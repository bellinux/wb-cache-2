Tested RO plant status monitoring unit has been installed along with various preexisting RO plants having a capacity of 500 – 2000 LPH at ten different nearby villages of Rajasthan such as Tamkor, Googne ki Dhani, Raboodi, Mukha ka bas, Jhunjhunu to monitor the real-time status of RO plants.

40|$|Although {{many studies}} {{assessed}} fouling behaviour in microporous membrane processes like membrane bioreactors (MBRs), in situ or direct {{observation of the}} fouling layer {{has not yet been}} possible. The observation of the fouling layer resulting from the filtration of model solutions allowed better understanding of MBR fouling intensity and mechanisms. In this study, alginate {{has been used as a}} model for polysaccharide (one of the main foulants in MBRs). Three visualisation techniques, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), and direct observation (DO) have been tested to observe the alginate fouling. The work presented in this paper revealed the advantages and limitations of each technique used for this specific application. Although no coating is required for this technique, ESEM allowed distinct non-destructive observation of clean membrane. However, the lack of structure in the alginate fouling layer limited the use of this technique for fouled membranes. While CLSM requires the use of expensive fluorescent markers, DO appeared as the most promising technique for direct and in situ observation of MBR fouling. DO of alginate/bentonite and alginate/bacteria solutions revealed the creation of a well-structured dual <b>fouling</b> <b>system</b> (bentonite-concentrated layer of 50 μm embedded and covered by a concentration polarisation of alginate greater than 240 μm) on the surface of hollow fibre membrane...|$|E
40|$|A {{fundamental}} goal {{in ecology}} {{is to identify}} the appropriate scales at which to observe trends in ecosystem behavior. Researchers often rely on intuition to choose a sampling scale, which if too large or too small potentially obscures the real system trends. A characteristic length scale (CLS) is a natural scale of a system at which the underlying deterministic dynamics are most clearly observed over stochasticity. The overarching aim {{of this research was}} to develop, examine and apply a robust technique to detect CLSs of real ecological systems. In this thesis, I first compared the robustness of two CLS methods, both of which account for complex oscillatory dynamics of ecological systems using attractor reconstruction from long time series of data. I applied these techniques to estimate CLSs of spatial multispecies systems of varying complexity, showing that for more complex models, the prediction r 2 metric of Pascual and Levin (1999) is a robust method. I then used an alternative method of CLS estimation, based on prediction r 2 but where repetition in space is largely substituted for repetition in time in attractor reconstruction, to determine the CLS of a natural marine <b>fouling</b> <b>system.</b> The new technique, requiring only a short temporal sequence of as few as three highly resolved spatial maps, enabled unambiguous length scales to be estimated for this system. Importantly, the estimated CLS was similarly based on analysis of several species representing a spectrum of phyla and life history patterns, indicating the adequacy of this method for objectively determining optimal scales of observation for real systems. Moreover, the CLS estimates of this system remained surprisingly consistent despite changes in time intervals between the spatial maps, changes in the number of maps used in the temporal sequence, and varying start dates of map sequences. When the field results were compared to those derived from a spatially explicit individual-based model of a similar marine community nearby, the average CLSs of the two communities were strikingly similar (0. 35 m), suggesting that dynamical trends of like systems may be best observed on similar scales. I also considered whether the approach could be extended to identify trends based on the dynamics of interactions among habitat types as opposed to interactions among species groups. Analysis of maps produced from remote sensing data at the habitat level successfully revealed unambiguous characteristic length scales of a coral reef. Habitats distinct in their species assemblages, abundances and morphologies provided similar length scales (300 m), suggesting that the system-level CLS detected is independent of the habitat type used for its estimation. Different species within the same system indicated dissimilar CLSs in some spatial model communities where species were only weakly connected, either due to the topology of network interactions or through spatial isolation as a result of spatial self-organization and patchiness. I finally evaluated the sensitivity of CLS estimates to varying levels of species connectivity and found that when species were weakly connected in terms of their network topology, the estimates of scale were likely to be dissimilar. The results contained within this thesis illustrate that the new method developed to detect natural scales of complex systems (1) can be applied to natural dynamical systems with a reasonable quantity of data, (2) is robust to changes in parameters that should not affect the scale of observation (e. g. initial configuration of the landscape), but (3) is sensitive to variations that would likely affect the spatial scale at which trends can be observed (e. g. connectivity). Species or habitat level data can be used to estimate CLSs, which will be critical for choosing the scale at which to sample real ecosystems to distinguish trends from random variation. Characteristic length scales can now be implemented to objectively guide the choice of observation scale, and I expect that in the future, they will become a part of every assiduous ecologist's toolbox...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a review on the fouling mechanism {{and its effect}} onto the performance of finned tube heat exchangers in HVAC <b>systems.</b> <b>Fouling</b> tends to degrade the performance of heat exchangers by decreasing the heat transfer coefficient and increasing the air-side pressure drop across the heat exchangers.

40|$|A broad based {{approach}} {{has been used to}} assess the impact of discharges to rivers from surface water sewers, with the primary objective of determining whether such discharges have a measurable impact on water quality. Three parameters, each reflecting the effects of intermittent pollution, were included in a field work programme of biological and chemical sampling and analysis which covered 47 sewer outfall sites. These parameters were the numbers and types of benthic macroinvertebrates upstream and downstream of the outfalls, the concentrations of metals in sediments, and the concentrations of metals in algae upstream and downstream of the outfalls. Information on the sewered catchments was collected from Local Authorities and by observation of the time of sampling, and includes catchment areas, land uses, evidence of connection to the <b>foul</b> <b>system,</b> and receiving water quality classification.

40|$|Aim: The global sprawl {{of marine}} hard {{infrastructure}} (e. g. breakwaters, sea walls and jetties) can extensively modify coastal seascapes, but {{the knowledge of}} such impacts remains limited to local scales. We examined the regional-scale effects of marine artificial habitats on the distribution and abundance of assemblages of ascidians, a key group of ecosystem engineer species in benthic <b>fouling</b> <b>systems.</b> Location: Five hundred kilometers of coastline in the North Adriatic Sea. Methods: We sampled a variety of natural reefs, marine infrastructures and marinas, and tested hypotheses {{about the role of}} habitat type and location in influencing the relative distribution and abundance of both native and non-indigenous species. Results: Assemblages differed significantly between natural and artificial habitats and among different types of artificial habitats. Non-indigenous species were 2 – 3 times more abundant on infrastructures built along sedimentary coastlines than on natural rocky reefs or infrastructures built close to rocky coastlines. Conversely, native species were twice as abundant on natural reefs than on nearby infrastructures and were scarce to virtually absent on infrastructures built along sedimentary coasts. The species composition of assemblages in artificial habitats was more similar to that of marinas than of natural reefs, independently of their location. Main conclusions: Our results show that marine infrastructures along sandy shores disproportionally favour non-indigenous over native hard bottom species, affecting their spread at regional scales. This is particularly concerning for coastal areas that have low natural densities of rocky reef habitats. We discuss design and management options to improve the quality as habitat of marine infrastructures and to favour their preferential use by native species over non-indigenous ones...|$|R

40|$|Water is a {{precious}} and necessary good for humans. We make great {{use of it}} be it for industry or urban use. In consequence its quality is altered and generates what we denominate waste waters. This water has to be treated to prevent {{negative impact on the}} environment. To avoid this there are waste water treatments. Conventional treatments in waste water treatment plants are composed of physic-chemical and biological treatments. But those water treatment plants present limitations that difficult improvement of the process. This limitations can be balanced out by integrating other advanced technologies of waste water treatment that will improve the treatment and generate better quality water diminishing the impact on the environment. One of those systems is called membrane bioreactor (MBR). This process generates much better water quality but has two big inconvenient: the operational cost and the membrane fouling. The membrane fouling is due to particle accumulation on the surface, negatively affecting water filtration. Fouling is detected by the increase in trans-membrane (TMP) pressure. In consequence there is an increment on the energetic cost and when accumulated it can damage the membrane. There exist different measures to help reduce <b>fouling.</b> <b>Systems</b> like the application of airing to create turbulence and detach fouling. Also periodical back wash process to release obstructed pores or chemical washes to recover filter capacity even though it reduces the membrane useful life. All these measures imply direct actions on the membranes. What we study is the option to apply an external peptic treatment that coats the membrane surface, able to prevent bio-fouling from membranes. With this treatment we could reduce back wash frequency, airing flow or even chemical washes. Therefore we can reduce operational costs from this technology increasing its profitability.

40|$|Whole milk fouling of {{surfaces}} within {{dairy products}} processing plants, especially that which occurs on heat treatment equipment, {{is an important}} operating problem, threatening the quality of product and reducing thermal and mechanical efficiency of equipment. A <b>fouling</b> monitoring <b>system</b> was developed using a commercial heat flux probe and temperature sensor. The fouling monitor was installed in two unit operations of a custom built milk powder pilot plant. The unit operations replicated heat treatments found in plate heat exchangers and falling film evaporators. The research plate heat exchanger consisted of six miniature plate heat exchangers or modules in series. Individual modules could be isolated at any point during a run allowing access to the fouling deposit. The research falling film evaporator was a flat plate attached to a steam chamber and milk weir box. The onset and build-up of whole milk fouling on the evaporator plate was viewed through a sight window installed in the evaporator casing. Trials conducted with the research plate heat exchanger showed that the monitoring system could detect whole milk fouling {{in terms of a}} reduction in the overall heat transfer coefficient. This reduction was shown to directly correspond to an increase in fouling deposit thickness. For the same bulk milk temperature, the fouling rate decreased significantly when the surface was unheated compared with heated surfaces. This observation lead to a set of experiments that manipulated the start up procedure on both the milk and heating medium side of the research plate heat exchanger. More fouling was observed on plates after air start up (on the milk side) than on plates after water start up. Similarly, Surface Conditioning by Operational Protocol (SCOP) extended the fouling induction period. The SCOP trials compared steady state heating with unsteady state heating during start-up. Similar amounts of fouling were observed on plates removed from the steady state heated modules after 30 minutes and on plates removed from the unsteady state modules after 9 hours. These results indicate that the state of the stainless steel surface when the. milk first makes contact has an important effect on the subsequent rate of fouling. It is recommended that future work aims to identify which milk components deposit first onto the surface and what influence they have on inhibiting or facilitating fouling.
