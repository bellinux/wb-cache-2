40|$|The mouth {{has been}} a natural site for release of stress. Right {{from the time of}} birth, a new born child cries and attracts {{attention}} of parents during stress. As the child grows, they spit and bite to release stress and frustration. As an adult, the same child uses abusive language, alcohol, smokes, and uses drugs (all orally) to release stress. Clenching, grinding, and bruxism are also a form of stress release using the oral route. Dentist is the first to detect such habit, and treat such cases with <b>habit</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>appliances,</b> which usually fail. This article highlights the need to refer cases for psychiatric treatment and hypnotherapy may be a choice of treatment. A female aged 26 year, reported with pain in all her teeth due to bruxism. All conventional dental treatments failed. This outlined a strong psychological component, hence hypnosis was tried. A 5 -year follow-up showed no relapse...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Explicit {{processes}} of persuasion, resistance and acceptance {{are generally not}} incorporated in theories of new product diffusion. It is supposed that the deficiency of a dynamic cognitive foundation limits the use of diffusion models for scheduling advertising campaigns. An agent-based computational model is presented which encompasses the whole attitude formation and decision-making process. Product sellers, the mass media, and the consumers are connected in a social network. Running the simulation yields realistic communication about the product alternatives, and the belief exchange leaves episode traces in the consumer memories. A new memory model draws on the spreading activation metaphor and produces four separated responses to the communication episodes. These response types result from crossing the automatic-controlled and the holistic-analytic dimensions of information processing. KEY WORDS: Agent-based social simulation, diffusion theory, social networks, persuasion, <b>habit</b> <b>breaking</b> spreading activation memory model, automaticity, holistic processin...|$|R
50|$|Jo ran {{the farm}} {{with help from}} her neighbours, the Naylors. Debbie and the Dingles also helped Jo with Sarah but money got tighter and tighter, and the Kings were {{declared}} bankrupt so ownership of the farm reverted to the bank. Various items began breaking and Andy repaired them. Jo was grateful until Lee Naylor caught Andy damaging the washing machine. A fight erupted and Jo realised that Andy had been <b>breaking</b> <b>appliances</b> and then repairing them to win back her trust. Jo {{knew that he would}} never leave her alone all the time she lived on his farm with his daughter so on 22 December, Jo and Lee sold the farm equipment so she and Sarah could get away. Just as Jo was about to leave, Mick Naylor arrived. Worried that he would tell Andy, she locked him in the barn but he begged her not to take Sarah. Following this, Jo and Sarah left the farm. However, she left Sarah Sugden with the Dingles and texted Lee telling him where Mick was. The next day, she texted Andy telling him to go to farm to meet her so he could see what she had done.|$|R

He found this enabled him to execute his harmonic concepts more effectively. His series of solo albums, Virtuoso (volumes 1 through 4) are a demonstration of Pass' refined technique.|$|R

50|$|The device {{works by}} {{breaking}} the suction which is present during thumbsucking. This suction causes {{not only the}} damage to the teeth and jaws, but also is responsible for the pleasure that the child seeks when engaging in the <b>habit.</b> By <b>breaking</b> the suction, the child ceases to receive pleasure, and thus, after 3 to 4 weeks of continuous use, stops thumb sucking altogether. The product is made out of a soft, flexible, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-listed plastic, and thus, is not designed to guard the thumb, but rather, to provide a means for air to flow which can then interrupt the habit.|$|R
