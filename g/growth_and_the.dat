5|$|The {{bridge was}} narrow and {{structurally}} unsound, leading {{the authorities to}} rename it Chelsea Bridge to avoid the Royal Family's association with a potential collapse. In 1926 it was proposed that the old bridge be rebuilt or replaced, due to the increased volume of users from population <b>growth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the automobile. It was demolished during 1934–1937, and replaced by the current structure, which opened in 1937.|$|E
5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} Governor Chiles published {{a report in}} 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain its <b>growth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> deterioration of the environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C were submitted to the United States Congress in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, and Florida Bay to undo the damage of the past 50years. It would take 30years and cost $7.8billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised by politics and funding problems.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on July10. Once {{north of the}} Greater Antilles, convective <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> development of a well-defined surface low {{led to the formation}} of a tropical depression just south of Acklins Island by 06:00UTC on July22. Amid a brief reprieve in strong upper-level winds, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie as it crossed Ragged Island around 23:15UTC that day. It later traversed Andros Island at peak intensity, with sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h), and weakened slightly before moving ashore near Elliott Key, Florida, with winds of 40mph (65km/h) on July23. Bonnie weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed South Florida, and the persistent effects of strong wind shear prevented intensification in the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone degenerated into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on July25 and later moved into southeastern Louisiana before dissipating later that day.|$|E

5|$|Eruptions from Mount Cleveland are {{generally}} vulcanian and strombolian in nature, characterized by short explosive ash clouds sometimes accompanied by a'a flows, lava fountains, pyroclastic flows, ash and steam emissions, lava dome <b>growth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ejection of breadcrust bombs. Hot springs were reportedly {{found on the}} volcano in the 1800s, and persistent fumarolic activity was observed in the 1980s and 1990s. Mount Cleveland is a site of persistent steam emissions and thermal anomalies that represent constant background activity. During 2011, a summit lava dome formed, by continuous intrusion of magma at the summit. Late in 2011, nearly 6 explosions demolished the dome. In June 2012, another small dome was observed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the pygmy slow loris is seriously threatened by hunting and trade. Within its geographic range and neighbor countries, {{the trade in}} the pygmy slow loris has recently increased due to economic changes and human population <b>growth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trend is expected to continue. Decreased sightings {{in the field and}} at animal markets indicate that wild populations are being depleted since the low reproduction rate of the pygmy slow loris cannot keep pace with these large-scale off-takes. Accordingly, conservationists and field biologists fear local extinctions in the near future. Between 1998 and 2006, 70% of pygmy slow lorises seized by authorities died before reaching a sheltering zoo, resulting in replacement demand and additional captures from the wild.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s {{the city}} entered {{a period of}} rapid <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> service sector overtook trade, {{industry}} and crafts as the leading sector of employment for the first time.

The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education. The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism; Gaffa and the KaosPilot school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively, and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as TV2, Gnags, Thomas Helmig, Bamses Venner, Anne Dorte Michelsen, Mek Pek and Shit & Chanel.|$|E

5|$|Leaves of Ficus obliqua {{serve as}} a food source for the larvae of the {{butterfly}} species the common crow (Euploea core), the no-brand crow (Euploea alcathoe), and the Geometer moth species Scopula epigypsa. The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis feeds {{on the underside of}} new leaves of F. obliqua, as well as F. rubiginosa and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue. A gall results and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips remain in the galls at night and wander about in the daytime before returning in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new <b>growth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding or pupate sheltered in the bark.|$|E
5|$|Male blue {{wildebeest}} become {{sexually mature}} at {{about two years}} of age while females can conceive at sixteen months if adequately nourished. Nevertheless, most females do not start to breed until a year later. The mating season, which lasts for about three weeks, coincides {{with the end of}} the rainy season. This means that the animals are in good condition, having been feeding on highly nutritious new grass <b>growth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> conception rate is often as high as 95%. The mating season, or rut, typically begins on the night of a full moon, suggesting that the lunar cycle influences breeding. At this time, testosterone production peaks in males, resulting in increased calling and territorial behaviour. The activities of these sexually excited males may also stimulate female to come into estrus.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of lead contamination in the soil decreases both the <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E

5|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's age by anthropologists {{depends on whether}} or not the individual was an adult or a child. The {{determination of}} the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates are sealed. The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger Allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The thigh bone became thicker and wider during <b>growth,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, {{and the growth of}} the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically, increasing in size without changing in proportion.|$|E
