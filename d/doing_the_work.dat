5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies {{that could lead to}} a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.|$|E

25|$|In Korea and Japan, phonetic {{systems were}} {{developed}} so that Chinese characters could {{be taught to}} the general public.

25|$|A new sun, wind, {{rain and}} dust {{facility}} {{was completed in}} April 1975 as an addition to the McKinley Climatic Laboratory. Designed to withstand internal winds of 100mph and maintain temperatures from 60 to 145 degrees Fahrenheit, the new addition simulated extreme climatic conditions for ground vehicles. Rain could be simulated from one to 15inches per hour and humidity controlled between 20 and 100 percent. Silicon dust {{could be used to}} simulate intense dust storms, the powder being collected and re-used following tests. Construction was supervised by the Army Corps of Engineers, with the Beckman Construction Company of Fort Worth, Texas, <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> The 50 X 50 X 30 foot building cost an estimated $432,500.|$|E
25|$|Rajasthan is earning Rs. 150 million (approx. US$2.5 million) per day as {{revenue from}} the crude oil sector. This earning is {{expected}} to reach 250 million per day in 2013 (which is an increase of 100 million or more than 66 percent). The government of India has given permission to extract 300,000 barrels of crude per day from Barmer region which is now 175,000 barrels per day. Once this limit is achieved Rajasthan will become a leader in Crude extraction in Country. Bombay High leads with a production of 250,000 barrels crude per day. Once the limit of 300,000 barrels per day is reached, the overall production of the country will increase by 15 percent.

25|$|One {{subject the}} laws did cover {{is how the}} king fit within {{the rest of the}} legal system. The king was not {{supposed}} to be above the law. In fact, some stipulations applied specifically to the king. However, as the king was the most powerful individual, and the one with the highest honour in an area, it was difficult to enforce the law against him. Although it might have been possible to proceed against the king as against any other, the laws also had an innovative solution to this quandary. Instead of enforcing against the king directly, a dependent of the king known as an aithech fortha (substitute churl) was enforced against instead, and the king was responsible for repaying the substitute churl. The laws also specified certain cases in which a king lost his honour price. These included <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of a commoner, moving around without a retinue, and showing cowardice in battle; again, though, it is unclear how often such stipulations were followed.|$|E
25|$|In October 1941, Powell {{was posted}} to Cairo and {{transferred}} {{back to the}} Royal Warwickshire Regiment. As secretary to the Joint Intelligence Committee, Middle East, he was soon doing work that would normally have been done by a more senior officer and was (May 1942, backdated to December 1941) promoted to major. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in August 1942, telling his parents that he was <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of three people and {{expected to be a}} brigadier within a year or two, and in that role helped plan the Second Battle of El Alamein, having previously helped plan the attack on Rommel's supply lines. Powell and his team began work at 0400 each day to digest radio intercepts and other intelligence data (such as estimating how many tanks Rommel currently had and what his likely plans were) ready to present to the chiefs of staff at 0900. The following year, he was honoured {{as a member of the}} Order of the British Empire for his military service.|$|E
25|$|In his {{original}} 1972/73 deep ecology paper, Arne Næss claims the deep ecology movement arose from scientists – ecologists who {{were out in}} the field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three of the most influential ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were Rachel Carson, David Brower, and Paul R. Ehrlich. Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range deep ecology movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for conservation of land and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because they clearly showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. Silent Spring helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.|$|E

500|$|Hearst {{animation}} studio International Film Service {{began in}} December 1915, and brought Hearst cartoonists to the screen.

[...] McCay derived satisfaction from <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> himself. [...] Begun in 1916, The Sinking of the Lusitania was his follow-up to Gertie. [...] The film was not a fantasy but a detailed, realistic recreation of the 1915 German torpedoing of the RMS Lusitania.

Murrow, which was broadcast on March 9, 1954. Titled [...] "A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy", the episode consisted largely of clips of McCarthy speaking. In these clips, McCarthy accuses the Democratic party of [...] "twenty years of treason", describes the American Civil Liberties Union as [...] "listed as 'a front for, and <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of', the Communist Party", and berates and harangues various witnesses, including General Zwicker.|$|E

Time seems to slow slow down as another inmate, Donnie Pfaster (Nick Chinlund)a [...] "death fetishist" [...] and serial killer who kidnapped Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) five years earlierwalks {{out of the room}} and leaves the prison. Hearing about the escape, Scully and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) investigate. They learn that three men escaped from three prisons, all of whom had contact with a prison chaplain named Reverend Orison (Scott Wilson). Eventually, the US Marshals corner Pfaster and Orison at a diner, but Orison uses his power of persuasion to distract the Marshals, allowing the two to escape. Pfaster takes Orison's car and runs him over. Meanwhile, Scully keeps hearing the song [...] "Don't Look Any Further" [...] everywhere she goes, soon believing it is a sign. The agents find and question Orison, who is himself an ex-convict and claims that he is <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of God.|$|E

In the early years, the Lord Chancellor made most of the decisions himself; he summoned the parties, set a date for hearings, addressed questions from the parties to the case and announced the verdict. He regularly called for assistance from the common law judges, who complained that this prevented them from <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of the common law courts, and early records frequently say that the decision was made [...] "with the advice and consent of the justices and servants of our Lord the King in the Chancery".|$|E
