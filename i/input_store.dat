Specifically, the reform shifted emphasis away from commodity support towards environmental contracts, diversified production practices and rural development. In the case of cereals, a full decoupling was applied in subsidies and integration through rights in the Single Payment Scheme, except rice, {{which was one of the}} few crop cases in which part of the subsidy remained coupled, particular in countries with significant production like Greece.

The analytical approach that is at the basis of computer programming allows for the successful resolution of apparently complex tasks. Two basic principles involved are the definition of simple fundamental functions that are then iterated and the modular subdivision of tasks.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 A {{method was}} {{developed}} for assessing the vulnerability of groundwater to contamination from contaminant sources at the soil surface, using a numerical groundwater flow model linked to a digital map database. The method was applied using the pcARC/INFO Geographic Information System (GIS) to <b>input,</b> <b>store,</b> and manipulate base maps, resulting in a database of digital maps for the alluvial aquifer system in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon. Digital elevation maps were created by digitizing topographic maps of land surface (1 : 250, 000 scale), water surface, and {{the base of the}} Tertiary-Quaternary sedimentary deposits (1 : 500, 000 scales). Soil association and aquifer unit maps digitized from 1 : 500, 000 scale map sheets were also used. Data were extracted from ARC/INFO to the SURFER software package to create a 3 -D surface model for each of the digital elevation maps. An ARC/INFO point coverage was then used to store and overlay these surfaces, allowing the creation of maps of depth to water, saturated thickness, and water table gradient. These data became the input to a numerical finite element groundwater flow model. The model solves a dual formulation problem for the potential function and the stream function to calculate the time-of-travel for water to flow from the surface to the water table and laterally for 100 meters as an index of groundwater vulnerability. A cluster analysis is used to condense the data and form a training data set for a multiple regression model. The regression model is fit to the results of the finite element model with an R-squared of greater than 0. 96. The simpler regression model is then used for mapping travel times for the entire study area. When properly calibrated against the finite element model and when combined with the digital map database and Geographic Information System (GIS) procedures described, the regression model can be conveniently used to assess the vulnerability of groundwater to contamination over large areas...|$|E
40|$|We say {{a program}} is data-independent {{with respect to}} a data type X if the {{operations}} it can perform on values of type X are restricted to just equality testing, although the system may also <b>input,</b> <b>store</b> and move around (via assignment) values of type X within its variables. This property can be exploited to give procedures for the automatic verification, called model checking, of such programs independently of the instance for the type X. This thesis considers data-independent programs with arrays, which are useful for modelling memory systems such as cache protocols. The main question of interest is the following parameterised model-checking problem: whether a program satisfies its specification for all non-empty finite instances of its types. In order to obtain these results, we present a UNITY-like programming language with arrays that is suited to the study of decidability of various modelchecking problems, whilst being useful for prototyping memory systems such as caches. Its semantics are given in terms of transition systems, and we use the modal μ-calculus, a branching-time temporal logic with recursion, as our specification language. We describe a model-checking procedure for programs that use arrays indexed by one data-independent type X and storing values from another Y. This allows us to prove properties about parameterised systems: for example, that memory systems can be verified independently of memory size and data values. This decidability result is shown to extend to data-independent programs with many types and multidimensional arrays which are acyclic, meaning {{it is not possible to}} form loops of types in the 'indexed by' relation. Conversely, it is shown that even reachability model-checking problems are undecidable for classes of programs that allow cyclic-array programs. We give practical motivation for these decidability results by demonstrating how one could verify a fault-tolerant interface on a set of unreliable memories, and the cache protocol in the Pentium Pro processor. Significantly, the verifications are performed independently of many of these systems' parameters. These case studies suggest two extensions to the language: an array reset instruction, which sets every element of an array to a particular value, and an array assignment or copy instruction. Both are shown to restrict decidability of model checking problems; however we can obtain some interesting decidability results for arrays with reset by restricting the number of arrays to just one, or by allowing the arrays only to store fixed finite types, such as the booleans. </p...|$|E

40|$|Incremental {{processing}} {{of the human}} parser is uncontroversially supported by many psycholinguistic experiments. Briefly, incrementality accounts for the intuitive fact that language is processed from left to right.

In this version, the parser maintains a totally connected parsing structure, while scanning the input words from left to right, with no <b>input</b> <b>stored</b> in a disconnected state. The key concept in attaching the next word to the left context is the notion of connection path (CP) [3], which is the chain of syntactic nodes that must be built in order to appropriately connect the current word to its left context. The major di#culty of implementing a strongly incremental strategy is the high number of candidate CPs, which yields a hard search problem, a#ecting the parser accuracy and speed.
