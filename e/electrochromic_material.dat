Various types {{of materials and}} structures {{can be used to}} construct electrochromic devices, depending on the specific applications. Transition metal oxides are a large family of materials possessing various interesting properties in the field of electrochromism. Among them, tungsten oxide (WO3), has been the most extensively studied material, used in the production of electrochromic windows or smart glass and more recently electrochromic displays on paper substrate as anti-counterfeiting systems integrated on packaging. NiO materials have been widely studied as counter electrodes for complementary electrochromic devices, in particular, smart windows. The world leading institutions on NiO efforts include National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Uppsala University. Another example of an <b>electrochromic</b> <b>material</b> is polyaniline which can be formed either by the electrochemical or chemical oxidation of aniline. If an electrode is immersed in hydrochloric acid which contains a small concentration of aniline, then a film of polyaniline can be grown on the electrode.

40|$|A {{smart dust}} is a micro spacecraft, with a {{characteristic}} side length {{on the order}} of a few millimeters, whose surface is coated with <b>electrochromic</b> <b>material.</b> Its orbital dynamics is controlled by exploiting the differential force due to the solar radiation pressure, which is obtained by modulating the reflectivity coefficient of the <b>electrochromic</b> <b>material</b> within a range of admissible values. A significant thrust level can be reached due to the high values of area-to-mass ratio of such a spacecraft configuration. Assuming that the smart dust is designed to achieve a passive Sun-pointing attitude, the propulsive acceleration due to the solar radiation pressure lies along the Sun-spacecraft direction. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the smart dust heliocentric dynamics in order to find a closed form, analytical solution of its trajectory when the reflectivity coefficient of the <b>electrochromic</b> <b>material</b> can assume two values only. The problem is addressed by introducing a suitable transformation that regularizes the spacecraft motion and translates the smart-dust dynamics into that of a linear harmonic oscillator with unitary frequency, whose forcing input is a boxcar function. The solution is found using the Laplace transform method, and afterwards the problem is generalized by accounting for the degradation of the <b>electrochromic</b> <b>material</b> due to its exposition to the solar radiation. Three spacecraft configurations, corresponding to low, medium and high performance smart dusts, are finally used to quantify the potentialities of these advanced devices in an interplanetary mission scenario...|$|E

Electrochromic polymer like polyaniline (PANI) {{is one of}} the most promising materials where its colour can be controlled electrically. However, the electrochromically deposited polyaniline exhibit substantial resistivity, which is attributed to the lack of conducting pathways at the nanoscale associated with random deposition morphology. This study describes developing <b>electrochromic</b> <b>material</b> using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the filler.

30|$|An {{attractive}} {{feature of}} <b>electrochromic</b> <b>materials</b> {{is the ability}} to change their optical properties in a reversible and persistent manner when applied with an electrical voltage. Since the pioneering work of Deb [1], a variety of <b>electrochromic</b> <b>materials</b> have been developed, which can be grouped into several subsets: transition metal oxides [2], Prussian blue [3], conducting polymers [4], viologens [5], transition metal ions coordination compound [6], hybrid <b>electrochromic</b> <b>materials</b> [7], and reversible electrodeposition-based <b>electrochromic</b> <b>materials</b> [8, 9]. Their electrochromic performance including optical contrast, switching time, coloration efficiency, cycling stability, and optical memory effect have been investigated extensively, which promote us to expand the applications of <b>electrochromic</b> <b>materials</b> in the area of smart windows, anti-glare rear-view mirrors, electrochromic display, electronic papers, and military camouflage [10 – 19]. Electrochromic devices based on reversible electrodeposition are promising for application in light modulations owing to their simple sandwich-type structure and facile and low-cost fabrication. Their optical properties can be manipulated via deposition of metal (copper (Cu), bismuth (Bi), plumbum (Pb), nickel (Ni), silver (Ag), etc.) onto transparent conducting electrodes under an applied electrical voltage and dissolution of metal back into electrolyte upon removal of the voltage [20 – 26]. Bismuth–copper (Bi/Cu) electrodeposition devices are widely used in information displays due to their rapid and reversible switching between black and transparent states enabled by the oxidation–reduction between Bi and Bi 3 + [9, 23 – 25]. Similarly, Ag-based electrodeposition system [26 – 29] has also been developed for fabricating electrochromic devices for its ability to realize mirror state.|$|R
