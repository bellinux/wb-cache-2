5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an <b>important</b> <b>social</b> determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including health care, and the greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E

5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising.

AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the {{government}} was involved in launching Gutt's monetary reform plan {{as well as the}} disarming of the resistance as part of the transition to stability. A major crisis emerged within {{the government}} over the refusal of the Front de l'Indépendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Armés (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and disarm. Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm the resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through <b>important</b> <b>social</b> security reforms.|$|E

5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. <b>Important</b> <b>social</b> changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E

5|$|The boyars, {{members of}} the landed nobility, formed the most <b>important</b> <b>social</b> group in the principality.

In this period, animals, especially sheep, remained the main item of export, but from the Wallachian Plain great quantities of grain were transported to the Mediterranean area. The basis of the peasants' diet was formed by millet eaten as porridge, while the boyars also used wheat.|$|E

5|$|The vegetal diet of the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is high {{in fiber}} and only moderate in protein. Salt licks {{are very important to}} the nutrition of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The salt licks also serve an <b>important</b> <b>social</b> purpose for the rhinos—males visit the licks to pick up the scent of females in oestrus. Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where salt licks are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.|$|E
5|$|The wars {{destroyed}} the old civilian bureaucracy that had governed {{the region for}} centuries, as {{institutions such as the}} audiencias were eliminated and many Peninsular officials fled to Spain. The Catholic Church, which had been an <b>important</b> <b>social</b> and political institution during the colonial period, initially came out weakened {{by the end of the}} conflicts. As with government officials, many Peninsular bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created and relations between the new nations and the Vatican were regularized. Then as the Church recovered, its economic and political power was attacked by liberals.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, {{including}} purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, {{and several}} {{different forms of}} meowing. (By contrast, feral cats are generally silent.) Their types of body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly <b>important</b> <b>social</b> signal mechanisms in cats; for example, a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals. Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited {{by one of the}} cats raising and tilting its head.|$|E

Their wedding was the most <b>important</b> <b>social</b> event in Shanghai of that year. Famous film stars served as bridesmaids and groomsmen, and child stars were their flower girls and page boys. Hu Die was ready to retire from the film industry, as was customary at the time after an actress' marriage, but with her husband's support, she {{signed a contract with}} Mingxing to make one film per year. She only made one more film under the new contract, before the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the hard-fought Battle of Shanghai completely destroyed Mingxing and other Shanghai studios in 1937.|$|E

The following year he was dispatched to Hungary {{on a mission to}} investigate the severity of the threat from the Ottoman Empire, the boundaries of which had been steadily spreading under Sultan Bayezid I. In this mission he was second in command to Jean de Boucicant, a Marshal of France and famous soldier, indicating the elevated social position Carrouges enjoyed following the duel.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{completed}} in 1828, but not immediately occupied.

Tayloe leased the building to Thomas Swann, Sr., a lawyer (and the father of Thomas Swann, Jr., who became Governor of Maryland in 1866). Swann vacated the home in November 1829, at which time Tayloe and his wife occupied it. The house was an <b>important</b> <b>social</b> gathering place for important Washingtonians in the four decades following its construction. In 1829, when Henry Clay left the office of Secretary of State, much of the furniture in his home was acquired by the Tayloes and used to decorate their home.
