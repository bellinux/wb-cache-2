5|$|The species also occurs {{outside its}} natural range in Australia, {{where it can}} be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> {{effluent}} of power stations in Victoria, and in tropical Queensland. It has also been captured in Perth, Western Australia, although this initial capture also resulted in its eradication. In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to Réunion, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, Taiwan, and the USA.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{was one of}} two {{storms in}} the 2007 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season to make landfall as a Category5 hurricane and was the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, tied with Camille and Mitch. After its first landfall, Hurricane Dean crossed the Yucatán Peninsula and emerged, weakened, into the Bay of Campeche. It briefly restrengthened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> waters of the bay before making a second landfall in Veracruz. Dean progressed to the northwest, weakening into a remnant low which finally dissipated over the southwestern United States.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{attributes}} {{are sometimes}} mimicked in architecture, {{as at the}} Eastgate Centre, Harare, which uses passive cooling, storing heat {{in the morning and}} releasing it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> parts of the day. The target of this piece of biomimicry is the structure of the mounds of termites such as Macrotermes michaelseni which effectively cool the nests of these social insects. The properties of the Namib desert beetle's exoskeleton, in particular its wing-cases (elytra) which have bumps with hydrophilic (water-attracting) tips and hydrophobic (water-shedding) sides, have been mimicked in a film coating designed for the British Ministry of Defence, to capture water in arid regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{homes were}} reached through tunnels. Other {{examples}} of subterranean, semi-subterranean or cliff-based dwellings in both {{hot and cold}} climates are found in Turkey, northern China and the Himalayas, and the southwest USA. A number of Buddhist monasteries built from earth and other materials into cliff sides or caves in Himalayan areas such as Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and northern India are often perilously placed. Starting in the 1970s, interest in the technique has revived in developed countries.

5|$|Due {{to their}} higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> inner Solar System {{close to the}} Sun, and these would {{eventually}} form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very {{small fraction of the}} solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has a {{continental}} climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Minnesota's {{location in the}} Upper Midwest allows it to experience some of the widest variety of weather in the United States, {{with each of the}} four seasons having its own distinct characteristics. The areas near Lake Superior in the Minnesota Arrowhead region experience weather unique {{from the rest of the}} state. The moderating effect of Lake Superior keeps the surrounding area relatively cooler in the summer and relatively warmer in the winter, giving that region a smaller yearly temperature range. On the Köppen climate classification, much of the southern third of Minnesota—roughly from the Twin Cities region southward—falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa), and the northern two-thirds of Minnesota falls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> summer great continental climate zone (Dfb).|$|E

5|$|New Zealand's native Cordyline {{species are}} relics of {{an influx of}} {{tropical}} plants that arrived from the north 15 million years ago <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> Miocene era. Because it has evolved {{in response to the}} local climate, geology and other factors, C.australis varies in appearance from place to place. This variation can alter the overall appearance of the tree, canopy shape and branch size, the relative shape and size of the leaves, and their colour and stiffness. There may also be invisible adaptations for resistance to disease or insect attack. Some of these regional provenances are different enough to have been named by North Island Māori: Tītī in the north, tī manu in the central uplands, tarariki in the east and wharanui in the west.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{once again}} to {{domestic}} cricket, Hamence scored 85 and 66 against Queensland, and this kept him in the running for {{a place in the}} national team, as he toured with The Invincibles in England in 1948. He was not selected to play in any of the Tests, however he reiterated when interviewed in 2008 that he felt no resentment over not having played. Hamence was a popular member of the touring squad and his cheerful nature and splendid tenor voice added to the good spirits of the team. His success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> up games was mixed, scores of 92, 46 and 49 not out against Cambridge University, Essex and Lancashire mixed with a duck, seven, one, three, two and five against other counties. Against Somerset, approaching his first century of the tour, the Australian players, keen to see Hamence succeed, left their card games to applaud only to see him dismissed for 99, his highest score for the season. He also faced Scotland for two matches in August 1948, scoring six and 15. Overall on the tour he played 19matches scoring 582runs at an average of 32.33.|$|E
5|$|The Bryce Canyon area shows {{a record}} of {{deposition}} that spans from {{the last part of}} the Cretaceous period and the first half of the Cenozoic era. The ancient depositional environment of the region around what is now the park varied. The Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm,</b> shallow waters of the advancing and retreating Cretaceous Seaway (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders). The colorful Claron Formation, from which the park's delicate hoodoos are carved, was laid down as sediments in a system of cool streams and lakes that existed from 63 to about 40million years ago (from the Paleocene to the Eocene epochs). Different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and river deltas migrated.|$|E

5|$|The Cretaceous saw the fragmenting of the {{southern}} landmass, {{with the opening of}} {{the southern}} Atlantic Ocean and the isolation of New Zealand, while South America, Antarctica, and Australia grew more distant. The diversity of Cupedidae and Archostemata decreased considerably. Predatory ground beetles (Carabidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) began to distribute into different patterns; the Carabidae predominantly occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> regions, while the Staphylinidae and click beetles (Elateridae) preferred temperate climates. Likewise, predatory species of Cleroidea and Cucujoidea hunted their prey under the bark of trees together with the jewel beetles (Buprestidae). The diversity of jewel beetles increased rapidly, as they were the primary consumers of wood, while longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) were rather rare: their diversity increased only towards the end of the Upper Cretaceous. The first coprophagous beetles are from the Upper Cretaceous and may have lived on the excrement of herbivorous dinosaurs. The first species where both larvae and adults are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle are found. Whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae) were moderately diverse, although other early beetles (e.g. Dytiscidae) were less, with the most widespread being the species of Coptoclavidae, which preyed on aquatic fly larvae.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E
5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
