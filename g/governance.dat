40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{formation}} and transformation of local entrepreneurial <b>governances</b> {{can be understood as}} a process of local responses to challenges presented by global economic restructuring. Two kinds of local responses are theoretically identified. At the structure level, local entrepreneurial <b>governances</b> happen when places are embedded in the situation of competition between cities and regions. At the agent level, the emergence of local entrepreneurial <b>governances</b> requires local actors who pursue their own political and economic interests. The theoretical framework, what I term 'territorial restructuring process', is empirically explained by the context of the West and China. Copyright 2008 The Author.

25|$|Due to the {{influences}} of public sector reforms, several authors (Kezar and Eckel 2004; Lapworth 2004; Middlehurst 2004) point out that next {{to the concept of}} shared and participative <b>governance</b> a new form of <b>governance</b> has emerged, i.e. the notion of corporate <b>governance</b> of institutions, that has increasingly become a more dominant approach to tertiary management. According to Lapworth, the rise of the notion of corporate <b>governance</b> and the decline of the shared or consensual <b>governance</b> can be seen to be a result of the decline in academic participation, a growing tendency towards managerialism and the new environment where the universities are operating.|$|E

25|$|Corporate <b>governance</b> is the mechanisms, {{processes}} and relations by which corporations are controlled and directed. <b>Governance</b> structures and principles identify {{the distribution of}} rights and responsibilities among different participants in the corporation (such as the board of directors, managers, shareholders, creditors, auditors, regulators, and other stakeholders) and includes the rules and procedures for making decisions in corporate affairs. Corporate <b>governance</b> includes the processes through which corporations' objectives are set and pursued {{in the context of}} the social, regulatory and market environment. <b>Governance</b> mechanisms include monitoring the actions, policies, practices, and decisions of corporations, their agents, and affected stakeholders. Corporate <b>governance</b> practices are affected by attempts to align the interests of stakeholders. Interest in the corporate <b>governance</b> practices of modern corporations, particularly in relation to accountability, increased following the high-profile collapses of a number of large corporations during 2001–2002, most of which involved accounting fraud; and then again after the recent financial crisis in 2008.|$|E
