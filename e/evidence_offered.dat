5|$|The Wall Street Crash of 1929 {{occurred}} {{only weeks}} after the building was completed. At that time more than 80% of the apartments were rented and some 300 students had signed up to take classes at the Institute. However, both rentals and student fees were soon depleted, and the nonprofit corporation that ran the building was unable to meet its payments. On April 6, 1932, this organization was sued for nonpayment of taxes and sinking fund payments due on the mortgage bonds. At {{that time it was}} alleged that the building was being mismanaged, the principal <b>evidence</b> <b>offered</b> being the provision of free living quarters to the Roeriches and their followers. Horch successfully contested the suit partly on a technicality and partly by explaining that the 20 rooms occupied rent-free were used by management as partial compensation to employees of the corporation. Representatives of the bond holders had argued that the parts of the building that did not produce rental income—that is the museum, institute, and other cultural spaces—should be converted to apartments but Horch successfully countered that the museum et al. were an asset that generated a substantial tax exemption and that, in normal times, they led to higher rental rates from the existing apartments than would comparable apartments. He also pointed out that the demanded conversion would be expensive (about $100,000). In June 1932, the foreclosure case ended with Horch being named one of two receivers tasked with clearing the building's debts.|$|E

[...] They were to be [...] "put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both". [...] Their genitals would be cut off and burnt before their eyes, and their bowels and hearts removed. [...] They would then be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of their bodies displayed so that they might become [...] "prey for the fowls of the air". [...] Fawkes's and Tresham's testimony regarding the Spanish treason was read aloud, as well as confessions related specifically to the Gunpowder Plot. [...] The last piece of <b>evidence</b> <b>offered</b> was a conversation between Fawkes and Wintour, who had been kept in adjacent cells. [...] The two men apparently thought they had been speaking in private, but their conversation was intercepted by a government spy.

There were numerous witnesses that we knew should have been interviewed, but lacked the resources to do so." [...] The appeal stated that the testimony of the prosecution witnesses had been coerced by law enforcement personnel.

2500|$|Abraham Updegraff was {{a member}} of the jury who was the driving force that led to the {{conviction}} of the rioters. Updegraff, an ardent abolitionist who was a vital member of the Underground Railroad in Lycoming County, was able to convince his peers that the rioters deserved to be punished. The first jury vote was 11 to 1 in favor of acquittal, with Upedgraff being the lone dissenter. Updegraff argued that [...] "we have been sworn to try this case according to the law and the evidence presented and that if no contradictory <b>evidence</b> <b>offered</b> by the defendants than we could do nothing more than to convict them." [...] He was able to make his argument in German, which was the native tongue of three other jurors. The second vote was 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal. A third vote brought about the conviction of thirteen of the eighteen men charged in the Muncy Abolition Riot of 1842. This conviction was essentially overturned by Governor David R. Porter when he pardoned the rioters several days later. Governor Porter's statement of pardon said, [...] "It is represented to me by highly respected citizens of Lycoming County, that this prosecution was instituted more with a view to the accomplishment of political ends than to serve the cause of law and order." ...|$|E
2500|$|The long {{interval}} of fifty-one {{years between the}} production of the first and last poems bearing Basse's signature led John Payne Collier to conjecture that there were two poets of the same name, and he attributed to an elder William Basse the works published in 1602, and to a younger William Basse all those published later. The internal <b>evidence</b> <b>offered</b> by the poems fails, however, to support this conclusion. [...] "Urania", the last poem of the collection, bearing the date 1653, has all the metrical characteristics of the [...] "Sword and Buckler" [...] of 1602; and Bathurst's verses prove that Basse followed his poetical career through many generations. A William Basse 'of Suffolk' entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1629, and took the degree of B.A. in 1632, and that of M.A. in 1636, but it is highly improbable that this student was the poet. There was a family named Basse, of Benhall, Suffolk, in the seventeenth century, of whom a William died in 1607, aged 85, and left a son Thomas and a grandson William, probably the Cambridge student; but it is impossible to identify the poet with any member of this family. The fact that his 'Great Brittaines Sunnesset' was published at Oxford, and his intimate relations with two great Oxfordshire houses, seem to connect the poet with Oxfordshire rather than with Suffolk.|$|E
2500|$|On March 18, 2013, opening {{statements}} were given in a Philadelphia court. [...] On April 23, after {{the prosecution had}} rested its case, the judge dismissed three of the seven first-degree murder charges (the next day the judge reinstated charges related to one and dismissed another, explaining the wrong charge had been mistakenly dismissed), the one count of infanticide, and all five charges of abusing a corpse Gosnell had been charged with, as well as six of the nine charges of theft by deception faced by O'Neill. No formal ruling has yet been given for these dismissals. [...] Media sources following the trial have suggested {{that there may have}} been insufficient evidence of post-procedure life to sustain charges in law. Although prosecutors had argued the movements were voluntary and therefore signs of life, it was argued that the <b>evidence</b> <b>offered</b> by prosecutors were equally capable of being interpreted in some or all of these as single autonomous post-mortem motor movements or spasms instead of clinical signs of life, and additionally that none of the seven were capable of being alive as all had been previously killed clinically in utero by means of drugs as part of the procedure. [...] Also, although staff had used descriptions such as [...] "jumping" [...] and [...] "screaming" [...] in their testimony, Gosnell's defense noted that testimony had shown only single movements or breaths, stating that the testimony was not evidence of [...] "the movements of a live child", and the medical examiner had also testified that tests could not determine whether or not any of the 47 fetuses found had been born alive due to tissue deterioration.|$|E

2500|$|Gold raised six {{grounds for}} reversal: 1) The trial court refused {{to apply the}} rules of {{evidence}} for perjury to the case; 2) The circumstantial <b>evidence</b> <b>offered</b> at trial was not sufficient to convict him under the rules of evidence; 3) The trial court's instructions to the jury regarding the definition of [...] "support" [...] were unsupported by law or common usage; 4) The trial court erred in permitting expert testimony regarding his resignation (e.g., the fact of his resignation was a matter for the jury, not expert witnesses, to decide); 5) Government employees on the grand and petit juries were biased (as they themselves had to take an anti-communist oath to retain their jobs); and 6) Law enforcement officers discussed anti-communist oaths {{with members of the}} jury while investigating an unrelated case. A deeply divided 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction. The court of appeals then asked for an en banc rehearing sua sponte. An equally divided en banc court upheld his conviction. Gold appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned his conviction in Gold v. United States, 352 U.S. 985 (1957). An FBI agent, investigating another case in which falsity of a non-Communist affidavit was at issue, telephoned or visited three members of the Gold jury or their families during Gold's trial. The Supreme Court held that although the FBI intrusion was unintentional it prejudiced the case against Gold. Relying on its recent decision in Remmer v. United States, 350 U.S. 377 (1955), the Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case to the district court with instructions to grant a new trial.|$|E

The evidence is anecdotal, {{and is based}} on personal experience during the years 1960 – 1971 in the Republic of Georgia.
