Effective control and treatment of rabies in India is also hindered by a form of mass hysteria known as puppy pregnancy syndrome (PPS). Dog bite victims with PPS (both male and female) become convinced that puppies are growing inside them, and often seek help from faith healers rather than from conventional medical services.

40|$|Background. The <b>global</b> <b>toll</b> {{of suicide}} is {{estimated}} to be one million lives per year, which exceeded the number of deaths by homicide and war combined. A key step to suicide prevention is to prevent less serious suicidal behaviour to preclude more lethal outcomes. Although 61 % of the world's suicides take place in Asia and the suicide rates among middle age groups have been increasing since the economic crisis in many Asian countries, population-based studies of suicidal behaviour among working-age adults in non-western communities are scarce. Method. Data from a population-based survey with 2015 participants were used to estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviour among the working-age population in Hong Kong, and to study the associated socio-economic and psychological correlates. We focused particularly on potential modulating factors between life-event-related factors and suicidal ideation. Results. Six per cent of the Hong Kong population aged 20 - 59 years considered suicide in the past year, while 1. 4 % attempted suicide. Hopelessness, reasons for living, and reluctance to seek help from family and friends had direct association with past-year suicidal ideation. Reasons for living were found to moderate the effect of perceived stress on suicidal ideation. Conclusions. Suicidality is a multi-faceted problem that calls for a multi-sectored, multi-layered approach to prevention. Prevention programmes can work on modulating factors such as reasons for living to reduce suicidal risk in working-age adults. © 2006 Cambridge University Press. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{scale-up}} {{of tobacco}} control, {{especially after the}} adoption of the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, is a major public health success story. Nonetheless, smoking remains a leading risk for early death and disability worldwide, and therefore continues to require sustained political commitment. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) offers a robust platform through which global, regional, and national progress toward achieving smoking-related targets can be assessed. Methods: We synthesised 2818 data sources with spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and produced estimates of daily smoking prevalence by sex, age group, and year for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We analysed 38 risk-outcome pairs to generate estimates of smoking-attributable mortality and disease burden, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We then performed a cohort analysis of smoking prevalence by birth-year cohort to better understand temporal age patterns in smoking. We also did a decomposition analysis, in which we parsed out changes in all-cause smoking-attributable DALYs due to changes in population growth, population ageing, smoking prevalence, and risk-deleted DALY rates. Finally, we explored results by level of development using the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Findings: Worldwide, the age-standardised prevalence of daily smoking was 25 · 0 % (95 % uncertainty interval [UI] 24 · 2 – 25 · 7) for men and 5 · 4 % (5 · 1 – 5 · 7) for women, representing 28 · 4 % (25 · 8 – 31 · 1) and 34 · 4 % (29 · 4 – 38 · 6) reductions, respectively, since 1990. A greater percentage of countries and territories achieved significant annualised rates of decline in smoking prevalence from 1990 to 2005 than in between 2005 and 2015; however, only four countries had significant annualised increases in smoking prevalence between 2005 and 2015 (Congo [Brazzaville] and Azerbaijan for men and Kuwait and Timor-Leste for women). In 2015, 11 · 5 % of global deaths (6 · 4 million [95 % UI 5 · 7 – 7 · 0 million]) were attributable to smoking worldwide, of which 52 · 2 % took place in four countries (China, India, the USA, and Russia). Smoking was ranked among the five leading risk factors by DALYs in 109 countries and territories in 2015, rising from 88 geographies in 1990. In terms of birth cohorts, male smoking prevalence followed similar age patterns across levels of SDI, whereas much more heterogeneity was found in age patterns for female smokers by level of development. While smoking prevalence and risk-deleted DALY rates mostly decreased by sex and SDI quintile, population growth, population ageing, or a combination of both, drove rises in overall smoking-attributable DALYs in low-SDI to middle-SDI geographies between 2005 and 2015. Interpretation: The pace of progress in reducing smoking prevalence has been heterogeneous across geographies, development status, and sex, and as highlighted by more recent trends, maintaining past rates of decline should not be taken for granted, especially in women and in low-SDI to middle-SDI countries. Beyond the effect of the tobacco industry and societal mores, a crucial challenge facing tobacco control initiatives is that demographic forces are poised to heighten smoking's <b>global</b> <b>toll,</b> unless progress in preventing initiation and promoting cessation can be substantially accelerated. Greater success in tobacco control is possible but requires effective, comprehensive, and adequately implemented and enforced policies, which might in turn require global and national levels of political commitment beyond what has been achieved during the past 25 years...|$|E

This map was combined with population distribution data to estimate how many people live in these areas and are, therefore, exposed to risk of infection by P. vivax malaria.

While it is home to just over 60 % of the world population, during the past 50 years it has experienced 73 % of <b>global</b> death <b>toll</b> due to earthquakes. It is reasonable to expect that such frequent disasters would result in changes in societal attitude towards risk that would express itself as measures aimed at reducing seismic vulnerability of the population. This paper attempts to assess such changes in societal attitudes towards seismic vulnerability through instances of post-event reconstruction. For this purpose it utilizes the inverse relationship between vulnerability and capacity of society as a touchstone and adopts two parameters of reconstruction drives as valid indicators of attitude of a society to enhance the capacity of its affected population. The first of these is adoption of owner driven reconstruction as the primary mechanism of reconstruction, while the second of these is sensitivity of a reconstruction drive towards socio-cultural characteristic of the affected population and their traditional construction systems. The study utilizes bibliographical sources and cutting-edge research and concludes that in general there is decided positive shift in societal attitudes towards reducing vulnerability through post-event reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|The annual <b>global</b> death <b>toll</b> from {{accidents}} at work far outstrips that accrued in acts of war or terrorism but {{the phenomenon}} struggles to command anything like the prominence of these traditional priorities of international security in global politics. Whilst the ‘securitization’ of many non-military issues, such as climate change and disease, {{has come to be}} accepted in some sections of the academic and ‘real’ political world, this status has very rarely been granted to accidents.

Securing people against such accidents, though, is a political task accepted by industrialized governments from {{as far back as the}} late nineteenth century when ‘social security’ policies began to evolve in response to changing economic and social conditions. Equally, incidents of workers in Less Developed Countries being killed are no longer unfortunate problems unconnected with the relatively safe lives of people in the global North since Developed world consumers are functionally connected to these systemic failures as never before.

40|$|The {{recent study}} by Robock et al on the climatic {{consequences}} of regional nuclear war shows that even a “limited ” nuclear conflict, involving as few as 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs, would have global implications with significant cooling of the earth's surface and decreased precipitation {{in many parts of}} the world. A conflict of this magnitude could arise between emerging nuclear powers such as India and Pakistan. Past episodes of abrupt global cooling, due to volcanic activity, caused major crop failures and famine; the predicted climate effects of a regional nuclear war would be expected to cause similar shortfalls in agricultural production. In addition large quantities of food might need to be destroyed and significant areas of crop land might need to be taken out of production because of radioactive contamination. Even a modest, sudden decline in agricultural production could trigger significant increases in the prices for basic foods and hoarding on a global scale, both of which would make food inaccessible to poor people in much of the world. While it is not possible to estimate the precise extent of the global famine that would follow a regional nuclear war, it seems reasonable to postulate a total <b>global</b> death <b>toll</b> in the range of one billion from starvation alone.
