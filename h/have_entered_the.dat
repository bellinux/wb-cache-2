5|$|The {{house is}} architecturally {{significant}} as a well-designed and well-preserved late 19th century suburban residence, with excellent interior detail and a matching carriagehouse. The {{area in which}} it is located was situated in an upper-class suburban area, but since the late 19th-century commercial and industrial buildings <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> area. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2006 study, the Noronha skink is {{infected}} by several parasitic worms, most frequently by the nematode Spinicauda spinicauda. Another nematode, Moaciria alvarengai, is much rarer. Other rare parasites include two trematodes—Mesocoelium monas and an undetermined species of Platynossomum—and an undetermined species of Oochoristica, a cestode. S.spinicauda is usually only found in teiid lizards; it may <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> archipelago when Tupinambis merianae, a teiid, {{was introduced to}} the island in 1960. Among nematodes, previous studies in 1956 and 1957 had only reported M.alvarengai and Thelandros alvarengai from the skink; the presence of S.spinicauda could explain the rarity of M.alvarengai and absence of T.alvarengai in Noronha skinks observed in 2006.|$|E

5|$|According to the Dalai Lama, {{among the}} many images in the temple was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in the temple, within which the small wooden statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden. The image was in the temple for 1300 years, and when Songtsen Gampo died his soul was {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> small wooden statue. During the Cultural Revolution, the clay image was smashed and the smaller Buddha was given by a Tibetan to the Dalai Lama.|$|E
5|$|Before the New Waddell Dam was constructed, {{two phases}} of a {{three-phase}} study {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of the dam on fisheries. Completed in 2005, the third phase of the study determined that the larger reservoir has less nutrient concentrations due to CAP water introduction and that water fluctuations have reduced fish cover, likely affecting food and spawning. Large mouth bass populations have also declined but striped bass <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> lake, likely by eggs transferred through CAP water. Around the lake, Reclamation has taken steps to protect wildlife habitats, including those for bald eagles and Gila topminnows.|$|E
5|$|Björk is a singer-songwriter from Reykjavík, Iceland. Her debut album, Björk, {{considered}} juvenilia, {{was released}} in 1977 by the Fálkinn record label.

5|$|Dodd {{tried to}} follow in the pattern of New Englanders who <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> race for the Democratic {{nomination}} and won, including John Kerry, Michael Dukakis, and John F. Kennedy. If elected, Dodd would have become the second Roman Catholic president (after Kennedy) and the second Connecticut-born president (after George W. Bush). He would have been the first Senator to win the presidency while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (that honor ultimately went to Barack Obama). After his withdrawal from the race, Dodd went on to endorse the eventual winner Barack Obama, and retired from the Senate in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Eurotunnel was in discussions with the Intergovernment Commission, which oversees the tunnel, with the aim of amending elements of the safety code governing the tunnel's usage. Most saliently, the requirement that trains be able to split within the tunnel and each part of the train be driven out to opposite ends has been removed. However, the proposal to allow shorter trains was not passed. Eurotunnel Chairman & Chief Executive Jacques Gounon said that he hoped the liberalisation of rules would allow entry into the market of competitors such as Deutsche Bahn. Sources at Eurotunnel suggested that Deutsche Bahn could <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> market at the timetable change in December 2012. This, however, did not happen.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E

5|$|In the Archaic period (before 2000 BCE), {{a number}} of loanwords from Mixe–Zoquean {{languages}} seem to <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> proto-Mayan language. This has led to hypotheses that the early Maya were dominated by speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages, possibly the Olmec. In {{the case of the}} Xincan and Lencan languages, on the other hand, Mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords. Mayan language specialists such as Campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between Maya and the Lencan and Xinca people, possibly during the Classic period (250–900).|$|E
5|$|Of the 55Japanese-born {{players who}} have played in MLB, 15 <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> league using the posting system. Since the system's {{creation}} in 1998, the 22players that have used it have experienced a range of success. Of these 22, eleven were immediately signed to Major League contracts and one player who drew no bids on his first posting was signed to a Major League contract on his second posting. These contracts range from $1.4million to $155million. Of the remaining nine, three were signed to Minor League contracts, two were unable to reach a contract agreement and five were unsuccessful in drawing bids from any Major League clubs (one player failed to draw bids during two separate postings). The following tables outline each posting and its outcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{common use}} of the English {{language}} {{is an example of}} the American impact on Philippine society. It has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of American pop cultural trends. This affinity is seen in Filipinos' love of fast food and American film and music. Fast food outlets are found on many street corners. American global fast food chain stalwarts <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> market, but local fast food chains like Goldilocks and most notably Jollibee, the leading fast food chain in the country, have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals.|$|E

The s, the s, and s <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> debate as options put forward for naval gunfire support, while others advocate the use of specifically designed close air support planes and newer missile systems that can loiter in an area as a replacement for naval gunfire.|$|E
5|$|This first {{hurricane}} of the season's {{effects were}} first noted in Santa Clara, Cuba, where rainy and windy conditions were observed {{on the afternoon}} of June 14. Several vessels sank during the hurricane during {{the early morning hours of}} June 15. The system was thought to <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Florida Straits during the evening. The system began to travel towards the west-northwest, steadily strengthening into a hurricane by the afternoon. On June 17, a minimum pressure of 979 mbar (hPa; 28.91 inHg) was recorded, as the hurricane passed over southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|While the Japanese raid {{into the}} Indian Ocean was not successful, {{associated}} Japanese shipping movements provoked a major Allied response. In early March 1944, Allied intelligence reported that two battleships escorted by destroyers had left Singapore {{in the direction}} of Surabaya and a U.S. submarine made radar contact with two large Japanese ships in the Lombok Strait. The Australian Chiefs of Staff Committee reported to the Government on 8 March that there was a possibility that these ships could <b>have</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean to attack Fremantle. In response to this report, all ground and naval defences at Fremantle were fully manned, all shipping was ordered to leave Fremantle and several RAAF squadrons were redeployed to bases in Western Australia.|$|E
