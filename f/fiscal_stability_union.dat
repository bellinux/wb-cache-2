40|$|We examine {{prospects}} for a monetary union in the East African Community (EAC) by developing a stylized model of policymakers' decision problem that allows for uncertain benefits derived from monetary,financial and <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability,</b> and then calibrating {{the model for the}} EAC for the period 2003 - 2010. When policymakers properly allow for uncertainty, none of the countries wants to pursue a monetary union based on either monetary or financial stability grounds, and only Rwanda might favor it on <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability</b> grounds; we argue that robust institutional arrangements assuring substantial improvements in monetary, financial and <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability</b> are needed to compensate...|$|R

40|$|The {{discussion}} {{about the impact of}} a monetary <b>union</b> on the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability</b> of individual member countries is largely confined to European Monetary <b>Union</b> and the <b>Stability</b> and Growth Pact (SGP) debate, which in turn tends to focus more on optimal fiscal rules. However, when adding insights from the theories of optimum currency areas, as well as from literature on <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability</b> analysis and exchange rate regimes in emerging markets, new layers are added to the discussion. Changes to the macroeconomic environment, changed incentives for fiscal authorities as well as possible changes in the reaction of capital markets are all factors that determine <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability</b> in a monetary union. This paper finds that some consequences of the institution of monetary union itself could alleviate the fear of heightened fiscal instability that is often assumed in the SGP debate. However, although {{the true nature of the}} problem of bailout for national fiscal authorities in a monetary union hinges likely less on the behaviour of fiscal authorities and more on the reaction of capital markets, this issue remains at the core of increased <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability</b> risk in a monetary union...|$|R

40|$|Public-policy {{assumptions}} regarding sub-national governments' financial {{behavior are}} based on economic rationality. Therefore, to achieve <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability</b> at the macro level, central governments use fiscal rules both to constrain the behavior of local policymakers and to resolve deficit/debt biases. Using the Italian fiscal governance system as an illustrative example, this chapter considers both the tensions derived from achieving fiscal responsibility {{at the national level}} in a decentralized environment and the difficulties of maintaining adequate performance at the local government level. It is argued that the public management perspective can be helpful not only at the micro level but also at the macro level in developing public policies to promote <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability.</b> It is suggested that public policy should adopt a more holistic approach toward fiscal responsibility in multi-level governance environments.

40|$|AbstractFiscal {{stability}} {{is one of}} the paramount demands of important foreign investors, as well as of all taxpayers. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>stability</b> is influenced by the level of trust in the fiscal system and in fiscal institutions. We conducted a study to determine the level of trust in the Romanian fiscal system, medium- and long-term, as well as in fiscal institutions. The recommendation that can be made after analysing the results is that the level of trust needs to be incresed in order to obtain <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability.</b> The paper is also a contribution to the field of fiscal literature, mapping out some of the improvements needed with regard to the Fiscal Compact, as well as researching legal persons. Due to bias in fiscal institutions forecast, we totally agree with the idea of creating an independent european fiscal institution that provides its own budget forecasts, so that the deficits and debts will be measured the same...|$|R

40|$|On the 2 nd of March 2012 the {{intergovernmental}} <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Stability</b> Treaty {{was signed by}} 25 European Union (EU) member-states {{with the exception of}} the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic. The treaty was part of a broader set of planned measures taken by EU member-states to protect the Euro in the wake of the 2007 Eurozone crisis. The treaty aimed to reduce national debt in EU member-states by averting fiscal imbalances. Due to the poor condition of the Irish economy, the treaty was a chance for Ireland to regain international market confidence, economic stability and growth. As an economically small EU member-state, Ireland’s position to bargain for concessions was tenuous due to the weakness of its economy and its consequences for the rest of the EU. However, Ireland managed to achieve a considerable degree of influence throughout the <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Stability</b> Treaty negotiations by drawing upon opportunity structures as negotiation leverage. In achieving influence in the <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Stability</b> Treaty negotiations by drawing upon credible opportunity structures, Ireland proved that small EU member-states can and do achieve influence in intergovernmental treaty negotiations, regardless of their economic size. This study challenges traditional understandings regarding the strength of the small EU member-state in intergovernmental treaty negotiations. As the Union Method becomes ever more embraced by EU member-states, we are urged to think differently about how treaties are agreed between EU member-states. We are also urged to question what this may tell us about intergovernmental treaty making and the influence of small EU member-states in intergovernmental treaty making processes, both at the present time and in the future. This thesis provides a basis for such exploration...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Stability</b> Pact for EMU {{suggests}} that constraints on fiscal policy are thought by policy makers {{to be necessary}} {{to ensure that the}} independent European central bank can control inflation. In this paper we examine the interrelationship between monetary and fiscal policy when both follow simple rules. We identify two stable policy regimes. In the 'active' regime, defined as a monetary policy that seeks to raise real interest rates in response to excess inflation, a self-stabilising fiscal policy is required to ensure model stability. In the corresponding 'passive' regime, a fiscal policy which does not, by itself, ensure fiscal solvency constrains monetary policy to be relatively 'passive'. The precise nature of these constraints depends upon the importance of money {{and the degree to which}} the economy deviates from Ricardian Equivalence. We then present simulations which analyse the impact of differing degrees of policy activism in the face of shocks. Our conclusion is that the central bank does not need to seek, on this account, the degree of debt stabilisation that appears to be implied by the <b>fiscal</b> <b>stability</b> pact...|$|R
