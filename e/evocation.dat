5|$|Fortune was a {{ceremonial}} magician. The magical principles on which her Fraternity was based were adopted {{from the late}} nineteenth century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with other influences coming from Theosophy and Christian Science. The magical ceremonies performed by Fortune's Fraternity were placed into two categories: initiations, in which the candidate was introduced to magical forces, and <b>evocation,</b> in which these forces were manipulated for a given purpose.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 it {{was adapted}} as a two-part {{television}} drama for the BBC. The production starred Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Wraysford and Clémence Poésy as Isabelle Azaire, and {{was directed by}} Philip Martin, based on a screenplay by Abi Morgan. The historian Edward Madigan favourably compared the television adaptation to Steven Spielberg's War Horse as a successful <b>evocation</b> {{of the experience of}} the World War I trenches.|$|E
5|$|The painting's dreamlike and {{haunting}} erotic <b>evocation</b> of infatuation and obsession {{was a huge}} popular success. After {{its first}} exhibition, at the 1782 Royal Academy of London, critics and patrons reäcted with horrified fascination and the work became widely popular, {{to the extent that}} it was parodied in political satire and an engraved version was widely distributed. In response, Fuseli produced at least three other versions.|$|E

5|$|When David's first book, Mediterranean Food was {{published}} in 1950 the British public was still enduring food rationing after the Second World War. Her <b>evocation</b> of the everyday plenty and excellence of Mediterranean food was revelatory, and although she did not reach a wide public until cheap paperback editions of her books {{came out in the}} mid 1950s, reviewers immediately spotted her importance.|$|E
5|$|His {{eyes are}} open, {{and his skin}} is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This <b>evocation,</b> not present in the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E
5|$|John Gerard (1545–1612) is {{the most}} famous of all the English herbalists. His Herball of 1597 is, like most herbals, largely derivative. It appears to be a {{reformulation}} of Hieronymus Bock's Kreuterbuch subsequently translated into Dutch as Pemptades by Rembert Dodoens (1517–1585), and thence into English by Carolus Clusius, (1526–1609) then re-worked by Henry Lyte in 1578 as A Nievve Herball. This became the basis of Gerard's Herball or General Historie of Plantes. that appeared in 1597 with its 1800 woodcuts (only 16 original). Although largely derivative, Gerard's popularity can be attributed to his <b>evocation</b> of plants and places in Elizabethan England and to the clear influence of gardens and gardening on this work.|$|E

5|$|Several critics {{detect a}} crisis in public {{memorial}} style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and <b>evocation</b> of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, {{at least on the}} Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.|$|E
5|$|Author Edward Macan views British symphonic pop as a {{splinter}} of {{the progressive}} rock genre that relied on straightforward songwriting, rich vocal arrangements and quasi-orchestral fullness, citing Supertramp, ELO, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project, and Al Stewart as examples. By the late 1970s, the era of record labels investing in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited control over their content and marketing had ended. Corporate artists and repertoire staff began exerting an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to the artists. Some of the major progressive bands transitioned to a more commercial sound and deemphasized the <b>evocation</b> of art music. By the early 1980s, the prevailing view was that the progressive rock style had ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|The Gaelic poet Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair {{spent much}} of his life in the Hebrides and made {{frequent}} references to them in his poetry, including in An Airce and Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill. The best known Gaelic poet of her era, Màiri Mhòr nan Òran (Mary MacPherson, 1821–98), embodied the spirit of the land agitation of the 1870s and 1880s. This, and her powerful <b>evocation</b> of the Hebrides—she was from Skye—has made her among the most enduring Gaelic poets. Allan MacDonald (1859–1905), who spent his adult life on Eriskay and South Uist, composed hymns and verse in honour of the Blessed Virgin, the Christ Child, and the Eucharist. In his secular poetry, MacDonald praised the beauty of Eriskay and its people. In his verse drama, Parlamaid nan Cailleach (The Old Wives' Parliament), he lampooned the gossiping of his female parishioners and local marriage customs.|$|E

5|$|When Crèvecœur {{offered his}} {{manuscript}} essays to the London publishers Davies & Davis in 1782, they were initially {{skeptical about the}} potential for the Letters to be successful. However, the work proved to be instantly popular in England for a variety of reasons. Proponents of political reform such as William Godwin and Thomas Paine approved of the radical anti-government implications of its message. Romantic writers admired, and were influenced by, its <b>evocation</b> of the natural landscape and the individual's relationship to it. More widely, in the final years of the Revolutionary War, the public was eager for the documentary detail Letters provided about America. The popularity of the book led to a second edition being called for only a year later.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained <b>evocation</b> of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular {{to the notion that}} Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't {{be able to make it}} work for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.|$|E
5|$|IV. Rondo: Allegretto – Presto. This lyrical rondo {{movement}} {{consists of}} flowing triplet movement and endless songful melody. Its form is a sonata-rondo (A–B–A–development–A–B–A–coda). The Rondo's main and opening theme {{is taken from}} the slow movement of the sonata D. 537 of 1817. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} this theme would make musical sense as a response subsequent to the questioning leading tone that closes the Allegro's opening fanfare; in this capacity the Rondo's lyricism is the dramatically delayed final goal of the sonata. The second thematic group is written in the traditional dominant key; however, it is very long, modulating through many different subdominant tonalities. The development section, in contrast, culminates in a long passage in C-sharp minor with a climax characterized by a tension-building ambiguity between E major and C-sharp minor and a greatly prolonged evasion of a cadence. This leads to a false recapitulation in F-sharp major, which then modulates to begin again in the home key. In the coda, the main theme returns fragmented, with full bar pauses, which lead each time to unexpected changes of key. This is followed by an agitated presto section, based on the final bars of the main theme, and the sonata concludes with a bold <b>evocation</b> of its very opening measures, with an ascending arpeggio (essentially an inversion of the descending figure from the Allegro's second phrase), followed by a fortissimo full statement of the opening fanfare in retrograde.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} decoration was extraordinarily rich. The walls were decorated with marble, {{the roof was}} gilded, while the narthex featured a depiction of the baptism of Constantine the Great. Fragments of ivory, amethyst, gold and colored glass, originally inlaid in the marble sculptures, have also been found at the site, as well as fragments of mosaics. The deliberate <b>evocation</b> of the Solomonic Temple was further reinforced by the preponderance of motifs such as palm trees, pomegranates and lilies in the church's decoration. A notable characteristic, {{which has not been}} attested before in Constantinopolitan art and architecture, is the extensive use of Sassanid Persian decorative motifs such as friezes of running palmette and pomegranate leaves or symmetric geometric and vegetal patterns. Persian motifs became increasingly popular in the 6th century, and were also used in the decoration of the Hagia Sophia. Another exceptional find are ten relief plaques bearing the images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Apostles; such images are very rare due to the destruction of human representations in the Iconoclasm of the 8th and 9th centuries.|$|E

25|$|Generally, <b>evocation</b> is {{used for}} two main purposes: to gather {{information}} and to obtain the services or obedience of a spirit or demon.

However, it is equally possible to evoke angelic beings, gods, and other intelligences related to planets, elements, and the Zodiac.|$|E
