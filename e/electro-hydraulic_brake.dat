5000|$|In a {{hydraulic}} brake system, the driver applies force by a mechanical link from the {{pedal to the}} master brake cylinder. In turn the master brake cylinder develops hydraulic pressure in the wheels. In contrast, the <b>electro-hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> SBC provides the brakes with a brake fluid supply from the hydraulic high-pressure reservoir, which is sufficient for several braking events. A piston pump driven by an electric motor supplies a controlled brake fluid pressure between 140 and 160 Bar in the gas diaphragm reservoir.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{violations}} {{are a major}} problem. Monitoring these traffic violations {{by human}} intervention over a wider area is too complicated due to the increasing population. The main motive behind {{this paper is to}} reduce these reckless accidents for which we propose a system that governs and controls the speed of the vehicle without any direct inconvenience to the driver. There are instances where the speed of the automobile is beyond the expected speed limit or the driver does not obey the traffic signals. An RFID reader present in the vehicle senses the RFID tag linked with a red traffic light or senses the vehicle speed limit on the tag attached to the speed limit signboard. The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) present in the vehicle will then decide upon the required control measure by comparing the tag information with real time speed of the automobile.

40|$|ABSTRACT−Reducing {{the number}} of traffic {{accidents}} is a declared target of most governments. Since dependence on driver reaction is {{the main cause of}} road accidents, it would be advisable to replace the human factor in some driving-related tasks with automated solutions. In order to automate a vehicle it is necessary to control the actuators of a car, i. e., the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake. This paper presents the design and implementation of an electro-hydraulic braking system consisting of a pump and various valves allowing the control computer to stop the car. It is assembled in coexistence with the original circuit for the sake of robustness and to permit the two systems to halt the car independently. This system was developed for installation in a commercial Citroën C 3 Pluriel of the AUTOPIA program. Various tests were carried out of its correct operation, and an experiment showing the integration of the system into the longitudinal control of the car is described.

40|$|Electric vehicle {{power train}} {{concepts}} with wheel-hub or close-to-wheel propulsion {{open up a}} whole new area of vehicle control possibilities. The DLR robotic concept vehicle ROMO allows the evaluation of these possibilities using integrated chassis control. With its electric drive train it is possible to recuperate kinetic energy during braking process. Using only the electric motors for braking, an increased mass of electric drives & energy storage would be necessary in order to comply to legal passenger vehicle braking regulations. Therefore, the combination of friction based brake and electric motor brake can be advantageous. In this paper, object oriented models (Modelica) of a permanent magnet synchronous machine driven <b>electro-hydraulic</b> disc <b>brake</b> and an in-wheel direct driven traction motor are presented. Furthermore, two torque blending algorithms of an <b>electro-hydraulic</b> disc <b>brake</b> and an in-wheel permanent magnet synchronous machine are evaluated.

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} {{goal in the}} field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) is to provide driving aids aimed at preventing accidents and reducing the number of traffic victims. The commonest traffic accidents in urban areas are due to sudden braking that demands a very fast response on the part of drivers. Attempts to solve this prob-lem have motivated many ITS advances including the detection of the intention of surrounding cars using lasers, ra-dars or cameras. However, this might not be enough to increase safety when there is a danger of collision. Vehicle to vehicle communications are needed to ensure that the other intentions of cars are also available. The article describes the development of a controller to perform an emergency stop via an <b>electro-hydraulic</b> <b>braking</b> system employed on dry asphalt. An original V 2 V communication scheme based on WiFi cards has been used for broadcasting positioning information to other vehicles. The reliability of the scheme has been theoretically analyzed to estimate its performance when the number of vehicles involved is much higher. This controller has been incorporated into the AUTOPIA pro-gram control for automatic cars. The system has been implemented in Citroën C 3 Pluriel, and various tests were per-formed to evaluate its operation...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{has been}} {{completely}} developed at Center for Automotive Re- search (CAR), The Ohio State University. The work {{has been focused on}} modeling and sizing an <b>Electro-Hydraulic</b> <b>Brake</b> system (EHB) for a hy- brid electric SUV equipped with axle motors. Within the target of this study, an optimal regenerative braking strategy which utilizes a two-level split of braking action has been investigated. The braking torque is ﬁrst distributed to front and rear axles in order to track the ideal brake force distribution factor. Then, the regenerative braking strategy optimally splits the torque between friction brakes and electric motors with the aim of max- imizing energy recuperation. The regenerative braking strategy is applied to the hybrid SUV vehicle simulator developed at CAR. Simulation results show the eﬀectiveness of the control strategy for diﬀerent braking maneu- vers. Finally, a comparative simulation study has been performed to assess the performance of the strategy proposed against other two braking strate- gies for three diﬀerent driving cycles: urban (FUDS), highway (FHDS) and aggressive (SMTP) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} the design of {{intelligent}} actuator logic for Electro-Mechanical Brake (EMB) system using fuzzy control. Previous studies simplified EMB system as a linear system or removed coulomb friction and backlash for the convenience of calculation. However, nonlinear components such as coulomb friction and backlash should be considered because the inherent nonlinearity in the high operating speed of EMB system is critical. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt full Brake by Wire (BBW) model of EMB system. Unlike <b>Electro-Hydraulic</b> <b>Brake</b> (EHB) system, EMB has no hydraulic back-up system, and is operated totally by electric and electro-mechanical components. Therefore, safety is the {{one of the most important}} problems in designing an EMB system. To control the EMB system, we developed fuzzy logic controller, which is effective in a complex and nonlinear system. MATLAB SIMULINK is used to provide the verification of the control performance. Simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy logic controller forces the EMB actuator to follow the command input precisely. This study will be a base of further research, whose purpose is to develop an intelligent actuator logic using adaptive fuzzy control for EMB system in noise and disturbance.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research results}} {{on a new}} fluid-mechatronic brake principle. The Self-energizing <b>Electro-Hydraulic</b> <b>Brake</b> (SEHB) utilizes the effect of instable self-reinforcement in combination with a closed loop control. Background {{for the development of}} the brake concept is a train application. However, SEHB is not limited to any specific application. Main advantages of the concept are its minimal energy consumption, the closed loop control of the true brake torque and its feedback ability due to the decentralized low-power electronic control. This thesis introduces the new brake principle by comparing it to conventional self-reinforcing brakes. A mathematical distinction is given between self-reinforcement and self-energization on the basis of static considerations. The dynamic characteristics are analyzed using a linearized system description which is further simplified using the method of pole dominance analysis. The simplified model is used to calculate a state dependent proportional controller map on the basis of a damping criteria. Besides the theoretic analysis, the thesis presents the basic hydraulic design criteria and gives a systematic overview over different hydraulic-mechanical design solutions. A special focus is given on the valve control, since it is vital for the brake performance. Different automotive valves such as from antilock brake systems (ABS) or electronic stabilization programs (ESP) are applied using electronic power switches and current drivers. The brake test stand and two successive prototypes are outlined at the end of this thesis. Different exemplary measurement results show the performance of the implemented types of valve control and demonstrate the potential of this new brake technology...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT−This paper {{proposes a}} method {{that can be used}} for the {{resistance}} estimation of a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) -driven solenoid. By using estimated solenoid resistance, the PWM duty ratio was compensated to be proportional to the solenoid current. The proposed method was developed for use with EHB (<b>Electro-Hydraulic</b> <b>Braking)</b> systems, which are essential features of the regenerative braking system of many electric vehicles. Because the HU (Hydraulic Unit) of most EHB systems performs not only ABS/TCS/ESP (Electronic Stability Program) functions but also service braking function, the possible duration of continuous solenoid driving is so long that the generated heat can drastically change the level of solenoid resistance. The current model of the PWM-driven solenoid is further developed in this paper; from this a new resistance equation is derived. This resistance equation is solved by using an iterative method known as the FPT (fixed point theorem). Furthermore, by taking the average of the resistance estimates, it was possible to successfully eliminate the effect of measurement noise factors. Simulation results showed that the proposed method contained a sufficient pass-band in the frequency response. Experimental results also showed that adaptive solenoid driving which incorporates resistance estimations is able to maintain a linear relationship between the PWM duty ratio and the solenoid current in spite of a wide variety of ambient temperatures and continuous driving...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to validate {{a new approach to}} understeer mitigation chassis control, based on a particle motion reference: parabolic path reference (PPR). Considering the scenario of excess entry speed into a curve, related to run-off-road crashes, the aim is that automatic braking minimizes lateral deviation from the target path by using an optimal combination of deceleration, cornering forces and yaw moments. Previous simulation studies showed that four-wheel braking can achieve this much better than a conventional form of yaw moment control (DYC). The aim of this work is to verify this on a test track with an experimental vehicle, and to compare performance with DYC and an uncontrolled vehicle. Experiments were performed with a front-wheel-drive passenger vehicle equipped with an additional four identical brake callipers controlled via an <b>electro-hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> (EHB) system, enabling individual brake control. Minimizing the maximum deviation from the intended curve radius is the control objective. Feedback to the controller consists of the available steering wheel angle, wheel speeds, yaw rate and lateral acceleration sensors in the vehicle. Additional to these variables, also the vehicle position was logged using a GPS system. It was found that PPR is superior to DYC in reducing the maximum deviation from the intended path, confirming the trends previously found in simulations. Furthermore, the PPR concept is found to be inherently more stable than DYC since more brake force is applied to the outer wheels than the inner wheels throughout the manoeuvre. The experiments involve a first implementation of a PPR control which is not a fully closed-loop control intervention and tuned to a step steer (transition from straight to fixed-radius curve. This is the first study to explicitly and systematically evaluate this new approach to understeer mitigation. The approach is fundamentally different from common DYC and suggests the potential {{for a new generation of}} controllers based on trajectory control via chassis actuators...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{increase}} in global environmental concern drives {{the development of}} fuel saving vehicle technologies. A way to save fuel is to recuperate kinetic energy into a usable form for propulsive purposes, which is known as regenerative (regen) braking. However, regen braking also influences the vehicle stability and the driver‟s perception of the brake system. The impact of the human factor imposes {{the use of a}} test vehicle during development of regen braking strategies. The production of a regen braking test vehicle was initiated by SAAB as part of their Hybrid Vehicles and eAWD project and conducted by this master thesis. The main use of the test vehicle is to analyze the limitations of additive regen braking, where additional electric motor brake torque is applied on top of the standard brake torque. Additive braking allows the original brake system to be retained, saving production costs while giving fuel consumption improvements. Also, it facilitates the transition process to hybrid vehicles. The perfect test vehicle for regen braking would possess one electric motor for each wheel and the necessary ancillaries. However, this vehicle project would have an intrinsic high level of packaging complexity, cost and engineering time. To overcome these negative aspects, another concept was conceived, in which a second hydraulic brake system is controlled to emulate electric motors. Electric motors are emulated {{in the sense that the}} friction brake wheel torque is equal to that produced by an electric motor. This concept consists of extra calipers clamping the original rotors, an <b>Electro-Hydraulic</b> <b>Brake</b> (EHB) unit delivering brake pressure and a dSpace onboard computer running the test program. Simulink models of a generic electric driveline were developed to emulate the behavior of regen braking. The models include the battery, electric motor, power converter, and motor controller. These models calculate the wheel torque to be applied, which needs to be converted to a pressure value for the EHB unit. A brake model was developed to calculate the pressure, taking into account the temperature which affects the friction coefficient between the pad and disc. A hardware-in-the-loop rig was used for calibration of the brake model. Additionally, torque measuring wheels were installed on the test vehicle to calibrate the software and to validate the performance of the vehicle. The result of this thesis is an easy-to-use test vehicle which can conduct experiments dealing with additive regen braking, as well as any brake based vehicle system. For engineers to get started quickly, an example case study and a user manual are provided. The result of the research utilizing the test vehicle will be seen in the next generation SAAB hybrid vehicles...|$|E
