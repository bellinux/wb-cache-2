40|$|One {{potential}} {{solution to}} reducing peak hour congestion {{has been to}} identify a role for the employer in reducing car-based travel to work and promoting more sustainable alternatives through comprehensive 'employee travel plans' (Rye, T., 1995. <b>Employee</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Plans</b> [...] An Easy Means to Cut Congestion? The 23 rd European Transport Forum, Proceedings of Seminar B, Planning for Sustainability, PTRC, pp. 229 - 241). In the UK such plans have seen a steady increase in interest since the early 1990 s culminating in their recognition in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions DETR, 1998 (DETR, 1998. A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone, The Government's White Paper on the Future of Transport, HMSO, London) Transport White Paper as a policy tool for reducing car-based travel. Despite their inclusion as a policy tool little information exists on the views of employers towards such plans (Rye, T., 1995. <b>Employee</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Plans</b> [...] An Easy Means to Cut Congestion? The 23 rd European Transport Forum, Proceedings of Seminar B, Planning for Sustainability, PTRC, pp. 229 - 241; Rye, T., MacLeod, M., 1998. An Investigation of Employer Attitudes to Employer <b>Transport</b> <b>Plans,</b> AET European <b>Transport</b> Conference 1998, Policy Planning and Sustainability Seminar (Seminar C), vol. 2, PTRC). This is of considerable concern given that employers by default are the key implementers. Studies to date on employers' attitudes have concentrated on {{the views of the}} large employer (over 100 <b>employees).</b> The <b>Transport</b> White Paper however suggests that there is also a role for the small employer. This paper therefore investigates the attitudes and policy of the small employer (under 100 employees) towards staff travel and green commuter plans. The paper is based on the analysis of data collected in 1998 from 352 small Oxfordshire employers. The research was funded under the DETR's Seedcorn Research Programme. The paper outlines selected findings of this research, and concludes by suggesting that while ultimately there should be a role for the small employer in developing green commuter plans it is the large firms that are more likely to implement green commuter plans in the short term. In policy terms, the continuing focus of green commuter plans on large employers is therefore the best way forward. In the long term however consideration needs to be given to the role that the small employer can play in reducing employee travel. ...|$|R

30|$|Besides {{the federal}} level the 16 states are the major {{political}} authorities. They all have their own <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> processes and plans, which have to be coordinated with national policy. A working group of the Research association for transport (FGSV) has released new guidelines for mobility master plans [28]. FGSV guidelines are not binding, but their application is strongly encouraged, and they serve as key reference documents for planning activities. There are other organisations, focusing on urban <b>transport</b> <b>planning.</b> One of those organisations influencing the debate is the German Association of Cities (Deutscher Städtetag), which have an expert commission for <b>transport</b> <b>planning.</b> In many Federal States so called ‘Zweckverbände’ (cooperative associations for public <b>transport</b> <b>planning)</b> carry out public <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> for several local authorities.|$|R
40|$|The paper argues {{the need}} for a more nuanced debate over the place of public {{involvement}} in <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> in Britain, {{in the context of the}} current democratic turn in governance. The recent policy shift towards integrated transport has been accompanied by significant institutional changes, which have created a new framework for <b>transport</b> <b>planning,</b> with important implications for public involvement. Yet many issues underlying the new participative approach to <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> have yet to be resolved. In this paper, the wider socio-political context for increasing inclusivity in planning processes is discussed, followed by a brief analysis of the condition of public involvement in <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> in Britain.

30|$|The <b>employee</b> <b>transporting</b> {{problem is}} {{actually}} a set partitioning problem for the assignment of the vehicles. The capacities of the vehicles vary in size. Therefore, it is a heterogenous fleet problem. These facts make the <b>employee</b> <b>transporting</b> problem belong to a different class of problems than the HVRP in the literature. Although in both problems {{the aim is to}} determine the fleet mix and composition, the <b>employee</b> <b>transporting</b> problem strives for this aim without routing. A set partitioning model is developed, deviating from the integer formulations in the literature. An important aspect of this article is the thorough investigation of the model structure. Consequently, this investigation leads to a knapsack problem from the model structure. This knapsack problem is the common sense problem of determining the number of vehicles of each capacity to transport all the passengers at a minimum cost by ignoring the subset-vehicle assignments.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{operational}} planning processes for road based long haul transportation and analyze the potentials for improvements. The point of departure is an Operations Management planning model used to build a frame of reference that is used to analyze <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> processes. Design/methodology/approach - A literature study was conducted to review models and theories from the Operations Management area. The outcome of that study was used to provide a theoretical foundation for analyzing <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> processes. Following the literature study, empirical data was collected through two different case studies, one with focus on vehicle fill rate and the other with focus on <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> processes. Findings - The findings include evidence of poor fill rate in road based long haul transportation related to poor planning processes. Hence, a framework for <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> based on Operations Management planning models is provided. By using that framework, the analysis reveals shortcomings in <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> related to lack of information access but also time to allocate the right resources to various assignments. Research limitations/implications – This paper is focused on road based transportation. It shows poor fill rate in long haul transport operations and consequently a need for improved <b>transport</b> operations <b>planning.</b> The provided <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> framework constitutes a theoretical contribution and is beneficial for analyzing <b>transport</b> operations <b>planning.</b> Practical implications – The fact that the fill rate in long haul road based transportation has potential to improve gives an opportunity for enhanced planning operations. The developed framework is useful in identifying opportunities for improvements in planning as well as what prerequisites needs to be fulfilled to enable better <b>transport</b> <b>planning.</b> Originality/value – In addition to showing evidence of poor fill rate in road based transportation, this work provides a <b>transport</b> operations <b>planning</b> framework based on traditional Operations Management <b>planning</b> models and <b>transport</b> <b>planning</b> models...|$|R

There is, however, notable diversity between highways authorities in the degree to which air quality is considered. Air quality management operates to a significantly shorter time-scale than <b>transport</b> <b>planning.</b> The differing time-scales of the two planning processes have hindered their integration as a consequence. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the Monge–Kantorovich transport {{problem in a}} purely measure theoretic setting, i. e. without imposing continuity assumptions on the cost function. It is known that <b>transport</b> <b>plans</b> which are concentrated on c-monotone sets are optimal, provided the cost function c is either lower semi-continuous and finite, or continuous and may possibly attain the value ∞. We show that this is true in a more general setting, in particular for merely Borel measurable cost functions provided that {c=∞} is the union of a closed set and a negligible set. In a previous paper Schachermayer and Teichmann considered strongly c-monotone <b>transport</b> <b>plans</b> and proved that every strongly c-monotone <b>transport</b> <b>plan</b> is optimal. We establish that <b>transport</b> <b>plans</b> are strongly c-monotone {{if and only if}} they satisfy a “better” notion of optimality called robust optimality...|$|R
