40|$|You’ve either done it or you’ve seen someone doing one: The dreadful walk of shame. On {{any given}} weekend morning, walk-of-shamers can be spotted prowling Ames’ sidewalks, {{attempting}} {{to be as}} <b>inconspicious</b> as possible— but often the short dresses, heels, messy hair, and smudged makeup gives them away. The truth is, in the bright morning light, walks of shame never go unnoticed. So what can one do to avoid scaring Sunday morning churchgoers? Follow these tips before you end up shamefully stumbling down Lincoln Way carrying the pumps you wore last night...|$|E
40|$|The {{enormous}} {{growth of}} the Australian wine industry in the 1990 s relied strongly on the export market, whereas domestic markets remained relatively stagnant. The study with 272 subjects in Adelaide in 2000 wants to contribute to better market transparency for adopting the product line to consumer demands. Consumers were clustered into five groups: Enjoyment oriented social drinkers (14 %), fashion or image oriented drinkers (19 %), ritual oriented conspicuous wine enthusiasts (18 %), purposeful <b>inconspicious</b> premium drinkers (25 %) and basic wine drinkers (24 %). Details on average age, educational status, income and consumption are given together {{with a number of}} indicative brands for the respective group. Johan Bruwer, Elton Li & Mike Rei...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{manifestations of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{including}} neuronal loss were investigated in 12 cases of AD and in 10 healthy age-matched controls, with {{focus on the}} cerebellum. Linear Purkinje cell (PC) density was measured in the vermis and cerebellar hemispheres. Neurons were also counted in the inferior olivary nucleus. In vermis of the AD cases, the mean PC number was significantly lower (p = 0. 019) than in the controls. The neurons in the inferior olive were similarly fewer, though not significantly (p = 0. 13). Molecular layer gliosis and atrophy in the vermis was clearly severer in AD than in the controls. Features typical of cerebral Alzheimer encephalopathy (plaques, tangles and microvacuolization) were <b>inconspicious.</b> The structural cerebellar changes in the AD cases were thus neuronal loss, atrophy and gliosis, judged to represent the disease process, and with a main involvement in the vermis. This may be reflected {{in some of the}} symptoms and signs seen in AD, signs that are generally overlooked or judged to be of noncerebellar origin...|$|E
40|$|Patients with TAR-syndrome are {{characterized}} by bilateral radius aplasia and thrombocytopenia. Several case reports describe an amelioration of thrombocytopenia and bleeding tendency during {{the first years of}} life. In one patient with TAR-syndrome the thrombopoietin (TPO) -dependent tyrosine kinase JAK 2 is not phosphorylated in platelets. Recently, our group described a microdeletion on chromosome 1 q 21. 1 present in all patients analyzed so far. In 75 % of cases the microdeletion was inherited by one unaffected parent referred to as carriers. In this thesis I report on several new findings: 1 : Only about half of the xx patients in our cohort had a documented increase in platelets over the first years of life. In general, all adult patients had sub-normal platelet counts without reaching the lower reference value. This amelioration was independent of sex, age of patients or the pattern of inheritance of the microdeletion. 2 : Analysis of the TPO-dependent JAK-STAT-pathway in platelets of patients with TAR-syndrome revealed two different patterns of phosphorylation: in five pediatric patients we found absent Jak 2 -phosphorylation while five adult patients showed an <b>inconspicious</b> pattern of activation. 3 : Patients with defective JAK 2 -phosphorylation also had a decreased level of phosphorylation of Jak 2 substrates including Tyk 2, STAT 1, STAT 3, and STAT 5. In adult patients the phosphorylation of these proteins was normal. 4. The mere presence of the microdeletion is not sufficient to cause thrombcytopenia as in platelets of four carriers TPO-dependent activation of the JAK-STAT-pathway comparable to controls. 5 : Hemizigous expression of HFE 2 gene, an important regulator of iron metabolism, had no influence on red blood cell parameters (MCV, MCHC etc.). HFE 2 is thus an unlikely candidate for anemia found in some patients with TAR-syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Between 1997 and 2002 seventy-six satin type {{guinea pigs}} {{suspected}} to have fibrous osteodystrophy were {{presented at the}} Clinic for Small Domestic Animals, Freie Universität Berlin. 15 out of 76 satin guinea pigs were examined pathologically. In the present study 52 satin type guinea pigs (sasa; 25 &# 9792;, 27 &# 9794;) were analysed statistically. Two control groups out of healthy, non-satin, normal guinea pigs were established, one to compare radiological results (n = 25) and one to compare blood chemistry and blood count values (n = 36). In addition, seven carriers of the satin gene (sa-, normal fur; 6 &# 9792;, 1 &# 9794;) were examined. Twenty out of fifty-two satin type guinea pigs were established to be clinically sick, in the other 32 there were no pathological findings. Fifteen animals had lost weight, ten animals had not eaten and had wet fur around their mouths. Four animals were dehydrated {{and the state of}} the teeth in three had deteriorated. Two others had grown elongated cheek teeth and twelve guinea pigs had misshapen mandibles. Fifteen satin type guinea pigs were reluctant to walk, four had painful knees and a painful hip, two had crooked backs. Twelve guinea pigs were weak and apathetic. Fibrous osteodystrophy was diagnosed in eleven out of fifteen guinea pigs by pathological examination. One out of seven carriers had vaginal discharge, the others were healthy. A radiographic scoring out of nine parameters was developed. Alterations in the course of fibrous osteodystrophy were assessed at the os parietale, os frontale, ramus mandibulae, arcus zygomaticus, vertebrae lumbales, articulatio coxae, os femoris, os tibiae and the articulatio genus. Between 9 and 27 points were possible. Less than and equal to 13 points were defined as being without pathological findings, more than 13 points as pathologic. None of the control group and none of the carriers got more than 13 points. Scoring 52 satin guinea pigs showed that the younger animals (&# 8804; 25 months) reached less points than the older animals (> 25 months; p < 0. 05; U-test). Sick animals reached more points than those without pathological findings (p < 0. 05). Sex was nonsignificant. We found osteopenia in the os mandibulae, arcus zygomaticus, os femoris and os tibiae, vertebrae lumbales and in the pelvic bone as well as osteosclerosis in bones like the os parietale, os frontale, vertebrae lumbales and in long bones. Satin type guinea pigs were hypocalcemic in comparison to control animals (p 13 points) had a higher alkaline phosphatase level than those without radiological changes. Creatinine in sick satin guinea pigs was higher than in animals that showed no clinical signs of disease (p < 0. 05; U-Test). Carriers and controls had higher levels of creatinine than healthy satin type guinea pigs (p < 0. 05). Clinicially <b>inconspicious</b> satin guinea pigs had less platelets than controls (p < 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences in}} sex within all parameters. Fibrous osteodystrophy caused by secondary hyperparathyroidism was diagnosed in sick satin type guinea pigs. The cause of the disease is unknown. We suggest a genetic disorder. This should be clarified in further studies...|$|E
40|$|As {{one of only}} a few german-speaking {{contemporary}} authors W. G. Sebald {{managed to}} become popular abroad. There are several reasons for this popularity. First, there’s the aesthetic quality of his writings. But it’s his thoughts on the Holocaust and its consequences that earned him a huge readership especially in England and in the USA. This thesis is dedicated {{to one of the most}} compelling aspects of his work: it’s intermediality. Writing on images is a widely used element in literature, writing around images is probably a phenomenon less common. In Sebald’s case images are not only the subject of ekphrasis or triggering actions within the fictional world but they’re being reproduced instead and integrated as material objects. They thus appear as pictorial signs right next to the verbal. As a result, Sebald’s texts are to be seen as iconotexts in which the verbal and the visual are standing side by side with equal rights and contributing equally to the meaning of the combination. The fact that images play a special role for Sebald is also proven by the fact that they’re a crucial element of his working method of bricolage. He uses photographs taken from family albums as well as found photographs or photographs taken by himself and writes his texts towards these pictures and away from them. Thus the images aren’t a late addition to an already finished verbal text but they’re an essential part of the combination of both the verbal and the visual that cannot be left out without consequences. Unsurprisingly intermediality has become one of the core areas of Sebald research. Next to only a few systematizing approaches most studies focus on single and in certain respects characteristic combinations of image and text, mostly from The Emigrants, The Rings of Saturn or Austerlitz. Vertigo, although Sebald’s first real iconotext, hasn't been analyzed from this perspective as much as the other texts. It differs from the later works by a more heterogeneous choice of topics, a more variable choice of image types integrated into the text, and finally a more playful way of working with the image material at hand. While later works tend to use photographs as main image source Vertigo also contains reproductions of paintings, newspaper articles, atlases, train tickets, maps, historical ads and a lot more. Research on intermediality in Sebald has a shortcoming in that it up until a short while ago rarely studied in detail the images themselves. Much too long questions on the actual arrangement of the images and their positioning within the layout were ignored. A further issue is the focus on analyzing characteristic combinations of image and text. This way it could be shown how flexible Sebald’s use of images is but as a result and disadvantage researchers tend to study the same images over and over again that have a central function in the text and seem to be promising and fruitful when interpreted. Additionally, as far as photographs are concerned with only a few exceptions only classical theories of photography like Roland Barthes’ idea of photography as an index that has a close connection to the subject of memory were used for analysis – although there’s a wider variety of theories and topics that are open for use. This thesis therefore analyzes the complete image material used in Vertigo. The aim is not to come up with any groundbreaking new findings on Sebald’s general tendencies of using images. But this work will show in much more detail how also <b>inconspicious</b> and usually ignored images not least through their individual quality and arrangement contribute essentially to the creation of meaning of the iconotext. Next to the qualities of the images themselves the connections of images and text will be thoroughly examined. It’s a result of the strongly intertextual and intermedial nature of Sebald’s writing that again and again connections will be drawn to text passages far away from the actual context of the image in discussion and to other works by Sebald and other authors. It’s a characteristic of Vertigo that it’s various editions differ from each other in terms of image quality and especially image arrangement. As a consequence the combinations of image and text offer different options for interpretation and have different aesthetic qualities. This is true not only of the translations that contain inevitable differences but also of the German editions...|$|E
