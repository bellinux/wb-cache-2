5|$|The ears {{have been}} ornamented with jewelry for {{thousands}} of years, traditionally by piercing of the <b>earlobe.</b> In ancient and modern cultures, ornaments have been placed to stretch and enlarge the earlobes, allowing for larger plugs to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe. Tearing of the <b>earlobe</b> from the weight of heavy earrings, or from traumatic pull of an earring (for example, by snagging on a sweater), is fairly common.|$|E
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of {{a single piece of}} elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface. A tubercle, known as Darwin's tubercle, is sometimes present, lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear-tip of mammals. The <b>earlobe</b> {{consists of}} areola and adipose tissue. The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound. The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival-times and intensities from each ear, in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 people in England {{over the age}} of 16 found that {{approximately}} 10% (1,049) had body piercings in sites other than the <b>earlobe,</b> with a heavy representation of women aged 16–24 (46.2% piercing in that demographic). Among the most common body sites, the navel was top at 33%, with the nose and ear (other than lobe) following at 19% and 13%. The tongue and nipple tied at 9%. The eyebrow, lip and genitals were 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Preference among women followed closely on that ranking, though eyebrow piercings were more common than nipple piercings. Among male responders, the order was significantly different, descending in popularity from nipple, eyebrow, ear, tongue, nose, lip and genitals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Earlobes</b> {{average about}} 2 centimeters long, and {{elongate}} slightly with age. [...] Although the [...] "free" [...] vs. [...] "attached" [...] appearance of <b>earlobes</b> is often presented {{as an example}} of a simple [...] "one gene - two alleles" [...] Mendelian trait in humans, <b>earlobes</b> do not all fall neatly into either category; there is a continuous range from one extreme to the other, suggesting the influence of several genes.|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and <b>earlobe.</b> The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method for}} {{piercing}} ears, first made {{popular in the}} 1960s, {{was the use of}} sharpened spring-loaded earrings known as self-piercers, trainers, or sleepers, which gradually pushed through the <b>earlobe.</b> However, these could slip from their initial placement position, often resulting in more discomfort, and many times would not go {{all the way through the}} <b>earlobe</b> without additional pressure being applied. This method has fallen into disuse due to the popularity of faster and more successful piercing techniques.|$|E
25|$|Dangle {{earrings}} {{are designed}} to flow from the bottoms of the earlobes, and are available in various lengths from a centimeter or two, {{all the way to}} brushing the shoulders. They are generally attached to the ear by the use of thin wires, which go through the <b>earlobe</b> and connect to themselves in a small hook at the back. A variation is the French hook design, which merely hangs from the <b>earlobe</b> without closure, although small plastic retainers are sometimes used on ends of French hooks. Rarely, dangle earrings use the post attachment design.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the <b>earlobe</b> with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the <b>earlobe,</b> with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the <b>earlobe</b> to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the <b>earlobe,</b> until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|E

25|$|Multiple piercings {{in one or}} {{both ears}} first emerged in {{mainstream}} America in the 1970s. Initially, the trend was for women to wear {{a second set of}} earrings in the earlobes, or for men to double-pierce a single <b>earlobe.</b> Asymmetric styles with more and more piercings became popular, eventually leading to the cartilage piercing trend.|$|E
25|$|An earring is a {{piece of}} {{jewellery}} attached to the ear via a piercing in the <b>earlobe</b> or another external part of the ear (except in the case of clip earrings, which clip onto the lobe). Earrings are worn by both sexes, although more common among women, and have been used by different civilizations in different times.|$|E

25|$|A drop earring {{attaches}} to the <b>earlobe</b> and features a gemstone or ornament that dangles down from a chain, hoop, or similar object. The length of these ornaments vary from the very short to the extravagantly long. Such earrings are occasionally known as droplet earrings, dangle earrings, or pendant earrings. They also include chandelier earrings, which branch out into elaborate, multi-level pendants.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, ear {{piercing}} was common among women, thus creating a broader {{market for the}} procedure. Department stores throughout the country would hold ear piercing events, sponsored by earring manufacturers. At these events, a nurse or other trained person would perform the procedure, either pushing a sharpened and sterilized starter earring through the <b>earlobe</b> by hand, or using an ear-piercing instrument modified from the design used by physicians.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{specialized}} cartilage piercings have since become popular. These include the tragus piercing, antitragus piercing, rook piercing, industrial piercing, helix piercing, orbital piercing, daith piercing, and conch piercing. In addition, <b>earlobe</b> stretching, while common in indigenous cultures {{for thousands of}} years, {{began to appear in}} Western society in the 1990s, and is now a fairly common sight. However, these forms of ear piercing are still infrequent compared to standard ear piercing.|$|E

500|$|La Venta Monument2 {{measures}} [...] high by [...] wide by [...] deep; {{the head}} weighs 11.8 tons. The face has a broadly smiling expression that reveals {{four of the}} upper teeth. The cheeks are given prominence {{by the action of}} smiling; the brow that is normally visible in other heads is covered by the rim of the headdress. The face is badly eroded, distorting the features. In addition to the severe erosion damage, the upper lip and a part of the nose have been deliberately mutilated. The head was found in its original context a few metres north of the northwest corner of pyramid-platform A-2. Radiocarbon dating of the monument's context dates it to between 1000 and 600BC. Monument2 has suffered erosion damage from its exposure to the elements prior to discovery. The head has a prominent headdress but this is badly eroded and any individual detail has been erased. A strap descends in front of the ear {{on each side of the}} head, descending as far as the <b>earlobe.</b> The head is adorned with ear ornaments in the form of a disc that covers the <b>earlobe,</b> with an associated clip or peg. The surviving details of the headdress and earflares are stylistically similar to those of Tres Zapotes MonumentA. The head has been moved to the Museo del Estado de Tabasco in Villahermosa.|$|E
