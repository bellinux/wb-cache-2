5|$|By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was {{dwarfed by the}} dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that {{would be involved in}} direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E

Fearing a Khánh comeback, the AFC met again and {{unanimously}} resolved to make contingency plans to repel any counter-insurrection by Khánh. Westmoreland sent Colonel Wilson, Khánh's former confidant, {{to go to the}} military airport at Đà Lạt to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. Khánh finally agreed to leave if he was given a dignified send-off, so the other generals arranged a ceremony at Tan Son Nhut, where military bands serenaded him. He theatrically bent down and picked up some loose dirt before putting it in his pocket, saying that he was taking his beloved homeland with him. His enemies, the remaining Vietnamese officers and Taylor, all met him at the airport. He then left as Ambassador-at-Large, and was sent on a world tour, starting with a report at the United Nations in New York City.|$|E
25|$|At the {{pay-per-view}} on September 17, Steen interrupted a {{match between}} El Generico and Jimmy Jacobs {{and called out}} Steve Corino, {{who was at the}} time wrestling in Japan, before powerbombing Jacobs on the ring apron. Steen was then confronted by Jim Cornette and ROH president Cary Silkin, whom he tried to Package Piledrive, before being ushered out of the arena by the security. On the November 5 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Steen reappeared with Ohio Valley Wrestling talent Christian Mascagni as his legal adviser, threatening Jim Cornette and Ring of Honor with legal action unless he was reinstated within three weeks. On the December 3 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Steen was granted a match with Steve Corino at Final Battle 2011, with his ROH future on the line. At the event, Steen defeated Corino, thus granting back his career in ROH. Afterwards, he delivered a package piledriver to Jimmy Jacobs, before putting El Generico through a table with the same maneuver. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> he confronted Davey Richards and promised to become the ROH World Champion in 2012. On March 4, 2012, at the 10th Anniversary Show, Steen defeated Jimmy Jacobs in a No Holds Barred match and ended the pay-per-view by having another confrontation with Davey Richards. Steen continued his win streak during the Showdown in the Sun weekend, first defeating El Generico, with help from Jimmy Jacobs, in a Last Man Standing match on March 30 and then Eddie Edwards in a singles match on March 31. On May 12 at Border Wars, Steen defeated Davey Richards to win the ROH World Championship for the first time, making him the first Canadian to hold the championship.|$|E

50|$|As <b>the</b> {{initiator}} <b>of</b> covenants, YHWH {{is depicted}} as providing all the necessary conditions for a covenant to occur. Moreover, YHWH is not only maker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covenant; he is also <b>the</b> keeper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covenant. His keeping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covenant, specifically the unconditional covenant was not contingent upon the people keeping their <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bargain. <b>Even</b> when <b>the</b> people break conditional covenants, YHWH executes a plan {{to bring them back}} into the covenant.|$|R
500|$|It was {{arranged}} that Bennet Langton, a Lincolnshire landowner and mutual acquaintance of Wilberforce and Clarkson, would organize {{a dinner party}} in order to ask Wilberforce formally to lead the parliamentary campaign.

[...] Pam sends a text message to Jim, who does not answer because he is passed out on his desk. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> Michael mistakenly thinks that he and Pam have a connection, and is rejected {{when he tries to}} kiss her. She gives him a ride home on the condition that he sit in the back seat. Jim tries to bicycle home but is too drunk and an amused Karen gives Jim a ride.|$|E

Gielgud's other roles in this season were Lord Trinket in The Jealous Wife, Richard II again, Antony in Antony and Cleopatra, Malvolio in Twelfth Night, Sergius in Arms and the Man, Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing – another role for which he became celebrated – and he concluded the season as King Lear. His performance divided opinion. The Times commented, [...] "It is a mountain of a part, and at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> the peak remains unscaled"; in The Manchester Guardian, however, Brown wrote that Gielgud [...] "is a match for the thunder, and at length takes the Dover road with a broken tranquillity that allowed every word of the King's agony to be clear as well as poignant." ...|$|E
50|$|In response, a French column {{proceeding}} from Gabon {{and led by}} Émile Gentil, {{supported by}} the steamboat Leon Blot, confronted Rabih at Kouno at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year. <b>Even</b> if <b>the</b> French were repulsed with losses, this did not prevent them from continuing and taking Kousséri. Here, they combined with the Lamy column, which had arrived from Algeria, and the Joalland-Meynier column, which had marched from Niger. Lamy assumed command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combined forces.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{the fourth}} movement, Canario, brings in music that Sanz wrote in <b>the</b> style <b>of</b> a folk dance {{originating}} in the Canary Islands. Rodrigo pays homage to the music's origins by imitating a bird call toward <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement <b>even</b> though <b>the</b> Canary Islands were so named because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wild dogs prevalent there (canis) and not because <b>of</b> birds (canaries). <b>The</b> movement was covered by Emerson, Lake & Palmer for their 1978 album Love Beach.|$|R
50|$|Each village {{focuses on}} {{immersion}} {{in both the}} language and <b>the</b> culture(s) <b>of</b> its target.

500|$|By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> Khánh was in Da Lat {{when his}} plane {{ran out of}} fuel, and no pumps were open at the time, so he was marooned there for the night. He phoned Saigon asking for re-supply, but his rivals denied his wish. Fearing a Khánh comeback, the Armed Force Council met again and {{unanimously}} resolved to make contingency plans to repel any counter-insurrection by Khánh. Westmoreland sent Colonel Jasper Wilson, Khánh's former confidant and adviser at corps level, to go to Da Lat to convince the Vietnamese general to resign and allow a new military leadership to take the reins. A year earlier, Wilson had helped Khánh depose Minh. Khánh initially refused to depart, calling the coup an American initiative and saying if he capitulated now, it would simply prove that the Americans were involved, as Wilson {{had been sent to}} tell him to leave.|$|E
500|$|Possibly {{because of}} its size, The Sirens and Ulysses failed to sell at the 1837 Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 wealthy Manchester cotton {{merchant}} Daniel Grant, an admirer of Etty who had already commissioned Venus and her Doves from him, met Etty at Heaton Park races and offered to buy The Sirens and Ulysses and Etty's smaller Samson Betrayed by Delilah unseen {{for a total of}} £200. Etty was hoping for £400 for the two paintings, but on being told by Grant that his firm had lost £100,000 that year offered a price of £300 for the pair. Grant counter-offered £250 (about £ in today's terms), which Etty refused. On leaving at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> Grant suddenly said, [...] "Will you take the money?", startling Etty, who in his surprise agreed. Grant died shortly afterwards, leaving the painting to his brother William, who in turn gave it to the Royal Manchester Institution in 1839.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, 50 {{years after}} the premiere, Monteux (then aged 88) agreed to conduct a {{commemorative}} performance at London's Royal Albert Hall. According to Isaiah Berlin, {{a close friend of}} the composer, Stravinsky informed him that {{he had no intention of}} hearing his music being [...] "murdered by that frightful butcher". Instead he arranged tickets for that particular evening's performance of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro, at Covent Garden. Under pressure from his friends, Stravinsky was persuaded to leave the opera after the first act. He arrived at the Albert Hall just as the performance of The Rite was ending; composer and conductor shared a warm embrace in front of the unaware, wildly cheering audience. Monteux's biographer John Canarina provides a different slant on this occasion, recording that by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> Stravinsky had asserted that [...] "Monteux, almost alone among conductors, never cheapened Rite or looked for his own glory in it, and he continued to play it all his life with the greatest fidelity".|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Paul Martin's Liberals {{hoped to}} {{recapture}} their majority, and this appeared likely {{at one point}} during the campaign; but it would have required holding back Bloc pressure in Quebec plus picking up some new seats there while also gaining seats in English Canada, most likely in rural Ontario and southwestern British Columbia. Towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign, <b>even</b> high-profile Liberals were beginning to concede defeat, and the best the Liberals could have achieved was a razor-thin minority.|$|R
50|$|Attachment {{occurs when}} the {{bacteria}} and the phage particles come in contact. This actually happens when the attachment site found on the viral surface attaches to the complementary receptor site on the bacteria. Attachment is supported by weak chemical bonds between the attachment and the receptor site. Also, the fibers at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> T <b>even</b> bacteriophage tail {{plays a role in}} the attachment site. Therefore, there must be specific receptor attachment as the receptor determines the host preference.|$|R
