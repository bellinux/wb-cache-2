40|$|The {{ability of}} tree species {{to cope with}} {{anticipated}} decrease in water availability is still poorly understood. We evaluated the potential of Norway spruce, Scots pine, European larch, black pine, and Douglas-fir to withstand drought in a drier future climate by analyzing their past growth and physiological responses at a xeric and a mesic site in Central Europe using dendroecological methods. Earlywood, latewood, and total ring width, {{as well as the}} d 13 C and d 18 O in early- and latewood were measured and statistically related to a multiscalar soil water deficit index from 1961 to 2009. At the xeric site, d 13 C values of all species were strongly linked to water deficits that lasted longer than 11 months, indicating a long-term cumulative effect on the carbon pool. Trees at the xeric site were particularly sensitive to soil water recharge in the preceding autumn and early spring. The native species European larch and Norway spruce, growing close to their <b>dry</b> <b>distribution</b> limit at the xeric site, were found to be the most vulnerable species to soil water deficits. At the mesic site, summer water availability was critical for all species, whereas water availability prior to the growing season was less important. Trees at the mesic were more vulnerable to water deficits of shorter duration than the xeric site. We conclude that if summers become drier, trees growing on mesic sites will undergo significant growth reductions, whereas at their <b>dry</b> <b>distribution</b> limit in the Alps, tree growth of the highly sensitive spruce and larch may collapse, likely inducing dieback and compromising the provision of ecosystem services. However, the magnitude of these changes will be mediated strongly by soil water recharge in winter and thus water availability {{at the beginning of the}} growing season...|$|E

40|$|A {{model to}} {{simulate}} dynamically the <b>distribution</b> of <b>dry</b> matter between leaves, stem, roots and individual cucumber fruits or tomato clusters of fruits is described. The simulated <b>dry</b> matter <b>distribution</b> is {{regulated by the}} sink strengths of the plant organs. These sink strengths can be quantified by their potential growth rates, i. e. the growth rates under conditions of non-limiting assimilate supply. Potential dry weight and time from flowering until harvest of tomato clusters of fruits decreased with increasing temperature (17, 21 or 25 °C). However, the relation between sink strength (potential growth rate) and developmental stage of a cluster (time after flowering / time from flowering until harvest) appeared to be almost independent on temperature. In the model the sink strengths of leaves, stem and roots were assumed to be constant.

40|$|Current {{practices}} in many nurseries involve the germination of tropical rainforest seedlings in shaded conditions and transferral, {{at a later}} date, to environments with greater light intensities. Determination of the ability of these seedlings to acclimate to increased light intensities will allow seedling stock to be processed with maximum efficiency within the nursery. The acclimation abilities of three species, Agyrodendron actinophyllum, Cardwellia sublimis, and Flindersia brayleyana, commonly found in north Queensland's rainforests were investigated in this study. These particular species are highly valued for their cabinet timber qualities and are being reared in nurseries for use in reforestation trials and programs in north Queensland. Seedlings were initially raised in greenhouse conditions under two layers of shade cloth (16 % of full sunlight) and then transferred into full sunlight at three different ages (3 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks). Upon transfer, organ ratios and the direction of <b>dry</b> matter <b>distribution</b> was determined for each species and age group. Approximately 3 months after the seedlings were transferred, the acclimation ability of each species and age group was then determined. <b>Dry</b> matter <b>distribution</b> was found to change with age, irrespective of light environment. Individuals within a species with larger root systems and thicker or more dense leaves had a greater acclimation ability than those with smaller root systems and thinner or less dense leaves. Furthermore, individuals within a species whose <b>dry</b> matter <b>distribution</b> upon transfer was directed towards developing a large root system, and a small photosynthetic area and mass, had a greater acclimation ability than those whose <b>dry</b> matter <b>distribution</b> was directed away from such morphologies. Awareness of these relationships allows {{a better understanding of}} seedling response to gap formation in natural forests, and also allows plant nursery operators to make a more informed decision about when to move seedlings to environments with a higher light intensity...|$|R
50|$|Foraging {{locations}} in the <b>drier</b> <b>distribution</b> areas appear to depend on nearness to water points and roosting sites (Williams & Dickman 2004, p. 213). In arid areas inland broad-nosed bats possibly obtain water from the insects eaten and further conserve water by producing concentrated urine in specialized kidneys (Williams & Dickman 2004, p. 205). In semi-arid areas foraging is concentrated around water sources with drinking occurring during flight (Reardon & Flavel 1991, p. 72). Similar to other arid zone mammals it is likely, especially in southern distribution areas, that the inland broad-nosed bat is able to enter into prolonged periods of torpor, reducing energy and water requirements (Geiser 2004, p. 130). Another arid and semi-arid adaption {{is the ability to}} tolerate high body temperatures (Bondarenco, Körtner & Geiser 2014, p. 684).|$|R

40|$|Sucrose solution, as an {{artificial}} photosynthetic-source, was injected into two sweet potato cultivars, Koganesengan (KOG, an early production type） and Minamiyutaka （MYK, a late production type), {{to investigate the}} cultivaral difference in the sucrose injection effect on root growth and the activity of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase （AGPase） in tuberous roots. The sucrose injection applied on the 35 th day after rooting was highestly effective in increasing the productivity and AGPase activity of tuberous roots in KOG. This time corresponded to the growth stage at which the ratio of <b>dry</b> matter <b>distribution</b> to stems began to drop. By this treatment, the tuberous root of KOG doubled in weight and the activity of AGPase was 25 % higher compared to those of the. control plant.

Low aggregation and homogeneous distribution maximize particle surface area, promoting mineralization, cell–particle interactions, and homogenous tissue regeneration. Hence, determination of the size and distribution of particles/particle agglomerates in the hydrogel is desirable. Commonly used techniques have drawbacks.

40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} of low voltage, <b>dry</b> type, <b>distribution</b> transformers is influenced {{primarily by the}} imposition of {{energy efficiency}} regulations and by the operational conditions imposed on the transformers. This study, in part, examines the energy efficiency regulations that govern the measurement and specification of energy efficiency for low voltage, <b>dry</b> type, <b>distribution</b> transformers and evaluates whether the requirement used to certify the transformer efficiency is optimized for minimizing power loss. In the U. S., regulations are mandated for transformer efficiency.

This study also attempts to characterize the operational load levels experienced by these transformers, including seasonal and daily load variations, and relates the operational load levels to the efficiency standard and alternate methods. The study also demonstrates the importance of considering transformers and distribution networks as part of a system when evaluating the implementation of other energy efficiency improvements, and how it impacts the optimization of power consumption within commercial facilities. Recommendations are presented for improving transformer rulemakings and for system considerations to realize higher energy savings in commercial and industrial facilities. ...|$|R

The distribution of Aedes vectors was influenced seasonally by breeding outdoors rather than indoors in all 4 containers. Accordingly, both urban and rural settings elicited significantly seasonal (wet versus <b>dry)</b> <b>distributions</b> of Ae. aegypti larvae observed in water storage containers (P= 0. 001 and P= 0. 002) and natural containers (P= 0. 016 and P= 0. 015), whereas, in rural setting, the significant difference was observed in discarded receptacles (P= 0. 028) and miscellaneous containers (P< 0. 001). Seasonal distribution of Ae. albopictus larvae in any containers in urban setting was not remarkably noticed, whereas, in rural setting, the significant difference was observed in water storage containers (P= 0. 007) and discarded receptacles (P< 0. 001). Moreover, the distributions of percentages of container index for Aedes-infested households in dry season were significantly lower than that in other wet seasons, P= 0. 034 for urban setting and P= 0. 001 for rural setting.

Eastern Inner Mongolia, China, located in the interface region of different biomes and ecogeographic zones, has experienced dramatic drying and warming over the past several decades. In this study, the annual accumulated temperature above 10 A degrees C (AAT 10) and the aridity index, two key indicators in geographical regionalization, are used to assess warming and drying processes and track the movements of temperature and aridity zones from 1960 to 2008. The results show a significant warming at the regional level from 1960 to 2008 with an AAT 10 increase rate of 7. 89 A degrees C center dot d/year (p < 0. 001) in Eastern Inner Mongolia, while the drying trend was not significant during this period. Spatial heterogeneity of warming and <b>drying</b> <b>distributions</b> was also evident. Analysis of warming and drying via piecewise regression revealed two separate, specific trends between the first 31 years (1960 - 1990) and the subsequent 18 years (1991 - 2008). Generally, mild warming and very slight wetting occurred prior to 1990, while after 1991 both warming and drying were significant and enhanced. Continuous warming drove a northward shift of temperature zones from the 1960 s to 2000 s, while aridity zones displayed enhanced temporal and spatial variability.
