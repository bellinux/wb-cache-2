50|$|Nicknamed Tricera (Torikera), the Bakuryū Triceratops (Bakuryū Torikeratopusu) is Abare Blue's partner, armored Bakuryū. He {{can take}} {{considerable}} punishment from an opponent, and seems {{strong enough to}} topple every building in downtown Tokyo. Tricera is {{the youngest of the}} three Bakuryū, and his voice is that of a pre-teenager. In episode 36, wanting to be human, he becomes a little boy named <b>Kerato</b> (ケラト). The transformation is later revealed to be caused by an angel (to God's dismay). Although Tricera {{falls in love with a}} woman he sacrifices his human life, returning to his normal form to protect Yukito; in the finale, he thanks Yukito for everything. He forms AbarenOh's right arm, shield and Double-Tail Sword handle. Tricera is voiced by Kōki Miyata (Miyata Kōki), and played as <b>Kerato</b> by Ryunosuke Kamiki (Kamiki Ryūnosuke).|$|E

In the pres ent study, cytokeratin 10 ex pres sion and pro lif er a tion rate as measured by Ki- 67 ex pres sion were com pared be tween 50 clin i cally and histologically di ag nosed keratoacanthomas and 50 squamous cell car ci no mas. Tis sue sec tions from the skin were immunohistochemically stained with anti-cytokeratin 10 and anti-Ki- 67 monoclonal antibodies. The distribution of cytokeratin 10 ex pres sion and proliferative cell count were analyzed. Study results showed higher cytokeratin 10 expression in <b>kerato</b> acanthomas than in squamous cell car cinomas and different distribution of staining in the two entities. The analysis of cytokeratin 10 ex pression showed a much wider range of values and statistically higher median (p 0. 001) in <b>kerato</b> acanthomas than in squamous cell carcinomas. Additionally, the prolifer ation index of keratinocytes as mea sured by Ki- 67 ex pres sion was significantly higher in squamous cell carcinomas than in keratoacanthomas (p 0. 01). These re sults may prove help ful in histologic differentiation of these disorders...|$|E

The main features of impression cytology were squamous metaplasia of epithelial cells and altered goblet cell density. The comparison between conjunctival biopsy findings and impression cytology confirm that impression cytology provides the same information as that of biopsy. Hence, the authors advocate that this non-invasive simple technique can replace conjunctival biopsy in confirmation of diagnosis in dry eye syndrome...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Data mining {{refers to}} extracting {{knowledge}} from {{large amount of}} data. Real life data mining approaches are interesting because they often present {{a different set of}} problems for data miners. The process of designing a model helps to identify the different Cataract Diseases. A cataract can cause a decrease in visual function, which in turn can be classified as a visual disability. Thus, cataract can be defined in three ways. The first definition is an objective lens change. The second is a lens opacity that is associated with a defined level of visual acuity loss. The third relates to the functional consequences of lens opacification. This guideline focuses on the last definition. It deals with care of the patient with functional impairment due to cataract and improvement in function as a result of treatment for the condition. Taking into account the prevalence of cataract among men and women the study is aimed at finding out the characteristics that determine the presence of cataract and to track the maximum number of men and women suffering from cataract with 790 population using weka tool. In this paper the data classification is cataract patients data set is developed by collecting data from hospital repository consists of 790 instances with 11 different attributes. The instances in the Dataset are pertaining to the categories of <b>Kerato</b> meter reading (RE), <b>Kerato</b> meter reading (LE), Axil Length(RE), Axil Length(LE), Power(RE), Power(LE), Cataract Disease. WEKA tool is used to classify the data and the data is evaluated using 10 -fold cross validation and the results are compared...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, 3 {{cases with}} manifestations of basal cell nevus {{syndrome}} in one Japanese Family are described. In {{the cases of}} an 8 -year-old female, a 12 -year-old female and a 40 -year old male, idential symptoms such as multiple odontogenic jaw (<b>kerato)</b> cyst, ocular hypertelorisms, a broadnasal root, frontal and temporoparietal bossing, and palmarplanter pits were presented. On the other hand, symptoms such as mandibular prognathism, bifid ribs, intracranial calcification in the falx, shizophrenia, bridging of sella turcica, kyphoscoliosis, and squint, were not necessarilly presented in all cases. Family histories suggest a dominant pattern of inheritance with penetrance and variable expressivity. Histopathological diagnosis of multiple jaw cysts was odontogenic keratocyst in all cases. All cysts were enucleated. No recurrence of cyst has been seen, but long-term follow up is necessary. 個人の特定が出来ると思われる写真が掲載されているため本文PDFの登録はな...|$|E
40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intraocular {{bacteria}} causing trachoma, {{adult and}} neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis, {{was the leading}} cause of blindness in the last century worldwide. Improvement in socioeconomic and living conditions, availability of antibiotics, and introduction of National Trachoma Control Programmes reduced the prevalence in developed countries, but it persisted in resource-poor settings of Africa and Asia, including India. In 2016, as per the WHO report, trachoma is restricted to 42 countries, causing blindness/visual impairment in ~ 1. 9 million people. India is one of the five countries with nearly half of total active trachoma patients. Introduction of Global Elimination of Trachoma 2020 program by the WHO, using SAFE strategy (surgery for trachomatous trichiasis; Antibiotics for C. trachomatis; Facial cleanliness; and environmental improvement) greatly reduced the prevalence, but trachoma still persists in India. Global increase in the reproductive tract infection by C. trachomatis urogenital serotypes (D-K) has led to concurrent increase in C. trachomatis eye infections. Therefore, <b>kerato</b> eye infections due to chlamydial infections continue to be seen in hospitals. Over the years, there have been advances in laboratory diagnostics, in understanding the pathogenesis, tissue tropism, C. trachomatis genomics, and treatment modalities. Due attention and research is still needed for the study of C. trachomatis eye infections...|$|E

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) for AK with 5 - aminolevulinic acid (ALA) or methyl aminolevulinate (Methyl- ALA) is an accepted treatment option for this disease, due to its effectiveness and excellent cosmetic results. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the pain reported by the patients during the treatment of PDT using the medicine Methyl- ALA and ALA a 15 %. AK 40 patients were selected for the upper limbs, the division performed and two groups of 20 patients, the drug administered group I and group II ALA administered -ALA methyl, then the remaining members were occluded for 3 hours, after curative was removed and held the lighting in the area for 40 minutes with a fluence of 36 J / em 2, the prototype <b>Kerato</b> PDT -based LED emitters. During the lighting and every 5 minutes a numerical visual scale (NVS) was applied to measure referred pain. The lesions were imaged and quantified before and 30 days after treatment. Data were statistically analyzed by Student's paired t-test, Friedman test and Tukey 's t testo The results showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups, and that both drugs used were effective in the treatment of AKs. Comparing the pain reported by the patients during treatment, there was no statistical difference between the female and the male, nor between the two groups, although for males the pain scale was statistically higher when used Methyl- ALA. We conclude that both drugs may be indicated for the treatment of AKs scattered in the upper limb, and more studies focused [...] . O câncer de pele é o tipo mais frequente de câncer no Brasil, correspondendo a 25 % de todos os cânceres registrados no País. Queratoses actínicas (QAs) são lesões pré-malignas comuns, com uma incidência estimada em 60 % dos pacientes com idade acima de 60 anos, as QAs podem evoluir para carcinoma espinocelular (CEC) que é um tipo de câncer de pele não melanoma agressivo, podendo ser responsável por 34 % das mortes por câncer de pele em todo mundo. A terapia fotodinâmica (TFD) em QAs com o ácido 5 - aminolevulínico (ALA) ou aminolevulinato de metila (Metil-ALA) é uma opção de tratamento aceita para esta doença, devido à sua eficácia e excelentes resultados estéticos. O objetivo deste trabalho foi Avaliar e comparar a dor referida pelos pacientes, durante o tratamento de TFD utilizando o medicamento ALA e Metil-ALA a 15 %.

40|$|Trachoma is chronic <b>kerato</b> conjunctivitis, {{which is}} caused by {{repeated}} infection with Chlamydia trachomatis bacterium. It is hyper endemic in many rural areas of Ethiopia. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the effect of water, sanitation and hygiene interventions on active trachoma in selected woredas of North and South Wollo zones of Amhara Region, Ethiopia. A community based quasi-experimental study was conducted from October 2014 to December 2015 among children aged 1 - 8 years at baseline and among one year older same children after intervention. A four-stage random cluster-sampling technique was employed to select study participants. From each selected household, one child was clinically assessed for active trachoma. Structured questionnaire was used to collect socio demographic and behavioral data. MacNemar test was applied to compare the prevalence of active trachoma between baseline and after the intervention period at both intervention and non-intervention study areas. The prevalence of active trachoma was reduced from baseline prevalence of 26 % to 18 % after one-year intervention period in the intervention woredas (P≤ 0. 001). MacNemar test result showed significant reduction of active trachoma prevalence after the intervention period in the intervention woredas compared to the non-intervention woredas (P≤ 0. 001). Water, sanitation and hygiene related activities were significantly improved after the intervention period in the intervention woredas (P< 0. 05). There was a significant reduction of active trachoma prevalence between the baseline and after the intervention period in the intervention woredas, but not in the non-intervention ones. Improved water, sanitation and hygiene interventions contributed to the reduction of active trachoma. However, the magnitude of active trachoma prevalence observed after the intervention is still very high in the studied areas of North and South Wollo Zones communities. To achieve the global trachoma elimination target by the year 2020 as set by the WHO, continued WaSH interventions and periodic monitoring, evaluation and reporting of the impact of WaSH on active trachoma is warranted...|$|E
40|$|Presented on September 17, 2013 from 4 : 30 pm- 5 : 30 pm in Klaus Classroom 1447. Bio: After {{graduating from}} Williams College (1955) and the University of Rochester School of Medicine (1960), I {{spent two years}} as a CDC Epidemic Intelligence (EIS) Officer {{assigned}} to the Indian Health Service in Arizona. In addition to my main responsibility for examining 10, 000 school children per year for trachoma (25 % were positive), I {{had the opportunity to}} investigate other health emergencies as they arose: Plague, Rabies, Measles, Shigella, Food Poisoning, <b>Kerato</b> Conjunctivitis (Philadelphia, Talequah Oklahoma, and La Paz Bolivia), Diabetes in Pima Indians, and Rotavirus in the Truck Islands in the South Pacific. In 1966, I was invited to join CDCs new Smallpox Eradication Program. Our family spent 4 years in Nigeria (1966 - 1970) and 4 years in Bangladesh (1972 - 1976) working with national health workers to eradicate smallpox. In 1977, I spent three months living with nomads in Somalia (the last smallpox epidemic country in the world). Smallpox was eradicated from the world in 1979. From 1980 to 1994, I worked with the International Health Program Office at CDC in its Combating Childhood Communicable Disease Project (CCCD). We worked with 10 African countries to improve the health and survival of children under 5 through strengthening their capacity to prevent and treat diseases. We focused on prevention (immunization, malaria chemoprophylaxis of women); case management of the three priority killers of children (malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea); communicating health behaviors, strengthening health information systems; and operations research. During this period, I taught management and policy at the emerging School of Public Health. I joined the Global Health Faculty in 1994 where I have taught GH 501 (Global Policy; Priorities, Policies, Programs; and most recently Global Health Challenges and Opportunities) in the fall; GH 572 - Community Transformation in the winter; and Evidence Based Strategic Planning (a case study of Oromia Region in Ethiopia) in the spring. On April 17, 2013 I gave my Last Lecture (50 Years of Public Health, Lessons Learned, and Visions for the Future). I am grateful to all that make up the Rollins School of Public Health and the Hubert Department of Global Health for the opportunity to partner with learners, staff, and faculty in developing the next generation of global health leaders. Runtime: 62 : 42 minutes. An estimated 2. 5 million children under five die from disease preventable by immunization. While significant progress has been made since the WHO Expanded Program of Immunization began in 1972, biomedical, biophysical, and operational research have developed new vaccines for Pneumonia, Meningitis A, rotavirus, and Human Papilloma Virus. Led by GAVI, public private partnerships are opening new channels for vaccine development, vaccine production, and program implementation for low resource countries...|$|E
