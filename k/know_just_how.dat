[...] "Once I saw their weight-load calculations, I {{knew we had to}} shut it down right away. We couldn't wait until May 29." [...] The thirteen toll booth employees were laid off. As of the closure there are $49,015 in toll tickets that have not been used. Refunds were [...] given for thirty days from the closure. The closure of the New Harmony Bridge as reported in the Evansville Courier would {{have a significant impact on}} farmers in the area and the oil industry. The bridge's closure increases the distance between New Harmony and Crossville, Illinois by about ten miles.|$|E
500|$|Lavender {{made his}} MLB debut on April23, 1912 as a relief pitcher in a 5–3 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Pirates. On June28, versus the Pirates, he threw a one-hit shutout in a 3–0win, and {{collected}} three hits as a hitter. On July1, he shutout Pittsburgh once more, this time in a 12-inning, 1–0victory. He threw his third consecutive complete game shutout on July5, a 4–0victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Lavender took a 33-inning consecutive scoreless inning streak into his next start, a home game against the New York Giants and pitcher Rube Marquard. He gave up five hits and defeated the Giants 7–2, ending Marquard's consecutive win streak at 19games, {{which at the time}} tied the record for the longest streak in baseball history. The loss appeared to affect Marquard {{for the remainder of the}} season, though he regained his form in the 1912 World Series. During the 1913season, upon the ending of an 11-game winning streak by Washington Senators pitcher Joe Boehling, Marquard commented, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> Boehling feels. I know how I felt after Lavender beat me in Chicago last year after I had won nineteen straight, and I can sympathize with the Washington youngster." [...] Lavender would have continued success against the Giants throughout his career.|$|E

2500|$|Alpha {{particles}} are tiny, positively charged particles that are spontaneously emitted by certain substances such as uranium and radium. [...] Rutherford himself had discovered them in 1899. In 1908 {{he was trying}} to precisely measure their charge-to-mass ratio. To do this, he first needed to <b>know</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> many alpha particles his sample of radium was giving off (after which he would measure their total charge and divide one by the other). [...] Alpha {{particles are}} too tiny to be seen even with a microscope, but Rutherford knew that alpha particles ionize air molecules, and if the air is within an electric field, the ions will produce an electric current. On this principle, Rutherford and Geiger designed a simple counting device which consisted of two electrodes in a glass tube. [...] Every alpha particle that passed through the tube would create a pulse of electricity that could be counted. [...] It was an early version of the Geiger counter.|$|E
2500|$|Due to a {{controversial}} article entitled [...] "Don't Wear a Poppy," [...] Yacowar was abruptly fired {{from his position}} as Editor-in-chief just five months in, receiving a 56.4% student-wide favourability rating against his dismissal. He was then succeeded by his friend Arthur, becoming the second Gauntlet Editor-in-chief. The pair would later graduate in 1962 to pursue lives in academia. Arthur who received a degree in History would later become a – now retired – Professor of History from Brock University while Yacowar, who received a degree in English, would become Emeritus Professor of English and future Dean of Humanities here in the University of Calgary. However, little did Arthur <b>know</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> powerful those 9 words would become, as the event gained increasing popularly for students to destress before exams. The BSDs of later years would feature pie duels with the University President, musical gatherings in Administration, games of squamish, and a tricycle race between SU representatives. In 1989, the University with the Student's Union introduced the BSD of modern day, with a single area which included the concert grounds and beer gardens.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{primarily}} recorded at recording studios MSR Studios NYC, Cake Studio, British Grove Studios and the Sotogrande Studios in New York, London and Spain, respectively {{over the course}} of three weeks, although sessions took place throughout 2009 and 2011, although Duffy had been recording songs she had written using her computer and iPod since the release of Rockferry, some of which remained in demo form until the final stages of the recording process. Duffy had formed a songwriting partnership with Albert Hammond for the record, which resulted in nine of the ten final songs released being written, composed and produced by Duffy and Hammond together. Aside from her partnership with Hammond, Duffy also forged collaborative efforts with other musicians who she felt reflected the sound change she was aiming for, including hip hop group The Roots. Duffy {{said in an interview that}} their involvement would be limited to [...] "a rhythm section" [...] going on to say [...] "if you know The Roots you will <b>know</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> cool [...] is. I love them and they are so cool." [...] She was also heavily involved with the recording process. The Daily Telegraph reports that often Duffy was a perfectionist regarding her songs, and that she often stayed in the studio with her mix engineer to ensure the composition sounded exactly as she wanted. This was often done without the help of Hammond, and she was quoted [...] "this is all I care about. I keep a tight rein when it comes to quality control." [...] Billboard reported in November later that year that Duffy had experimented with a new dance sound, confirming that neither Bernard Butler nor Steve Booker, who produced the bulk of Duffy's debut album, Rockferry, had returned for the record.|$|E
