50|$|Although {{the utility}} of {{incremental}} rendering seems intuitively obvious, making it happen {{is something of an}} art as well as a science. The sequence in which the various elements of a Web page render is almost never strictly top-to-bottom. The programming that fills in the missing pieces must do a certain amount of guesswork to determine how to best display partial content. Images in particular are virtually always loaded following the HTML page, as the browser must consult the HTML file in order to know which images to request from the server - as the server doesn't present them automatically without the <b>follow-up</b> <b>request.</b> Web designers and web design software often include hints that assist with this process - for example, including the expected heights and widths of images in the HTML code so the browser may allocate the correct amount of screen space before the image is actually retrieved from the server.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We report {{results from}} two statewide {{experiments}} in Wash-ington designed to test potential methods for using postal mail to obtain survey responses over the Internet from address-based samples of gen-eral public households. The five methods we test are: 1) sending Web and mail modes of response sequentially; 2) providing a prepaid $ 5 in-centive; 3) offering an instruction card for responding over the Web; 4) sending the <b>follow-up</b> <b>request</b> by Priority Mail; and 5) providing an ad-ditional $ 5 incentive with this <b>follow-up</b> <b>request.</b> Results are evaluated {{from the standpoint}} of response rates, demographic representativeness of respondents, and survey costs and data collection times for Web and mail modes. We find that a ‘‘Web-plus-mail’ ’ design—mailing an initial Web request followed by a mail request—with the prepaid incentive offers much potential for obtaining Internet responses. In addition, the mail follow-up to the initial Web request significantly increases overall response rates and improves respondent representativeness...|$|E

40|$|Integrating spatial {{information}} from multiple grid-enabled sources of geologic data {{is an important}} component of the NSF-funded Geosciences Network (GEON) project. The spatial integration is orchestrated by Geo-GEMS (Grid-Enabled Mediation Services), a collection of grid services that support spatial data mediation, ontology and schema conflict resolution, and composite map assembly. Geologic data are served by distributed ArcIMS and WMS servers, each wrapped in WSDL/SOAP wrappers. Capabilities of each source are registered at the mediator, so that the latter can plan and orchestrate query execution. To produce a composite result, query results retrieved from individual sources are either merged at the mediator or overlapped at the client. A comprehensive GEON map assembly service represents a temporary mediator-level ArcIMS service that is created on demand to merge individual raster and vector fragments from distributed servers into a composite map and generate answers to <b>follow-up</b> <b>requests</b> without re-querying the sources...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect the {{educational}} preparation curriculum had on graduates of Sam Houston State University's Educator Preparation Program as they began their professional careers. The population was drawn from all graduates receiving certification in elementary education from 1997 through spring 2000. A questionnaire was sent to 50 % of the 909 identified graduates, and 196 responded. Sam Houston State University graduates were generally pleased with their overall experience in the Educator Preparation Program. There was a strong positive perception of satisfaction from graduates of 2000, 1999, and 1997 in their overall preparedness to teach. Findings do suggest that all areas of the Educator Preparation Program need to be evaluated and reviewed on an annual basis, and the program faculty and staff should use the program's exit interviews to evaluate student perceptions of preparedness to teach. The establishment of a mentoring/outreach program is also recommended. Appendixes contain the cover letter, study questionnaire, and a <b>follow-up</b> <b>request...</b>|$|E
30|$|The final {{questionnaire}} {{was sent to}} the top executives of 3, 500 companies by mail. These managers were randomly selected from the Hoppenstedt database that comprises one of the largest databases on SMEs in Germany. One <b>follow-up</b> <b>request</b> was sent to non-respondents (Dillman 1978, 1991). Overall, 370 companies responded to the survey, which translates into a response rate of 10.5  %. The questionnaires were then analyzed for missing data and regarding the person, who ultimately answered the respective questions in the organization. As this paper analyses the decision quality of strategic decisions, it was essential to receive feedback directly from the top executives, who can best assess these factors. Thus, 100 of the responses had to be excluded from the analysis as an assistant or staff member rather than the executive completed the survey. Twenty eight further responses were excluded from the analysis to correct for outliers in company size and ensure a high degree of comparability among the firms studied. Additionally, 87 questionnaires had to be excluded due to missing data, yielding a final sample size of 155. This response rate in in line with other board-level studies that analyzed confidential issues such as decision quality or performance (Agle et al. 1999; Cruz et al. 2010; Zellweger et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|Background: Spontaneous {{reports of}} {{suspected}} adverse drug reactions to regulatory bodies and market authorization holders {{are important in}} pharmacovigilance. Follow-up information, which {{can be difficult to}} obtain, is often required from reporters; therefore, we developed targeted follow-up letters that we hoped would make replying easier. Objective: To examine the effects of introducing targeted letters on responses to follow-up requests from a regional pharmacovigilance centre in the UK. Method: In January 2001 we redesigned our <b>follow-up</b> <b>request</b> letter to include tick-boxes targeted to obtain the appropriate information from reporters. Response rates and the requirement for a second follow-up letter were examined for the 5 -year period before introduction of the targeted follow-up letter (1996 - 2000) and the 5 years after the change to the targeted follow-up system (2001 - 5). In an 18 -month sub-study examining data from 2001 - 2, time from the production of the first targeted follow-up letter to receipt of a response from reporters was also measured. Results: The introduction of targeted follow-up letters was associated with an increase in the mean annual response rate for follow-up from 36. 4 % in the 5 years pre-targeted follow-up to 60. 5 % in the 5 years post-targeted follow-up (p < 0. 0001). Fifty percent of all successful follow-up responses were obtained within 70 days. Conclusion: Targeted follow-up letters were associated with increased followup success rates. Results also indicate that closing cases to follow-up information at 70 days would allow collection of 78 % of all follow-up that would ever arrive...|$|E

Methods: Reports of exposures to human blood and body fluids from Padua university health care workers since 2004 to 2006 and compliance with the follow-up after injury according to the patients’ source were analysed. Results: The injury reports were 497. The residents in surgery and anesthesiology were significantly more injured than the others, and the compliance with follow-up was low: from 26. 3 % (hepatitis B virus) to 40 % (hepatitis C virus) with positive source, less than 30 % with a negative source, as far as 40 % with an unknown source.

40|$|Following the 2000 United States presidential {{election}} {{a team of}} faculty conducted a mail survey of donors who had contributed to any of eight presidential candidates. These included two Democrats (Bill Bradley and Al Gore), five Republicans (Gary Bauer, George Bush, Bob Dole, Steve Forbes, and John McCain), and Green candidate Ralph Nader. The sample was stratified by candidate; each candidate’s sample included approximately 300 donors sampled from public lists of donors maintained by the Federal Election Commission. Strata for Dole, Nader, and Bush were over-sampled for substantive reasons. No data was collected on modest (<$ 200) donors for the Forbes campaign as his campaign {{did not participate in}} public funding. Note that these samples were ALL drawn from individuals who gave before July 31, 2000. The ten-page survey instrument contained items designed to collect data on donor demographics, on political attributes, attitudes, and activities, on how the donors were solicited, and on how much, how often, and to whom they gave. It was sent directly to sampled donors via first class mail. Each envelope was addressed to a specific donor and included a personalized cover letter explaining the project. All letters were individually signed by hand. Business-reply return envelopes were provided with these materials. Approximately one month after the initial mailing, a <b>follow-up</b> <b>request</b> was sent to all sample members who had not returned a response. The text of the cover letter was changed to reflect a repeat request; otherwise, the contents were identical to the first mailing. One additional mailing was done for all remaining non-respondents, except those in Nader’s stratum. Participants were given the option of responding anonymously to the survey by erasing the unique identifying number written in pencil on their surveys. Eight percent of the total sample chose to respond anonymously, with the highest rates of anonymous respondents from the Bauer (11 %) and Forbes (10 %) strata, and the lowest rates of anonymous response from the Gore (5 %), McCain (6 %), and Bush (6 %) strata. The three waves were sent over the period from August to November of 2001. Following the 2004 United States {{presidential election}} the team sent slightly shorter surveys to every respondent to the 2000 survey who did not respond anonymously. 	 The six-page survey instrument contained items designed to collect data on donor demographics, on political attributes, attitudes, and activities, on how the donors were solicited, and on how much, how often, and to whom they gave. It was sent directly to sampled donors via first class mail. Each envelope was addressed to a specific donor and included a personalized cover letter explaining the project. All letters were individually signed by hand. Business-reply return envelopes were provided with these materials. Approximately {{two and a half months}} after the initial mailing, a <b>follow-up</b> <b>request</b> was sent to all sample members who had not returned a response. The text of the cover letter was changed to reflect a repeat request and to more firmly urge participation. Two additional mailing was done for all remaining non-respondents over the next four months. Participants were given the option of responding anonymously to the survey. However, color coded marks were added to envelopes so that we could identify the appropriate strata of each respondent even if their identity was not recorded. If individuals included identifying information on anonymous respondents (e. g. return addresses) we used this only to mark these respondents as having responded, but then deleted all identifying information. At any point in the process if mail was returned with a forwarding address a survey was immediately sent to the new address. However, a number of surveys were returned without forwarding addresses. In between the third and fourth waves we submitted these addresses to a commercial mailing firm that supplied new addresses using data collected by the United States Postal Service. Thereafter four “special waves” were sent (spaced approximately one month apart) to all addresses that had been located by this commercial firm. Because of anonymous responses, delays in the mail, and some human error some respondents received more than one survey even after having responded. In all cases the survey with the earliest post mark was included in the final dataset. On the cover letter respondents were encouraged to fill out the survey online.

40|$|The {{engineering}} data {{of a large}} enterprise is typically distributed over a wide area and archived {{in a variety of}} file systems and databases. Access to such information is crucial to team members and relevant processing services (applications, tools and utilities) in a concurrent engineering setting. However, this is not easy because there is no simple way to efficiently access the information without being knowledgeable about various file systems, file servers, and networks, especially when complex domain related data files get bigger. In a concurrent engineering environment, there is every {{need to be aware of}} the transparent and dynamic data perspectives of the other members of the team. We have developed a Federated Service-Oriented File Transfer Framework called FICUS (Files In Chunks Utilizing Storage) with the objective to form dynamic federations of network services that provide {{engineering data}}, applications and tools on a grid. The FICUS system stores information about files in metadata repositories and information about replicated file fragments (chunks) in tracking repositories. The content of FICUS files is persisted in byte store repositories in a split format with replicated chunks for efficient parallel access directly from multiple byte store repositories. The value of FICUS is enhanced when both users and compute service providers can readily share the content in a seamless fashion. This framework fits the SORCER philosophy of grid interactive service-oriented programming, where users create distributed metaprograms using federated providers along with FICUS repository providers. The multiple FICUS facades accept initial requests from the user and convert them into requests specific to relevant distributed repositories. The <b>follow-up</b> <b>requests</b> are then communicated from the user directly to the repositories identified by the accessed facade and the results are fetched back to the user directly. Our paper describes the methodology of how FICUS works along with the details of the implementation and extensions planned for the future.

This article experimentally examines the effect of mode preference on response, contact, and cooperation rates; mode choice; and data collection efficiency. Respondents to a 2008 telephone survey (n = 1, 811; AAPOR RR 3 = 38 percent) were asked their mode preference for future survey participation. These respondents were subsequently followed up in 2009 with two independent survey <b>requests.</b> The first <b>follow-up</b> survey <b>request</b> was another telephone survey (n = 548; AAPOR RR 2 = 55. 5 percent). In the second follow-up survey (n = 565; AAPOR RR 2 = 46. 0 percent), respondents were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four mode treatments: Web only, mail only, Web followed by mail, and mail followed by Web. We find that mode preference predicts participation in Web and phone modes, cooperation in phone mode (where contact and cooperation can be disentangled), and the selection of a mode when given the option of two modes. We find weak and mixed evidence about the relationship between mode preference and reduction of field effort. We discuss the important implications these findings have for mixed mode surveys...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{education}} {{is the cornerstone of}} the training of health professionals.   Many training institutions offer courses in clinical education.   Fifteen participants of a 20 -hour physiotherapy clinical facilitators workshop formed part of this descriptive study.   The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate their perceptions of the workshop and the impact it had on their practice.   Data were captured using three sepa rate questionnaires, consisting of closed- and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data.   Results indicated that participants regarded the topics presented as important, that their needs had been met and that they enjoyed the workshop immensely. Furthermore, they reported that the content of the workshop had an impact on their practice.   Many participants <b>requested</b> <b>follow-up</b> workshops on clinical education.   It can be concluded from the above results that a workshop addressing educational aspects is an appropriate method of supporting colleagues involved in physiotherapy clinical training. </em...|$|R
40|$|The cost of {{providing}} medical care is ever-increasing but the resources available are at best static. Major savings {{can be made by}} reducing inappropriate investigations. Using serological testing for organisms causing atypical pneumonia as an example, we examined the appropriateness of requests and also physicians' understanding of the test. Of 119 patients tested, only 3 had titres indicative of acute infection. Most patients were tested within 2 days of hospital admission, before receipt of results excluding more likely diagnoses. Forty-five patients had no current or recent respiratory symptoms, in whom infection was highly unlikely. Titres were most often requested by the least experienced members of the clinical team. Of 70 patients with an acute illness in whom a definitive diagnosis, bacteriological or otherwise, was not made, in only 9 was a convalescent specimen sent for <b>follow-up</b> titres. Most <b>requests</b> for serology for organisms causing atypical pneumonia were inappropriate. Furthermore, in the majority of cases the test was incorrectly used...|$|R
40|$|Background: Failure to {{follow-up}} {{laboratory test}} results {{has been described}} as one of the major processes contributing to unsafe patient care. Currently, most of the laboratories do not know with certainty not only their rate of missed (or unreviewed) requests but the economical cost and impact that this issue implies. The aim of our study was to measure that rate and calculate the resulting costs. Material and methods: In January 2015, we checked in our Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) for every emergency request from 1 st July 2011 to 30 th June 2014, if they had been reviewed by any allowed user or not. 319, 064 requests were ordered during that period of time. Results were expressed as “ordered requests”, “missed requests” and its percentage. Additionally, total cost of missed requests was calculated in euros (€). “Non-productive days” were theorised (as the days producing requests that were not reviewed) based on these results. Results: 7924 requests (2. 5 %) were never reviewed by clinicians. This represented a total cost of 203, 039 € and 27 “non-productive” days in three years. Significant differences between inpatients, outpatients and emergency department as well as different emergencies units were found after application of statistical analysis. Conclusions: In terms of resources, never reviewed or missed requests appear to be a not negligible problem for the clinical laboratory management. Electronic result delivery, with electronic endorsement to indicate <b>follow-up</b> of <b>requests</b> along with better systems of electronic requesting should be investigated as a way of improving patient outcomes and save unnecessary expenses...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} the caries index (dmft), presence of sucking habits and facial alterations in children attended by the preventive program for {{infants and children}} assisted by spontaneous demand, at the same age, at the public sector of Maringá, PR. A total of 100 children were evaluated (1 - 6 years), who were divided into 2 groups: GI - children attended by the infant program with educational and preventive care and bimonthly follow-up, since the 1 st year of age; GII - children assisted for conventional treatment (preventive and restorative) according to the needs, and <b>follow-up</b> as <b>requested</b> by the parents. Data collection was performed by interview with the parents and clinical examination for evaluation of the dmft and facial alterations. Analysis of data (Mann-Whitney test for dmft comparison and chi-square test for all other comparisons) demonstrated a significant difference (p< 0. 05) {{in relation to the}} dmft index (GI: 0. 2; GII: 3. 0), percentage of caries-free children (GI: 88 %; GII: 57 %) and non-nutritive sucking habits (GI: 47 %; GII: 75 %). The breastfeeding and bottle utilization practices were similar for both groups. Facial alterations were more frequently observed (p< 0. 05) in GII (48 %) than GI (8. 4 %), especially for the variables (p< 0. 05) high arched palate (GI: 10. 2 %; GII: 35. 4 %), anterior open bite (GI: 14. 2 %; GII: 35. 4 %) and mouth breathing (GI: 6. 1 %; GII: 29. 1 %). It was concluded that the infant program is more effective than the spontaneous demand program, reaching the goal of oral health maintenance in the child population...|$|R
40|$|In {{the peak}} of the 2009 Q fever {{outbreak}} in the Netherlands, we introduced a diagnostic algorithm for acute Q fever with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin M antibodies to Coxiella burnetii phase II antigens (MII screen) as an initial step. Subsequently, an immunofluorescence assay or PCR was performed depending on the MII screen outcome, date of onset of disease, and inpatient or outpatient setting. The impact of MII screen on the number of immunofluorescence assays performed and the contribution of PCR to diagnosis were retrospectively evaluated in 825 patients referred in a 17 -day period. Acute Q fever was diagnosed in 256 patients. The introduction of MII screen reduced the number of immunofluorescence assays performed by more than 80 %. In 103 patients, PCR analysis contributed to the diagnosis of acute Q fever. Q fever diagnostics were hampered by the fact that for a high number of patients the date of onset of disease was not provided and the <b>requested</b> <b>follow-up</b> serum samples were not received...|$|R
