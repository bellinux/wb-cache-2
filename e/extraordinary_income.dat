25|$|Considering revenue alone, Inter surpassed city {{rivals in}} Deloitte Football Money League {{for the first}} time, in the 2008–09 season, to rank in 9th place, one place behind Juventus in 8th place. (Milan in 10th place.) In the 2009–10 season, Inter {{remained}} in 9th place, surpassing Juventus (10th) but Milan re-took the leading role as the 7th. Inter became the 8th in 2010–11, but was still one place behind Milan. Since 2011, Inter fell to 11th in 2011–12, 15th in 2012–13 and 17th in 2013–14 season. In 2008–09 season, Revenue percentages were divided up between matchday (14%, €28.2million), broadcasting (59%, €115.7million, +7%, +€8million) and commercial (27%, €52.6million, +43%). Kit sponsors Nike and Pirelli contributed €18.1million and €9.3million respectively to commercial revenues, while broadcasting revenues were boosted €1.6million (6%) by Champions League distribution. in 2009–10 season the revenue was boosted by the sales of Ibrahimović, the treble and the release clause of coach José Mourinho. For the 2010–11 season, Serie A clubs started negotiating club TV rights collectively rather than individually. This was predicted to result in lower broadcasting revenues for Inter, with smaller clubs gaining from the loss. Eventually the result included an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>income</b> of €13million from RAI. Deloitte expressed the idea that issues in Italian football, particularly matchday revenue issues were holding Inter back compared to other European giants, and developing their own stadia would result in Serie A clubs being more competitive on the world stage.|$|E
60|$|Andie Dale was the Prefect (as I would jocularly call him) of the Bass, {{being at}} once the {{shepherd}} and the gamekeeper of that small and rich estate.

The young are dainty eating, as much as two shillings a-piece being a common price, and paid willingly by epicures; even the grown birds are valuable for their oil and feathers; and a part of the minister's stipend of North Berwick is paid to this day in solan geese, which makes it (in some folks' eyes) a parish to be coveted. To perform these several businesses, as well as to protect the geese from poachers, Andie had frequent occasion to sleep and pass days together on the crag; and we found the man at home there like a farmer in his steading. Bidding us all shoulder some of the packages, a matter in which I made haste to bear a hand, he led us in by a locked gate, which was the only admission to the island, and through the ruins of the fortress, to the governor's house. There we saw, by the ashes in the chimney and a standing bed-place in one corner, that he made his usual occupation.|$|E

40|$|RESUMEN: El examen de las relaciones de rentas compiladas por los ministros de hacienda en momentos de crisis o dificultades financieras ofrece una buena imagen de la estructura y valor de los ingresos de la Corona de Castilla desde finales del siglo XVI y a lo largo del XVII. Gracias a estos documentos es posible medir el aumento de la carga tributaria durante la escalada fiscal del reinado de Felipe IV y la importancia de las medidas de alivio aprobadas en el de Carlos II, así como el peso de los ingresos estrictamente fiscales respecto a los extraordinarios. El artículo se detiene asimismo en el análisis de la evolución de la carga tributaria en términos «reales» planteando algunas de sus repercusiones sobre la economía y la población de Castilla. ABSTRACT: The {{study of}} a group of fiscal {{relations}} compiled by royal ministers in some moments of the XVIth and XVIIth centuries offers an accurate view of both the amount and the structure of the fiscal revenues collected by the Castilian Crown from 1577 to 1688. These documentary sources have allowed us to measure the increase of the tax burden during the reign of Philip IV and the importance of the measures subsequently adopted during the reign of Charles II to lighten such burden. Simultaneously, our sources have also allowed us to compare the amount and the evolution of the ordinary taxes collected by the Crown to that of the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>incomes.</b> To finish, our paper deals with the evolution of tax burden in real terms and its consequences on the Castilian economy and population. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I study the {{trends in the}} value-relevance of {{quarterly}} earnings announcements covering years 1972 - 2015. The topic has been of interest to many researchers and has maintained its attractiveness since the value-relevance {{has changed over the}} years and the reasons for it remain somewhat unambiguous. The motivation to a topic this actively researched strives from the fundamental changes in the business models of the companies included in the sample. The portion of technology and service business companies has increased rapidly during the latest years, and in contrast to traditional manufacturing companies, their financial reporting and accounting rules differ quite a lot. This causes differences in the value-relevance of earnings announcements. In the previous research, the timelines used do not cover the latest 5 - 10 years, indicating that the effect of these newly listed technology and service centered companies does not reflect to the results. As a results, prior research is lacking a consistent understanding on the effects of the latest years of the data available from Compustat and The Center of Research in Security Prices (CRSP) data base. The dataset used in this study extends from January 1972 to December 2015 and comprises firms listed in NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX. The quarterly data for firms is retrieved from Compustat and the daily return data is from CRSP. Hypotheses are formulated based on prior research and they are formulated to each income statement line item used to measure the value-relevance. These income line items are net income (NIQ), operating income before depreciations (OIBDPQ) and operating <b>income</b> before <b>extraordinary</b> items (IBQ). Return model is used to capture the instant market reaction to quarterly earnings announcements around the announcement date, and in contrast, the price model aims to capture the effect of the accumulated information from the whole quarter. Fama-MacBeth method (Fama & MacBeth, 1973) is used to run in total six different cross-sectional time series regressions, out of which three are based on return model and three are based on price model. Prior research has shown that some discretionary items, like <b>extraordinary</b> items in <b>income</b> statement, reduce the value-relevance of earnings (Donelson et al., 2011). The results gained in this thesis are somewhat in line with those prior results. Net income has the lowest value-relevance or the strongest decrease in value-relevance in both of the models. Additionally, the results indicate that the value-relevance enhances when moving up in the income statement from net income towards pure earnings...|$|R

This article focuses {{on the role of}} control fraud in causing financial crises. Financial control frauds ’ “weapon of choice ” is accounting. Fraudulent lenders produce guaranteed, exceptional short-term “profits ” through a four-part strategy: extreme growth (Ponzi-like), lending to uncreditworthy borrowers, extreme leverage, and minimal loss reserves. These exceptional “profits ” render “private market discipline ” perverse, often defeat regulatory restrictions, and allow the CEO to convert firm assets to his personal benefit through seemingly normal compensation mechanisms. The short-term profits also cause the CEO’s stock options holdings to appreciate. Fraudulent CEOs that follow this strategy are guaranteed to obtain <b>extraordinary</b> <b>income</b> while minimizing the risks of detection and prosecution. The optimization strategy for lenders that engage in accounting control frauds explains why such firms fail and cause catastrophic losses.

40|$|Purpose – This study aims to test empirically the {{validity}} of the accounting valuation model that is based on earnings and book values for loss-reporting firms under a conservative accounting regime. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical tests are performed by employing returns models on data derived from non-financial firms listed on the Athens Stock Exchange for the period 1992 - 2000. Findings – The empirical results suggest that there is no unique concept of income, which is applicable, for valuation purposes, in all circumstances. Total income may be the appropriate income concept to use for the valuation of profit reporting firms but not for loss-reporting ones; for loss-reporting firms, ordinary income appears to be a more useful concept for valuation purposes. <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>income</b> was also found to be value relevant. Further, different versions of the accounting valuation model appear to be more relevant for different groups of firms (groups defined in terms of various firm characteristics, such as: size, growth opportunities and riskiness. Practical implications – The study examines the informational content of the various earnings and loss items in the income statement and provides conclusions that are useful for standard setters, accounting policy makers and market participants. Originality/value – It provides further evidence on the value relevance of losses, as opposed to that of earnings. It coincides with {{the development of a new}} project initiated by the International Accounting Standards Board, i. e. “Reporting Comprehensive Income”, concerning the content of the income statement.
