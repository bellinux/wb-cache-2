5|$|Construction of {{the ship}} began on 17 June 1863 at the Carr and MacPherson Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Latnik was laid down on 24 December 1863 and she was {{launched}} on 22 March 1864. She entered service on 14 July 1865 and cost a total of 1,148,000 rubles, almost double her contract cost of 600,000 rubles. The ship {{was assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon completion. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> was the only ship of the class not to make a port visit to Stockholm, Sweden in July–August 1865. She suffered some sort of hull damage in September, but the details are not known.|$|E
25|$|Narathihapate's death officially {{marked the}} end of the two-and-a-half-century-old Pagan Empire. The country was in chaos, with each region {{claiming}} a king. Now, the dowager queen, Hla Wun managed to return to Pagan, hoping to restore the kingdom. At Pagan, she became the leader of the remaining old court. A year and half after her husband's death, on 30 May 1289, she put one of Narathihapate's sons, Kyawswa, on the throne. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> did not choose her only son (and child) Yazathu as king.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said she}} found the episode both [...] "dishearting" [...] and [...] "engaging", as well as later adding that it was [...] "sad" [...] and [...] "frightening" [...] when Jake O'Connor was accused of murdering his father. Writing about the final scene which shows Megan enter the Russell’s house, {{she said that she}} wanted to [...] "smack" [...] Megan for doing so, saying [...] "What was she thinking? She knew Scanlon had committed the murder and that Jen was acting strangely when she wouldn't let her in. Yet, she went back to find the door open and walked right in. Megan's intelligent enough to know that something wasn't right but she's unarmed and untrained to handle the situation. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> seemed incapable of making the smart decision to wait for the real police". Orlando said of the flashback scenes that she hopes in future episodes they [...] "delve deeper" [...] into Megan's father's death, saying that it was [...] "certainly a turning point for the character and I'd love to know more". She said it was [...] "nice" [...] to see scenes between Peter and Megan and said of the carpooling storyline, [...] "Snacks for carpool didn't seem like a bad idea but they could have used a couple of healthier options to go with the chocolate". Of Curtis and Kate's examining Manny Santos, she said that their expressions were [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] when they decided whether Manny was a juvenile, adding that it gave [...] "a much needed moment of comic relief in an otherwise heavy episode". She finished in saying that the episode [...] "grabbed her attention", finishing, [...] "These engaging characters and this episode was a winner for Body of Proof". In the carpooling storyline it featured Tastykake's products, a line of snack foods based in Philadelphia. Such products which were mentioned were Krimpets and KandyKakes, with the ABC saying they were the [...] "best".|$|E

5000|$|Williams had {{garnered}} considerable critical acclaim, but her {{commercial success}} was moderate. Emmylou Harris said of Williams, [...] "She {{is an example}} of the best of what country at least says it is, but, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>she's</b> completely out of the loop and I feel strongly that that's country music's loss." [...] Harris recorded the title track from Williams's Sweet Old World for her career-redefining 1995 album, Wrecking Ball.|$|R
50|$|Nephren is a Leprechaun rarely showing emotions. She {{cared about}} Willem {{and help him}} a lot but often sticks to him <b>for</b> <b>some</b> unknown <b>reason.</b> <b>She</b> loves flowers.|$|R
2500|$|In Heath and Potter's book , Kinkade's work is {{described}} as [...] "so awful it must {{be seen to be}} believed." [...] In Dana Spiotta's 2011 novel Stone Arabia, the main character's boyfriend, an art teacher at a private school in Los Angeles, gives her presents of Thomas Kinkade Painter of Light pieces. [...] "When I asked him why Thomas Kinkade, he just said, 'Well, he is America's most successful artist. And a native Californian as well.' Or he would say, 'His name has a trademark— see?' and he would point to the subscript that appeared after his name." [...] The pieces are [...] "deeply hideous" [...] and [...] "kitschy," [...] but <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> loves them.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun quivered and flushed. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> {{was almost}} in tears.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> {{found it}} {{difficult}} to ask the question on her lips.|$|E
60|$|Honora looked up, and {{surprised}} Mrs. Robert's {{eyes fixed on}} her with the same strange expression she had noticed on her arrival. And <b>for</b> <b>some</b> senseless <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> flushed.|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> {{or other}} <b>she</b> seemed dissatisfied. She pointed towards the Baroness.|$|R
6000|$|... "At last," [...] he cried, [...] "at last!" [...] And he {{sat down}} on the bench beside her. Her first impulse was to rise, yet <b>for</b> <b>some</b> inexplicable <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> remained.|$|R
60|$|Such was the {{confidence}} with which, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> inspired him, {{that he left}} with an easier mind.|$|E
6000|$|He {{understood}} that <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> {{did not wish}} him to pass the house, and he bowed. [...] "Wherever you like. I hope Mrs. Simpson is well? And Miss Simpson?" ...|$|E
60|$|Alvina did {{not really}} like Lottie Witham. Yet the other woman was sharp and shrewd in the uptake, and <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> fancied Alvina. So she was invited to tea at Manchester House.|$|E
60|$|And {{what were}} the Earl's {{thoughts}} of Gertrude? Here was the one drop of bitterness in the girl's cup of happiness. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>she</b> could not divine the Earl showed signs of marked antipathy.|$|R
60|$|Miss Keene {{had noticed}} that his eyes were his best feature, albeit {{somewhat}} abstracted and melancholy; but, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> vague <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> could not explain herself, she answered hurriedly {{that she had seen}} nothing very particular in them.|$|R
50|$|She has a {{hard time}} {{watching}} her mouth; <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> whenever <b>she</b> says something bad will happen it always does, causing everyone around to feel fearful and uneasy whenever she voices her opinions. Others often refer to this as Crow's Mouth (烏鴉嘴).|$|R
60|$|Stephen, who {{was very}} fond of her, saw that <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> was not herself. He {{examined}} her with unwonted gravity. Thyme turned away from him. He heard, to his alarm, a little gulping sound.|$|E
60|$|The night passed quietly enough, but, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> {{could not}} explain, Grace awoke {{long before the}} others. She tried {{to go to sleep}} again, but, finding that a failure, dressed and went out on the deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, me!" [...] {{answered}} Barbara. [...] "I'm only a child. Nobody takes any {{notice of}} me--except other kids, like you." [...] <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> {{appeared out of}} conceit with herself, which was not her usual state of mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Apparently..." [...] Bruce Carmyle's scowl betrayed that resentment which a {{well-balanced}} man cannot {{but feel}} at the unreasonableness of others. [...] "... Apparently, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> extraordinary <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> has taken {{it into her}} head to dash over to England." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked around}} the room and {{recognised}} some of her friends. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> or other <b>she</b> felt remarkably light-hearted.|$|R
60|$|But Mrs. Travers was not {{so easily}} to be {{disposed}} of. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> or other, <b>she</b> had shown a disposition to attach herself to Wingrave.|$|R
60|$|Miss Rosa was not there. She {{was a very}} regular attendant, but <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> {{was absent}} on this momentous afternoon. I did not say {{anything}} to him on the subject, but I knew he felt this absence deeply.|$|E
60|$|She had {{suffered}} much, {{and was still}} overwrought and nerve-strung: <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> could not afterwards have explained, she felt spiteful and uncontrolled, goaded into stupid fury {{by the look of}} insolence and of triumph with which Candeille calmly regarded her.|$|E
60|$|Then, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> {{must call}} in Rouen {{on the way}} back to London. He had an instinctive mistrust of her desire for the place. But, perversely, she wanted to go there. It was as if she wanted to try its effect upon her.|$|E
60|$|Helen sank at {{the foot}} of a tree, leaning against it. Despite her weariness she had {{retained}} some spirit until this direful revelation broke her courage. What worse could have happened? Mordaunt had led her, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>she</b> could not divine, into the clutches of Brandt, into the power of Legget and his outlaws.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked away}} from him. He could see that <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> or other <b>she</b> was embarrassed. The colour had {{streamed}} into her cheeks, but she went on bravely enough.|$|R
50|$|She was {{appointed}} {{as an editor}} at Shaoxing Opera Group after the Anti-Japanese War. After the War of Liberation, she paid heavily for the fame she had acquired. In 1955, she was put in jail <b>for</b> <b>some</b> ridiculous <b>reasons.</b> <b>She</b> died in 1982 in Shanghai, where she became famous, after struggling with poverty and illness.|$|R
60|$|Lottie Witham {{eyed the}} thin, nervous face of Alvina. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> liked her. And of course, Alvina was {{considered}} a lady in Woodhouse. That was what it had come to, with James's declining fortunes: she was merely considered a lady. The consideration was no longer indisputable.|$|E
60|$|I {{went back}} to the sitting-room. She hadn't moved an inch. She was still bolt upright {{on the edge of her}} chair, {{gripping}} her umbrella like a hammer-thrower. She gave me another of those looks as I came in. There was no doubt about it; <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> had taken a dislike to me. I suppose because I wasn't George M. Cohan. It was a bit hard on a chap.|$|E
60|$|Of course, {{considering}} {{the sort of}} girl Madeline Bassett was--stars and rabbits and all that, I mean--you might say that a sober sadness {{would have been more}} fitting. But in these matters you have got to realize that tastes differ. The impulse of right-thinking men might be to run a mile when they saw the Bassett, but <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> appealed to the deeps in Gussie, so that was that.|$|E
60|$|Julien {{looked across}} at the {{opposite}} table. The girl, as he had noticed before, was stealing frequent glances at him. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> or other, <b>she</b> seemed anxious to attract his attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha, my dear, looking {{fresh as}} a flower--and as pretty!" [...] he said, turning round and taking her hand; then, after {{two or three}} irresolute glances at her face, he drew her towards him, and was about to imprint a kiss on her {{forehead}} (let us hope), when, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> unaccountable <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> shrank back from him and defeated his purpose.|$|R
50|$|On 1 November 2013, Ferguson {{uploaded}} a {{video of}} her performing the song live at London Air Studios. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> unknown <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> decided to perform album track (now the follow up single) 'All That I Got' live on the The Paul O'Grady Show on 14 November 2013 instead of 'I Hope'. She later performed 'I Hope' live on The X Factor on 1 December 2013.|$|R
