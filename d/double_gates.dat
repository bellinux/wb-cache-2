5|$|When {{the park}} was {{enclosed}} in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896. Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present <b>double</b> <b>gates</b> date from 1926. Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of Coombe, with both a gate and a step ladder. The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901. The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899. Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron gates were installed. The chinoiserie lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{universal}} compact potential {{model for}} all types of double-gate MOSFETs is presented. An analytical closed-form solution to a 2 -D Poisson’s equation is obtained with the approx-imation that a vertical channel potential distribution is a cubic function of position. As a result, an analytical equation for the threshold voltage is derived from the proposed potential model. Different gate work functions and independent gate biases for front and back gates are considered, and the proposed model is found to be valid for an arbitrary double-gate structure: a symmetric versus asymmetric <b>double</b> <b>gate</b> and a tied versus sep-arated double-gate structure. The threshold voltage behaviors for double-gate MOSFETs are investigated for various device dimen-sions. The back-gate effects of the separated <b>double</b> <b>gate</b> are also investigated for various silicon channel thicknesses and gate oxide thicknesses. Last, a process-induced threshold voltage fluctuation is estimated for symmetric and asymmetric separated double-gate MOSFETs. The analytical solution of the threshold voltages is verified by a comparison with simulation results in terms of the gate length, the silicon thickness, and the gate oxide thickness. A good agreement between two sets of results is obtained.

25|$|Warren {{was able}} to {{investigate}} the inside of these gates. Warren's Gate and the Golden Gate simply head towards {{the centre of the}} Mount, fairly quickly giving access to the surface by steps. Barclay's Gate is similar, but abruptly turns south as it does so; {{the reason for this is}} currently unknown. The double and triple gates (the Huldah Gates) are more substantial; heading into the Mount for some distance they each finally have steps rising to the surface just north of the al-Aqsa Mosque. The passageway for each is vaulted, and has two aisles (in the case of the triple gate, a third aisle exists for a brief distance beyond the gate); the eastern aisle of the <b>double</b> <b>gates</b> and western of the triple gates reach the surface, the other aisles terminating some way before the steps – Warren believed that one aisle of each original passage was extended when the al-Aqsa Mosque blocked the original surface exits.|$|E
500|$|The main {{defensive}} {{structure is}} a revetted lunette shaped earthwork. It has a [...] thick rampart with [...] {{of concrete and}} [...] of brick forming a retaining wall for the earth fill. The rampart is covered by natural vegetation and, in both the 19th and 21st century operation, is closed to access to preserve this. The glacis gives extra protection to the fort and was designed to blend the fort into the landscape. It surrounded the fort on the north, south and seaward sides and was made by forming the surrounding sandhills. The side facing the fort—the scarp—is steep and, with the front face of the rampart, forms a [...] wide ditch that can be raked by rifle fire from the caponier or the stockade's sides. The outer face is a gentle slope and {{is designed to be}} covered by case shot fired from the fort's 64-pounder guns. The southern glacis section was removed during sand mining and construction of the caravan park, both after World War II. The western glacis is changed, but still visible, and the northern glacis was recreated in 1993—showcasing the purpose of the glacis and the function of the caponier. Access to the fort is via <b>double</b> <b>gates</b> at the fort's rear, one each through the stockade and the rear defence wall. Both gates were removed or destroyed over time and the 21st century gates are reconstructions. The formal parade ground or manning parade lies between the rear walls and barracks, and the raised terreplein. It was formerly used for drill training, assembly and formal parades. First gravelled when constructed, it was paved with tar in the 1890s to solve drainage problems. Around the seaward side of the manning parade runs the terreplein. It is a raised crescent shaped level on which the guns platforms sit, and is ascended from the manning parade by ramps and stairs.|$|E

From 16 July 1891, all traffic from the port had to pass along the canal, and entered the river through Eastham Lock. Access to the river had previously been by a tidal basin, but this was fitted with <b>double</b> <b>gates</b> where it connected to the ship canal. The Shropshire Union spent £37,850 constructing a new quay next to the gates, [...] long, and suitable for ships up to 4,000 tons. While the ship canal was under construction, the Shropshire Union investigated the cost of upgrading their line from Ellesmere Port to Autherley to take larger barges. Jebb estimated that it would cost around £13,500 per mile (£8,400 per km), so the total cost would have been £891,475. In the autumn of 1890, they were discussing plans for a large canal from the Mersey to Birmingham via the Potteries with the North Staffordshire Railway. Neither scheme came to fruition, but the Shropshire Union spent {{large amounts of money}} on building better wharves and warehouses at many of the Pottery towns.|$|E

It was surrounded by a double wall, with an outer and an inner moat, the outer dry, and the inner filled with water. There were <b>double</b> <b>gates</b> also, and by them guard-towers. Moreover, I see a little yard, with posts in it, where prisoners were scourged, and a small and horrible room, furnished with a kind of wooden bed, to which they were bound for the punishment of the putting out of their eyes and the slitting of their tongues.

'Now look here, Good,' I remonstrated, {{when there}} came a sound at the curtain, which, on being drawn, {{admitted}} a functionary, who signified by signs {{that he was there}} to lead us to the bath. We gladly consented, and were conducted to a delightful marble chamber, with a pool of running crystal water in the centre of it, into which we gaily plunged. When we had bathed, we returned to our apartment and dressed, and then went into the central room where we had supped on the previous evening, to find a morning meal already prepared for us, and a capital meal it was, though I should be puzzled to describe the dishes. After breakfast we lounged round and admired the tapestries and carpets and some pieces of statuary that were placed about, wondering the while {{what was going to happen}} next. Indeed, by this time our minds were in such a state of complete bewilderment that we were, as a matter of fact, ready for anything that might arrive. As for our sense of astonishment, it was pretty well obliterated. Whilst we were still thus engaged, our friend the captain of the guard presented himself, and with many obeisances signified that we were to follow him, which we did, not without doubts and heart-searchings -- for we guessed that the time had come when we should have to settle the bill for those confounded hippopotami with our cold-eyed friend Agon, the High Priest. However, there was no help for it, and personally I took great comfort in the promise of the protection of the sister Queens, knowing that if ladies have a will they can generally find a way; so off we started as though we liked it. A minute's walk through a passage and an outer court brought us to the great <b>double</b> <b>gates</b> of the palace that open on to the wide highway which runs uphill through the heart of Milosis to the Temple of the Sun a mile away, and thence down the slope on the farther side of the temple to the outer wall of the city.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{modeling}} framework for single gate conventional planar MOSFET and <b>double</b> <b>gate</b> (DG) MOSFETS are reviewed. MOS Modeling {{can be done}} by either analytical modeling or compact modeling. Single gate MOSFET technology has been the choice of mainstream digital circuits for VLSI as well as for other high frequency application in the low GHZ range. The major single gate MOS modeling methods are reviewed and compared. First generation to fifth generation MOS models like BSIM & PSP are compared. The use of multiple gates has emerged as a new technology to replace the conventional planar MOSFET when itsfeature size is scaled to the sub 22 nm regime. <b>Double</b> <b>Gate</b> devices seem to be attractive alternatives as they can effectively reduce the short channel effects and yield higher current drive. DGFETS are classified as Symmetric <b>Double</b> <b>Gate</b> FETs (SDGFET) and Asymmetric <b>Double</b> <b>Gate</b> FETs (ADGFET). This paper covers the fundamentals of SDGFETs and ADGFETs.

The station was normally crowded, and if there was a great flutter of evening papers in the multitude of hands there were no signs of extraordinary emotion on that multitude of faces. There was nothing in them to distract me from the thought that it was singularly appropriate that I should start from this station on the retraced way of my existence. For this was the station at which, thirty-seven years before, I arrived on my first visit to London. Not the same building, but the same spot. At nineteen years of age, after a period of probation and training I had imposed upon myself as ordinary seaman on board a North Sea coaster, I had come up from Lowestoft--my first long railway journey in England--to [...] "sign on" [...] for an Antipodean voyage in a deep-water ship. Straight from a railway carriage I had walked into the great city with something of the feeling of a traveller penetrating into a vast and unexplored wilderness. No explorer could have been more lonely. I did not know a single soul of all these millions that all around me peopled the mysterious distances of the streets. I cannot say I was free from a little youthful awe, but at that age one's feelings are simple. I was elated. I was pursuing a clear aim, I was carrying out a deliberate plan of making out of myself, in the first place, a seaman worthy of the service, good enough to work by the side of the men with whom I was to live; and in the second place, I had to justify my existence to myself, to redeem a tacit moral pledge. Both these aims were to be attained by the same effort. How simple seemed the problem of life then, on that hazy day of early September in the year 1878, when I entered London for the first time.|$|E

40|$|The double-gate (DG) MOSFETs {{have been}} {{identified}} in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) as the most promising device structure that enables CMOS continuous scaling beyond the 65 nm technology node (with 25 nm physical gate length) for its higher drive current, improved sub-threshold swing, excellent short channel effect(SCE) control, and potential circuit design flexibility. Study of the process variation's impacts on performance are highly desirable to gain physical insight into the device's operating principles, facilitate the device designs, identify the key technological challenges to its fabrication and investigate the applications in circuitry. In this study, we focus on the process variations including the bottom gate misalignment issue in the planar structures and the vertical non-uniformity of the finFET structures, In the planar <b>double</b> <b>gate</b> MOSFETs the bottom gate misalignment will cause the SCEs control to degrade. The SCEs-based <b>double</b> <b>gate</b> MOSFETs scaling theory should consequently be properly revised.

The bottom gate misalignment effects on different <b>double</b> <b>gate</b> MOSFETs configurations and working modes are also different. Compared with the symmetric <b>double</b> <b>gate</b> MOSFETs, stricter misalignment accuracy is required for the <b>double</b> <b>gate</b> MOSFETs with asymmetric gate configurations.
