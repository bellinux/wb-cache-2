2500|$|Sound {{recording}} {{and reproduction is}} an electrical or mechanical inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog {{recording and}} digital recording. Analog (or analogue) recording (Greek, ana = [...] "according to" [...] and logos = [...] "relationship") is a technique used to store signals of audio or video information for later playback. In digital recording, the analog signal of video or sound is converted into a stream of discrete numbers, representing the changes in chroma and luminance values (video) orair-pressure (audio) through time, thus making an abstract template for the original sound or moving image. In 1967, the first <b>digital</b> audio <b>magnetic</b> tape <b>recorder</b> is invented. A 12-bit 30kHz stereo device using a compander to extend the dynamic range.|$|R

50|$|Magnetic {{storage in}} the form of wire {{recording}}—audio recording on a wire—was publicized by Oberlin Smith in the Sept 8, 1888 issue of the Electrical World. Smith had previously filed a patent in September, 1878 but found no opportunity to pursue the idea as his business was machine tools. The first publicly demonstrated (Paris Exposition of 1900) <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder</b> was invented by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Poulsen's device recorded a signal on a wire wrapped around a drum. In 1928, Fritz Pfleumer developed the first <b>magnetic</b> tape <b>recorder.</b> Early <b>magnetic</b> storage devices were designed to record analog audio signals. Computers and now most audio and video magnetic storage devices record digital data.|$|R

40|$|Standards for {{removable}} {{computer storage}} media are needed so that users may reliably interchange data both within and among various computer installations. Furthermore, media interchange standards support competition in industry and prevent sole-source lock-in. NIST participates in magnetic tape and optical disk standards development through Technical Committees X 3 B 5, <b>Digital</b> <b>Magnetic</b> Tapes, X 3 B 11, Optical Digital Data Disk, and the Joint Technical Commission on Data Permanence. NIST also participates in other relevant national and international standards committees for removable {{computer storage media}}. Industry standards for <b>digital</b> <b>magnetic</b> tapes {{require the use of}} Standard Reference Materials (SRM's) developed and maintained by NIST. In addition, NIST has been studying care and handling procedures required for <b>digital</b> <b>magnetic</b> tapes. NIST has developed a methodology for determining the life expectancy of optical disks. NIST is developing care and handling procedures for optical digital data disks and is involved in a program to investigate error reporting capabilities of optical disk drives. This presentation reflects the status of emerging magnetic tape and optical disk standards, as well as NIST's contributions in support of these standards...|$|R
50|$|Poulsen {{obtained}} a Telegraphone Patent in 1898, {{and with his}} assistant, Peder O. Pedersen, later developed other <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorders</b> that recorded on steel wire, tape, or disks. None of these devices had electronic amplification, but the recorded signal was easily strong enough to be heard through a headset or even transmitted on telephone wires. At the 1900 World's Fair in Paris, Poulsen {{had the chance to}} record the voice of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria which {{is believed to be the}} oldest surviving magnetic audio recording today.|$|R
5000|$|Orr's early {{knowledge}} {{allowed him}} to establish Orradio in 1949. When, after some uncertainty, tape became the standard medium for <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorders,</b> and as other uses such as data storage and videotape appeared, Orradio's sales expanded rapidly in the late 1950s. Orradio produced the first commercially available audio tape, video tape, and computer tape in the world. The company was purchased by a larger competitor, the Ampex Corporation, in 1959 when Ampex decided it was cheaper to own the plant than to keep buying all their tape.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of magnetic tape, <b>magnetic</b> wire <b>recorders</b> had successfully demonstrated the concept of magnetic recording, but they never offered audio quality comparable to the other recording and broadcast standards of the time. Some individuals and organizations developed innovative uses for <b>magnetic</b> wire <b>recorders</b> while others investigated variations of the technology. One particularly important variation was the application of an oxide powder to a long strip of paper. This German invention was the start of a long string of innovations that have led to present day magnetic tape recordings.|$|R
50|$|Tigerstedt {{moved to}} Denmark, where he {{continued}} working on film sound recording devices at the Petersen & Poulsen company. He befriended the Danish inventor Valdemar Poulsen (1869-1942), {{who was the}} inventor of the telegraphone steel wire <b>magnetic</b> <b>recorder.</b> Tigerstedt, too, had experimented with recording sound on a steel wire. He attempted to transmit speech across the Jutland straits using 30 kHz ultrasound, but the results were not promising. He also experimented with transmitting sound underwater, which was more successful, and he was eventually granted a patent for this process.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{establishes the}} same kinds of standards and controls that are currently in use for the procurement on new analog and <b>digital</b> <b>magnetic</b> tapes. The Magnetic Tape Certification Facility (MTCF) currently maintains a Quality Products List (QPL) for all new analog and <b>digital</b> <b>magnetic</b> tapes purchased by NASA-GSFC. Extensive tests are conducted in the MTCF on an annual basis to determine the manufacturer's tape types to be added to or deleted from the current QPL. The MTCF currently maintains two specifications for magnetic tapes: NASA TM- 79724 is used for the QPL and acceptance testing of new analog tapes; and NASA TM- 80599 is used for the QPL and acceptance testing of new digital tapes. This specification will be used for the QPL and acceptance testing of new 3480 cartridges. The magnetic tapes used by GSFC, LaRC, ARC/Dryden, WFF, and the Network Tracking Stations are covered by the NASA-GSFC specifications. The 3480 cartridge was introduced approximately 3. 5 years ago and is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to <b>digital</b> <b>magnetic</b> tapes. Many users have already converted to the 3480 system and have more tape drives on order...|$|R
40|$|A digital {{microfluidic}} platform manipulates droplets {{on an open}} surface. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>digital</b> microfluidics utilizes <b>magnetic</b> {{forces for}} actuation and offers unique advantages compared to other digital microfluidic platforms. First, the magnetic particles used in <b>magnetic</b> <b>digital</b> microfluidics have multiple functions. In addition to serving as actuators, they also provide a functional solid substrate for molecule binding, which enables {{a wide range of}} applications in molecular diagnostics and immunodiagnostics. Second, <b>magnetic</b> <b>digital</b> microfluidics can be manually operated in a “power-free” manner, which allows for operation in low-resource environments for point-of-care diagnostics where even batteries are considered a luxury item. This review covers research areas related to <b>magnetic</b> <b>digital</b> microfluidics. This paper first summarizes the current development of <b>magnetic</b> <b>digital</b> microfluidics. Various methods of droplet manipulation using magnetic forces are discussed, ranging from conventional magnetic particle-based actuation to the recent development of ferrofluids and magnetic liquid marbles. This paper also discusses several new approaches that use magnetically controlled flexible substrates for droplet manipulation. In addition, we emphasize applications of <b>magnetic</b> <b>digital</b> microfluidics in biosensing and medical diagnostics, and identify the current limitations of <b>magnetic</b> <b>digital</b> microfluidics. We provide a perspective on possible solutions to close these gaps. Finally, the paper discusses the future improvement of <b>magnetic</b> <b>digital</b> microfluidics to explore potential new research directions. Full Tex...|$|R
