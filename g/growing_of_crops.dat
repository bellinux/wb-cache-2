5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Days of Ruin is {{considerably}} darker than, and unrelated to, the plots of previous games. Almost 90% of humanity {{has been killed}} off following devastating meteor strikes which have destroyed much of civilization and caused a massive dust cloud to blot out the sun, preventing photosynthesis and thereby preventing the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops.</b> Scattered survivors pick through the wreckage, and the remnants of several military superpowers patrol the ravaged landscape, some factions protecting the innocent while the others prey upon them.|$|E
25|$|Biofuels {{are not a}} new phenomenon. Before the industrialisation, {{horses were}} the primary (and humans {{probably}} the secondary) source of power for transportation and physical work, requiring food. The <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> for horses (typically oat) for carrying out physical work is of course comparable to the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> for biofuels for engines, albeit on a smaller scale, because production since then has increased.|$|E

25|$|For {{many generations}} {{the main source}} of {{employment}} in the parish was agriculture. The village lands were divided into two parts—infield and outfield. The infield was cultivated for the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> and the outfield was pasture. Crops grown included wheat, barley and peas. Turnips were a successful later addition. The scrubland and clay soil of the parish meant lots of hard work re-claiming land, drainage work, and liming. Wheat and barley were taken by cart to Dalkeith, Peebles and Melrose for the making of bread and beer, and carts returning from Dalkeith brought lime for the soil.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the wild}} {{vegetation}} of the area is that of grassland with very little forest mostly due to {{a long history of}} agriculture in the area. One of the few forested areas is the Ayaquemetl mountain is near San Nicolás Tetelco with about ten hectares. There have been some efforts at reforestation. However, most of the plant life is the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops,</b> especially in the east and south growing corn, spinach, other leafy greens, alfalfa, figs, pears, and walnuts. There is also significant aquatic vegetation such as water lilies, chichicastle and ninfa. Most {{of the wild}}life of the area has been extinguished because of human encroachment but in the Santa Catarina mountains there are still badgers, cacomistle and bats as well as various kinds of rodents and birds found throughout the borough.|$|E
25|$|Depopulation {{continued}} {{at the end}} of the 16th and early 17th centuries, and the monastery’s importance diminished. By the end of this time, the monastery was all but abandoned, as Cuautla grew and became the regional center. In the 17th century, those who had land rights under what were called “primordial title” began to struggle with Spanish owned haciendas over surface water. Much of the land in the municipality is not suited for the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops,</b> but is instead suited for the raising of livestock, especially cattle. For this reason, the area’s industry in providing beef and dairy products such as cream and cheese began relatively early in the colonial period. Orchards established in the very early colonial period were still important. There was another period of depopulation in the 18th century when many residents went to work in haciendas in Cuautla and other areas in Morelos.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{industry}} is tourism, but the island {{also has a}} strong agricultural heritage, including sheep and dairy farming and arable crops. Traditional agricultural commodities {{are more difficult to}} market off the island because of transport costs, but local farmers have managed successfully to exploit some specialist markets, with the higher price of such products being able to absorb the transport costs. One of the most successful agricultural sectors is now the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> under cover, particularly salad crops including tomatoes and cucumbers. The island has a warmer climate and longer growing season than much of the United Kingdom. Garlic has been successfully grown in Newchurch for many years, and is even exported to France. This has led to the establishment of an annual Garlic Festival at Newchurch, {{which is one of the}} largest events of the local calendar. A favourable climate supports two vineyards, including one of the oldest in the British Isles at Adgestone. Lavender is grown for its oil. The largest agricultural sector has been dairying, but due to low milk prices and strict legislation for UK milk producers, the dairy industry has been in decline: there were nearly 150 producers in the mid-1980s, but now just 24.|$|E
2500|$|Thirty {{seven percent}} of the {{population}} is employed in agriculture, livestock and fishing. Agricultural units cover 2,233,897 hectares in rural areas of the state. Just over fifty percent is dedicated to the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops,</b> 46.5% to pasture, 2.6% is forest and [...]8% is wild vegetation. Agriculture is the most important economic activity of the rural areas, but it is mostly limited to the rainy season from June to October, as there are few facilities for irrigation. This limits the sector’s growth potential significantly. Due to lack of investment only 11% of the state’s arable land is irrigated. Seventy two percent of farmland is privately own with the rest belonging to ejidos or other types of communal ownership. The municipalities with the most cultivated land are Chignahuapan, Chalchicomula de Sesma, Tlachichuca and Zacapoaxtla [...]|$|E
2500|$|There {{is about}} 1 million {{hectares}} of cultivable land, {{half of which}} is in private hands and 43% is ejido or communal land. The rest is occupied by human settlements. There are 3,620 ejidos parceled out to 270,000 ejido members. 52.5% of agricultural land {{is used for the}} <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> or used as pasture and 43.1% is forest or rainforest. Chief agricultural products include coffee, vanilla, sugarcane, tobacco, bananas, coconuts, and vegetables, but local farmers depend mainly on corn and beans. Two corn crops per year are generally produced, planted on 644,936 hectares with a production of 1,114,325 tons. The state is the leading national producer of coffee, sugarcane, corn, and rice. Coffee is grown on 152,993 hectares producing 400,575 tons. Export earnings from this crop are about 232 million USD annually. Most coffee is grown in the mountain areas of Córdoba-Huatusco, Coatepec-Teocelo-Cosautlán and Misantla-Tlapacoyan-Atzalan. Sugarcane is cultivated on 254,000 hectares, producing 16,867,958 tons annually. Veracruz is the largest producer of rice with 24,000 hectares producing 120,000 tons. Much is this crop is protected by import bans from Asia.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} national, {{regional and}} international biofuels policies and strategies to assess whether these policies promote or undermine the development of biofuels sector in Africa. Despite having a huge comparative advantage in land, labour and good climatic conditions favourable for the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>crops,</b> few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have included biofuels strategies in their energy or national development policies. Further results show that while developed countries commit huge financial resources for research, technology development {{and the provision of}} tax-incentives to both producers and consumers, there is little government support for promoting biofuels in Africa. Although the consequences of biofuels on food supply remain uncertain, the mandatory blending of biofuels with fossil fuels by industrialized countries will create demand for land in Africa for the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>crops</b> for biofuels. This paper urgently calls upon national governments in Sub-Saharan Africa to develop appropriate strategies and regulatory frameworks to harness the potential economic opportunities from biofuels sector development, while protecting the environment and rural communities from the adverse effects of land alienation from the mainstream agriculture towards the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>crops</b> for biofuels at the expense <b>of</b> traditional food <b>crops.</b> Biofuels Energy policies Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R

2500|$|Problems {{developed}} in the early 17th century when the Little Ice Age came to North America. With late frost in May and June and early frosts in August or September, made the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>crops</b> difficult. Cold weather also made big and small game more difficult to find. as game would go into semi hibernation. [...] Also nut crops from oak, hickory, beech, walnut, butternut, and chestnut, failed at times; making the supply of these nuts scarce. Rivers froze early, and water became cold fast; so fishing became impossible. The Native populations had declined after epidemics of infectious diseases, for which they had no acquired immunity. [...] Native American populations were separated from Europe {{for thousands of years}} and had no immunity to these diseases that the Europeans brought with them. Many Native American populations were weakened from starvation due to the Little Ice Age, which was coldest during the 17th century. Their important corn, bean and squash crops failed due to spring frosts [...] and early frosts in autumn. [...] As the Native American population declined, more land was available for European settlement. All these factors made the Native American populations decline dramatically.|$|E
