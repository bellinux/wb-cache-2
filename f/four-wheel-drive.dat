5|$|Filming in the Czech Republic's Barrandov Studios {{began in}} May. The crew took over {{sections}} of the Old Town in Prague. While filming in the city on April 26, people were injured when a bus and several cars collided with a <b>four-wheel-drive</b> vehicle that appeared to have braking problems. The emergency services confirmed those taken to hospital had minor injuries. Filming wrapped after a month in Prague. Additional second unit filming took place in Paris, Egypt, Tokyo, the Arctic, and underwater.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{earliest}} mid-engined <b>four-wheel-drive</b> cars were the various road-legal rally cars made for Group B homologation, such as the Ford RS200 made from 1984 to 1986. In 1989, niche maker Panther Westwinds created a mid-engined <b>four-wheel-drive,</b> the Panther Solo 2.|$|E
25|$|The {{cars were}} {{available}} through any AMC dealer, {{but less than}} 200 conversions were manufactured (Concord and <b>four-wheel-drive</b> Eagle versions).|$|E
25|$|Bugatti {{created a}} total of three <b>four-wheel-drive</b> racers, the Type 53, in 1932, but the cars were notorious for having poor handling.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, {{before the}} {{establishment}} of a modern automotive industry in Britain, English engineer Bramah Joseph Diplock patented a <b>four-wheel-drive</b> system for a steam-powered traction engine, including four-wheel steering and three differentials, which was subsequently built. The development also incorporated Bramah's Pedrail wheel system in what {{was one of the first}} <b>four-wheel-drive</b> automobiles to display an intentional ability to travel on challenging road surfaces. It stemmed from Bramagh's previous idea of developing an engine that would reduce the amount of damage to public roads.|$|E
25|$|Four further prototypes were built, the P4-based front-engined T2 and rear-engined T2A saloons, the rear-engined <b>four-wheel-drive</b> T3 coupé, and the front-engined {{front-wheel drive}} T4 saloon.|$|E
25|$|Willys {{introduced}} the model CJ-2A in 1945, the first full-production <b>four-wheel-drive</b> vehicle {{for sale in}} the general marketplace. Thanks to the ubiquitous World War II jeep's success, its rugged utilitarianism set the pattern for many four-wheel drive vehicles to come.|$|E
25|$|The {{machines}} {{typically have}} two large powered wheels {{at the back}} and two smaller wheels for steering at the front. However, some traction engines used a <b>four-wheel-drive</b> variation, and some experimented with an early form of caterpillar track.|$|E
25|$|As World War II {{had already}} begun in Asia, with Japan {{expanding}} in China, Manchuria and Southeast Asia, the Imperial Japanese Army was using a small <b>four-wheel-drive</b> car for reconnaissance and troop movements, having introduced the Kurogane Type 95 in 1936.|$|E
25|$|Australia's first {{production}} <b>four-wheel-drive</b> car-based vehicle—a utility—was {{introduced by}} Ford as an XY model in November 1972. All were fitted with the 250-cu-in six that was {{mounted on a}} 30° slant to provide front axle suspension clearance between the front differential and the sump.|$|E
25|$|The Land Rover {{name was}} {{originally}} {{used by the}} Rover Company for the Land Rover Series, launched in 1948. It developed into a brand encompassing a range of <b>four-wheel-drive</b> models, including the Defender, Discovery, Freelander, Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, and Range Rover Evoque.|$|E
25|$|Brush Fire Unit : A {{vehicle that}} is a <b>four-wheel-drive,</b> {{all-terrain}} unit used to reach hilly, remote and marshy areas to extinguish fires involving weeds, grass and other vegetation. Along with regular firefighting equipment, it carries its own water, as well as rakes, shovels, and backpack extinguishers.|$|E
25|$|After the {{perceived}} {{poor performance in}} battles in Malaya and Burma in 1942, {{it was decided that}} the existing infantry divisions were over–mechanised. To counter this, the 17th and 39th divisions were selected to become light divisions, of only two brigades which would rely more on animal and <b>four-wheel-drive</b> transport.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover is a car {{brand that}} specialises in <b>four-wheel-drive</b> vehicles, owned by British {{multinational}} car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, {{which has been}} owned by India's Tata Motors since 2008. The Land Rover {{is regarded as a}} British icon, and was granted a Royal Warrant by King George VI in 1951.|$|E
25|$|Various 4×4 {{conversions}} {{were built}} by independent constructors, such as Marc Voisin, near Grenoble, some from a Méhari 4×4 chassis and a 2CV body. In the UK, Louis Barber builds single-engined <b>four-wheel-drive</b> 2CVs. In the late 1990s, Kate Humble from BBC Top Gear tested one against a Landrover Defender off-road. The 2CV won.|$|E
25|$|The LFA {{appeared}} on Top Gear in January 2010, where its power lap of 1.22.8 was the quickest wet test lap ever recorded on the Top Gear test track located at Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, United Kingdom; it was 3 seconds {{faster than the}} nearest wet lap which was the <b>four-wheel-drive</b> Lamborghini Gallardo.|$|E
25|$|They had {{previously}} obtained military fatigues from various outlets and securing three units of Mitsubishi Pajero <b>four-wheel-drive</b> vehicles. The Pajero, of similar make {{to that used}} by the Malaysian Army was painted green and given false number plate at a house rented in Kati, for the specific use as a transit point for the group.|$|E
25|$|The Eagle {{name came}} from the {{innovative}} all-wheel drive AMC Eagle line, but the Medallion was a standard passenger car and its sales were also hindered by marketing missteps. There was no specific advertising campaign highlighting the Medallion sedans and wagons. Chrysler also planned to phase out the Medallion sedan {{in favor of a}} <b>four-wheel-drive</b> wagon by 1990.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of launch in 2003, it became the world's first dual-clutch {{transmission}} in a series-production car, in the German-market Volkswagen Golf Mk4 R32, and shortly afterwards worldwide, in the original Audi TT 3.2. For {{the first few years}} of production, this original DSG transmission was only available in transversely oriented front-engine, front-wheel-drive and Haldex Traction-based <b>four-wheel-drive</b> vehicle layouts.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>four-wheel-drive</b> car, {{as well as}} hill-climb racer, with {{internal}} combustion engine, the Spyker 60 H.P., was presented in 1903 by Dutch brothers Jacobus and Hendrik-Jan Spijker of Amsterdam. The two-seat sports car, which {{was also the first}} ever car equipped with a six-cylinder engine, is now an exhibit in the Louwman Collection (the former Nationaal Automobiel Museum) at the Hague in The Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Audi also {{introduced}} a permanently all-wheel-driven road-going car, the Audi Quattro, in 1980. Audi's chassis engineer, Jörg Bensinger, had noticed in winter tests in Scandinavia that a vehicle {{used by the}} German Army, the Volkswagen Iltis, could beat any high-performance Audi. He proposed developing a <b>four-wheel-drive</b> car, that would {{also be used for}} rallying to improve Audi's conservative image. The Audi Quattro system became a feature on production cars.|$|E
25|$|The M7B was a one-off {{conversion}} of an M7A chassis with the fuel stored low and centrally in integral tanks {{at the sides}} of the cockpit. This was another result of Bruce McLaren's theory about improving the car's handling by altering the fuel weight distribution. Author and former McLaren secretary Eoin Young said that another purpose of the outboard tanks was to make room for a <b>four-wheel-drive</b> system.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, the Japanese company Tokyu Kurogane Kogyo built {{approximately}} 4,700 <b>four-wheel-drive</b> roadsters, {{called the}} Type 95 {{used by the}} Imperial Japanese Army from 1937 until 1944, used during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Three different bodystyles were manufactured; a 2-door roadster, a 2-door pickup truck and a 4-door phaeton, all equipped with a transfer case that engaged the front wheels, powered by a 1.3 litre, 2-cylinder, air-cooled OHV V-twin engine.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 Alfa Romeo GTV6 {{was one of}} {{the fastest}} Group A rally cars. In 1986 {{production}} of the GTV6 ceased and Alfa Romeo turned its Group A racing and rallying efforts to the 75/Milano saloons, which were based on the same rear transaxle chassis. However, 1986 also saw the GTV6 post one of its finest rallying victories when Yves Loubet's example won the Group A in the tragic 1986 Tour de Corse and placed 3rd overall among the monstrously powerful <b>four-wheel-drive</b> Group B cars.|$|E
25|$|Jeep {{advertising}} {{has always}} emphasized the vehicle's off-road capabilities. Today, the Wrangler {{is one of}} the few remaining <b>four-wheel-drive</b> vehicles with solid front and rear axles. These axles are known for their durability, strength, and articulation. New Wranglers come with a Dana 44 rear differential and a Dana 30 front differential. The upgraded Rubicon model of the JK Wrangler is equipped with electronically activated locking differentials, Dana 44 axles front and rear with 4.10 gears, a 4:1 transfer case, electronic sway bar disconnect and heavy duty suspension.|$|E
25|$|Solihull is {{the home}} of the <b>four-wheel-drive</b> car {{manufacturer}} Land Rover's main production plant (situated east of the Lode Heath district) and a range of other major companies. The village of Meriden was the famous home of the Triumph motorbike factory from 1942-1983. The former home of retail bakers Three Cooks, after it was brought out of administration in 2006, the new company Cooks the Bakery retains its HQ in Solihull. Other major companies headquartered in Solihull include pub company Enterprise Inns and mortgage and personal loan provider Paragon.|$|E
25|$|The BCNR33 GT-R version {{also had}} the same RB26DETT engine that the BNR32 was {{equipped}} with, although torque had been improved, due {{to changes in the}} turbo compressor aerodynamics, turbo dump pipe, and intercooler. The turbo core changed from a sleeve bearing to a ball bearing, but the turbine itself remained ceramic, except on N1 turbos (steel turbine, sleeve bearing). From the R33 onward, all GT-Rs received Brembo brakes. In 1995 the GT-R received an improved version of the RB26DETT, the ATTESA-ETS <b>four-wheel-drive</b> system, and Super HICAS 4-wheel steering.|$|E
25|$|The figures, {{which were}} based on data {{collected}} by police forces following accidents between 2000 and 2004 in Great Britain, showed that Defender drivers had a 1% chance of being killed or seriously injured and a 33% chance of sustaining any kind of injury. Other <b>four-wheel-drive</b> vehicles scored equally highly, and collectively these vehicles were much safer for their passengers than those in other classes such as passenger cars and MPVs. These figures {{reflect the fact that}} drivers of large mass vehicles are likely to be safer, often {{at the expense of other}} drivers if they collide with smaller cars.|$|E
25|$|The Spirit AMX was an {{innovative}} concept and was well executed from an engineering standpoint, highlighting the creative thinking and skilled engineering {{on a low}} budget that characterized AMC's efforts. The Spirit was markedly improved and performed well, but AMC was unable to overcome perception that its products were outdated. Moreover, the Spirit AMX was introduced {{the same year as}} the similar but new Fox Platform Ford Mustang. The Spirit AMX cancelled after a brief two model years, with the similar Eagle SX/4, a sporty <b>four-wheel-drive</b> successor. The Spirit AMX was the last car to wear the AMX name and has achieved popularity with AMC enthusiasts.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the AMC Eagle {{came about}} when Jeep's chief {{engineer}} joined a Concord {{body with a}} <b>four-wheel-drive</b> system. Such a vehicle was a logical step for AMC, according to then CEO Gerald C. Meyers, as a second energy crisis had hit in 1979, and sales of AMC's highly profitable truck-based Jeep line dropped, {{due in part to}} their low fuel efficiency, leaving AMC in a precarious financial position. The Eagle provided a low-cost way of bridging the gap between AMC's solid and economical, but aging, passenger car line and its well-regarded, but decidedly off-road-focused, Jeep line, as the Eagle used the existing Concord (and later, Spirit) automobile platform.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June 1969, {{eight of}} the Ramblers were entered into the passenger-car {{category}} and the two 4WD versions were in the Experimental class. Garner did not drive in the race because of a film commitment in Spain. Seven of the Ramblers finished the grueling race, taking three {{of the top five}} places in the passenger-car class. One of the <b>four-wheel-drive</b> cars came in fourth in its class. The AIR team included a car with Bob Bondurant and Tony Murphy that took first place. For one of the winning Rambler drivers, this was his first ever race and the experience launched the career of Walker Evans.|$|E
25|$|Innovations for the U12 {{included}} {{the introduction of}} Nissan's mechanical <b>four-wheel-drive</b> system, called ATTESA and the ever-popular SR20DET engine {{was introduced in the}} series 2 (HNU12) bluebirds (89–91). With the Maxima having been spun off into its own range, U12 Bluebirds were all four-cylinder models, with either a 1.6, 1.8 or 2.0 L petrol engine and also the option of an LD20 2.0l diesel. The sports and luxury versions came with a factory viscous LSD. Nissan made a turbocharged Bluebird from 1987 to 1990 named the RNU12, using the 1809 cc DOHC CA18DET that was sold in Japan and New Zealand. It also used ATTESA.|$|E
25|$|Stung by the {{criticism}} of the original Mark V (which was still hugely popular despite motoring press criticism of its styling, ride and handling), Ford facelifted the Escort and Orion in September 1992, giving the revised cars a new grille, bonnet and, in the Escort hatchback's case, a new rear end. A new 1.6L 16-valve 90bhp (66kW) Zetec engine was introduced, replacing the previous CVH. Fuel injection was now standard on all petrol models, and Ford introduced a <b>four-wheel-drive</b> variant of the RS2000, offering much improved handling over its front-wheel-drive cousins. A first for the Escort also saw the introduction of all disc brakes on all four wheels as standard on all RS2000 and XR3i models.|$|E
25|$|When {{it became}} obvious that the United States was {{eventually}} going to become involved in the war raging in Europe, the U.S. Army contacted 135 companies asking for working prototypes of a <b>four-wheel-drive</b> reconnaissance car. Only two companies responded to the request: American Bantam Car Company and Willys-Overland. The Army had set what seemed like an impossible deadline of 49 days to supply a working prototype. Willys asked for more time, but was refused. The bankrupt American Bantam Car Company had no engineering staff left on the payroll and solicited Karl Probst, a talented freelance designer from Detroit. After turning down Bantam's initial request, Probst responded to an Army request and commenced work, initially without salary, on July 17, 1940.|$|E
25|$|Daimler-Benz {{also has}} a history in four-wheel drive. In 1907 the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft had built a four-wheel-driven vehicle called Dernburg-Wagen, also {{equipped}} with four-wheel steering, that was used by German colonial civil servant, Bernhard Dernburg, in Namibia. Mercedes and BMW, in 1926, introduced a rather sophisticated four-wheel drive, the G1, the G4 and G4 following. The 1937 Mercedes-Benz G5 and BMW 325 4×4 featured full-time four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, three locking differentials, and fully independent suspension. They were produced because of a government demand for a <b>four-wheel-drive</b> passenger vehicle. The modern G-series/Wolf such as the G500 and G55 AMG still feature some of the attributes, {{with the exception of}} fully independent suspension since it hinders suspension articulation. The Unimog is another Mercedes truck.|$|E
25|$|Bolivia {{features}} a 'Che Guevara Trail' which is overseen by Care Bolivia and the Bolivian Ministry of Tourism. The trail leads by {{road from the}} Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, via the Inca site of Samaipata, onto the villages of Vallegrande and La Higuera (the 'holy grail' for Che pilgrims). The tour allows visitors to travel just as Che and his comrades did – by mule or on foot through rocky forested terrain – or in <b>four-wheel-drive</b> vehicles along unpaved roads. The trail visits places of historical interest including the site of Che's guerrilla camp, the school where after 11 months as a guerrilla he was captured and killed, and his former grave. Visitors also are able to meet local people who met or traveled with Guevara.|$|E
