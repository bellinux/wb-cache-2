500|$|Ravines {{within the}} Pine Bush contain mixed forests of pine-northern {{hardwoods}} and Appalachian oak-pine. The pine-hardwood forests {{are dominated by}} species such as white pine and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), mixed with scattered red maple, a shrub layer dominated by witch-hazel (<b>Hamamelis</b> <b>virginiana),</b> and a herbaceous layer composed {{of a variety of}} herbs, mosses, and lichens. The Appalachian oak-pine forest has a tree canopy of one or more oak species, primarily black oak, white oak, and red oak (Quercus velutina, Quercus alba, and Quercus rubra); these are mixed with pitch pine and some white pine, and a shrub layer dominated by heath shrubs, typically blueberries and black huckleberry. Marshes and wetlands occur along the northern boundary of the Pine Bush and along the bottoms of ravines.

5000|$|<b>Hamamelis</b> <b>virginiana,</b> {{also known}} as Witch Hazel. Native Americans {{produced}} witch hazel extract by boiling the stems of the shrub and producing a decoction, which was used to treat swellings, inflammations, and tumors. [...] Early Puritan settlers in New England adopted this remedy from the natives, and its use became widely established in the United States. It is a flowering plant with multiple species native to North America. It has been widely used by Native Americans for its medicinal benefits, leading white settlers to incorporate it into their own medical practices. An extract of witch hazel stems is used to treat sore muscles, skin and eye inflammation and to stop bleeding. Witch hazel is utilized by many tribes, including the Menominee for sore legs of tribesmen who participate in sporting games, the Osage for skin ulcers and sores, the Potawatomi in sweat lodges for sore muscles and the Iroquois in tea for coughs and colds.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{deciduous}} large shrub {{growing to}} 4 m tall, spreading by stoloniferous root sprouts. The leaves are oval, 7-13 cm long and 6.7-13 cm broad, cuneate to slightly oblique at the base, acute or rounded at the apex, with a wavy-toothed or shallowly lobed margin, and a short, stout petiole 7-15 mm long; they are dark green above, and glaucous beneath, and often persist {{into the early}} winter. The flowers are deep to bright red, rarely yellow, with four ribbon-shaped petals 7-10 mm long and four short stamens, and grow in clusters; flowering begins in mid winter and continues until early spring (the Latin word vernalis means spring-flowering). The fruit is a hard woody capsule 10-15 mm long, which splits explosively at the apex at maturity one year after pollination, ejecting the two shiny black seeds up to 10 m distant from the parent plant. Although often occurring with the related <b>Hamamelis</b> <b>virginiana,</b> it does not intergrade, and can be distinguished by its flowering in late winter (December to March in its native range), not fall.|$|E
