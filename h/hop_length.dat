As in the undirected graph problem, this Euclidean minimax path problem can be solved efficiently by finding a Euclidean minimum spanning tree: every path in the tree is a minimax path. However, the problem becomes more complicated when a path is desired that not only minimizes the <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> but also, among paths with the same <b>hop</b> <b>length,</b> minimizes or approximately minimizes the total length of the path. The solution can be approximated using geometric spanners.|$|E
30|$|Hence, it was {{concluded}} that average <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> rapidly increased as assortativity approached its maximum value mainly because there were fewer shortcut edges and a few shortcut edges can markedly reduce average <b>hop</b> <b>length,</b> as demonstrated in a previous study (Newman 2000). However, these types of shortcut edges are likely to be lost when assortativity is very high because a clustered topology of the type shown in Fig. 4 emerged. The observations indicated that the network lost these shortcut edges when the value of r was very high. Consequently, average <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> rapidly increased as assortativity approached a maximum value.|$|E

The analysis uses Laws-Parsons values for the a and b parameters of A(dB/Km) =a Rb (mm/hr), and considers the two cases of (i) limited rain-cell and (ii) "entire hop in rain". The result is a family of fade margin vs. <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> curves for various reliability objectives, obtained {{for each of the}} 14 -rain zones at a frequency of 50 GHz. A simple frequency scaling rule is also devised to enable similar analysis at frequencies in the range 30 - 70 GHz. It is particularly concluded that an extended <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> of 10 - 20 Km is possible with reasonable reliability if the reduced cell-size concept is applied. If the entire hop is in rain, a limited <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> of one to five kms can't be exceeded even with modest reliability.

30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{robustness}} of interconnected networks, it is inappropriate to use the giant component size because {{only a limited number}} of nodes include edges between networks, and the removal of other nodes corresponds to a considerably small influence on the performance of assortativity between networks. Removing nodes with the fore-mentioned interconnected edges could constitute a future research topic. However, all the nodes remain connected until all interconnecting edges are removed unless the endpoint nodes include extreme bottlenecks within the corresponding belonging network. Therefore, in order to evaluate the effect of interconnecting edges, average <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> between networks was used while removing endpoint nodes of the edges. With {{respect to the}} average <b>hop</b> <b>length,</b> paths between two nodes in the same network were ignored because they were barely influenced by the edges between networks. Thus, an interconnected network was considered robust if it retained its original value of average <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> following the removal of a few endpoint nodes.|$|E

40|$|Localization is a {{fundamental}} problem in wireless sensor networks and its accuracy impacts the efficiency of location-aware protocols and applications, such as routing and storage. Most previous localization algorithms assume that sensors are distributed in regular areas without holes or obstacles, which often does not reflect real-world conditions, especially for outdoor deployment of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called Reliable Anchor-based Localization (RAL), which can greatly reduce the localization error due to the irregular deployment areas. We first provide theoretical analysis of the minimum <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> for uniformly distributed networks and then show its close approximation to empirical results, which can assist {{in the construction of}} a reliable minimal hop-length table offline. Using this table, we are able to tell whether a path is severely detoured and compute a more accurate average <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> as the basis for distance estimation. At runtime, the RAL scheme 1) utilizes the reliable minimal <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> from the table as the threshold to differentiate between reliable anchors and unreliable ones, and 2) allows each sensor to determine its position utilizing only distance constraints obtained from reliable anchors. The simulation results show that RAL can effectively filter out unreliable anchors and therefore improve the localization accuracy. Department of Computin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are {{evolving}} {{to be the}} {{key technology}} of the future. They aim to provide broadband wireless internet service to a large community of users by exploiting multi-hop wireless communications between Access Points thus replacing wired infrastructure. However, in multihop networks, flows spanning multiple hops suffer from extremely low throughputs compared to flows traversing fewer hops. In particular, some shorter <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> flows can severely degrade the performance of flows traversing more hops. This is highly undesirable in the envisioned scenarios of mesh networks. In this paper, we propose an elegant most frequently seen cache based traffic regulator that identifies and appropriately regulates the rate of such flows.

30|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of assortativity on the {{robustness}} and efficiency of interconnected networks was investigated. This involved constructing a network that possessed the desired degree of assortativity. Additionally, an interconnected network was constructed wherein the assortativity between component networks possessed the desired value. With respect to single networks, {{the results indicated that}} a decrease in assortativity provided low <b>hop</b> <b>length,</b> high information diffusion efficiency, and distribution of communication load on edges. The study also revealed that excessive assortativity led to poor network performance. In the study, the assortativity between networks was defined and the following results were demonstrated: assortative connections between networks lowered the average <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> and enhanced information diffusion efficiency, whereas disassortative connections between networks distributed the communication loads of internetwork links and enhanced robustness. Furthermore, it is necessary to carefully adjust assortativity based on the node degree distribution of networks. Finally, the application of the results to the design of robust and efficient information networks was discussed.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a novel {{heuristic}} algorithm for routing and wavelength assignment in virtual wavelength path routed WDM network. In this paper, we have considered a wavelength routed WDM optical network and the Heuristic algorithm is implemented on it. The term heuristics is used for algorithm, which finds solution among all possible ones, but they do not guarantee that the best solution will be found. Therefore they may be considered as approximate and not accurate algorithms. Heuristic algorithm has its own structure, so it never runs slowly and never gives very bad results. The results are always close to the best solution. In this paper the objective of this algorithm is to minimize the requirement of wavelength in any network topology demanded by network traffic. It also minimizes the <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> between source and destination nodes in the traffic. As wavelength and number of hops get reduced, the cost of the network also gets reduced and maximizes the resource utilization. In the first phase of this algorithm, we assigned minimum <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> to each route demanded by traffic and also assigned wavelengths to each route. In second phase of algorithm effective rerouting is performed {{to reduce the number of}} wavelengths required in the network and it also minimizes the <b>hop</b> <b>length</b> of each rerouted route. By minimizing wavelength requirement, the need of wavelength converter gets reduced, so that the network cost is also reduced.
