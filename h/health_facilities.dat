5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural <b>health</b> <b>facilities.</b> Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E

40|$|Delivering in <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> {{under the}} {{supervision}} of skilled birth attendant is an important way of mitigating impacts of delivery complications. Empirical evidence suggests that decision-making autonomy is aligned with holistic wellbeing especially in the aspect of maternal and child health. The objective of this paper was {{to examine the relationship between}} women’s health decision-making autonomy and place of delivery in Ghana. We extracted data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. Descriptive and logistic regression techniques were applied. The results indicated that women with health decision-making autonomy have higher tendency of <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> delivery as compared to those who are not autonomous [OR = 1. 27, CI = 1. 09 – 1. 48]. However, those who have final say on household large purchases [OR = 0. 71, CI = 0. 59 – 0. 84] and those having final say on visits [OR = 0. 86, CI = 0. 73 – 1. 01] were less probable to deliver in <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> than those without such decision-making autonomy. Consistent with existing evidence, wealthier, urban, and highly educated women had higher inclination of <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> delivery. This study has stressed the need for interventions aimed at enhancing <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> delivery to target women without health decision-making autonomy and women with low education and wealth status, as this can play essential role in enhancing <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> delivery...|$|R

5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{provided}} for a cash grant of $12.5 million (about $94 million at 2007 prices) to be disbursed to the Alaskan {{government in a}} number of phases, to fund the construction of mental <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> in the territory. To meet the ongoing costs of the program, the bill transferred one million acres (4,000km²) of federally owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant-in-aid—the federal government owned about 99% of the land of Alaska at the time. The trust would then {{be able to use the}} assets of the transferred land (principally mineral and forestry rights) to obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental health program. Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood.|$|E

40|$|Background: As making {{preparations}} for birth and <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> delivery are behaviours linked to positive maternal and newborn health outcomes, we aimed {{to describe what}} birth preparations were made, where women delivered, and why. Methods: Outcomes were tabulated using data derived from a repeated sample (continuous) quantitative household survey of women aged 13 – 49 who had given birth in the past year. Insights into why behaviours took place emerged from analysis of in-depth interviews (12) and birth narratives (36) with recently delivered mothers and male partners. Results: Five hundred-twenty three women participated in the survey from April 2012 –November 2013. Ninety-five percent (496 / 523) of women made any birth {{preparations for}} their last pregnancy. Commonly prepared birth items were cotton gauze (93 %), a plastic cover to deliver on (84 %), gloves (72 %), clean clothes (70 %), and money (42 %). Qualitative data suggest that preparation of items used directly during delivery was perceived as necessary to facilitate good care and prevent disease transmission. Sixty-eight percent of women gave birth at a <b>health</b> <b>facility,</b> 30 % at home, and 2 % {{on the way to}} a <b>health</b> <b>facility.</b> Qualitative data suggested that <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> delivery was viewed positively and that women were inclined to go to a <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> because of a perception of: increased education about delivery and birth preparedness; previous <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> delivery; and better availability and accessibility of facilities in recent years. Perceived barriers: were a lack of money; absent <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> staff or poor provider attitudes; women perceiving that they were unable to go to a <b>health</b> <b>facility</b> or arrange transport on their own; or a lack of support of pregnant women from their partners. Conclusions: The majority of women made at least some birth preparations and gave birth in a <b>health</b> <b>facility.</b> Functional items needed for birth seem to be given precedence over practices like saving money. As such, maintaining education about the importance of these practices, with an emphasis on emergency preparedness, would be valuable. Alongside education delivered as part of focussed antenatal care, community-based interventions that aim to increase engagement of men in birth preparedness, and support agency among women, are recommended...|$|R

5|$|Health {{indicators}} in Ratanakiri are {{the worst}} in Cambodia. Life expectancy is 39 years for men and 43 years for women. Malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal parasites, cholera, diarrhea, and vaccine-preventable diseases are endemic. Ratanakiri has very high rates of maternal and child mortality; in Ratanakiri and neighboring Mondulkiri (whose figures were combined {{in the most recent}} survey), over 10% of children die before the age of five. Ratanakiri also has the country's highest rates of severe malnutrition. Ratanakiri residents' poor health can be attributed to a variety of factors, including poverty, remoteness of villages, poor quality medical services, and language and cultural barriers that prevent Khmer Loeu from obtaining medical care. The province has one referral hospital, 10 health centers, and 17 health posts. Medical equipment and supplies are minimal, and most <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> are staffed by nurses or midwives, who are often poorly trained and irregularly paid.|$|E

Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's <b>health</b> <b>facilities,</b> particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E
5|$|Healthcare in Tripura {{features}} a {{universal health care}} system run by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the Government of Tripura. The health care infrastructure {{is divided into three}} tiers– the primary health care network, a secondary care system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing speciality and super speciality care. As of 2010–11, there are 17 hospitals, 11 rural hospitals and community health centres, 79 primary health centres, 635 sub-centres/dispensaries, 7 blood banks and 7 blood storage centres in the state. Homeopathic and Ayurvedic styles of medicine are also popular in the state. The National Family Health Survey– 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20 per cent of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government <b>health</b> <b>facilities,</b> and prefers private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less compared to the national level, where 65.6 per cent do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor quality of care as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facility, long waiting time, and inconvenient hours of operation. As of 2010, the state's performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate is better than the national average. The state is vulnerable to epidemics of Malaria, Diarrhea, Japanese Encephalitis and Meningitis. In summer 2014 the state witnessed a major Malaria outbreak.|$|E
