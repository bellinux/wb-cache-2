50|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} by Deloitte, most of the UK-based asset managers think that the AIFM Directive could reduce the competitiveness of the <b>EU's</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> industry because of the compliance the regulations impose on the industry. In addition, these managers from the hedge fund, private equity and real estate sectors believe that the directive will reduce the number of non-EU managers operating within the EU. The AIFMD passed after contentious negotiations, especially between UK and French authorities, and because of its third-country provisions, which attracted considerable interest and engagement from U.S. authorities.|$|R
2500|$|In the EU, {{managers}} {{are subject to}} the <b>EU's</b> Directive on <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> Managers (AIFMD). According to the EU, the aim of the directive is to provide greater monitoring and control of <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>funds.</b> AIFMD requires all EU hedge fund managers to register with national regulatory authorities and to disclose more information, on a more frequent basis. It also directs hedge fund managers to hold larger amounts of capital. AIFMD also introduced a [...] "passport" [...] for hedge funds authorised in one EU country to operate throughout the EU. The scope of AIFMD is broad and encompasses managers located within the EU as well as non-EU managers that market their funds to European investors. An aspect of AIFMD which challenges established practices in the hedge funds sector is the potential restriction of remuneration through bonus deferrals and clawback provisions.|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation seeks {{to assess and}} address the potential contribution of the hedge fund industry to financial instability. In so doing, the dissertation investigates three main questions. What are the contributions of hedge funds to financial instability? What is the optimal regulatory strategy to address the potential contribution of hedge funds to financial instability? And do new regulations in the U. S. and the EU address the contribution of hedge funds to financial instability? With respect to financial stability concerns, {{it is argued that}} despite their benefits, hedge funds can contribute to financial instability. Hedge funds’ size and leverage, their interconnectedness with Large Complex Financial Institutions (LCFIs), and the likelihood of herding behavior in the industry can potentially undermine financial stability. Nonetheless, the data on hedge funds’ size and leverage suggest that these features are far from being systemically important. In contrast, the empirical evidence on the interconnectedness of hedge funds with LCFIs and their herding behavior is mixed. Based on these findings, the thesis focuses on one particular aspect of hedge fund regulation: direct vs. indirect regulation. In this respect, a major contribution of the thesis to the literature consists in the explicit discussion of the relationships between hedge funds and other market participants. Specifically, the thesis locates the domain of the indirect regulation in the inter-linkages between hedge funds and prime brokers. Accordingly, the thesis argues that the indirect regulation is likely to address the contribution of hedge funds to systemic risk without compromising their benefits to financial markets. The thesis further conducts a comparative study of the regulatory responses to the potential contribution of hedge funds to financial instability through studying the <b>EU</b> Directive on <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> Managers (AIFMD) and the hedge fund-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Directive on <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> Managers (AIFM Directive 2011 / 61 /EU) in 2013 means a radical transformation of the EU regulatory landscape for the whole <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>fund</b> industry.

The research is based on the case of Malta, which is a quickly growing financial centre. The main findings are based on an analysis of questionnaire responses conducted with key players in the fund industry regulated and licensed by the Malta Financial Services Authority. This study provides an extensive analysis of the AIFMD and its impact on Malta’s financial service industry. It has highlighted various factors that will have a positive or negative impact on the industry resulting from the AIFMD. The paper provides recommendations for further development of the Maltese fund industry {{in the context of the}} AIFMD that can be partially applied to other fund domiciles. N/...|$|R

The respective chapters provide an analysis of the most important aspects of regulation of <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>funds,</b> which I consider as crucial for collective investment undertakings and its (even only potential) investors. In {{a large portion of the}} thesis I focus on the definition of <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> to clarify the possible modes of operation and distinguish them from their earlier regulated standard counterparts. In the first of eight chapters I introduce this topic in the historical context, which provides a brief excursion into the progress of regulation of collective investment at the European and Czech level, and further explain the reasons which led to creation of a unified regulation for collective investment business. The second chapter describes the current regulatory framework in accordance with the European regulation, based primarily on the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> Managers Directive (AIFMD) and its subsequent transposition into the Czech Act on Investment Companies and <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> (ICIFA) [...] . ...|$|R

The main aim of the thesis is to analyze the new legal regulation of qualified investor funds in the Czech Republic and to assess {{on the basis of}} changes adopted in which direction the legal regulation has been shifted.

Part Two illustrates the development of qualified investor funds in the Czech Republic and includes the major news introduced by the Act on investment companies and <b>investment</b> <b>funds.</b> Chapter Two analyzes the legal regulation of <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>funds</b> on the <b>EU</b> level, namely directive AIFM, regulation EuVECA and regulation EuSEF, and outlines its basic concepts, backgrounds and objectives.
