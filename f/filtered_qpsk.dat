40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} a new trellis pruning method which uses nonlinear convolutional coding for peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction of <b>filtered</b> <b>QPSK</b> and 16 -QAM modulations. The Nyquist filter {{is viewed as}} a convolutional encoder that controls the analog waveforms of the filter output directly. Pruning some edges of the encoder trellis can effectively reduce the PAPR. The only tradeoff is a slightly lower channel capacity and increased complexity. The paper presents simulation results of the pruning action and the resulting PAPR, and also discusses the decoding algorithm and the capacity of the filtered and pruned QPSK and 16 -QAM modulations on the AWGN channel. Simulation results show that the pruning method reduces the PAPR significantly without much damage to capacity. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{algorithmic}} noise-tolerance (ANT) technique referred to as reduced precision redundancy (RPR). RPR requires a reduced precision replica whose output can be employed as the corrected output in case the original system computes erroneously. When combined with voltage overscaling (VOS), the resulting soft digital signal pro-cessing system achieves up to 60 % and 44 % energy savings with no loss in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for receive <b>filtering</b> in a <b>QPSK</b> system and the butterfly of fast Fourier transform (FFT) in a WLAN OFDM system, respectively. These energy savings are with respect to optimally scaled (i. e., the supply voltage equals the critical voltage dd crit) present day systems. Further, we show that the RPR technique is able to maintain the output SNR for error rates of up to 0. 09 /sample and 0. 06 /sample in an finite impulse response filter and a FFT block, respectively.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns interference suppression techniques in two different communication systems. In the first part we study fiber-optic systems with practical non-ideal transmitters and receivers, which give rise to intersymbol interference (ISI). A unique property of this ISI is that {{it depends on the}} transition pattern of the transmitted symbols, which changes for different transmitter configurations. The resulting asymmetric signal constellations of the detected symbols lead to unequal bit error rates (BER) in quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) systems and unequal symbol error rates (SER) in differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) systems. By deriving the theoretical BER and SER for QPSK and DQPSK systems, respectively, we explain these phenomena, which have not been described previously. Based on the analytic results, system modifications are proposed to mitigate the performance degradations. These modifications require no hardware add-on but merely the adjustment of transmitter coefficients or receiver decision boundaries. With our solutions, the overall BER performance can be improved by up to 2 dB and 3 dB for QPSK and DQPSK systems, respectively. The analytic results {{can also be used to}} optimize the bandwidth of the receiver low-pass <b>filter</b> for <b>QPSK</b> systems, or to improve channel mutual information for DQPSK systems. The second part of the thesis presents a fixed-point successive interference canceller (SIC) from an implementation point of view. A SIC is applied to suppress multiple-access interference (MAI) in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. The minimum precision of the fixed-point SIC for a system to achieve satisfactory performance is determined and is used to implement an SIC in a rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) digital signal processor. A model of the fixed-point SIC is developed to predict the system performance at a given precision, which greatly simplifies the design procedure. We show that the theoretical results agree well with simulations for a moderately loaded system, especially with a high precision, which is of most interest...|$|R
40|$|Power {{amplifiers}} (PAs) {{are important}} components of communication systems and are inherently nonlinear. When a non-constant modulus signal {{goes through a}} nonlinear PA, spectral regrowth (broadening) appears in the PA output, which in turn causes adjacent channel interference (ACI). Stringent limits on the ACI are imposed by regulatory bodies, and thus {{the extent of the}} PA nonlinearity must be controlled. PA linearization is often necessary to suppress spectral regrowth, contain adjacent channel interference, and reduce bit error rate (BER). This dissertation addresses the following aspects of power amplifier research: modeling, linearization, and spectral regrowth analysis. We explore the passband and baseband PA input/output relationships and show that they manifest differently when the PA exhibits long-term, short-term, or no memory effects. The so-called quasi-memoryless case is especially clarified. Four particular nonlinear models with memory are further investigated. We provide experimental results to support our analysis. The benefits of using the orthogonal polynomials as opposed to the conventional polynomials are explored, in the context of digital baseband PA modeling and predistorter design. A closed-form expression for the orthogonal polynomial basis is derived. We demonstrate the improvement in numerical stability {{associated with the use of}} orthogonal polynomials for predistortion. Spectral analysis can help to evaluate the suitability of a given PA for amplifying certain signals or to assist in predistortion linearization algorithm design. With the orthogonal polynomials that we derived, spectral analysis of the nonlinear PA becomes a straightforward task. We carry out nonlinear spectral analysis with digitally modulated signal as input. We demonstrate an analytical approach for evaluating the power spectra of <b>filtered</b> <b>QPSK</b> and OQPSK signals after nonlinear amplification. Many communications devices are nonlinear and have a peak power or peak amplitude constraint. In addition to possibly amplifying the useful signal, the nonlinearity also generates distortions. We focus on signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) optimization within the family of amplitude limited memoryless nonlinearities. We obtain a link between the capacity of amplitude-limited nonlinear channels with Gaussian noise to the SNDR. Ph. D. Committee Chair: G.
