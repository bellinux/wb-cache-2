40|$|Introduction: Dance {{teachers}} {{are exposed to}} high sound intensities. Aim: To verify the sound intensity of music used by <b>dance</b> teachers during <b>classes.</b> Method: This was a transversal and prospective study. Dance teachers were evaluated with a sociodemographic questionnaire, and sound intensity level measurements were taken at the beginning, middle, and end of <b>dance</b> <b>classes.</b> Results: The sample comprised 35 teachers (average age, 31. 8 years). The duration of their career as dance teachers was 1 - 37 years; they worked daily for approximately 1 - 10 h. Among the classes followed, there were 15 (42. 85 %) classical ballet classes, 4 (11. 42 %) tap dancing lessons, 5 (14. 28 %) jazz <b>dance</b> <b>classes,</b> 2 (5. 71) Arab dance lessons, 6 (17. 14 %) street <b>dance</b> <b>classes,</b> and 3 (8. 57 %) ballroom dancing lessons. The average values observed at the beginning, middle, {{and end of the}} classes were 80. 91 dB (A), 83. 22 dB (A), and 85. 19 dB (A), respectively. The music played in the street <b>dance</b> <b>classes</b> exposed teachers to the highest sound intensity. Conclusion: The average level of sound intensity of the <b>dance</b> <b>classes</b> in this study was either below or equal to the limit considered harmful for hearing health. Analysis of different class types showed that the sound densities of street, ballroom, and tap <b>dance</b> <b>classes</b> were above the recommended limits...|$|R

500|$|Bowie met dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and {{enrolled}} in his <b>dance</b> <b>class</b> at the London Dance Centre.

His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing I had ever seen, ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus." [...] Studying the dramatic arts under Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, meanwhile, the Bowie-penned [...] "Over the Wall We Go" [...] became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie composition, [...] "Silly Boy Blue", was released by Billy Fury the following year.

Playing acoustic guitar, Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime.
