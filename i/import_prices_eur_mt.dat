Abstract 1 New Zealand and Australia have recently had large <b>import</b> <b>price</b> increases {{on the back}} of currency depreciations. Despite these large <b>import</b> <b>price</b> shocks, consumer prices have not risen as strongly as would be suggested by previously accepted relationships. The recent prolonged period of general US dollar strength has also raised the profile of exchange rate and <b>import</b> <b>price</b> pass-through {{in a number of other}} countries. We re-estimate short- and long-run <b>import</b> <b>price</b> pass-through coefficients for New Zealand consumer prices. The data confirms that the estimated coefficients are smaller than previously thought: a 10 per cent increase in <b>import</b> <b>prices</b> will lead to a 0. 5 per cent increase in consumer prices within the first quarter, and to a 1. 5 per cent increase over the long-run. This result suggests that we should not necessarily expect the recent exchange rate depreciation to result in further consumer price increases. Similarly, if the exchange rate were to appreciate in the future, we should not expect large decreases in consumer prices as a direct result of the exchange rate appreciation. ...|$|R
