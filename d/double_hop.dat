Plyometric is one of the training methods that can increase explosive power. There are many models of plyometric training including single leg <b>hop</b> progression and <b>double</b> leg <b>hop</b> progression. This research was experimental using match subject design techniques. The subjects of this study were 39 students who joined basketball school club. There were 3 groups in this study: Group 1 were 13 students who given sin¬gle leg hop progression exercise, Group 2 were 13 students who given <b>double</b> legs <b>hop</b> progression exercise, Group 3 were 13 students who given conventional exercise.

40|$|We {{present results}} {{concerning}} the cation vacancy diffusion mechanisms occurring on the NiO(001) surface {{along with their}} corresponding migration energies. Using a rigid ion potential and molecular dynamics simulations {{we found that the}} cation vacancy diffusion is the main diffusion process in this surface employing the simple and two different <b>double</b> <b>hopping</b> mechanisms. Although the hopping rates of the latter are about two times lower than that of simple jumps, at high temperatures their contribution to the total vacancy diffusion coefficient is comparable with that of simple jumps. In addition, for all mechanisms saturation is found in the Arrhenius diagrams above a temperature T-s = 2850 K. We attributed this behavior to collective and correlated movements of the surface atoms that are activated from multi-phonon processes taking place above T-s. Similar behavior was found recently in the case of metals. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in designing cellular cognitive radio (CR) networks is the avoidance of secondary user (SU) interference to so called primary users (PUs) operating in the licensed bands.

Recently, dynamic frequency hopping (DFH) mechanisms have been suggested to enable reliable PU detection and continuous SU operation at the same time. Applying DFH in a multi-cell environment adds the challenge of mitigating co-channel interference (CCI). In this paper, we introduce a new DFH approach for cellular CR networks to allow reliable PU detection and continuous SU operation while avoiding CCI: <b>double</b> <b>hopping</b> (DH).
