5|$|In the north, 1 RAR was {{inserted}} into its new landing zone—LZ March— to the south-west. With B Company securing the site, the battalion moved on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{line of departure}} but not before they were mistakenly engaged by US helicopter gunships and artillery fire. However, after the Australians established communications, the shelling was halted and they began their advance. No sooner had the lead elements—D Company {{under the command of}} Major Ian Fisher—emerged into the cleared area that was originally to have been used as the battalion's LZ, when the forward platoon came under fire from Viet Cong positions in the tree-line on the north-east corner. In the action which followed, six Australians from 12 Platoon were wounded, including platoon commander Lieutenant Jim Bourke, who was shot through the jaw but remained in command until he passed out from loss of blood. Meanwhile, two medics who attempted to move forward to treat the casualties were themselves shot and killed.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{suggests}} that Hank and Jacob return a paltry {{sum of the}} money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. While travelling on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods, the brothers come across an old man on a snowmobile. Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the old man's murder.|$|E
5|$|The {{figures of}} both Venus and Cupid were {{significantly}} altered during the painting process, {{the result of}} the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.|$|E

5|$|The retreat quickly {{broke down}} into a {{confused}} and disorganized rout. Task Force Smith suffered its highest casualties during this withdrawal as its soldiers were most exposed to enemy fire. The surviving members of Task Force Smith reached Battery A's position. The artillerymen disabled the five remaining howitzers by removing their sights and breechblocks and retired in good order with {{the remains of the}} task force on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern outskirts of Osan, where most of the unit's hidden transport vehicles were found intact. The vehicles, unmolested by the North Korean forces, departed for Pyongtaek and Cheonan, picking up stragglers along the way, eventually joining units of the 24th Infantry Division that had established a second line of defense.|$|E
5|$|With Japan's {{entry into}} the war {{following}} the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, it became {{more likely that the}} division would be called upon to undertake active service overseas, and the division was mobilised for war. In early January 1942, Major General Stanley Savige, an experienced officer who had commanded the 17th Brigade in combat against the Germans in the Middle East earlier in the war, took over command of the division. Savige set about the task of preparing the division for combat and he began by removing officers that he did not think were physically fit enough or competent to lead in battle and replacing them with men who had gained experience in AIF units. A comprehensive training program was established and in April 1942 the division was assigned to the Australian I Corps, and in order to enable divisional exercises to begin, the 3rd Division moved to Bonegilla, Victoria. In order to toughen the men up, Savige decided that they would march on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new camp.|$|E

25|$|After {{a week at}} Mudros, the {{battalion}} was transferred to Egypt, landing at Alexandria on 18 December. On 30 December it was moved by rail and <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Western Desert {{in support of the}} cavalry and armoured cars operating against the Senussi before returning to camp near Cairo in January 1916.

25|$|By mid January, the SS and Nazi-controlled police units {{had begun}} forcing {{thousands}} of camp prisoners from Poland, East Prussia, Silesia and Pomerania to walk westward {{away from the}} advancing Red Army. The death marches, which took place over hundreds of kilometers in sub-zero conditions without food and medicine, resulted in thousands of concentration camp prisoners and allied POWs dying on route. It is estimated that in March and April 1945 at least 250,000 {{men and women were}} marched on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heartland of Germany and Austria sometimes for weeks at a time.|$|E

Appointed colonel of the 48th Foot on 6 April 1746, he took part in Culloden later that month during the Jacobite Rebellion. His next battle, in July 1747, was at Lauffeld, in which he {{narrowly}} escaped death, being captured by the French but released on parole a few days later. In July 1749, he transferred from the 48th <b>Foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 34th Foot, and served with his regiment in the garrison of Menorca in 1751.|$|E

A single, vertical, faired interplane strut on each side braced the rear spar of the upper wing to the lower forward spar. Towards its top a metal faired-in oblique strut braced the forward, upper spar and there was a similar arrangement at its <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear spar. To minimise drag, there were no conventional cross bracing flying wires but instead a single, faired diagonal strut from the top of each interplane struts to the corresponding lower fuselage longeron.|$|E
25|$|After the Nazi German {{occupation}} of France in 1940, Beckett joined the French Resistance, {{in which he}} worked as a courier. On several occasions {{over the next two years}} he was nearly caught by the Gestapo. In August 1942, his unit was betrayed and he and Suzanne fled south on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> safety of the small village of Roussillon, in the Vaucluse département in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. There he continued to assist the Resistance by storing armaments in the back yard of his home. During the two years that Beckett stayed in Roussillon he indirectly helped the Maquis sabotage the German army in the Vaucluse mountains, though he rarely spoke about his wartime work in later life.|$|E

It leads through a region of esparto grass, white asparagus, common asphodel and germander.|$|E
25|$|The next ghetto {{liquidation}} action {{took place}} {{less than a}} month later in Łomazy lacking a rail line. The infants, the old and the infirm were shot by Battalion 101 already during the early morning roundups on 17 August 1942. Later that day, the Hiwi shooters arrived at the main square, and some 1,700 ghetto prisoners were marched on <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hały forest outside the town, where the stronger Jewish men prepared a trench with entrance on one side. The killings of stripped naked Jews lasted till 7pm. The Ukrainian Trawnikis got so drunk that the policemen from the First, Second and Third Platoon under Lieutenant Hartwig Gnade had to continue shooting by themselves in half-a-metre of groundwater and blood.|$|E
25|$|A reverse sweep is a crossbatted sweep shot {{played in}} the {{opposite}} direction to the standard sweep, thus instead of sweeping the ball to the leg side, it is swept to the off side, towards backward point or third man. The batsman may also swap his hands on the bat handle to make the stroke easier to execute. The batsman may also bring his back <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front therefore making it more like a traditional sweep. The advantage of a reverse sweep is that it effectively reverses the fielding positions and thus is very difficult to set a field to. It is also a risky shot for the batsman as it increases the chance of LBW and also is quite easy to top edge to a fielder.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, funding {{had been}} agreed in the 1850s {{for a more}} {{detailed}} survey of towns and cities. From 1850-53, twenty-nine towns were mapped at 1:528 (10 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mile). From 1855 1:500 (10.56 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mile) became the preferred scale. London and some seventy other towns (mainly in the north) were already being mapped at 1:1056 (5 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mile). Just under 400 towns with a population of over 4000 were surveyed at one of these three scales, most at 1:500. Publication of the town plans was completed by 1895. The London first edition was completed and published in 326 sheets in the 1860s-70s; a second edition of 759 sheets was completed and brought out in the early 1890s; further revisions (incomplete coverage of London) followed between 1906 and 1937. Very few other towns and cities saw a second edition of the town plans.|$|R
