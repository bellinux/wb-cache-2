50|$|<b>Ethion</b> {{remains a}} major {{contaminant}} {{of the environment}} in among others Australia because of (former) usage in agriculture. However, there are some microbes that can convert <b>ethion.</b> The Pseudomonas and Azospirillum species were able to digest <b>ethion</b> when cultivated in minimal salts medium. A significant decrease of the <b>Ethion</b> concentration was observed. On top of that, <b>ethion</b> was the only available source of carbon. After analysis of the compounds present in the media after digestion of <b>ethion</b> through bacteria, {{it turned out that}} no abiotic hydrolytic degradation products of <b>Ethion</b> (like <b>ethion</b> dioxon and <b>ethion</b> monoxon) were present. The biodigestion of <b>ethion</b> is probably used to support rapid growth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethion</b> can undergo {{biotransformation}} in {{the human}} body, this happens in the liver. <b>Ethion</b> undergoes desulfurization here and is thereby changed in its active metabolite: <b>ethion</b> monoxon. This enzyme cytochrome P-450 catalyzes this step. <b>Ethion</b> monoxon is an inhibitor of the neuro enzyme cholinesterase (ChE), because it contains an active oxygen. Because ChE can dephosphorylate organophosphate, in the next step of the biotransformation <b>ethion</b> monoxon is dephosphorylated and ChE is phosphorylated. The {{next step in the}} biotransformation is not yet completely known, and that this happens via esterases in the blood and liver (1). Besides the dephosphorylation of <b>ethion</b> monoxon by ChE, {{it is likely that the}} <b>ethion</b> monoxon is partially oxidized toward <b>ethion</b> dioxon.|$|E
50|$|A study among {{chickens}} reveals {{more about}} the <b>ethion</b> distribution in the body. After 10 days of <b>ethion</b> exposure liver, muscle, and fat tissues were examined. In all three cases <b>ethion</b> or <b>ethion</b> derivatives were present, indicating that it is widely spread in the body. Also chicken eggs were investigated. It {{was found that the}} egg white reaches a steady <b>ethion</b> derivative concentration after four days while the concentration in yolk was still rising after ten days. Also in the investigated chicken about six polar water-soluble metabolites were found.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethion</b> (C9H22O4P2S4) is an {{organophosphate}} insecticide. <b>Ethion</b> {{is known}} to affect a neural enzyme called acetylcholinesterase and prevent it from working.|$|E
50|$|LD50 {{values for}} pure <b>ethion</b> in rats of 208 mg/kg, and for {{technical}} <b>ethion</b> of 21 to 191 mg/kg. Other reported oral LD50 values are 40 mg/kg in mice and guinea pigs. Furthermore, inhalation of <b>ethion</b> is very toxic. During one study which {{was looking at}} technical-grade <b>ethion,</b> an LC50 of 2.31 mg/m^3 was found in male rats and of 0.45 mg/m^3 in female rats. Other data reported a 4-hour LC50 in rats of 0.864 mg/L.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, <b>Ethion</b> {{was first}} {{registered}} in the USA as an insecticide. However, the usage of <b>ethion</b> has varied during the years due to overall crop values and weather conditions. For example, 1999 was a very dry year; the drought reduced yields, and the usage of <b>ethion</b> became less economically advantageous. Since 1998, serious studies for the risk assessment of <b>ethion</b> have been conducted by (among others) the EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency). The risk assessments for <b>ethion</b> were presented at a July 14, 1999 briefing with stakeholders in Florida, which was followed by an opportunity for public comment on risk management for this pesticide.|$|E
50|$|In a {{parallel}} study in goats, radioactive labeled <b>ethion</b> with incorporated 14C was used. After {{identification of the}} 14C residues in organs of the goats like the liver, heart, kidneys, muscles and fat tissue, it appeared that 0.03 ppm or less of the 14C compounds present was non-metabolized <b>ethion.</b> The metabolites <b>ethion</b> monoxon and <b>ethion</b> dioxon were also not detected in any samples with a substantial threshold (0.005-0.01 ppm). 64 to 75% of the metabolites from the tissues were soluble in methanol. After addition of a protease, another 17 to 32% were solubilized. In the aqueous phase, at least four different radioactive metabolites were found. However, characterization of these compounds was repeatedly unsuccessful due to their high volatility. One compound was trapped from the kidney and was identified as formaldehyde. This {{is an indication that}} the 14C of <b>ethion</b> are used in the formation of natural products.|$|E
50|$|Insecticides such as <b>ethion</b> can be {{detected}} with different general chemical detection ways, {{but most of the}} time the samples need to be prepared. And due to fact that the methods are not specific it can be quite difficult to determine if a specific substance is actually present. But a new and novel and simple detection way has been developed. In this method the interaction of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with <b>ethion</b> and the quenching of the resonance relay scattering (RRS) intensity are used. RRS can be used because the change in this was linearly correlated to the concentration of <b>ethion</b> (Range: 10.0-900.0 mg/L). Furthermore, its has as advantages over general detection methods that <b>ethion</b> can be measured in just 3 minutes and that no pretreatment of the sample is required before the measurement. From interference tests it became clear that the method has a very good selectivity for <b>ethion.</b> The limit of detection (LOD) was 3.7 mg/L and limit of quantification (LOQ) was 11.0 mg/L. Relative standard deviations (RSD) for 15.0 and 60.0 mg/L of <b>ethion</b> example concentration in water were 4.1 and 0.2 mg/L, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethion</b> has an {{influence}} on the environment as it is persistent and thus might accumulate through plants and animals. When looking at songbirds, <b>ethion</b> is very toxic. The LD50 in red-winged blackbirds is 45 mg/kg. However, it is moderately toxic to birds like the bobwhite quail (LD50 is 128.8 mg/kg) and starlings (LD50 is greater than 304 mg/kg). These birds would be classified as ‘medium sized birds’. When looking at even larger, upland game birds (like the ring-necked pheasant and waterfowl like the mallard duck, <b>ethion</b> is barely toxic to nontoxic. This is a good example on how the toxicity to animals may depend strongly on the species. Furthermore, <b>ethion</b> is very toxic to aquatic organisms like freshwater and marine fish. On top of that, it is highly toxic to freshwater invertebrates with an LD50 of 0.056 µg/L to 0.0077 mg/L. The LD50 for marine and estuarine invertebrates are 0.04 to 0.05 mg/L. <b>Ethion</b> is practically nontoxic to honeybees. The LD50 is 50.55 µg per bee.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethion</b> {{is quite}} toxic to lethal via inhalation. One study, looking at technical-grade <b>ethion,</b> found an LC50 of 2.31 mg/m3 in male rats and of 0.45 mg/m3 in female rats. Other data {{reported}} a 4-hour LC50 in rats of 0.864 mg/L. As said above, <b>ethion</b> {{can also lead}} to pupillary constriction, muscle cramp, excessive salivation. Sweating. Nausea. Dizziness. Laboured breathing. Convulsions. unconsciousness. Besides the earlier mentioned symptoms, a sensation of tightness in the chest and rhinorrhea are common after inhalation.|$|E
50|$|Goats {{exposed to}} <b>ethion</b> showed clear distinctions in excretion, {{absorption}} half-life and bioavailabilities. These differences {{depend on the}} method of administration. Intravenous injection resulted in a half-life time of 2 hours, while oral administration resulted in a half-life time of 10 hours. Dermal administration lead to a half-life time of even 85 hours. These differences in half-life times can be completed with a difference in bioavailability. The bio-availability of <b>ethion</b> in oral administration was less than 5%, whereas the bio-availability of dermal administration of <b>ethion</b> was 20%.|$|E
50|$|In {{a chronic}} {{toxicity}} study,rats were fed 0, 0.1, 0.2 or 2 mg/kg/day <b>ethion</b> for 18 months. However, no severe toxic effects were observed. The only significant change was {{a decrease of}} cholinesterase levels in the group with the highest dose. Therefore, the NOEL {{of this study was}} 0.2 mg/kg. The oral LD50 for pure <b>ethion</b> in rats is 208 mg/kg. The dermal LD50 in rats is 62 mg/kg, 890 mg/kg in rabbits, and 915 mg/kg in guinea pigs. For rats, the 4-hour LD50 is 0.864 mg/l <b>ethion.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{is known}} that <b>ethion</b> is small and {{lipophilic}} molecule and because it has these characteristics rapid absorption across cell membranes is expected. This absorption from skin, lungs and the gut to the blood will happen via passive diffusion. Furthermore, <b>ethion</b> is changed in the liver, via desulfuration, into its active metabolite: <b>ethion</b> monoxon. Due to this change happening in the liver the primary place of damage it {{expected to be the}} liver. <b>Ethion</b> monoxon is an inhibitor of the neuro enzyme cholinesterase (ChE). ChE is a facilitator of nerve impulse transmission, secondary of damage is thus the brain. Because <b>ethion</b> monoxon is an organophosphate its mechanism of action is thought to be the same. This mechanism works as follows (see the figure [...] "Inhibition of cholinesterase by <b>ethion</b> monoxon."): a hydroxyl group from a serine residue in the active site from ChE is phosphorylated by the organophosphate, thereby inhibiting the enzyme. The inhibition {{is a result of the}} inability of the serine hydroxyl group to participate in the hydrolysis of another enzyme called acetyl choline(Ach). In the figure it is indicated that inhibition reaction is a two step process. The phosphorylated form of the enzyme is highly stable, and depending on the R and R’ groups attached to the phosphorus this inhibition is reversible or irreversible.|$|E

5000|$|Testing on rats with 10 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day {{showed no}} histopathological {{effect on the}} {{respiratory}} trackt, neither did 13 week testing on dogs (8.25 mg/kg/day). [...] values for pure <b>ethion</b> in rats of 208 mg/kg, and for technical-grade <b>ethion</b> of 21 to 191 mg/kg,. Other reported oral LD50 values (for the technical product) are 40 mg/kg in mice and guinea pigs. In a group of six male volunteers no differences in blood pressure or pulse rate were noted, neither in mice or dogs. Diarrhea did occur in mice orally exposed to <b>ethion,</b> severe signs of neurotoxicity were also present. The effects were consistent with cholinergic overstimulation of the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to that of}} Castalius <b>ethion</b> but has two green bands on the back.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethion</b> {{will result}} in toxic effects by {{absorption}} via the skin, ingestion and via inhalation. When the skin is exposed it may cause burns. According to Extoxnet, any form of exposure results in the following inconveniences: pallor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, eye pain, blurred vision, constriction or dilation of the eye pupils, tears, salivation, sweating, and confusion may develop within 12 hours. Severe poisoning may result in distorted coordination, loss of reflexes, slurred speech, fatigue and weakness, tremors of the tongue and eyelids, involuntary muscle contractions and {{can also lead to}} paralysis and respiratory problems. In more severe cases <b>ethion</b> poisoning can lead to involuntary discharge of urine or feces, irregular heart beats, psychosis, loss of consciousness and to coma or death. Death will be a result of respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. Hypothermia, AC heart blocks and arrhythmias are also found to be possible consequences of <b>ethion</b> poisoning. <b>Ethion</b> may also lead to delayed symptoms of other organophosphates.|$|E
50|$|In rabbits {{receiving}} 250 mg/kg of technical-grade <b>ethion</b> for 21 days, the {{dermal exposure}} {{lead to increased}} cases of erythema and desquamation. It also lead to inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase at 1 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL {{was determined to be}} 0.8 mg/kg/day. In guinea pigs, <b>ethion</b> als lead to slight erythema, that cleared in 48 hours, and it was determined that the compound was not a skin sensitizer.|$|E
50|$|Banded Blue Pierrot Discolampa <b>ethion</b> is a contrastingly marked {{butterfly}} {{found in}} South Asia {{that belongs to}} the Blues or Lycaenidae family.|$|E
50|$|To {{treat the}} ethion-{{exposure}} itself {{is done in}} the same way as exposure with other organophosphates. The main danger lies in respiratory problems, if symptoms are present then artificial respiration with an endotracheal tube is used as a treatment. The effect of <b>ethion</b> on muscles or nerves is counteracted with Atropine. Pralidoxime can be used to act against organophosphate poisoning, this must be given as fast as possible after the <b>ethion</b> poisoning for its efficacy is inhibited by the chemical change of ethion-enzyme in the body that occurs over time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethion</b> {{can also}} cause slight redness and {{inflammation}} to the eye and skin, this will clear within 48 hours. It is also known to cause blurred vision, pupil constriction and pain.|$|E
50|$|In a study {{conducted}} among rats, after oral administration it was found that <b>ethion</b> is quite readily metabolized. The metabolization products in found in urine are four to six polar water-soluble products.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethion</b> {{was one of}} many {{substances}} that were approved for use based on data from Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories, which prompted the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization to recommend its reanalysis in 1982.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{pesticide}} use, {{there is no}} Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) in place. However, {{in the last decade}} numerous poisonous chemicals such as monocrotophos, quinalphos, <b>ethion,</b> and phorate have been prohibited (as of May 2005).|$|E
50|$|In a study {{determining}} the LD50 of <b>ethion,</b> 80 male and 60 female adult rats were dermally exposed to <b>ethion</b> dissolved in xylene. The lowest dose {{to kill a}} rat {{was found to be}} 150 mg/kg for males and 50 mg/kg for females. The minimum survival time was 6 hours for females and 3 hours for males, the maximum time of death was 3 days for females and 7 days for males. The LD50 was 245 mg /kg for males and 62 mg/kg for females. Skin contact with organophosphates in general may cause localized sweating and involuntary muscle contractions. Other studies found the LC50 via the dermal route to be 915 mg/kg in guinea pigs and 890 mg/kg in rabbits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethion</b> is {{produced}} under controlled pH conditions, by making dibromomethane react with O,O-diethyl hydrogen phosphorodithioate in ethanol. Another {{method of manufacturing}} is the reaction of methylene bromide and the sodium salt of O,O-diethylphosphorodithoate. It can also be made with an reaction of O,O-Diethyl dithiophosphoric acid and formaldehyde.|$|E
50|$|After solvent {{partitioning}} {{of urine}} from rats {{which had been}} fed <b>ethion,</b> {{it became clear that}} the metabolites found in the urine were 99% dissolved in the aqueous phase. This means that only nonsignificant levels (<1 %) were present in the organic phase and that the metabolites are very hydrophilic.|$|E
50|$|In a goat study, also {{heart in}} kidney tissue was {{investigated}} {{after a period}} of <b>ethion</b> exposure, and in these tissue ethion-derivatives were found.

5000|$|Rabbits, {{receiving}} 2.5 mg/kg/day of <b>ethion</b> {{showed a}} decrease in body weight, no effects were seen at 0.6 mg/kg/day. The decrease body, combined with reduced food consumption, was observed for rabbits receiving 9.6 mg/kg/day [...] Male and female dogs receiving 0.71 mg/kg/day did not show change in body weight, but dogs receiving 6.9 and 8.25 mg/kg/day showed reduced food consumption and reduced body weight.|$|E
50|$|No {{hematological}} {{effects were}} reported in an experiment with six male volunteers, nor in rats or dogs. The volunteers did not show differences in muscle tone after intermediate-duration oral exposure, nor did the testing animals to different exposure. It is however knows that <b>ethion</b> can result in muscle tremors and fasciculations. The animal-testing studies on rats and dogs showed {{no effect on the}} kidneys and liver, but a different study showed an increased incidence in orange-colored urine. The animal-testing studies on rats and dogs did also not show dermal or ocular effects.|$|E
50|$|The Amenta {{originally}} {{formed in}} Baulkam Hills, a Sydney suburb, in 1997 as Crucible of Agony. They initially played black metal and released two demos in 1999 under that name. They were renamed as The Amenta in 2001 and, the following year, released their first extended play, Mictlan, on Dissident Records. The line-up was Cessium 137 (aka Mark Bevan, lead vocals), Scott Howard (drums), <b>Ethion</b> (Erik Miehs, guitar), Endrin (Nathan Jenkins, bass guitar) and Chlordane (Timothy Pope, keyboards). Howard was soon replaced by Diazanon (Dave Haley) on drums.|$|E

50|$|A six-month-old boy {{experienced}} shallow excursions and intercostal retractions after accidentally ingesting 15.7 mg/kg <b>ethion.</b> The symptoms started {{one hour}} after ingestion and were treated. Five hours after ingestion, respiratory arrest occurred and mechanical ventilation {{was needed for}} three hours. Following examinations after one week, one month and one year suggested that full recovery was made. The same boy also showed occurrence of Tachycardia, frothy saliva (1 hour after ingestion), watery bowel movements (90 minutes after ingestion), increased urine WBC counts, inability to control his head and limbs, occasional twitching, pupils non-reactive to light, purposeless eye movements, palpable liver and spleen {{and there were some}} symptoms of paralysis.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study with}} human volunteers, a {{decrease}} of plasma cholinesterase was observed during 0.075 mg/kg/day (16% decrease), 0.1 mg/kg/day (23% decrease) and 0.15 mg/kg/day (31%decrease) treatment periods. This was partially recovered after 7 days and fully recovered after 12 days. No effect on erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase was observed, nor signs of adverse neurological effects. Another study showed severe neurological effects after a single oral exposure in rats. For male rats salivation, tremors, nose bleeding, urination, diarrhea and convulsions occurred at 100 mg/kg and for female rats at 10 mg/kg. In a study with albino rats, {{it was observed that}} brain acetylcholinesterase was inhibited 22%, erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase 87% and plasma cholinesterase 100% for male rats after being fed 9 mg/kg/day of <b>ethion</b> for 93 days. After 14 days of recovery, plasma cholinesterase recovered completely and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase recovered 63%. No effects were observed at 1 mg/kg/day. In a study with different rats, no effects on erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase were observed at 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 2 mg/kg/day of <b>ethion.</b> In a 90-day-study on dogs, in which the males received 6.9 mg/kg/day and females 8.25 mg/kg/day, ataxia, emesis, miosis and tremors were observed. Brain and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase were inhibited (61-64% and 93-04% respectively). At 0.71 mg/kg/day in male dogs, the reduction of brain acetylcholinesterase was 23%. No effects were seen at 0.06 and 0.01 mg/kg/day. Based on these findings, a minimal risk level of 0,002 mg/kg/day for oral exposure for the acute and intermediate durations was established. A chronic-duration minimal risk level of 0.0004 mg/kg/day was calculated as well.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ethion</b> residue removal {{efficiency}} using individual and combined effects of ultrasonication (US), ozonation (O 3), ultrasonication and ozonation (US/O 3) was investigated. A 1 mg·L - 1 standard <b>ethion</b> {{was subjected to}} an ultrasonic irradiation (3 W input power) device with different frequencies of 108, 400, 700, 1000 kHz, and to an ozone with a concentration of 200 mg· mL - 1 with various exposure times (0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes). Reduction of residual <b>ethion</b> was determined by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection (GC-FPD). It was found that 1000 kHz ultrasonic irradiation for 60 minutes was the most effective treatment for reducing <b>ethion</b> concentration. Additionally, ozone could reduce the concentration of standard <b>ethion</b> after 60 minutes of exposure. Ultrasonic irradiation in combination with ozone had a synergistic effect in reducing standard <b>ethion</b> concentration, with the highest rate occurring within the first 15 minutes. <b>Ethion</b> concentration was reduced to 75. 43 % after ultrasonic irradiation at 1000 kHz and ozone exposure for 60 minutes. The effectiveness of the combined scheme for reducing of <b>ethion</b> residues on tangerine was also determined by GC-FPD. The <b>ethion</b> residue on fresh tangerines after ultrasonic irradiation and ozone washing was reduced by 73. 03 % after 60 minutes. The present study demonstrates that ultrasonic irradiation and ozone exposure {{could be used to}} reduce <b>ethion</b> residues in treated tangerine {{in order to meet the}} Standards for Pesticide Residue Limits. </p...|$|E
