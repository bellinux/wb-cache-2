5|$|Martin drew much {{inspiration}} from actual <b>history</b> <b>for</b> the series, having several bookcases filled with medieval <b>history</b> <b>for</b> research and visiting historic European landmarks. For an American who speaks only English, {{the history of}} England proved the easiest source of medieval <b>history</b> <b>for</b> him, giving the series a British rather than a German or Spanish historic flavor. For example, Ned and Robb Stark resemble Richard, 3rd Duke of York and his son Edward IV, and Queen Cersei resembles both Margaret of Anjou and Elizabeth Woodville. Martin immersed himself in many diverse medieval topics such as clothing, food, feasting, and tournaments, to have the facts at hand if needed during writing. The series was in particular influenced by the Hundred Years' War, the Crusades, the Albigensian Crusade, and the Wars of the Roses, although Martin refrained from making any direct adaptations. Martin was also inspired by the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon, which are about the French monarchy in the 13th and 14th centuries.|$|E
