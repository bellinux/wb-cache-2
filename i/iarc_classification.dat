The International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) recently classifies glyphosate as a carcinogenic substance in Group 2 A, in IARC words “Probably carcinogenic to humans”, based on the available and evaluated studies by <b>IARC.</b> This <b>classification</b> was initially published in a short report in the "Lancet Oncology" journal on 20 March 2015 but was not explained scientifically in detail.

40|$|Formaldehyde (FA) ranks 25 th in {{the overall}} U. S. {{chemical}} production, with more than 5 million tons produced each year. Given its economic importance and widespread use, many people are exposed to FA occupationally. Recently, based on the correlation with nasopharyngeal cancer in humans, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (<b>IARC)</b> confirmed the <b>classification</b> of FA as a Group I substance. Considering the epidemiological evidence of a potential association with leukemia, the IARC has concluded that FA can cause this lymphoproliferative disorder. Our group has developed a method to assess the exposure and genotoxicity effects of FA in two different occupational settings, namely FAbased resins production and pathology and anatomy laboratories. For exposure assessment we applied simultaneously two different techniques of air monitoring: NIOSH Method 2541 and Photo Ionization Detection Equipment with simultaneously video recording. Genotoxicity effects were measured by cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay in peripheral blood lymphocytes and by micronucleus test in exfoliated oral cavity epithelial cells, both considered target cells. The two exposure assessment techniques show that in the two occupational settings peak exposures are still occurring. There was a statistical {{significant increase in the}} micronucleus mean of epithelial cells and peripheral lymphocytes of exposed individuals compared with controls. In conclusion, the exposure and genotoxicity effects assessment methodologies developed by us allowed to determine that these two occupational settings promote exposure to high peak FA concentrations and an increase in the micronucleus mean of exposed workers. Moreover, the developed techniques showed promising results and could be used to confirm and extend the results obtained by the analytical techniques currently available...|$|R

40|$|Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} (PET) is {{an excellent}} material for bottling water, beverages, edible oils and other liquids because it is light, tough and transparent. PET bottles are also extensively reused for storage of drinking water, beverages and other liquids and for solar disinfection of microbiologically unsafe drinking water in the tropics. In spite of the usefulness of PET bottles earlier works have reported leaching of antimony and acetaldehyde from the bottle matrix into the liquid contents. Both antimony trioxide and acetaldehyde belongs to Group 2 B (possible carcinogens) in the International Agency for Research on Cancer (<b>IARC)</b> carcinogen <b>classification.</b> Additionally acetaldehyde associated with alcoholic beverages (derived from alcoholic beverage and formed endogenously) has recently been upgraded to IARC Group 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic to humans). The research aims to assess the pattern and extent of antimony and acetaldehyde migration from British and Nigerian polyethylene terephthalate bottles into bottle contents under typical use and reuse conditions. The research compares the assessed extents of migration with the current regulations {{to determine whether the}} maximum acceptable levels of antimony and acetaldehyde are being exceeded and whether current regulations might need to be reassessed. To achieve these goals the pattern and extent of PET bottle use and reuse in Britain and Nigeria were appraised through survey. The survey revealed that new bottles with contents are typically stored prior to use for periods ranging between one and 7 days, with Nigerians storing for longer periods than British respondents. However storage of up to one year was reported. The extent of bottle reuse was high and similar for the two countries. Nevertheless Nigerian respondents reuse bottles for longer periods than British respondents. The survey findings together with relevant literature were used to design laboratory experiments that assessed the extent of antimony and acetaldehyde migration from PET bottles into water/beverages. A total of 82 brands of bottled water and soft drinks in plastic and glass bottles and in cartons were collected. A few samples from Nigeria in plastic pouches were collected. Materials used in bottling including glass and plastic bottle materials, metal and plastic bottle cap materials and plastic cap lining materials were collected. All samples were collected in supermarkets and shops in Britain and Nigeria except drinking water from taps which was collected in Britain only. Some bottles were aged for the purpose of studying the impact of bottle aging on chemical migration. Other bottles were stored with their contents to study the impact of long term storage of bottle contents on chemical migration. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterise PET bottle material and other materials associated with water and soft drink bottling. Antimony and other trace metals in water and soft drinks were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Antimony content of PET and other plastics was determined by microwave digestion and ICP-MS.

40|$|Using the {{traditional}} {{guidelines of the}} International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) for adult brain cancer, their classifications for EMFs was “possible human carcinogen ” (IARC’s Group 2 B). Panels convened by IARC and the National Institutes for Environmental Health Sciences {{on the other hand}} thought the evidence was “inadequate ” to make a <b>classification</b> (<b>IARC’s</b> Group 3). Using the Guidelines developed especially for the California EMF program, one of the reviewers was “prone to believe ” that high residential EMFs cause some degree of increased risk of adult brain cancer, and the other two were “close to the dividing line between believing or not believing. ” There are several reasons for the differences between the DHS reviewers and those of IARC. The three DHS scientists thought there were reasons why animal and test tube experiments might have failed to pick up a mechanism or a health problem; hence, the absence of much support from such animal and test tube studies did not reduce their confidence much or lead them to strongly distrust epidemiological evidence from statistical studies in human populations. They therefore had more faith in the quality of the epidemiological studies in human populations and hence gave more credence to them. Adult brain cancer has an incidence of around 1 / 10, 000 per year. If one doubled this rate to 2 / 10, 000 per year and accumulated it over a lifetime of continuous high exposure one would accumulate a lifetime risk of 1 %. Thus the vast majority (99 %) of highly exposed people would still not contract this disease. Furthermore, calculations suggest that the fraction of all cases of adult brain cancer that one could attribute to EMFs would be {{no more than a few}} percent of the total cases (if any). Nevertheless, if EMFs do contribute to the cause of this condition, even the low fractions of attributable cases and the size of accumulated lifetime risk of highly exposed individuals could be of concern to regulators. Indeed, when deemed a real cause, estimated lifetime risks smaller than this (1 / 100, 000) have triggered regulatory evaluation and, sometimes, actual regulation of chemical agents such as airborn...|$|R

This pattern {{is due to a}} fundamental adaptation to the rotation of Earth around its own axis. Molecular mechanisms of generation of circadian rhythms organize a biochemical network in suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues, building cell autonomous clock pacemakers. Rhythmicity is observed in transcriptional expression {{of a wide range of}} clock-controlled genes that regulate a variety of normal cell functions, such as cell division and proliferation. Desynchrony of this rhythmicity seems to be implicated in several pathologic conditions, including tumorigenesis and progression of cancer.

40|$|The {{chlorinated}} solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant. The carcinogenic hazard of TCE {{was the subject}} of a 2012 evaluation by a Working Group of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Information on exposures, relevant data from epidemiologic studies, bioassays in experimental animals, and toxicity and mechanism of action studies was used to conclude that TCE is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). This article summarizes the key evidence forming the scientific bases for the <b>IARC</b> <b>classification.</b> Exposure to TCE from environmental sources (including hazardous waste sites and contaminated water) is common throughout the world. While workplace use of TCE has been declining, occupational exposures remain of concern, especially in developing countries. The strongest human evidence is from studies of occupational TCE exposure and kidney cancer. Positive, although less consistent, associations were reported for liver cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. TCE is carcinogenic at multiple sites in multiple species and strains of experimental animals. The mechanistic evidence includes extensive data on the toxicokinetics and genotoxicity of TCE and its metabolites. Together, available evidence provided a cohesive database supporting the human cancer hazard of TCE, particularly in the kidney. For other target sites of carcinogenicity, mechanistic and other data were found to be more limited. Important sources of susceptibility to TCE toxicity and carcinogenicity were also reviewed by the Working Group. In all, consideration of the multiple evidence streams presented herein informed the IARC conclusions regarding the carcinogenicity of TCE. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|E

OBJECTIVES: The authors of this paper are scientists from various disciplines relevant to the identification and hazard evaluation of human carcinogens. We have examined here criticisms of the <b>IARC</b> <b>classification</b> process to determine the validity of these concerns. We review the history of IARC evaluations and describe how the IARC evaluations are performed. DISCUSSION: We conclude that these recent criticisms are unconvincing. The procedures employed by IARC to assemble Working Groups of scientists from the various discipline and the techniques followed to review the literature and perform hazard assessment of various agents provide a balanced evaluation and an appropriate indication of the weight of the evidence.

40|$|Background Breast cancer {{incidence}} {{is increasing}} globally for largely unknown reasons. The {{possibility that a}} portion of the breast cancer burden might be explained by the introduction and increasing use of elec-tricity to light the night was suggested 420 years ago. Methods The theory is based on nocturnal light-induced disruption of circadian rhythms, notably reduction of melatonin synthesis. It has formed the basis for a series of predictions including that non-day shift work would increase risk, blind women would be at lower risk, long sleep duration would lower risk and community nighttime light level would co-distribute with breast cancer incidence on the population level. Results Accumulation of epidemiological evidence has accelerated in recent years, reflected in an International Agency for Research on Cancer (<b>IARC)</b> <b>classification</b> of shift work as a probable human carcinogen (2 A). There is also a strong rodent model in support of the light-at-night (LAN) idea. Conclusion If a consensus eventually emerges that LAN does increase risk, then the mechanisms for the effect are important to elucidate for inter-vention and mitigation. The basic understanding of phototransduc-tion for the circadian system, and of the molecular genetics of circadian rhythm generation are both advancing rapidly, and will provide for the development of lighting technologies at home and at work that minimize circadian disruption, while maintaining visual efficiency and aesthetics. In the interim, there are strategies now available to reduce the potential for circadian disruption, which include extending the daily dark period, appreciate nocturnal awa-kening in the dark, using dim red light for nighttime necessities, and unless recommended by a physician, not taking melatonin tablets...|$|E

40|$|Non-ionizing {{radiation}} (NIR) is {{the term}} given to radiation {{in the part of}} the electromagnetic spectrum that does not have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules directly. The NIR includes electric and magnetic fields up to 300 GHz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet radiation (UV). People are exposed to non-ionizing radiation by several man-made sources every day. From highest to lowest energy, this includes for example microwave ovens, cell phones, baby monitors, cordless phones, garage-door openers etc. Extremely low frequency (ELF) waves are produced by high voltage power lines and indoor electrical wiring systems. Radiofrequency (RF) waves can cause tissue heating at high intensities. Some forms of non-ionizing radiation can induce damage of tissues if exposed to high intensity fields. For instance, exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun for a prolonged period of time is known to cause skin cancers (Narayanan et al., 2010); even moderate amounts can cause skin burns. There is a big concern amongst the public and authorities regarding possible adverse health effects from exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), in particular the radiation generated by power lines and wireless communication devices. In 2002 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that extremely low frequency magnetic fields (from power lines) are possibly carcinogenic (Group 2 B of <b>IARC</b> <b>classification).</b> The same conclusion was reached in 2011 with respect to radiofrequency fields from mobile phones. UVB and UVA radiation has been classified by IARC as Group I: the agent is carcinogenic to humans. It is therefore not surprising that a lot of research was (and still is) devoted to the investigation of biological effects of non-ionizing radiation. In many cases the link has been established between genotoxicity and carcinogenicity and the possibility that non-ionising radiations including EMFs are carcinogenic so it follows that studies on the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of such agents are also important issues. In our laboratory we use comet assay for testing genotoxicity of non-ionizing radiation for more than ten years. In the experiments we use whole blood samples (human or dog), cell lines (e. g. H 295 R cell line) or 3 dimensional in vitro skin tissue (epidermis) models. In our protocol a slightly modified alkaline Comet assay method of Singh et al. (1988) is used. On our poster there will be presented a brief summary of our experiments with exposure to different types of radiation (ELF, RF, and intermediate frequency). In our protocols the non-ionizing radiation was often combined with ionizing radiation to see whether the non-ionizing radiation can influence the repair of the DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. For the evaluation of the slides mainly Komet 4. 0 image analysis system software (Kinetic Imaging, Liverpool, UK) was used, but as we got familiarized with other methods for slide evaluation like grading the comets by visual scoring into 5 categories or the CaspLab software, the comparison of these three methods will be also presented...|$|E

40|$|The James Zadroga 9 / 11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010, Public Law 111 - 347, Title XXXIII of the Public Health Service Act, 124 Stat. 3623 (codified at 42 United States Code section 300 mm- 300 mm- 61), {{requires}} the Administrator of the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program to "periodically conduct {{a review of}} all available scientific and medical evidence, including findings and recommendations of Clinical Centers of Excellence, published in peer-reviewed journals to determine if, based on such evidence, cancer or {{a certain type of}} cancer should be added to the applicable list of WTC-related health conditions. " 42 U. S. C. sec. 300 mm- 22 (a) (5) (A). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) presented the first periodic review of cancer for the WTC Health Program in July 2011. This review included findings from the peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature about exposures and cancer resulting from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks [NIOSH 2011]. The Exposure section of the first periodic review provided an initial list of agents detected in the area around the World Trade Center (WTC) during the disaster response and recovery periods. The Contaminants of Potential Concern (COPC) Committee of the World Trade Center Indoor Air Task Force Working Group developed the initial list from the chemicals identified in air sample testing results included in four databases [COPC Committee 2003]. The committee used this list to select COPCs and set health-based benchmarks for indoor environments. The four data sources were the: 1. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 2 database of environmental sampling results, which contains more than 200, 000 records on sampling results for 137 agents; 2. New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) /Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) public health investigation database, which includes results from Lower Manhattan samples of six minerals, 354 air samples from residential buildings, and 32 samples of fibers collected outdoors and analyzed by phase contrast microscopy; 3. New York City Department of Education findings from sampling in schools, which involved samples collected both indoors and outdoors from six schools between September 2001 and June 2002 and includes more than 30, 000 records of air sampling results for more than 70 agents; and 4. Chatfield and Kominsky's survey of indoor air quality. A total of 287 chemicals or chemical groups were identified from the report [COPC Committee 2003], and each of them was checked against (1) the United States National Toxicology Program (NTP) 12 th Report on Carcinogens (RoC) [NTP 2011] and (2) the United Nations International Agency on Research on Cancer (IARC) list of agents and documented in the IARC monographs, Volumes 1 - 102 [IARC 2006]. The list and cancer designations of these chemicals were provided in Appendix E of the First Periodic Review of Scientific and Medical Evidence Related to Cancer for the World Trade Center Health Program [NIOSH 2011]. In addition to the agents identified by the COPC Committee [COPC 2003], several other agents of potential concern have been included because of the potential for widespread exposure. In particular, the fires at the WTC site produced {{over an extended period of}} time substantial amounts of combustion products from building materials, including wood and plastics. Also, a large number of trucks, many of which run on diesel fuels, were used at the WTC site. These trucks likely produced large quantities of diesel particulates, which were discharged into the air at and around the WTC site. Because of the potential exposure of rescue and recovery workers, as well as workers and residents in area buildings, to soot, biomass fuel, and diesel particulates, these are included with the COPC agents identified by EPA. Tables 1, 2, and 3 (Section IV) provide the cancer classifications of NTP and IARC and expand upon the information provided in the first periodic report by providing a summary of the basis for the <b>IARC</b> <b>classification.</b> NTP and IARC do not address decomposition products from plastics as a group; they are addressed only as individual compounds. Therefore, the individual compounds from thermal decomposition of plastics that were identified by the COPC Committee are included in the tables. A summary of the studies cited in the IARC monographs is provided in Section IV. Hyperlinks to the NTP Report on Carcinogens and the IARC monographs are provided as well. The agents identified as COPC and other select agents are grouped according to their IARC designation as Group 1, 2 A, or 2 B. Agents categorized by IARC as Group 3 or Group 4 are not summarized because they are not expected to contribute to potential cancer outcomes among the rescue and recovery workers and the survivors. Descriptions of uncategorized agents are not available in the IARC Monographs. A total of 63 agents are included from the original list of 287 COPCs, and the additional three agents (soot, biomass fuel, and diesel) have been added.
