The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage.

In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one {{at the bottom of the}} formation and another about 5 metres above it. These wells are typically drilled in groups off central pads and can extend for miles in all directions. In each well pair, steam is injected into the upper well, the heat melts the bitumen, which allows it to flow into the lower well, where it is pumped to the surface.|$|E

50|$|Many {{prerequisites}} enabled this {{suite of}} technologies to become productive. Probably, the first requirement was {{the realization that}} oil wells, or water wells, are not necessarily vertical. This realization was quite slow, and did not really grasp {{the attention of the}} oil industry until the late 1920s when there were several lawsuits alleging that wells drilled from a rig on one property had crossed the boundary and were penetrating a reservoir on an adjacent property.

40|$|While {{the use of}} <b>directional</b> (or horizontal) <b>drilling</b> {{technology}} has increased dramatically since the mid- 1980 's, the technology itself dates back to 1891, when the first patent was granted for equipment to place a horizontal hole from a vertical well. In 1929, the first truly horizontal wells were drilled at Texon, Texas and many horizontal wells were drilled in the USSR and China during the 1950 's and 1960 's, with limited success. Weakening of oil prices, coupled {{with the need to}} reduce finding costs and the development of new downhole devices, resurrected horizontal drilling technology in the late 1970 's and early 1980 's. A directionally drilled well is defined as a well bore that intersects a potentially productive formation and does not intentionally exit the formation for the remaining footage drilled. Generally, this means that the well is spudded like a conventional vertical well, and at a predetermined "kick-off " point (KOP), the well is deviated from the vertical so that the well bore enters the formation roughly parallel to the bedding plane.
