It was first used informally at the Glamorganshire Golf Club, Penarth, Wales, in 1898, and first used in competition at Wallasey Golf Club in Wallasey, England, in 1932.|$|E
25|$|High-class {{buildings}} can {{be identified}} easily by tell-tale details like spacing between windows, penthouses and bay windows. Sometimes, the relative rank and occupation of tenants is represented by ornaments, sometimes by memorial plaques. Note that these are all Moscow features. In smaller cities, the social elite usually comprised <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two classes; St. Petersburg always had a supply of pre-revolutionary luxury space.|$|E
25|$|Optimization will {{generally}} focus on improving <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> {{two aspects of}} performance: execution time, memory usage, disk space, bandwidth, power consumption or some other resource. This will usually require a trade-offnbsp&— where one factor is optimized {{at the expense of}} others. For example, increasing the size of cache improves runtime performance, but also increases the memory consumption. Other common trade-offs include code clarity and conciseness.|$|E

25|$|Fewer than {{a hundred}} trees {{are known to be}} growing wild, in three localities not far apart. It is very {{difficult}} to count individuals, as most trees are multistemmed and may have a connected root system. Genetic testing has revealed that all the specimens are genetically indistinguishable, suggesting that the species has been through a genetic bottleneck in which its population became so low (possibly <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two individuals) that all genetic variability was lost.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} nine Peterson played piano {{with control}} that {{impressed}} professional musicians. For many years his piano studies included four to six hours of practice daily. Only {{in his later years}} did he decrease his daily practice to <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two hours. In 1940, at fourteen years of age, Peterson won the national music competition organized by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. After that victory, he dropped out of school and became a professional pianist working for a weekly radio show, and playing at hotels and music halls.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} of {{inhabitants of the}} Kura–Araxes culture showed that ancient settlements were found along the Hrazdan river, as shown by drawings at a mountainous area in a cave nearby. Structures in settlements have not revealed much differentiation, nor was there much difference in size or character between settlements, facts that suggest they probably had a poorly developed social hierarchy for a significant stretch of their history. Some, but not all, settlements were surrounded by stone walls. They built mud-brick houses, originally round, but later developing into subrectangular designs with structures of <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two rooms, multiple rooms centered around an open space, or rectilinear designs.|$|E
25|$|Sharp {{played as}} a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman; as an amateur, he acted as captain of Leicestershire {{many times over}} his long career, and was official captain in 1921 and for part of 1922. A solicitor, Sharp never played a full season, but he appeared in first-class matches in every season from 1908 to 1935 {{with the exception of}} 1925. Most of his first-class cricket was concentrated into the years either side of the First World War: from 1926 onwards, he played in most years <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two matches and he passed 50 only once in the 10 seasons before his very last appearance in 1935.|$|E
25|$|As more {{types of}} mesons were {{discovered}} in accelerator experiments later, it was eventually found that the mu meson significantly differed {{not only from the}} pi meson (of about the same mass), but also from all other types of mesons. The difference, in part, was that mu mesons did not interact with the nuclear force, as pi mesons did (and were required to do, in Yukawa's theory). Newer mesons also showed evidence of behaving like the pi meson in nuclear interactions, but not like the mu meson. Also, the mu meson's decay products included both a neutrino and an antineutrino, rather than <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> the other, as was observed in the decay of other charged mesons.|$|E

25|$|Aphasia is best {{thought of}} as a {{collection}} of different disorders, rather than a single problem. Each individual with aphasia will present with their own particular combination of language strengths and weaknesses. Consequently, it is a major challenge just to document the various difficulties that can occur in different people, let alone decide how they might best be treated. Most classifications of the aphasias tend to divide the various symptoms into broad classes. A common approach is to distinguish between the fluent aphasias (where speech remains fluent, but content may be lacking, and the person may have difficulties understanding others), and the nonfluent aphasias (where speech is very halting and effortful, and may consist of <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two words at a time).|$|E
25|$|Regina Ip {{stated that}} the {{government}} would have to allocate more resources to deal with the increased workload resulting from right of abode applications by FDHs. Since Lam's earlier ruling in favour of Vallejos in late September, there had been a definite {{rise in the number of}} FDHs applying for permanent residence, from <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two such cases per month in the past, to an average of sixteen in August and September 2011, and over 20 applications on 25 October alone. In total, the Immigration Department stated that it had received 148 permanent residence applications from FDHs in October. A total of roughly 900 foreign domestic helpers made applications for permanent residence from October 2011 to late March 2012 when the Court of Appeal overturned Lam's ruling.|$|E
25|$|Higgins had a poor 2011/2012 season, {{reaching}} {{only two}} quarter finals of major ranking events. His season-best performance was reaching the semi-finals of the Masters, where he lost 4–6 to Shaun Murphy. Before {{the start of}} his World Championship title defence, he admitted that his performance levels had not been good enough and that he had not been trying hard enough, managing <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two days of practice a week. In {{the first round of the}} tournament, he came from 6–8 down to defeat Liang Wenbo 10–9. He then played Stephen Hendry in the second round, the first time the two players had ever met in a World Championship, but Hendry thrashed the defending champion 13–4, with Higgins calling it the worst he had ever played at the Crucible. He finished the season ranked world number five.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} about 27,000 people {{received}} ECT in 1980. The authors of the survey estimated that ECT use had approximately halved since the early 1970s. There was wide regional variation, with the heaviest user, Jersey and Guernsey, using ECT at more than 5 {{times the rate of}} the lowest user, the Oxford region. There was a 17 fold difference in rates of ECT use between different hospitals and in many hospitals a large proportion of ECT was given by <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two psychiatrists. Some psychiatrists didn’t use ECT at all; others thought that the main, or even the only, indication for ECT was in psychotic or endogenous depression; yet others thought it appropriate in the treatment {{of a wide range of}} disorders. The median age of patients was mid-fifties. About 900 people over 80, and about 420 people under 20, were given ECT in 1980. 69 per cent were women. 21 per cent were treated with unilateral ECT.|$|E
25|$|IR {{has several}} classes of travel {{with or without}} air conditioning. A train may have <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> many classes of travel. Slow {{passenger}} trains have only unreserved seating class whereas Rajdhani, Duronto, Shatabdi, Garib Rath and Yuva trains have only air-conditioned classes. The fares for all classes are different with unreserved seating class being the cheapest. The fare of Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains includes food served in the train, but the fare for other trains does not include food {{that has to be}} bought separately. From September 2016, the IR have introduced dynamic fares for all accommodation classes for Rajdhani, Duronto and Shatabdi trains(except 1AC and EC classes) to shore up revenue. In long-distance trains a pantry car is usually included and the food is served at the berth or seat itself. Luxury trains such as Palace on Wheels have separate dining cars, but these trains cost as much as or more than a five-star hotel room.|$|E
25|$|Concerning the {{practice}} of psalm recitation, the recitation by a congregation of educated chanters is already testified by the soloistic recitation of abridged psalms {{by the end of}} the 4th century. Later it was called prokeimenon. Hence, there was an early practice of simple psalmody, which was used for the recitation of canticles and the psalter, and usually Byzantine psalters have the 15 canticles in an appendix, but the simple psalmody itself was not notated before the 13th century, in dialogue or papadikai treatises preceding the book sticheraria. Later books, like the akolouthiai and some psaltika, also contain the elaborated psalmody, when a protopsaltes recited <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two psalm verses. Between the recited psalms and canticles troparia were recited according to the same more or less elaborated psalmody. This context relates antiphonal chant genres including antiphona (kind of introits), trisagion and its substitutes, prokeimenon, allelouiarion, the later cherubikon and its substitutes, the koinonikon cycles as they were created during the 9th century. In most of the cases they were simply troparia and their repetitions or segments were given by the antiphonon, whether it was sung or not, its three sections of the psalmodic recitation were separated by the troparion.|$|E
