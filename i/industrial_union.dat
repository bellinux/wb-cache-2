5|$|Duhalde, Alfonsín, their parties, {{the unions}} and the Church all agreed to promote {{policies}} {{to increase the}} industrial growth of the country. For this purpose, Duhalde created the ministry of production, with functions that used {{to belong to the}} ministries of economy and foreign relations. The new minister was José Ignacio de Mendiguren, head of the Argentine <b>Industrial</b> <b>Union.</b> Alfonsín negotiated with him, on Duhalde's behalf, while Congress was still voting for the new president. Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the convertibility plan, considered the main cause of the economic crisis. Although Menem proposed a full dollarization of the Argentine economy, Duhalde preferred to instead stick to the peso and order a devaluation. Although it was initially expected to make a 40% devaluation, the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 dollar, a 200% devaluation. The higher dollar price allowed for more lucrative exports, increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates, but at the cost of a higher cost of living.|$|E
25|$|Like the General Managers Association of Chicago, the Southern Pacific Railroad (SPR) {{acknowledged}} the danger in allowing railway workers {{to form an}} <b>industrial</b> <b>union.</b> The SPR hired the Pinkerton Agency to infiltrate and destroy the UBRE. One of the Pinkerton labor spy tactics was persuading workers to quit the <b>industrial</b> <b>union</b> and instead join a craft union. The defeat of the UBRE ended the last major attempt to organize North American railway workers into an <b>industrial</b> <b>union.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reuther won {{constitutional}} {{inclusion of}} an <b>Industrial</b> <b>Union</b> Department to promote industrial unionism and organizing {{in the new}} federation. However, while Reuther advocated a 6-cent tax on CIO unions to fund the department, McDonald pressed for a 1- or 2-cent tax. When Reuther expressed interest in leading the new <b>Industrial</b> <b>Union</b> Department, McDonald proposed a USWA district director. Once more, McDonald won the day, and the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Union</b> Department, once envisioned as an organizing juggernaut, now became merely a research, publicity, and lobbying unit.|$|E

50|$|Increasingly, {{the debate}} {{involved}} a growing battle over craft versus industrial unionism. Certain unions—such as the Teamsters, the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, and the National Union of United Brewery Workmen—were already <b>industrial</b> <b>unions</b> {{in all but}} name, and vigorous battles were fought within the AFL to pare back the jurisdictions of these <b>industrial</b> <b>unions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Industrial Workers of the World advance an {{industrial}} unionism which would organize all the workers, regardless of skill, gender or race, into one big union divided {{into a series}} of departments corresponding to different industries. The <b>industrial</b> <b>unions</b> would be the embryonic form of future post-capitalist production. Once sufficiently organized, the <b>industrial</b> <b>unions</b> would overthrow capitalism by means of a general strike, and carry on production through worker run enterprises without bosses or the wage system. Anarcho-syndicalist unions, like the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo, are similar in their means and ends but organize workers into geographically based and federated syndicates rather than <b>industrial</b> <b>unions.</b>|$|R

25|$|At this time, the Cleveland local of the Metal and Machinery Workers <b>Industrial</b> <b>Union</b> (MMWIU) was {{the strongest}} IWW branch in the United States. Leading figures such as Frank Cedervall, who had helped build the branch up for over ten years, were {{concerned}} about the possibility of raiding from AFL-CIO unions if the IWW had its legal status as a union revoked. In 1950, Cedervall led the 1500-member MMWIU national organization to split from the IWW, as the Lumber Workers <b>Industrial</b> <b>Union</b> had almost thirty years earlier. Unfortunately for the MMWIU, this act would not save it. Despite its brief affiliation with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, it would face serious raiding from AFL and CIO and would be defunct by the late 1950s, less than ten years after separating from the IWW.|$|E
