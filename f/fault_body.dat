40|$|Modeling of self-exciting wave {{processes}} in crustal faults requires substantiation {{of the possibility}} to represent the faults as a self-exciting wave system. The self-exciting wave system is shown to be active, nonlinear and unstable. 1. The activity of the system suggests that the energy and substance exchange with the environment, and the transformation mechanism of the energy reserved in the system is converted to wave energy. As thermodynamically open systems, the faults exchange by energy and fluid flows with the geomassives. The fault zones undergo permanent outer and inner effects of the tectonic and gravity stress fields, dynamic loads {{as the result of}} earth tides, irregular Earth rotation, waves from earthquakes, etc. The fluids are actually displaced in the fault zones, which influence immediately the fault dynamics and provide the oscillating regimes of the physical and chemical {{processes in}} the crust and lithosphere. The chemical degradation of the fracture-porous cemented geomaterials of the <b>fault</b> <b>body</b> is governed by heat and mass transfer due to decomposition of the intraporous fluid, molecular diffusion in the porous matrix, diffusion and advection in fractures and fault canals.

Furthermore, the faults generated during extensional events can favour the circulation of dolomitaizing fluids, leading {{to the formation of}} <b>fault</b> related dolomitized <b>bodies</b> that can strongly improve the porosity framework. In the last few years, this type of bodies received particularly attention by the hydrocarbon industry, due to the decrease of conventional reservoir discoveries. However, structural network, porosity distribution, shape and geometry of the <b>fault</b> related dolomitized <b>bodies</b> and the porosity evolution of these types of reservoirs are difficult to predict only on the bases of well-logs and seismic information. The study of outcrop analogues can help to solve these issues. In this work I focused my attention to the carbonate platform of the Calcari Grigi group (formed by Monte Zugna, Loppio and Rotzo Formations), located on the Trento platform in the Southern Alps, which was extensively affected by synsedymentary extensional tectonic during the Early Jurassic. This tectonic event led to the tilting of the Loppio Formation and caused abruptly change of thickness in the Rotzo Formation. The extension ceased during the deposition of {{the upper part of the}} Rotzo Formation, which seals the Jurassic faults. During the late Paleocene-early Eocene, the Alpine tectonics reactivated, with a strike slip movement, the Jurassic faults allowing the circulation of dolomitizing fluids and leading to the formation of secondary fault-related dolomitized bodies. A Jurassic synsedimenatry structure affected by secondary dolomitization is spectacularly exposed near the Monte Testo on the Asiago Plateau.

In {{the initial stages of}} detachment faulting and high-angle fault, scarps show extensive mass wasting that reduces their slope. Flexural rotation further lowers scarp slope, hinders mass wasting, resulting in morphologically complex chaotic terrain between the breakaway and the denuded corrugated surface. Extension and drag along the fault plane uplifts a wedge of hangingwall material (apron). The detachment surface emerges along a continuous moat that sheds rocks and covers it with unconsolidated rubble, while local slumping emplaces rubble ridges overlying corrugations. The detachment fault zone is a set of anostomosed slip planes, elongated in the along-extension direction. Slip planes bind <b>fault</b> rock <b>bodies</b> defining the corrugations observed in microbathymetry and sonar.

(2) The seismic moment was 2. 6 × 10 ^ 27 dyn cm. The directivity of the surface wave radiation indicates an asymmetric (1 : 2. 3) bilateral faulting with a total length of 250 km. In modeling the displacement a rupture velocity of 3 km/s was used, and the fault curvature was included. (3) If a fault width of 15 km is assumed, the average offset is estimated to be about 2 m. This value is about twice as large as the average surface offset. (4) Although the observed directivity suggests a uniform overall displacement along the <b>fault,</b> the <b>body</b> wave analysis suggests that the earthquake consists of as many as 10 independent events, each having a seismic moment of 1. 3 – 5. 3 × 10 ^ 26 dyn cm and a fault length of about 10 km.

API developers write Javadoc comments, and API users often read these comments to understand the API they use, e. g., an API user can read a Javadoc comment for a method instead of reading the method body of the method. An inconsistency between the Javadoc comment and body for a method indicates either a <b>fault</b> in the <b>body</b> or, effectively, a fault in the comment that can mislead the method callers to introduce faults in their code. This thesis presents a novel approach, called @tComment, for testing Javadoc comments, specifically for testing method properties about null values and related exceptions. Our approach consists of two components. The first component takes as input source files for a Java project and automatically analyzes the English text in Javadoc comments to infer a set of likely properties for a method in the files. The second component generates random tests for these methods, checks the inferred properties, and reports inconsistencies. We evaluated @tComment on seven open-source projects and found 28 inconsistencies between Javadoc comments and method bodies.

The progressive variation in geometry, scale, composition and texture of these successive magmatic events appears to have resulted from a "decaying" or lowering oceanic geothermal gradient. [...] Earliest identified crustal processes record the development of a relatively large (at least 3 to 4 km) open-system magma chamber which is defined by a differentiated plutonic suite of ultramafic to mafic cumulates. [...] Lowering geotherms result in a freezing of the axial magma chamber and a lowering of the brittle-ductile transition zone into the lower crust and upper mantle. The axial magma chamber which is initially affected by high temperature ductile deformation accommodates extension by brittle failure which in turn controls the geometry and distribution of subsequent magmatic episodes. These are defined by much smaller <b>fault</b> controlled dike-like <b>bodies</b> that are lithologically and texturally highly variable, but temporally gradational. [...] Accompanying the structural change is a significant reduction in the supply of magma to the ridge system. Chemically these magmas become progressively more depleted (REEs and TiO₂) and increasingly refractory (enriched in Mg, Cr and Ni) through time and appear to be correlative with the Troodos lava sequence. [...] A definitive explanation for the death of the ridge system at this stage is not possible, however "ridge jumping" or a locking up of the subduction system from which the Troodos crust was being generated due to collision, are possible candidates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{progressive}} automation {{and consistent}} rationalization in production of automotive components requires {{the use of}} new sheet materials as well as innovations in press and tool technologies. Sheet metal forming is getting more and more complex. Thus several structural defects like thinning, cracks and creases as well as geometrical imprecisions due to spring back may occur. At the same time, consumer demands are rising concerning product quality and value for money. Therefore optimized processes and efficient methods of quality control are required. As the main objective a 100 %-in-process quality control throughout the process chain is demanded in press shops. The aim of the experiments presented here was to detect structural <b>faults</b> in formed <b>body</b> components. Thinning is often considered a failure criterion in the metal forming industry. At high-strained parts even cracks may develop as a result of excessive structural thinning. Especially in advancement of high-strength steels, edge cracking may be a significant failure mode in many sheet metal stamping processes. Furthermore research activities were focused on the quality of formed threads: their presence and accurate shape. Inline measurements by the help of electromagnetic and micromagnetic NDE techniques offer the opportunity for online measurements of physical parameters while feeding acquired data into calibrated regression models. Therefore changes in mechanical material characteristics can be predicted for ferromagnetic magnetorestrictive materials and failures can be discovered. Eddy current testing in conjunction with multivariate analysis methods have been used for quality control on formed body components. The method proved to be suitable to discover cracks and, in some cases, thinning. The results show a significant correlation between eddy current signals and critical amounts of thinning. Future research may investigate how to develop these testing methods for inline control...|$|R

Geological and geophysical {{data were}} combined {{to conduct a}} highly detailed interpretation of the southern third of the Erawan gas/condensate field in the Gulf of Thailand. Data included three-dimensionally migrated seismic lines, horizontal time slices through the 3 -D data volume, time and amplitude maps generated on an interactive computer interpretation system, and borehole data. Using these data, six seismic horizons were mapped in the study area: (1) top of acoustic basement (Paleozoic or Mesozoic rocks); (2) near top of Cycle I (within the lower Miocene); (3) an arbitrary reflector within Cycle IIwithin the lower Hiocene); (4) near top of Cycle II (within the lower Miocene); (5) near the middle Miocene unconformity, near top of Cycle III (within the upper Miocene); and (6) a very continuous reflector within Cycle IV (within the upper Miocene). The regional geologic rlistory included several different tectonic settings from the Cambrian to the Recent. Subduction from the east commenced in the Silurian to Lower Devonian and continued until continental collision occurred in the Triassic. Subduction from the west commenced in the Jurassic and has continued to the present. Associated with the subduction was the formation of large granitic bodies which were intruded {{throughout most of the}} region. The Tertiary section within the Pattani trough was dominantly controlled by backarc spreading in the early Tertiary which initiated subsidence along older zones of weakness. Most of the faulting associated with the study area developed in the Miocene as the result of increased sediment load and basin subsidence. The configuration of the horizons mapped demonstrates the presence of a complex, faulted graben. Fault blocks of less than a quarter mile (half a kilometer) in width were mapped. Faults generally strike north-south {{in the northern part of}} the study area and trend eastward in the southern half. The structure contains major east-dipping faults which cut basement and associated west-dipping antithetic faults. The axis of the graben shifts from the center of the study area in the north to east of the area in the southern part. In the soutlnvest corner of the area, the west-dipping flank of another graben structure is present. Stratigraphic mapping performed on and between these horizons revealed a complex stratigraphy. Most sand bodies are thin and lenticular with limited lateral extent. Most of the section is fluvial in origin with only minor amounts of marine influence. Reservoir beds are mainly meandering channel sandstones and bars, rather than extensive sheet sands with each fault block acting as a separate unit in controlling hydrocarbon accumulations, it is critical to encounter these small <b>faulted</b> sand <b>bodies</b> in an optimum structural position. The use of three-dimensional seismic methods have aided in defining these structural positions...|$|R
40|$|Fault zones may exert a first-order {{control on}} fluid flow by acting {{either as a}} barrier and/or conduit in the subsurface. Faults often include highly {{fractured}} damage zones encompassing cataclastic <b>bodies</b> (<b>fault</b> core) {{where most of the}} deformation is localized. Especially in tight carbonates, both porosity and permeability significantly increase within the fault damage zones, while the fault cores behave as a hydraulic barrier for cross-fault fluid flow. The general validity of this hydraulic-deformational characterization of fault zones is influenced by several factors including displacement distribution, fault geometry, modalities of fault propagation, fault slip direction, mechanical rock properties and environmental conditions of deformation (mainly lithostatic burial and pore fluid pressure). In order to investigate the inner structure of tight platform carbonates, and hence gain new insights on the related fault permeability, we study the fault dimensional parameters (i. e. damage zone and core thickness variations relative to the amount of displacement) of different types of faults cropping out in the Murge Plateau, southern Italy. The Murge Plateau represents the Plio-Pleistocene foreland of the South-Apennines orogenic belt which is characterized by a relatively-thick lithosphere and a little deformed sedimentary cover. The outcrops in Murge Plateau are good analogues of the Upper Cretaceous carbonate systems of the peri-Adriatic area that represent important hydrocarbon reservoirs in southern Italy. In this work, we compute the scaling relationships between fault dimensional parameters and the cumulative frequency distributions of the fault-related fracture networks (i. e. spacing and opening). The scaling relationships are fitted by power-law, logarithmic or exponential relationships, in agreement with different degree of faults development within the geo-structural contest of this sector of the Apenninic foreland. Based on the relative thickness between fault damage zones and fault cores, we infer different permeability structures associated to the studied faults. These last parameters are strongly affected by the presence of both sedimentary dykes, which include large clasts of breccias, clay material and calcite, and karst that often is present within the fault damage zones...|$|R
