Improvement was defined as > 30 % improvement (≥ a half standard deviation) compared to baseline. Methods: We used the following outcome variables: difference {{in the number of}} improved patients on MPS (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI) and improved caregivers on burden (Caregiver Burden, CB) and competence (Caregiver Competence List, CCL). Assessments were taken after intake (T 1) and after six months of follow-up (T 3). Risk ratios (RR), number needed to treat (NNT), and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. Results: IRR had a significant positive effect on NPI-cluster hyperactivity (RR 2. 64; 95 % CI: 1. 26 - 5. 53; NNT 4. 07). In the complete cases analysis, IRR showed significant ORs of 2. 80 on the number of NPI symptoms and 3. 46 on the NPI-sum-severity; up to 76 % improved patients. For caregivers, competence was a significant beneficiary in IRR (RR 2. 23; 95 % CI: 1. 07 - 4. 62; NNT 5. 07).

40|$|Arterial distensibility and its {{converse}} stiffness have comeof age as physiological concepts 1 {{and now as}} {{a target}} for intervention.

For example, blood pressure (BP), whether casual or 24 hour, is more sensitive to stimuli and, therefore, more variable.

40|$|A {{hallmark}} of religion clause scholarship is the complaint that the doctrine is a hopeless muddle. However, the Rehnquist Court brought {{a considerable amount}} of consistency-well, apparent consistency- to the doctrine. I say 2 ̆ 2 apparent consistency 2 ̆ 2 because, just as a paradox is only a seeming contradiction, so was the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s religion clause jurisprudence only seemingly consistent. The doctrine focuses on whether the government singles out religion for special benefit (generally problematic under the Establishment Clause) or for special burden (generally problematic under the Free Exercise Clause). If, on the other hand, the government benefits religion as part of a more <b>general</b> category of benefits, or <b>burdens</b> religion as part of a more <b>general</b> category of <b>burdens,</b> neither clause is violated. Thus, religion clause doctrine seemingly fits together nicely, tracking a more general development in equality jurisprudence. However, there are some outlier cases in which the Rehnquist Court upheld special benefits for or special burdens on religion. These outlier cases are a window into a deeper inconsistency in religion clause doctrine. The outlier cases-and a proper understanding of why and when the Court views religion as foregrounded, rather than backgrounded, in Establishment Clause cases-remind us {{of the ways in which}} religion is distinctive. That distinctiveness is not properly valued by a formal doctrine that matches <b>general</b> benefits (valid) against <b>general</b> <b>burdens</b> (valid), and special benefits (invalid) against special burdens (invalid). What we take away from religion by the cases that invalidate religion-favoring governmental action is not offset by those that invalidate religion- disfavoring governmental action. We need a broader conception of free exercise to compensate for the ways in which the doctrine (properly, in my judgment) treats religion as distinctive under the Establishment Clause...|$|R

Recent findings Modifiable contributing factors to {{the quantity and quality of}} life in adults ageing with HIV include: burden of harmful health behaviours, injury from HIV infection, HIV treatment toxicity and <b>general</b> <b>burden</b> of ageassociated comorbidities.

MPS have {{negative effects on}} caregivers; 70 - 80 % of caregivers are moderately to heavily burdened. We tested an integrative psychotherapeutic programme (IRR) focused on MPS as well as caregiver burden. To develop decision rules in indicating IRR, prognostic potentialities of diagnostic and functional baseline variables for a favourable outcome of IRR were identified. Methods: Patients with a DSM-IV classification of dementia, amnestic disorders or other cognitive disorders were followed in a randomised controlled trial, comparing IRR (n = 81) with usual nursing home care (n = 87). Assessments at T 1 (intake) and T 2 (6 months' follow-up). Results: In the combined prognostic models Alzheimer dementia showed significant prognostic qualities for improve- ment on NPI sum severity (OR 3. 01), IRR on <b>general</b> <b>burden</b> and competence of caregiver (OR 2. 29 and 3. 34).

40|$|When a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{adopts a}} measure which it {{considers}} {{is necessary to}} protect against a health risk, but which constitutes a barrier to international trade in goods, there is a conflict of interests. If the measure is removed, the health protection interest is affected negatively. If the measure is kept in place, the trade liberalisation interest is affected negatively. Both interests are considered important within the WTO regulatory framework, and must therefore be balanced. One part of this balancing act occurs when panels answer burden of proof questions in WTO disputes concerning health protection measures. The core questions are: What facts must be proved by the parties under the relevant provisions (what are the ‘legal facts’) ? What party shall carry the heaviest burden of persuading the panel about these facts (what party shall carry the ‘persuasive burden’) ? And to what extent must the party persuade the panel about the facts (what ‘standard of proof’ shall be applied) ? In WTO law, {{there are a number}} of provisions specifically regulating the adoption of health protection measures. The most important are: Article XX(b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (the GATT 1994), and Articles 2, 3, and 5 of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement). The aim of this study is to analyse these provisions from a burden of proof perspective. The analysis is carried out in Chapters 2 - 5 of the study. Chapter 2 contains an analysis of the <b>general</b> <b>burden</b> of proof concept. The main conclusions reached are that a court cannot normally avoid allocating the persuasive burden to one of the parties, and applying a certain standard of proof. When deciding how the burden should be allocated, and what standard to apply, the court should primarily rely on arguments related to the desire to reduce the risk of an erroneous outcome. Chapter 3 contains a <b>general</b> analysis of how the <b>burden</b> of proof has been handled in WTO dispute settlement. The main conclusions from this Chapter are that, even though the adjudicating bodies have often addressed the burden of proof in their reports, they have not discussed why the burden should be allocated to a certain party, or why a certain standard should be applied. <b>General</b> <b>burden</b> of proof principles have been applied with very little discussion. Moreover, they have also relied on the ‘prima facie case’ concept when allocating the burden. This concept seems to have little practical relevance, and it is argued that the adjudicating bodies should not continue to rely on it in future cases. Chapter 4 contains an analysis of how the legal facts in Article XX(b) of the GATT 1994 (and the chapeau of Article XX) have been interpreted, and how the burden of proof has been handled under the provision. The main conclusions here are that the adjudicating bodies have not provided much guidance in respect of how the existence of a health risk, and the relationship between the measure and the risk, should be demonstrated under the provision. The provision has consistently been treated as an exception for burden of proof purposes, and the burden has been allocated to the defendant. This entails that the trade interest has been favoured, and the health interest disfavoured. Chapter 5 contains an analysis of how the legal facts in the relevant paragraphs of Articles 2, 3, and 5 of the SPS Agreement have been interpreted, and how the burden of proof has been handled under the provisions. The main conclusions reached are that, even though the provisions contain detailed requirements, and even though the adjudicating bodies have provided rather detailed interpretations in different disputes, many of the most important legal facts are still unclear. It is for example not clear when the scientific evidence should be considered sufficient to perform a risk assessment within the meaning of Article 5. 1, and what is required from such an assessment. This makes it difficult for the parties to know what to prove. More or less all provisions in the SPS Agreement have been treated as <b>general</b> rules for <b>burden</b> of proof purposes, and the burden has been allocated to the claimant. This entails that the health interest has been favoured, and the trade interest disfavoured. The conclusions of the study are summarised in Chapter 6. The most important general conclusion is that the WTO adjudicating bodies should not apply <b>general</b> <b>burden</b> of proof principles. Instead, they should examine how the burden of proof should be handled under individual provisions, in light of arguments related to the desire to reduce the risk of errors. It is proposed that the default option under the above provisions should be to allocate the burden to the claimant, and to apply the balance of probability standard...|$|R

Global malaria programmes and rehabilitation programmes are organized as vertical and separate programmes, and as such they focus on prevention, cure and control, and disability respectively. When looking at specific conditions and illnesses, the impairing long-term consequences of illness incidents during childhood are not questioned. Methods The study design was ethnographic with an open, exploratory approach. Data were collected in Mangochi District in Malawi through qualitative in-depth interviews and participant observation. Results Despite a local-based health service system, people living in poor rural areas are confronted with a multitude of barriers when accessing malaria prevention and treatment. Lack of skilled health personnel and equipment add to the <b>general</b> <b>burden</b> of poverty: insufficient knowledge about health care, problems connected to accessing the health facility in time, insufficient initiatives to prevent malaria attacks, and {{a general lack of}} attention to the long term disabling effects of a malaria attack. Conclusions This study points to the importance of building malaria programmes, research and statistics that take into consideration the consequences of permanent impairment after a malaria attack, as well as the context of poverty in which they often occur. In order to do so, one needs to develop methods for detecting people whose disabilities are a direct result of not having received health services after a malaria episode. This may be done through qualitative approaches in local communities and should also be supplemented by suitable surveys in order to estimate the problem on a larger scale. </p...|$|R

Three key questions were addressed: 1) what was {{the quality of the}} data, 2) which methodological choices were made to calculate disability adjusted life years (DALYs), and 3) were uncertainty and risk factor analyses performed? Furthermore, DALY outcomes of the included studies were compared. Methods: Burden of disease studies (1990 to 2011) in international peer-reviewed journals and in grey literature were identified with main inclusion criteria being multiple-cause studies that quantified the burden of disease as the sum of the burden of all distinct diseases expressed in DALYs. Electronic database searches included Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and Web of Science. Studies were collated by study population, design, methods used to measure mortality and morbidity, risk factor analyses, and evaluation of results. Results: Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria of our review. Overall, studies followed the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) approach. However, considerable variation existed in disability weights, discounting, age-weighting, and adjustments for uncertainty. Few studies reported whether mortality data were corrected for missing data or underreporting. Comparison with the GBD DALY outcomes by country revealed that for some studies DALY estimates were of similar magnitude; others reported DALY estimates that were two times higher or lower. Conclusions: Overcoming " error" variation due to the use of different methodologies and low-quality data is a critical priority for advancing burden of disease studies. This can enlarge the detection of true variation in DALY outcomes between populations or over time...|$|R
40|$|Asthma is a {{very common}} chronic disease that occurs in all age groups and {{is the focus of}} various {{clinical}} and public health interventions. Both morbidity and mortality from asthma are significant. The number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to asthma worldwide is similar to that for diabetes, liver cirrhosis and schizophrenia. Asthma management plans have, however, reduced mortality and severity in countries where they have been applied. Several barriers reduce the availability, affordability, dissemination and efficacy of optimal asthma management plans in both developed and developing countries. The workplace environment contributes significantly to the <b>general</b> <b>burden</b> of asthma. Patients with occupational asthma have higher rates of hospitalization and mortality than healthy workers. The surveillance of asthma as part of a global WHO programme is essential. The economic cost of asthma is considerable both in terms of direct medical costs (such as hospital admissions and the cost of pharmaceuticals) and indirect medical costs (such as time lost from work and premature death). Direct costs are significant in most countries. In order to reduce costs and improve quality of care, employers and health plans are exploring more precisely targeted ways of controlling rapidly rising health costs. Poor control of asthma symptoms is a major issue that can result in adverse clinical and economic outcomes. A model of asthma costs is needed to aid attempts to reduce them while permitting optimal management of the disease. This paper presents a discussion of the burden of asthma and its socioeconomic implications and proposes a model to predict the costs incurred by the disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: Occult {{hepatitis}} B virus infection (OBI) {{characterized by}} the absence of detectable HBsAg remains a potential threat in blood safety. We investigated the actual prevalence, viral factors and genotype of OBI infections in Nigerian blood donors. Methods: Serum collected from two blood banks were reconfirmed as HBsAg seronegative by ELISA. Forty HBsAg positive samples were employed as controls. HBV-DNA was amplified from all donors and viral loads were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Antibodies to the HBV core, surface and HBe antigen (anti-HBc,anti-HBs,HBeAg) were measured. The PreS/S and PreC/C regions of the HBV genome were sequenced. Results: Of the 429 blood donors, 72 (17 %) were confirmed as OBI by DNA detection in different reference labs and excluded the concern of possible contamination. Of the 72 OBI samples, 48 (67 %) were positive for anti-HBc, 25 (35 %) positive for anti-HBs, and 2 (3 %) positive for HBeAg. Of the 72 OBI samples, 31 (43 %) were seropositive for either anti-HBc, anti-HBs or HBeAg, 21 (30 %) positive for both anti-HBc and anti-HBs,one positive for both anti-HBc and HBeAg. None of the OBI samples were positive for all three serological markers. The viral load was Conclusion: High incidence of OBI is relevant in high endemic areas worldwide and is a <b>general</b> <b>burden</b> in blood safety. This study signifies the high prevalence of OBI and proposes blood donor samples in Nigeria should be pre-tested for OBI by nucleic acid testing (NAT) and/or anti-HBc prior to transfusion to minimize the HBV infection risk...|$|R
40|$|Background This article {{discusses}} {{the link between}} disability and malaria in a poor rural setting. Global malaria programmes and rehabilitation programmes are organized as vertical and separate programmes, and as such they focus on prevention, cure and control, and disability respectively. When looking at specific conditions and illnesses, the impairing long-term consequences of illness incidents during childhood are not questioned. Methods The study design was ethnographic with an open, exploratory approach. Data were collected in Mangochi District in Malawi through qualitative in-depth interviews and participant observation. Results Despite a local-based health service system, people living in poor rural areas are confronted with a multitude of barriers when accessing malaria prevention and treatment. Lack of skilled health personnel and equipment add to the <b>general</b> <b>burden</b> of poverty: insufficient knowledge about health care, problems connected to accessing the health facility in time, insufficient initiatives to prevent malaria attacks, and {{a general lack of}} attention to the long term disabling effects of a malaria attack. Conclusions This study points to the importance of building malaria programmes, research and statistics that take into consideration the consequences of permanent impairment after a malaria attack, as well as the context of poverty in which they often occur. In order to do so, one needs to develop methods for detecting people whose disabilities are a direct result of not having received health services after a malaria episode. This may be done through qualitative approaches in local communities and should also be supplemented by suitable surveys in order to estimate the problem on a larger scale...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective To {{systematically}} {{review the}} methodology of <b>general</b> <b>burden</b> of disease studies. Three key questions were addressed: 1) what was {{the quality of the}} data, 2) which methodological choices were made to calculate disability adjusted life years (DALYs), and 3) were uncertainty and risk factor analyses performed? Furthermore, DALY outcomes of the included studies were compared. Methods Burden of disease studies (1990 to 2011) in international peer-reviewed journals and in grey literature were identified with main inclusion criteria being multiple-cause studies that quantified the burden of disease as the sum of the burden of all distinct diseases expressed in DALYs. Electronic database searches included Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and Web of Science. Studies were collated by study population, design, methods used to measure mortality and morbidity, risk factor analyses, and evaluation of results. Results Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria of our review. Overall, studies followed the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) approach. However, considerable variation existed in disability weights, discounting, age-weighting, and adjustments for uncertainty. Few studies reported whether mortality data were corrected for missing data or underreporting. Comparison with the GBD DALY outcomes by country revealed that for some studies DALY estimates were of similar magnitude; others reported DALY estimates that were two times higher or lower. Conclusions Overcoming “error” variation due to the use of different methodologies and low-quality data is a critical priority for advancing burden of disease studies. This can enlarge the detection of true variation in DALY outcomes between populations or over time. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{is a major}} {{contributor}} to chronic diseases. High blood pressure and other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors are on the increase in Nigeria. The purposes of this study were to (a) explore associations among high blood pressure, social economic status, and health status awareness and (b) measure the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in 3 states of Nigeria: Lagos, Ekiti, and Ondo. Participants (N = 368) were selected through stratification and randomization. Data were collected in person with the aid of validated questionnaire, which measured socioeconomic status as well as other variables in Lagos, Ado Ekiti, Ijesa-Isu, and Akure. Logistic regression and correlation analyses showed {{no significant difference in the}} regional incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (F (4, 362) = 1. 23, p = 0. 30); and there was no significant relationship between the health status variable and the standard of living variable. Due to the fact that only 3 out of 36 states were sampled, this study is not generalizable and some other cardiovascular diseases modifiable risks factors that were not measured could have reacted differently in analysis. This study 2 ̆ 7 s results set precedence by promoting cardiovascular health. When disseminated, the results of this study will help advocate for a change process that curtails cost and decreases the <b>general</b> <b>burden</b> of CVDs in other, similar areas. Recommendations include measuring this incidence and prevalence of CVDs in all 36 states of Nigeria and exploring the interactions between culture, religion, health, and beliefs...|$|R
