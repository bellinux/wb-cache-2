Rivera was instructed to erect a structure large enough to house a garrison of one hundred men, a supply storehouse, and a powder magazine.|$|E

As Dando reached her front door at about 11:32, she was shot once in the head. Her body was discovered about 14 minutes later by neighbour Helen Doble. Police were called at 11:47. Dando was taken to the nearby Charing Cross Hospital where she was declared dead on arrival at 13:03 BST.|$|E
25|$|Michael Parkinson always sought guests who, {{besides being}} well known, {{had some sort}} of story to relate. He then saw his job as {{allowing}} them to tell <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> so by being open, relaxed and attentive. (He learnt very early on that in order to be an adept interviewer, he had to be a good listener.) He researched his subjects thoroughly, and, in the early shows, always had his list of questions to hand. Having guided them to an area of discussion, he rarely interrupted his guests — except to provide the occasional prompt — instead letting them expand on a particular topic. Sometimes, a person would warm to this style with unpredictable results. For example, he regards his chats with Shirley MacLaine as bordering on flirtatious. In his final programme, broadcast 22 December 2007, Parkinson stated that one of his most memorable interviews was with Jacob Bronowski in 1973.|$|E

25|$|On 1 August 2010, the News of the World {{reported}} that Palmer {{was pregnant with}} her fourth child {{and that she would}} take maternity leave from EastEnders later in the year. It also noted that she was already showing a baby bump. To facilitate the departure, Bianca will feature in a major storyline, which executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said was the only possible reason Bianca would have for leaving her family. In December 2010, it was announced that Natalie Cassidy would return as part of Bianca's departure storyline which started in January 2011. Bianca's departure was broadcast on 21 January 2011. Palmer gave birth earlier than expected, meaning that she started leave three weeks before she planned to. A departure scene and several other key moments were therefore not filmed, and changes had to be made to the storyline to accommodate her absence. Bianca reappeared from December 2011, though Palmer stated in February 2011 that she was in no hurry to return, did not miss <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not know when she would be back. On 19 July 2011, Palmer revealed that she had signed a new 'working mums' contract and would be returning {{before the end of the}} year.|$|E
500|$|A {{newspaper}} {{article about the}} suicide of a lonely man who jumped from a hotel window inspired the lyrics. Axton presented the song to Presley in November 1955 at a country music convention in Nashville. Presley agreed to record <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> so on January 10, 1956, in a session with his band, The Blue Moon Boys, the guitarist Chet Atkins, and the pianist Floyd Cramer. [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] comprises an eight-bar blues progression, with heavy reverberation throughout the track, to imitate the character of Presley's Sun recordings.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{later said}} [...] "Jim Wong [...] {{was a big}} help, too. A lot of the stage {{directions}} point toward farce, but Jim told me to play against that and just let the situation play out. The Forrest Gump scene was difficult, too. When I prepared <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> it the first time, I was almost Shakespearean in my approach. Jim made me toss it off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} just like him. Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E

500|$|Zyos {{studied his}} opponent's {{style of play}} {{in order to find}} weaknesses. He also practiced four to five hours to day, and the week before a tournament for ten. He stated that most of the stress of {{competing}} is mental, though physical fitness helps in tournaments that can last 16 hours per day. Talents he has suggested players need include quick reflexes, concentration, and the ability to play under pressure. The transition from Halo to Halo 2 was a mixed bag for Zyos, since he called it an [...] "easier game", but tournaments started being more focused on two-on-two. Once Halo 2 was released, Leto began to focus almost exclusively on <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not play the original at all.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{argued that}} new tests {{comparing}} DNA in the silencer {{to a sample}} from Sheila's biological mother suggested that the [...] "major component" [...] of the DNA in the silencer had not come from Sheila. A DNA sample from June's sister suggested that the major component had come from June, they argued. The court concluded that June's DNA was in the silencer, that Sheila's DNA {{may have been in}} the silencer, and that there was evidence of DNA from at least one male. The judges' conclusion was that the results were complex, incomplete, and also meaningless because they did not establish how June's DNA came to be in the silencer years after the trial, did not establish that Sheila's was not in <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not lead to a conclusion that Bamber's conviction was unsafe.|$|E
500|$|Upon the group's {{return to}} California, {{post-production}} {{work on the}} Sweetheart of the Rodeo album was disrupted when Parsons' appearance on the album was contested by Lee Hazlewood, who contended that the singer was still under contract to his LHI record label. [...] While the legal problems were being resolved, McGuinn replaced three of Parsons' lead vocals with his own singing, a move that still infuriated Parsons as late as 1973, when he told Cameron Crowe {{in an interview that}} McGuinn [...] "erased <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> the vocals himself and fucked it up." [...] However, Parsons was still featured singing lead vocals on the songs [...] "Hickory Wind", [...] "You're Still on My Mind", and [...] "Life in Prison". [...] There has been speculation that McGuinn's decision to re-record Parsons' lead vocals himself was not entirely motivated by the threat of legal action, but by a desire to decrease Parsons' presence on the album.

500|$|Damage was {{greatest}} in Connecticut, where floods affected {{about two-thirds of}} the state. It was the largest flood on record in the state's history. All major streams and valleys were flooded during the storm, including hundreds of tributaries, and 30gauges in the state reported the highest level on record. The Connecticut River at Hartford reached the third-highest level on record at the time, cresting at , or [...] above flood stage. Although there was rural damage, the city of Hartford was spared from flooding due to previously constructed dykes. The Naugatuck River had significant flooding that damaged or destroyed every bridge across <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> extensive damage in Ansonia. In Waterbury, the river washed buildings and railroad girders into a bridge. In the city, 30people were killed, including 26 in 13houses that were washed away in one block. The Quinebaug River flooded the city of Putnam {{at the same time that}} a major fire originated at a magnesium plant. Much of the commercial district of Winsted was destroyed by the Mad River, which reached [...] deep; the floods destroyed most buildings on the south side of the town's Main Street, and carried away several cars from a car dealership. The local newspaper reported that 95% of businesses were destroyed or severely damaged in Winsted. High rivers destroyed historical sites and buildings, and statewide Diane destroyed 563houses. There were 77deaths in the state and $350million in damage. Most of the damage in the state was industrial or commercial damage.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses told {{the heads of}} the Israelite tribes God's {{commands}} about commitments ( [...] , nedarim, commonly translated, or some say mistranslated, as [...] "vows"). If a man made a vow to God, he was to carry out all that he promised. If a girl living in her father's household made a vow to God, and her father learned of <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not object, her vow would stand. But if her father objected on the day that he learned of it, her vow would not stand, and God would forgive her. If she married while her vow was still in force, and her husband learned of <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not object on the day that he found out, her vow would stand. But if her husband objected on the day that he learned of it, her vow would not stand, and God would forgive her. The vow of a widow or divorced woman was binding. If a married woman made a vow and her husband learned of <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not object, then her vow would stand. But if her husband objected on the day that he learned of it, her vow would not stand, and God would forgive her. If her husband annulled one of her vows after the day that he learned of it, he would bear her guilt.|$|E
