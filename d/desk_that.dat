5|$|In {{order to}} do justice to the {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group decided to build their own studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still lacked an adequate mixing <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> could handle recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E

5|$|Pei {{finally saw}} his {{architecture}} {{come to life}} in 1949, when he designed a two-story corporate building for Gulf Oil in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained {{as part of an}} apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior curtain wall brought praise from the journal Architectural Forum. Pei's designs echoed the work of Mies van der Rohe in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah in 1952. Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including Henry N. Cobb and Ulrich Franzen. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with teak walls and a glass clerestory. They also installed a control panel into the <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.|$|E

25|$|The next morning, {{the group}} {{sets out to}} {{retrieve}} the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley, which Everett earlier claimed was the location of his treasure. The police, having learned of the place from Pete, arrest the group. Dismissing their claims of receiving pardons, Sheriff Cooley orders them hanged. Just as Everett prays to God, the valley is flooded and they are saved. Tommy finds the ring in a <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> floats by, and they return to town. However, when Everett presents the ring to Penny, it turns out it wasn't her ring, and she doesn't even remember where she put it.|$|E

Shayler moved again, to G9 branch, responsible for Middle Eastern terrorism where he reportedly headed the Libyan desk as G9A/5. It was during his tenure at the Libyan <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> he claims that he learned of the MI6 plot to assassinate Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi from his MI6 counterpart David Watson (PT16B) and Richard Bartlett (PT16) who had overall control and responsibility for the operation. He left the service in October 1996.|$|E
25|$|When {{president}} Lyndon B. Johnson {{took office}} in 1963, he found he was too large for the desk, and instead commissioned a plainer replacement which was built for him by the Senate cabinet shop. Richard Nixon, who succeeded Johnson in 1969, used the Wilson desk, the desk from the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, which he had used as Eisenhower's Vice President and believed {{to be that of}} former president Woodrow Wilson. Gerald Ford, who succeeded to the presidency in 1974 following the resignation of Nixon, used the Wilson desk throughout his term. Jimmy Carter, Ford's successor, brought the Resolute desk back to the Oval Office, where it remained until George H. W. Bush returned the Wilson desk to the Senate, preferring the C <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> he used while serving as Vice President during the Reagan Administration. Bill Clinton subsequently brought the Resolute desk back again to the Oval Office, where it has remained since.|$|E

Sir Rowland congratulates Clarissa on her {{relationship}} with and handling of Pippa who had a bad time with her real mother, Miranda and her drug-supplying lover, Oliver Costello. A phone call to the house is strangely cut off when Clarissa tells the caller that she is not Mrs. Brown but Mrs. Hailsham-Brown. Clarissa tells Sir Rowland that the house used to belong to a Mr. Sellon, a now-deceased antique dealer in Maidstone and the furnishings are his. His former trade means that enquiries are received about some of his furniture, including one for the <b>desk</b> <b>that,</b> unbeknown to her, Jeremy had been searching through earlier. Walking in on the conversation, Pippa tells the two that she has found out that the desk has a secret drawer and she shows it to them together with its contents: an envelope with three autographed papers inside with the signatures of Queen Victoria, John Ruskin and Robert Browning on them.|$|E
500|$|During Amin's time in power, {{popular media}} outside of Uganda often portrayed {{him as an}} {{essentially}} comic and eccentric figure. In a 1977 assessment typical of the time, a Time magazine article described him as a [...] "killer and clown, big-hearted buffoon and strutting martinet". The comedy-variety series Saturday Night Live aired four Amin sketches between 1976–79, including {{one in which he}} was an ill-behaved houseguest in exile, and another in which he was a spokesman against venereal disease. In a Benny Hill show transmitted in January 1977, Hill portrayed Amin sitting behind a <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> featured a placard reading [...] "ME TARZAN, U GANDA".|$|E

Within a few days he found a note on his <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> read, [...] "You are next." [...] With American assistance, he immediately fled Hungary for Switzerland. He and his family returned to New York City for a few months, and Szentkiralyi applied for a position as a Hungarian instructor at the Army Language School.

Messing took the door to Grace's office; she wanted to lean it up against the wall at her house as a piece of modern art. Sean Hayes was given a couple of pieces from Will's apartment: [...] "There's a leather box that was on Will’s <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> I want to find a place for."

500|$|St Edwen's Church, Llanedwen is a 19th-century parish church {{near the}} Menai Strait, in Anglesey, north Wales. The first church was founded here by St Edwen (daughter of Edwin of Northumbria, king and saint) in 640, but the present {{structure}} dates from 1856 and {{was designed by}} Henry Kennedy, {{the architect of the}} Diocese of Bangor. It contains some memorials from the 17th and 18th centuries and a reading <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> reuses panel work from the 14th and 17th centuries.

The replacement doctor, Dr. Harad assures Phoebe that she's in good hands, until he spontaneously declares his admiration for Fonzie, from Happy Days several times.

She moreover begs Rachel to talk to her brother Frank, and convince him to let her keep one of the triplets, after having second thoughts over the surrogate process. In the delivery room, Phoebe gives birth to two girls and a boy. Rachel breaks the news to Phoebe that she won’t be able to keep one of the babies.

500|$|The opening {{televised}} debate, Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate on TV3, saw moderator Vincent Browne challenge Sinn Féin candidate Martin McGuinness on the post-1974 {{membership of}} the Irish Republican Army (IRA), that McGuinness repeatedly denied, by producing eight books from under his <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> claimed otherwise. Fine Gael candidate Gay Mitchell suffered from lack of recognition by many voters, and suffered heavily for his controversial views on suicide and on Ireland joining the Commonwealth. Labour candidate Michael D. Higgins was pursued by his past links to the unpopular Fianna Fáil and his admission that he had smoked cannabis. Independent candidate Dana Rosemary Scallon interrupted the Prime Time debate, moderated by Miriam O'Callaghan, to read out a statement condemning a [...] "malicious" [...] and [...] "false" [...] accusation that she had heard had been made against her family. Seán Gallagher, {{a former member of}} the Fianna Fáil national executive, was leading the opinion polls ahead of the final televised debate, moderated by Pat Kenny on The Frontline.

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time The Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: [...] "Mr. Burns gives [...] this terrible plaque above his <b>desk</b> <b>that</b> says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how sometimes things don't {{go the way}} you planned, which is pretty amazing in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover this horrible thing so it now reads, 'Do it for her.' It gives me a lump in the throat thinking about it." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: [...] "A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 seems a bit odd, but this {{is a good example of}} a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success." [...] In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune cited [...] "And Maggie Makes Three", [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", [...] "Homer Badman", and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] among his favorite episodes of the season.|$|E
