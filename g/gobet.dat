The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much {{recent research}}. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand <b>Gobet</b> and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere {{are more likely to have}} been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.|$|E

40|$|The photosystem I (PSI) core {{complex of}} oxygenic {{photosynthesis}} {{is an integral}} pigment-protein complex that incorporates both the antenna and the reaction center (RC). It binds about 100 Chl a and 20 â-carotene molecules. In the PSI core complex of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, {{a total of about}} 9 antenna Chl a molecules are red-shifted with respect to the primary electron donor, which absorbs at 700 nm. We have studied energy transfer and trapping processes in trimeric PSI complexes of this species at femtosecond resolution by means of the fluorescence-upconversion technique. By simultaneously analyzing the fluorescence upconversion results and those obtained with a streak camera with picosecond resolution and multichannel detection (<b>Gobets,</b> B.; et al. Biophys. J., in press), we have mapped out the energy transfer processes that follow immediately after photon absorption. Equilibration among Chl a pigments in the bulk antenna was found to occur with a time constant of 360 fs. A major energy equilibration phase between bulk Chl a and the red-shifted antenna Chls occurs in 3. 6 ps. A slow phase in energy equilibration takes place in 9. 8 ps, after which the excitations are trapped by the RC in 38 ps. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements indicated an initial anisotropy of 0. 30, which decayed biphasically with a major fast phase of 160 fs and a minor slow phase of 1. 8 ps to a final anisotropy of 0. 06. The 160 fs phase is assigned to elementary energy transfer steps in the bulk Chl a antenna, and the 1. 8 ps phase to further equilibration processes, possibly involving energ...|$|R

5000|$|This usage {{derives from}} Miller's (1956) idea of {{chunking}} as grouping, but {{the emphasis is}} now on long-term memory rather than only on short-term memory. A chunk can then be defined as [...] "a collection of elements having strong associations with one another, but weak associations with elements within other chunks" [...] (<b>Gobet</b> et al., 2001, p. 236). Chase and Simon (1973) and later <b>Gobet,</b> Retschitzki and de Voogt (2004) showed that chunking could explain several phenomena linked to expertise in chess. To be more specific, more skilled chess players have a larger chunk size. Several successful computational models of learning and expertise have been developed using this idea, such as EPAM (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) and CHREST (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures). Chunking has also been used with models of language acquisition (Barnard, Lieven, & Tomasello, 2009).|$|E
50|$|A 2004 {{review of}} {{literature}} by Fernand <b>Gobet,</b> de Voogt & Retschitzki shows that relatively little scientific research {{has been carried out}} on the psychology of Go, compared with other traditional board games such as chess and Mancala. Computer Go research has shown that given the large search tree, knowledge and pattern recognition are more important in Go than in other strategy games, such as chess. A study of the effects of age on Go-playing has shown that mental decline is milder with strong players than with weaker players. According to the review of <b>Gobet</b> and colleagues, the pattern of brain activity observed with techniques such as PET and fMRI does not show large differences between Go and chess. On the other hand, a study by Xiangchuan Chen et al. showed greater activation in the right hemisphere among Go players than among chess players. There is some evidence to suggest a correlation between playing board games and reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.|$|E

50|$|A {{criticism}} of Dreyfus and Dreyfus's {{model has been}} provided by <b>Gobet</b> and Chassy, who also propose an alternative theory of intuition. According to these authors, there is no empirical evidence {{for the presence of}} stages in the development of expertise. In addition, while the model argues that analytic thinking does not play any role with experts, who act only intuitively, there is much evidence that experts in fact often carry out relatively slow problem solving (e.g. look-ahead search in chess).|$|E
50|$|While {{there has}} been a fair amount of {{scientific}} research on the psychology of older board games (e.g., chess, Go, mancala), less has been done on contemporary board games such as Monopoly, Scrabble, and Risk. Much research has been carried out on chess, in part because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible to compare their levels of expertise. The works of Adriaan de Groot, William Chase, Herbert A. Simon, and Fernand <b>Gobet</b> have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing.|$|E

50|$|Whereas {{most adults}} can repeat about seven digits in correct order, some {{individuals}} have shown impressive enlargements of their digit span—up to 80 digits. This feat is possible by extensive training on an encoding strategy {{by which the}} digits in a list are grouped (usually in groups of three to five) and these groups are encoded as a single unit (a chunk). For this to succeed, participants {{must be able to}} recognize the groups as some known string of digits. One person studied by Ericsson and his colleagues, for example, used an extensive knowledge of racing times from the history of sports in the process of coding chunks: several such chunks could then be combined into a higher-order chunk, forming a hierarchy of chunks. In this way, only some chunks at the highest level of the hierarchy must be retained in working memory, and for retrieval the chunks are unpacked. That is, the chunks in working memory act as retrieval cues that point to the digits they contain. Practicing memory skills such as these does not expand working memory capacity proper: it is the capacity to transfer (and retrieve) information from long-term memory that is improved, according to Ericsson and Kintsch (1995; see also <b>Gobet</b> & Simon, 2000).|$|E
