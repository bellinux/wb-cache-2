Licensing of the format is managed by NBCUniversal.|$|E

Despite a pro-Wright ruling in France, legal maneuvering dragged {{on until the}} patent expired in 1917. A German court ruled the patent not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Chanute in 1903. In the U.S. the Wrights made {{an agreement with the}} Aero Club of America to license airshows which the Club approved, freeing participating pilots from a legal threat.

5|$|Falafel {{plays an}} iconic role in Israeli cuisine and is widely {{considered}} to be the national dish of the country. While falafel is not a specifically Jewish dish, it was eaten by Mizrahi Jews <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>countries</b> of origin. Later, it was adopted by early Jewish immigrants to Palestine. Due to its being entirely plant based, it is considered pareve under Jewish dietary laws and gained acceptance with Jews because it could be eaten with meat or dairy meals. According to Jonathan Kis-Lev, falafel and hummus are often used as symbols for peace, as well as tools for bridging Israelis and Palestinians.|$|E

5|$|The {{conservatism}} of the Liberal and Country League did {{not keep}} up with the expectations of a modern-day society. There was dissatisfaction with the restrictive drinking laws; environmentalists campaigned for more natural parks and more 'green' practices; police powers stood strong, 'no loitering' legislation remained in place; gambling was almost completely restricted. The constituents who loudly demanded changes were mostly immigrants and their offspring, used to more libertine conditions <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>countries</b> of origin. Their homes, usually built by the Housing Trust, sprawled into 'rural' electoral districts that were controlled by the League. Labor pledged to introduce social legislation to meet their demands; Playford, who did not drink, smoke or gamble, had no interest in doing so. His own candidates knew that the 1965 election would be unwinnable if Playford did not budge. The economy was still going strong and incomes were still increasing, so the Premier did not change his position on social reform.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the great}} {{majority}} of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>countries.</b> Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope, their dignity is purely honorific. However, originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City of Rome, constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses (called suburbicarian sees) bordering the diocese of Rome (cardinal-bishops), priests of the parochial churches of Rome (cardinal-priests) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city of Rome (cardinal-deacons). Unlike today, the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses, parochial churches (called tituli) or deaconries to which they were attached. The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule, that cardinals – members of the clergy of the diocese of Rome – cannot serve simultaneously in another, external church, which is now common practice.|$|E
