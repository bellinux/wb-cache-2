25|$|Franklin Howard Scobey (May 27, 1837 – July 22, 1888) {{was born}} in Hamilton, Ohio. Scobey was {{considered}} The Spirit of Sigma Chi for being friendly with <b>everybody</b> <b>and</b> not just {{a select group of}} people. After graduating from Miami University in 1858 he went on to graduate again in 1861 with a law degree. He worked as a journalist in his hometown until 1879 but {{went on to become a}} cattleman in Kansas until 1882. Scobey then moved back to Ohio where he took up farming until his death. Never physically robust, Scobey was afflicted with hearing loss in his final years.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 reform, {{effective}} on 1 March 2010, enables parties to a lawsuit or trial {{to question the}} constitutionality of the law that is being applied to them. The procedure, known as question prioritaire de constitutionnalité, is broadly as follows: the question is raised before the trial judge and, if it has merit, it is forwarded to the appropriate supreme court (Council of State if the referral comes from an administrative court, Cour de Cassation for other courts). The supreme court collects such referrals and submits them to the Constitutional Council. If the Constitutional Council rules a law to be unconstitutional, this law is struck down from the law books; this decision is valid for <b>everybody</b> <b>and</b> not only for the cases at hand.|$|E
25|$|It {{caused him}} to reflect. But there was no result. The {{justice of the peace}} was a stern man. On the trial he found fault with the scheme and {{required}} us to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.” The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” Then he said to the jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.” He said it in open court, before <b>everybody,</b> <b>and</b> to me it did not seem very kind.|$|E

Bus Stop became a box office success, grossing $4.25 million, and received mainly favorable reviews.

Marilyn Monroe has finally proved herself an actress." [...] She received a Golden Globe for Best Actress nomination for her performance.|$|E

Menken said of the general songwriting process, [...] "the first challenge for us was finding that musical palette and lyrical palette and performance palette that really spoke to <b>everybody</b> <b>and</b> said {{that we are in}} the world of early Walt and to have that place to start." ...|$|E

Hearing rumors of a Honduran revolt, the United States government ordered his unit and a supporting naval detachment to sail to Honduras, [...] to the west, to defend the U.S. Consulate in Honduras. Using a converted banana boat renamed the Panther, Butler and several hundred Marines landed at the port town of Puerto Cortés. In a letter home, he described the action: they were [...] "prepared to land and shoot <b>everybody</b> <b>and</b> everything that was breaking the peace", but instead found a quiet town. The Marines re-boarded the Panther and continued up the coast line looking for rebels at several towns, but found none.|$|E

500|$|Small {{was born}} in Princes Town, Trinidad, in 1892. He first played cricket for a club in Trinidad called Stingo, which {{included}} players from the lowest social class. Cricket in Trinidad {{at the time was}} divided along racial lines. For cricket clubs on the island, the colour of a player's skin was crucial. Stingo was described by writer and historian C. L. R. James: [...] "They were plebeians: the butcher, the tailor, the candlestick maker, the casual labourer, with a sprinkling of unemployed. Totally black and of no social status whatever." [...] James described Small as a genial presence on the cricket field: [...] "Small talked to <b>everybody</b> <b>and</b> everybody talked to him: Joe radiated good nature and self-satisfaction." [...] Outside of his cricket career, Small worked for the Stores Department of Trinidad Leaseholds oil company.|$|E
500|$|During his career, Ford {{developed}} a reputation as an immensely physical centre-forward, especially toward opposition goalkeepers. His Wales international teammate John Charles commented on his playing style, stating that [...] "He used to bang <b>everybody</b> <b>and</b> knock {{them out of the}} way, he was never frightened" [...] but also described him as a wonderful person. Former England international Gil Merrick accused Ford of maltreating goalkeepers in his autobiography, although Ford later sued Merrick, stating that he had never been cautioned or sent off over his style of play, and received an apology and the withdrawal of the book over the claim. Ford himself stated that his personality was transformed once he stepped onto a football pitch, describing himself as [...] "Like an animal" [...] but also commenting that he was simply [...] "doing his job and doing it well" [...] Billy Bingham later stated [...] "He got some terrible knocks from goalkeepers but he also knew how to dish it out and he never complained to refs".|$|E
500|$|Asked in February 2017 {{if there}} would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, Cornell replied, [...] "It's always a possibility. I mean, we've been talking about it for at least three or four years now. We were talking about {{actually}} picking dates, and it just ended up not working out because everybody's so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that's taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it's really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it's comfortable for <b>everybody</b> <b>and</b> we want to do it, because I definitely feel like everybody's up for it." [...] On May 18, 2017, Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit after performing at a show with Soundgarden, ending the possibility of a reunion.|$|E

500|$|Cartman's {{televised}} morning announcements are {{patterned after}} the Glenn Beck television program, {{using the same}} types of music and imagery, as well as a logo with the initials [...] "EC" [...] that closely resemble the logo of Beck's show, which use the initials [...] "GB". Cartman also writes comments about Wendy on a blackboard, which is a prop often used by Beck on his television program. The day after [...] "Dances with Smurfs" [...] originally aired, Beck himself discussed the episode on his radio program. Beck said he had not watched the episode himself but took the parody as a compliment, and that he particularly enjoyed Cartman's hair, which was combed in a style similar to Beck. Steve [...] "Stu" [...] Burguiere, the executive producer of Beck's radio show, also complimented the episode, and said of Parker and Stone, [...] "These guys skewer <b>everybody</b> <b>and</b> they are always very good at it." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{method of}} {{recording}} caused conflicts to arise. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector's obsessive techniques: [...] "Phil {{would sit in}} the control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one note on the drum, hour after hour, after hour, after hour." [...] During the recording of [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School", Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times {{over the course of several}} hours. Sire Records owner Seymour Stein relates: [...] "To Johnny, this must have been like the Chinese water torture." [...] "I understood [...] attitude," [...] said Marky. [...] "He was from The Bronx, I was from Brooklyn. We got along very well and had a nice rapport… But he had his way of working that was very slow, and the Ramones had their way of working which was very fast. So that would sometimes irk <b>everybody,</b> <b>and</b> led to animosity with Johnny and Dee Dee." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} when you need to and it refreshes <b>everybody,</b> <b>and</b> it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
