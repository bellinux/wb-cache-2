5|$|As an even-numbered lanthanide, in {{accordance}} with the Oddo-Harkins rule, ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, thulium and lutetium, which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of ytterbium <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it has few commercial applications. Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the , a solid-state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E

5|$|Although Jupiter {{would need}} to be about 75 times as massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} and become a star, the smallest red dwarf <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E

5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the Solar System, nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the Solar System, might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E
5|$|Found {{with almost}} all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, {{lutetium}} {{is very difficult}} to separate from other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce, La, etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 0.5mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal {{is very difficult to}} prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, {{shortly after}} {{discovering}} Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments {{of a much}} larger planet that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before. Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 4% of the mass of the Moon, do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.|$|E

5|$|Outside a {{protective}} atmosphere and magnetic field, {{there are few}} obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106eV up to an extreme 1020eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers. According to astronauts, like Don Pettit, space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an arc welding torch.|$|E
5|$|Similarly to {{the other}} rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} has no known biological role, but it is found even in humans, concentrating in bones, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the liver and kidneys. Lutetium salts are known to occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides. Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content, so it is not known how much the average human takes in, but estimations show the amount <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> several micrograms per year, all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants. Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic, but insoluble ones are not.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of actinium in the Earth's crust <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 5%. Actinium is mostly present in uranium-containing, {{but also in}} other minerals, though in much smaller quantities. The content of actinium in most natural objects corresponds to the isotopic equilibrium of parent isotope 235U, {{and it is not}} affected by the weak Ac migration. Protactinium is more abundant (10−12%) in the Earth's crust than actinium. It was discovered in the uranium ore in 1913 by Fajans and Göhring. As actinium, the distribution of protactinium follows that of 235U.|$|E

5|$|Toxic {{peptides}} from Amanita {{species have}} been widely used in biological research as chemical agents to inhibit RNA polymerase II, an enzyme essential for protein synthesis. However, these toxic peptides can only be obtained from fruit bodies collected from natural habitats, and are consequently expensive. Some success has been reported in extracting peptide toxins directly from the mycelia of Amanita exitialis grown in liquid culture. Although the toxin concentration in the mycelium <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 10% of that in fruiting bodies, the authors suggest that is possible to increase the amatoxin production by optimizing the growth conditions.|$|E
5|$|Vega <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> a {{tenth of}} the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its {{expected}} lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies. Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium. Vega is also a variable star that varies slightly in brightness. It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274km/s at the equator. This causes the equator to bulge outward due to centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is observed from the direction of one of these poles.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that Kuiper belt objects {{are composed of}} a mixture of rock {{and a variety of}} ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock–ice fractions are known for {{only a small number of}} objects for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense objects are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects are likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There is a trend of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. One possible explanation for this trend is that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.|$|E
