The [...] "great and powerful Oz" [...] is actually Herman Smith, a failed politician from Atlantic City, New Jersey, who was transported to Oz when a balloon he was flying to promote his campaign to become the city dogcatcher was lost in a storm. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion are distraught that they will never receive their respective brain, heart, and courage, but Dorothy makes them realize that they already have had these things all along.

When they all storm into the Wizard's room, they {{discover}} it is merely a Hollywood effects stage and that the Wizard (Jeffrey Tambor) is just an ordinary man, pretending. He asked for the witch's eye so that she could not see him for who he really was. Even so, he still proceeds to grant their wishes. Dorothy finally becomes a singer in the Land of Oz, but she realizes that all she ever really wanted was to go back home and be with her family. After traveling back to Munchkinland, she meets Glinda the Good Witch of the South (Miss Piggy), who tells her that if she clicks <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> together three times, she will be able to go anywhere she desires, contrary to how the Good Witch of the North said to get to the Emerald City.

500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{returns from}} Outward Bound manager training—where {{he became more}} [...] "decisive and confident"—hoping for revenge on Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for commandeering his job during the {{previous}} spring. To do this, Andy sets up a slackline {{in the parking lot}} and makes the employees walk across it, humiliating Nellie as she insists on walking in <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> and fails to keep her balance. After Clark proves that he is talented at balancing, Dwight attempts to one-up him, but ends up failing repeatedly and hurting himself. Eventually, Dwight tries to prove his superiority by riding a bicycle across a tight-rope suspended between the roof and a telephone pole, but the photocopier he is using as a counterweight is not heavy enough and he ends up losing his balance and hanging from the bicycle above the parking lot. Much to his embarrassment, he has to be rescued by a team of firefighters, while Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) mistakenly believes the incident to be a circus act.

Around a campfire, he listens to tales; the Bouto or river dolphin used to take [...] "the shape of a beautiful woman, with hair hanging loose to <b>her</b> <b>heels,</b> and walking ashore at night in the streets of Ega, to entice the young men down to the water" [...] where the Bouto would grab them and [...] "plunge beneath the waves with a triumphant cry". They go turtle-hunting; and Bates kills an alligator with a heavy stick.

500|$|On January 22, 2011, Spears tweeted {{from the}} video shoot, {{saying it was}} [...] "an {{incredible}} experience" [...] and would [...] "be {{one of the best}} videos I have ever done." [...] On February 2, 2011, accusations came from TMZ.com that Åkerlund had decided to use a dance double for Spears when it seemed like she had not rehearsed her moves enough.

[...] I've been around long enough to know when an artist gives it their all, and to me it doesn't get better than this. This video is gonna be fucking awesome! It's all Britney." [...] Her manager Larry Rudolph later confirmed that a body double was actually used, but only for the scenes in which Spears fights herself. The fight scene was choreographed by Steven Ho. He commented that Spears incorporated the moves learned during rehearsals, but also incorporated [...] "her own flavor", by adding a small shuffle of steps in <b>her</b> <b>heels.</b> The length of the dresses also presented a problem, and there were discussions about shortening the trains for safety issues. They were later added as 'weapons', as Ho explained, [...] "as if they were sharp blades, giving Britney reason to jump and evade around them." ...|$|E
500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out of her mouth and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was {{directed}} by Ray Kay and filmed inside a basement in Los Angeles, California.

In the special, Spears is seen watching the playback, as she later explained, [...] " [...] just to make sure it's right and that the costume looks right and the dancers are together and we all look in unison. It's an energy and it looks fresh. It has a certain vibe with it and it makes sense." [...] She also went on to describe the set as [...] "grimy and gross [...] It was sweat and it was disgusting sometimes". At a point in the shoot, Spears changed <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... but it looks good. It wasn't a full-length shot, so a girl's about comfort when it's not showing." [...] Spears said that she did not feel the need to top herself, saying that [...] "I've made so many videos that I'm at the point that I genuinely want to enjoy myself, and I have such a good team of people with me.

2500|$|Another pair, the {{close-up}} or insert shoes, is in best {{shape of}} all, {{appears to be}} better made, has no orange felt on the soles and has [...] "#7 Judy Garland" [...] written in the lining. [...] According to the Library of Congress, [...] "it is widely {{believed that they were}} used primarily for close-ups and possibly the climactic scene where Dorothy taps <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> together." [...] Circular scuff marks on the soles support the theory that they were the ones Garland had on when she clicked <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> together. [...] The lack of felt indicates these were likely also the shoes taken from the feet of the dead Wicked Witch of the East (since the soles are visible in the film), hence their nickname: the [...] "Witch's Shoes".|$|E
2500|$|When Dorothy leaves Oz {{after having}} several adventures there and befriending many of Oz's natives, she is magically carried over the Deadly Desert {{by means of}} the charmed Silver Shoes she had been given shortly after her {{unexpected}} arrival when her farmhouse landed on and killed the previous pair's owner, the Wicked Witch of the East. After knocking <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> together three times and wishing to return home, Dorothy is lifted into the air and transported to Kansas. The shoes however, slip off of Dorothy's feet and are lost forever in the desert. Baum states the silver shoes are never recovered. In the 1939 film the shoes are changed to Ruby Slippers. When Dorothy clicks <b>her</b> <b>heels</b> together she closes her eyes and says: [...] "Theres no place like home".
