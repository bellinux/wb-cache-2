40|$|Recently, many {{methods of}} {{evolutionary}} computation such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Genetic Programming (<b>GP)</b> have <b>been</b> {{developed as a}} basic tool for modeling and optimizing the complex systems. Generally speaking, GA has the genome of string structure, while the genome in <b>GP</b> <b>is</b> the tree structure. Therefore, <b>GP</b> <b>is</b> suitable to construct the complicated programs, which {{can be applied to}} many real world problems. But, <b>GP</b> <b>is</b> sometimes difficult to search for a solution because of its bloat and introns. In this paper, a new evolutionary method named Genetic Network Programming (GNP), whose genome is network structure is proposed to overcome the low searching efficiency of <b>GP</b> and <b>is</b> applied to the problem on the evolution of behaviors of ants in order to study the effectiveness of GNP. In addition, the comparison of the performances between GNP and <b>GP</b> <b>is</b> carried out in simulations on ants behaviors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe graph G(P) of a {{polyhedron}} P has a node {{corresponding to}} each vertex of P and two nodes <b>are</b> adjacent in <b>G(P)</b> if {{and only if}} the corresponding vertices of P are adjacent on P. We show that if P ⊆ Rn is a polyhedron, all of whose vertices have (0 – 1) -valued coordinates, then (i) if <b>G(P)</b> <b>is</b> bipartite, the <b>G(P)</b> <b>is</b> a hypercube; (ii) if <b>G(P)</b> <b>is</b> nonbipartite, then <b>G(P)</b> <b>is</b> hamilton connected. It is shown that if P ⊆ Rn has (0 – 1) -valued vertices and is of dimension d (≤n) then there exists a polyhedron P′ ⊆ Rd having (0 – 1) -valued vertices such that G(P) ⋍ G(P′). Some combinatorial consequences of these results are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Initially, {{function}} using {{genetic programming}} (<b>GP)</b> <b>is</b> investigated through symbolic regression for data mining applications. Various kinds of functions are investigated including function learning tasks {{as well as}} Boolean functions learning. The objective of the initial investigation is to review how <b>GP</b> <b>is</b> applied to function learning tasks. The drawbacks of this method <b>are</b> identified. Hybrid <b>GP</b> technique based on genetic algorithm-program (GA-P) for function learning tasks with variables and constants is investigated. This hybrid <b>GP</b> technique <b>is</b> further expanded to new hybrid GA SA-p. The new hybrid GA SA-P combining genetic algorithms (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) is proposed for function learning tasks with numeric constants. The convergence bahaviour will be compared with existing GP and genetic algorithm-program (GP-P). Application of <b>Gp</b> <b>is</b> extended to discover interesting rules among data sets. Given a set of data and appropriate parameter settings, <b>GP</b> <b>is</b> used to discover set of rules that describes the relationships that exist among the data. Finally, <b>GP</b> <b>is</b> investigated as decision tree classifier for classifying binary and multiclass classification problems. The simulation results will be compared with C 4. 5 decision tree algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Two {{correlational}} studies tested whether personality {{differences in}} empathy and perspective taking differentially relate to disapproval of unethical negotiation strategies, such as lies and bribes. Across both studies, empathy, but not perspective taking, discouraged attacking opponents’ networks, misrepresentation, inappropriate information gathering, and feigning emotions to manipulate opponents. These {{results suggest that}} unethical bargaining {{is more likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>deterred</b> by empathy than by perspective taking. Study 2 also tested whether individual differences in guilt proneness and shame proneness inhibited the endorsement of unethical bargaining tactics. Guilt proneness predicted disapproval of false promises and misrepresentation. Empathy did not predict disapproval of false promises when guilt proneness was included in the analysis. The comparatively private nature of the sin of false promises suggests that private ethical breaches are more likely to <b>be</b> <b>deterred</b> by anticipated guilt, while ethical breaches with clear interpersonal consequences are more likely to <b>be</b> <b>deterred</b> by empathy...|$|R
