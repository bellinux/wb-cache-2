Absorbers are constructed of thin, porous sheets of supported K 2 CO 3 that are spirally wound to form a cylindrical reactor.

In current research, effects of <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate</b> on drying rate, antioxidant activity, total phenolics and color of raisin were investigated. Raisin was produced sun-dried (as control), cold and warm alkaline at four concentrations of 0. 75, 1. 5, 3 and 6 percent of <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> Results indicated that by increasing concentration of <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate</b> and using warm solution, drying time reduced. Furthermore, raisin pre-treatment highly affects on total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The highest content of totol phenolic and antioxidant activity were observed in warm 6 % <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate</b> treated raisins. In addition, warm-alkaline treated raisin showed higher total phenolic and antioxidant activity in comparison to those of cold-alkaline treated raisins. Production method revealed a significant effect on color, drying rate and antioxidant properties of Bidaneh Sefid.

40|$|AbstractThe {{absorption}} {{of carbon dioxide}} with alkanolamine or <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate</b> solvents has gained widespre ad acceptance {{for the removal of}} CO 2 from natural gas and H 2. However, alkanolamine solutions are prone to oxidative degradation at high temperature. The main advantages of <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate</b> solution for CO 2 removal are the high chemical solubility of CO 2 in the carbonate/ bicarbonate system, low solvent costs and the low energy requirement for solvent regeneration. The major challenge concerning {{absorption of}} CO 2 into aqueous solutions of <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate</b> is a relatively slow rate of reaction in the liquid phase causing low mass transfer rates. It is often advantageous to add a promoter to increase the absorption rate. While piperazine is often used for this purpose, there are some environmental health concerns with this approach. In this work we consider boric acid as an alternative promoter. Absorption of CO 2 in a wetted -wall column by aqueous <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate</b> solution with and without various concentrations of boric acid as promoter was measured under conditions in which the reaction of CO 2 was of pseudo-first order. The equilibrium partial pressure and the rate of absorption of CO 2 were measured in 30. 0 wt% <b>potassium</b> <b>carbonate</b> and 1. 0 to 5. 0 wt% of boric acid at 50 to 80  ∘C. The overall pseudo -first-order reaction rate constants were determined fro m the kinetic measurements.
