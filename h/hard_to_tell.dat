5|$|It Ain't <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> by Nas. Nas has {{performed}} It Ain't <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> as a mashup with Human Nature using Jackson's original vocals at some concerts.|$|E
5|$|This {{extinction}} {{date for}} Babakotia radofilai {{is based on}} a single radiocarbon date from one specimen. For this reason, it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> when this species became extinct or how it is related to other lemur species.|$|E
5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer {{should not have to}} resort to reading summaries on the packaging to make sense of a story populated with incoherent battles and characters <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> apart from.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I can't. You wouldn't understand. Besides, I couldn't tell it just right. It's one of {{the things}} that are <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> I'd spoil it if I told it--now. Perhaps some day I'll be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it properly. It's very beautiful--but it might sound very ridiculous if it wasn't told just exactly the right way." ...|$|R
50|$|Exactly how a through gut {{formed from}} this blind gut is {{somewhat}} <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> The genetic mechanisms responsible for anus formation are quite variable, which {{might suggest that}} the anus evolved several times in different groups. Scientists are currently looking into this matter to generate a more complete picture.|$|R
30|$|Although {{removing}} question/measure pairs {{from the}} sample {{is one way to}} cope with unreliability, it reduces power, which makes it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> when two methods of generating questions are truly equal on a measure. Thus, for our second analysis, we used medians instead of means, {{on the grounds that they}} are less sensitive to outliers.|$|R
5|$|May is 13, but {{she knows}} nothing, is unable to talk fluently, nor walk with ease due to for her bandy legs. Her father is dead and she has four elder brothers, all mentally retarded... The {{students}} are all disabled, retarded and of different ages. Teaching them is a hard job. They are of the 3rd grade {{but many of them}} find it hard to do the reading. Only a few of them can. Their pronunciation is distorted due to their twisted lips and their memory is quite short. They easily forget what they've learned... In the Village, it is quite <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the kids' exact ages. Some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old. They find it difficult to feed themselves, much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work. No one can hold back the tears when seeing the heads turning round unconsciously, the bandy arms managing to push the spoon of food into the mouths with awful difficulty... Yet they still keep smiling, singing in their great innocence, at the presence of some visitors, craving for something beautiful.|$|E
25|$|An anti-Soviet guerrilla {{movement}} {{known as}} the Metsavennad ("Forest Brothers") developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946–48. It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{how many people were}} in the ranks of the Metsavennad; however, it is estimated that at different times there could have been about 30,000–35,000 people. Probably the last Forest Brother was caught in September 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.|$|E
25|$|The {{black-necked stilt}} is {{distinguished}} from non-breeding vagrants of the Old World black-winged stilt {{by the white}} spot above the eye. Vagrants of the northern American form in turn is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> apart from the resident Hawaiian stilt, in which only the eye-spot is markedly smaller. But though many stilt populations are long-distance migrants and during their movements can be found hundreds of miles offshore, actual trans-oceanic vagrants are nonetheless a rare occurrence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, mademoiselle," [...] he said, [...] "you {{will find}} it <b>hard</b> also <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me whether you come of your own accord or at the {{instigation}} of Herr Freudenberg?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{geographic}} location {{has played a}} role in the size of the problem. Because Portsmouth is located at the junction of three states and on the routes of several north-south and east-west highways, it has become a distribution point for more than just the local area. The separate state jurisdictions do not track prescriptions among the others, making it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> where the prescriptions are going. Generations of poverty have helped to create an underground economy supporting the distribution of illegal substances.|$|R
500|$|Curtis has {{attempted}} to distinguish his work from Moore's film, describing Moore as [...] "a political agitprop film-maker," [...] arguing that, [...] "you'd be <b>hard</b> pushed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> my politics from watching [...]" ...|$|R
25|$|Males in nuptial plumage are {{distinguished}} from green-winged teals by the horizontal white scapular stripe, {{the lack of}} a vertical white bar at the breast sides, and the quite conspicuous light outlines of the face patch, which are indistinct in the green-winged teal drake. Males in eclipse plumage, females and immatures are best recognised by their small size, calls, and the speculum; they are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> apart from the green-winged teal however.|$|E
25|$|Developed {{from the}} medium-range Tupolev Tu-104, the Tu-124 {{was meant to}} meet Aeroflot's {{requirement}} for a regional airliner to replace the Ilyushin Il-14 on domestic routes. Resembling a 75% scaled-down Tu-104, the two were <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> apart at a distance {{but it was not}} a complete copy of the Tu-104. The Tu-124 had a number of refinements, including double-slotted flaps, a large centre-section airbrake and automatic spoilers. Unlike the Tu-104, the wing trailing edge inboard of the undercarriage was unswept.|$|E
25|$|The art of Eastern Catholicism {{has always}} been rather closer to the Orthodox art of Greece and Russia, and in {{countries}} near the Orthodox world, notably Poland, Catholic art has many Orthodox influences. The Black Madonna of Częstochowa {{may well have been}} of Byzantine origin - it has been repainted and this is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> Other images that are certainly of Greek origin, like the Salus Populi Romani and Our Lady of Perpetual Help, both icons in Rome, have been subjects of specific veneration for centuries.|$|E
25|$|Tigrinya has {{a fairly}} typical set of phonemes for an Ethiopian Semitic language. That is, {{there is a}} set of ejective consonants and the usual seven-vowel system. Unlike many of the modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has {{preserved}} the two pharyngeal consonants. Along with , a velar or uvular ejective fricative, these phonological elements make it easy to distinguish spoken Tigrinya from closely related languages such as Amharic. However, it is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> from Tigre, as this language has also maintained the pharyngeal consonants.|$|R
2500|$|Over time, fidelity, {{dynamic and}} noise levels {{improved}} {{to the point}} that it was <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the difference between a live performance in the studio and the recorded version. This was especially true after the invention of the variable reluctance magnetic pickup cartridge by General Electric in the 1940s when high quality cuts were played on well-designed audio systems. The Capehart radio/phonographs of the era with large diameter electrodynamic loudspeakers, though not ideal, demonstrated this quite well with [...] "home recordings" [...] readily available in the music stores for the public to buy.|$|R
5000|$|Curtis has {{attempted}} to distinguish his work from Moore's film, describing Moore as [...] "a political agitprop film-maker," [...] arguing that, [...] "you'd be <b>hard</b> pushed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> my politics from watching The Power of Nightmares." ...|$|R
25|$|Entertainment Weekly listed Star Wars: The Clone Wars {{as one of}} {{the five}} worst films of 2008 with critic Owen Gleiberman saying, It's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the droids from the Jedi drones in this robotic {{animated}} dud, in which the George Lucas Empire Strikes Back—at the audience. What wears you out is Lucas' immersion in a Star Wars cosmology that has grown so obsessive-compulsively cluttered yet trivial that it's no longer escapism; Because this movie has bad lightsaber duels and the lack of the original cast, it's something you want to escape from.|$|E
25|$|White {{factoring}} {{affects the}} amount of white on the dog. It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> without actually breeding, whether a dog is white-factored or not, though dogs with white going up the stifle (the front of the hind leg) are usually assumed to be white-factored. Breeding two white-factored dogs can result in color-headed whites—Shelties with colored heads (sable, tricolor, bi-black, or blue or sable merle) and white bodies. For show dogs, dogs with more than 50% white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring; they are normal in every other way.|$|E
25|$|A {{change has}} also come over Voigt's voice lately, though it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if it's from weight loss or normal aging—controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas's drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet {{exhibits}} any of Callas's technical problems: Her voice {{continues to be}} reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable, however—earlier this season in Verdi's La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality {{at the very center}} of the instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, it's fine talking," [...] {{observed}} Mrs. Poyser, {{who was now}} seated {{near her}} husband, with Totty on her lap--"it's fine talking. It's <b>hard</b> work <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> which is Old Harry when everybody's got boots on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Bob, with embarrassment. 'But {{the fact}} is, that bird will hardly do for ye, ma'am. He's a <b>hard</b> swearer, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth; and I am afraid he's {{too old to}} be broken of it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Philip {{was afraid}} {{he was going to}} cry. He felt very weak. He shut his eyes and frowned, trying to control himself. He felt a sudden flash of anger with Athelny because he would not leave him alone; but he was broken; and presently, his eyes still closed, slowly in order to keep his voice steady, he told him the story of his adventures during the last few weeks. As he spoke {{it seemed to him that}} he had behaved inanely, and it made it still <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> He felt that Athelny would think him an utter fool.|$|R
25|$|The entire Early Dynastic {{period is}} {{generally}} dated to 2900–2350 BC {{according to the}} Middle Chronology, or 2800–2230 BC according to the Short Chronology. The Sumerians were firmly established in Mesopotamia {{by the middle of}} the 4th millennium BC, in the archaeological Uruk period, although scholars dispute when they arrived. It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> where the Sumerians might have come from because the Sumerian language is a language isolate, unrelated to any other known language. Their mythology includes many references to the area of Mesopotamia but little clue regarding their place of origin, perhaps indicating that they had been there for a long time. The Sumerian language is identifiable from its initially logographic script which arose last half of the 4th millennium BC.|$|E
25|$|Evans, at one point, {{published}} an {{assertion that the}} disc had been written, and should be read, from the center out; {{because it would have}} been easiest to place the inscription first and then size the disc to fit the text. There is general agreement that he was wrong, and Evans himself later changed his mind: the inscription was made, and should be read, from the outside in toward the centre. The centres of the spirals are not in the centre of the disc, and some of the symbols near the centre are crowded, as though the maker was cramped for space. One pair of symbols are set top-to-bottom, so it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what order they should be in. Except in the cramped section, when there are overstrikes, the inner symbol overlies the outer symbol. Jean Faucounau has proposed a reconstruction of the scribe's movements, which would also require an inward direction; Yves Duhoux says that any outward reading may be discarded. Despite this consensus, there are still a few such attempted decipherments (See Phaistos Disc decipherment claims).|$|E
25|$|Critics, {{such as the}} American Council of the Blind, {{note that}} U.S. bills are {{relatively}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> apart: they use very similar designs, they are printed in the same colors (until the 2003 banknotes, in which a faint secondary color was added), {{and they are all}} the same size. The American Council of the Blind has argued that American paper currency design should use increasing sizes according to value and/or raised or indented features to make the currency more usable by the vision-impaired, since the denominations cannot currently be distinguished from one another non-visually. Use of Braille codes on currency is not considered a desirable solution because (1) these markings would only be useful to people who know how to read Braille, and (2) one Braille symbol can become confused with another if even one bump is rubbed off. Though some blind individuals say that they have no problems keeping track of their currency because they fold their bills in different ways or keep them in different places in their wallets, they nevertheless must rely on sighted people or currency-reading machines to determine the value of each bill before filing it away using the system of their choice. This means that no matter how organized they are, blind people still have to trust sighted people or machines each time they receive US banknotes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "There's Hairy. Did {{you ever}} see two cousins look more alike? If it were not that Hairy is bigger than Downy it would be <b>hard</b> work <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them apart. Do you see any other difference, Peter?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1959, Wann Langston, Jr. {{recorded}} {{evidence of}} a Centrosaurus bonebed near Hilda, Alberta. Later, between 1964 and 1966 Don Taylor of the Provincial Museum of Alberta (now called the Royal Alberta Museum) oversaw the collection of fossils from yet another bonebed in the same region. These prospective bonebeds {{attracted the attention of}} scientists working for the Royal Tyrell Museum in the 1990s because Hilda was an ideal location for maintaining physical continuity across the bonebeds' expanse. Physical continuity is important, because discontinuity in the rock strata can make it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if the bones were deposited at the same time or not.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in September 1990, the 940 was {{essentially}} a cosmetic reskin of the 740. All drivetrains, and most options available in the 940 had been available in the 740, {{with the exception of}} the 780 Coupé. The 940 was more closely related to the 740 than the 760, sharing the same dashboard, drivetrain choices, and sheet metal from the A-pillar forward. In contrast, the 960 was an evolution of the 760. The 760 / 960 front sheet metal, independent rear suspension, dashboard, and other interior features were all exclusive to the two upscale models. The estate, introduced in May 1991, was even <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> apart from its 745 predecessor.|$|R
500|$|As a {{homage to}} Lewis, Azaria {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} the [...] "Treehouse of [...] " [...] segment in which Frink revives his dead father, with Lewis guest starring as the father. In a review of that episode, which aired around Halloween in 2003, Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Frink and his father's voices apart: [...] "Azaria voices Frink with such a spot-on Lewis imitation that it's sometimes <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> which one of the two nutty professors is talking." [...] In addition, The Knoxville News-Sentinels Terry Morrow commented that [...] "to hear Lewis doing Azaria doing Lewis is a mind-bending gut buster, the kind of pay-off that die-hard Simpsons fans live for." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were almost}} universally praised. Andrew Bub of GameSpy asserted that Nintendo should have used Iridion to advertise the Game Boy Advance, {{as it took}} {{full advantage of the}} system's power. A year after its release, TechTV's Miguel Concepcion argued it was still the best-looking game for the system. Miguel Lopez of GameSpot lauded the graphics, writing that [...] "while it's ultimately all smoke and mirrors, Iridions world is richly detailed, has remarkable depth, and is unbelievably fluid. It's often <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if the game's backgrounds are composed of streaming full motion video or just some really fancy math-powered 2D bitmaps." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{separate}} publishing from The New York Times, David Browne criticized the song's overuse of processed vocals, writing that: [...] "As heard on her current single 'We R Who We R' {{from her new}} mini-album, 'Cannibal,' Kesha has a thin, often computer-manipulated voice that recalls ’80s new-wave pop acts. It’s often <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> when her singing voice ends and the Vocoder processing kicks in." [...] Rolling Stone gave the song {{two and a half}} stars out of five, referring to the combination of Kesha's style and the song's themes as an [...] "awkward fit". However, Rolling Stone later placed the song at number 50 in its Best 50 Singles of 2010 list.|$|E
