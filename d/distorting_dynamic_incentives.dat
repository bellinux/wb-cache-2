40|$|Based on 18 National Allocation Plans (NAP) for phase 2 (2008 - 2012) of the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), {{we explore}} to which extent {{individual}} Member States (MS) {{intend to use}} the ETS effectively and efficiently to reduce CO 2 emissions. Our analyses at the macro level of these NAPs show that on average the ET-budgets in phase 2 are only about 3 % lower than the budgets in phase 1 (2005 - 2007), historical emissions in 2005 and projected emissions in 2010. While on average, the old MS intend to reduce emissions by about 10 %, compared to projected emissions, the im-plied excess allocation in the new MS is more than 20 %. When compared with a cost-efficient split of the required emission reductions, the ET-budgets in the EU- 15 MS are generally too large. Thus, the burden for non-trading sectors (households, tertiary and transport) will be too high. Noteworthy are also the high shares of governments' intended and companies' possible use of Kyoto Mechanisms, which challenge the traditional position held by the EU on supplementarity. In general, our analyses at the micro level of the allocation methods (across countries and phases) suggest that MS tend {{to stick with the}} oncepts and methodologies developed in phase 1, unless these actually contradict rulings by the European Commission. Thus the progress made towards more efficient and more harmonized allocation rules is generally small. With some variation, all NAPs include persistent inefficient rules for closures and new installations which <b>distort</b> <b>dynamic</b> innovation <b>incentives</b> and tend to preserve existing production structures. Observed improvements include a (rather small) increase in auctioning and the use of benchmarking for existing and new installations. Also, the NAPs of a few old MS have simplified special provisions for process-related emissions or combined heat and power. In contrast, new MS have often introduced such provisions in phase 2. We conclude that potentials to improve environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency are far from being tapped. Improvements crucially hinge on the outcome of the European Commission's review process. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Mobility on Demand {{is a new}} {{transportation}} paradigm {{aimed to}} provide sustainable transportation in urban settings with a fleet of electric vehicles. Usage scenarios prpopsed by Mobility on Demand systems must allow one-way rentals. However, one-way rentals bring significant challenges to fleet management because areas of high demand will tend to lose their inventory, whereas areas of low demand will tend to accumulate inventory. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>incentives</b> can be provided to encourage different usage patterns and alleviate the problem of demand asymmetry. This thesis proposes a <b>dynamic</b> <b>incentive</b> scheme for rental vehicle fleet management {{in the context of}} Mobility on Demand.

A comparison, based on a numerical sim-ulation, between the <b>dynamic</b> <b>incentives</b> (DI) model and a private savings (PS) model characterised by a stationary tax-transfer policy allows the assertion that, even if the first system converges to the second system, the total utility guaranteed by the government in the DI model is greater than the total value achieved by the PS model, and in the DI model, the gap in consumption between able and disabled individuals increases not only along working histories, as in the PS model, but also across working histories...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the <b>dynamic</b> <b>incentives</b> for technology adoption under a transferable permits system, {{which allows for}} strategic trading on the permit market. Initially, firms can both invest in low- emitting production technologies and trade permits. In the model, technology adoption and allowance prices are generated endogenously and are inter-dependent. It is shown that the non-cooperative permit trading game possesses a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, where the allowance value reflects the level of uncovered pollution (demand), the level of unused allowances (supply), and the technological status. These conditions are also satisfied when a price support instrument (dubbed European-cash- for{permits), which is contingent on {{the adoption of the}} new technology, is introduced. Numerical investigation confirms that this policy generates a floating price floor for the allowances, and it restores the <b>dynamic</b> <b>incentives</b> to invest. Given that this policy comes at a cost, a criterion for the selection of a self-financing policy (based on convex risk measures) is proposed and implemented.

40|$|Moral hazard {{is widely}} {{reported}} {{as a problem}} in credit and insurance markets, mainly arising from information asymmetry. Although theorists have attempted to explain how group lending with joint liability {{can be an important}} tool for mitigating moral hazard among the poor, empirical studies are rare and sometimes give mixed results. In Malawi, for example, although, group lending with joint liability has been practiced for nearly four decades, the unwillingness to repay loans remains the single major cause of default. This paper examines the extent of occurrence of moral hazard and investigates its determinants of occurrence among joint liability lending programs from Malawi, using group level data from 99 farm and non-farm credit groups. Results reveal that peer selection, peer monitoring, peer pressure, <b>dynamic</b> <b>incentives</b> and variables capturing the extent of matching problems explain most of the variation in the incidence of moral hazard among credit groups. The implications are that joint liability lending institutions will continue to rely on social cohesion and <b>dynamic</b> <b>incentives</b> as a means to enhancing their performance which has a direct implication on their outreach, impact and sustainability. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{an individual}} lending credit market {{in a rural}} society, where potential borrowers have a <b>dynamic</b> <b>incentive</b> of strategic default, and a benevolent lender gives them a credible threat to cut future credit when loands are not repaid. A crucial issue is that social sanction of default depends on the default rate in the society. Our analysis suggests that for a relatively small financing cost, a credit market exists where borrowers have little motivation to default voluntarily, associated with intense social sanctions. The results also reveal that a relatively large financing cost causes the credit market to collapse, since it raises motivation of default, associated with less intense social sanctions. These results could justify government support to reduce the lender’s financing cost. The model further illustrates the plausibility of two equilibria: a low default rate associated with a low lending rate and intense social sanctions, and a high default rate with a high lending rate and less intense social sanctions. This could explain {{the possibility that the}} default rate is different from village to village even though these societies seem to share an almost identical environment.
