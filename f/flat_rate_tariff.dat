The method {{is dedicated to}} designing the fundamental window patterns of ToU tariffs rather than optimising exact prices for each settlement period. It makes use of Gaussian Mixture Model clustering technique to group half-hour interval <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tariffs</b> within a day into clusters to determine ToU tariffs. Two groups of ToU are designed following the variations in energy prices and system loading demand respectively. With a number of price-oriented and load-oriented ToU tariffs, the investigation is further carried out to explore {{the effects of these}} ToU tariffs on domestic demand response (DR), especially in terms of energy cost reduction and peak shaving. The DR in this paper is assumed to be enabled by household storage battery and the objective of the DR in response to each ToU tariff is to minimise the electricity bills for end customers and/or mitigate network pressures. An example study in the UK case is also carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods...|$|R

30|$|Cost cap tariffs {{were first}} {{introduced}} {{in addition to}} existing pay-per-use plans and <b>flat</b> <b>rates</b> in the German mobile communications market in 2009. Provider O 2 /Telefonica introduced this new tariff type for voice communication in 2009 with a price of 0.15  €/min and a monthly cost cap of 60  €. At the time, this pricing was such that the minute price of the cost cap tariff exceeded the common market price for pure pay-per-use tariffs (0.09  €/min) while the cost cap was set {{at the level of}} comparable <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> plans. The introduction of the cost cap tariff led to a clear increase in customers for O 2 (Briegleb 2009). As a consequence, several competitive virtual mobile network operators soon followed with similar offers. While these mobile network operators are still offering cost cap tariffs, the initial provider O 2 decided to no longer advertise its cost cap tariff. Thus, the long run effects on consumer choice and providers’ profits are an open research question. Furthermore, the use of cost cap tariffs {{is not limited to the}} telecommunications market. Insurance services often include deductibles which behave in the same fashion as a cost ceiling of consumer payment. Also rental services, e.g., for car or bike sharing, often include a time-dependent rate which is covered by predefined day rates. Table 1 illustrates some selective examples for different industries. Thereby, note that cost cap tariffs are offered both by the same company in addition to its pay-per-use and <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tariffs</b> as well as in response to <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> and/or pay-per-use <b>tariffs</b> by competitors.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDomestic demand-side {{response}} (DSR), if widely adopted, {{could help}} make electricity more secure, clean and affordable. However, {{little is known}} about consumer demand for different approaches to achieving DSR. This study aimed to gauge the acceptability of a range of DSR tariffs, and explore factors affecting it. An online between-subjects survey experiment was deployed to a representative sample of bill payers in Great Britain (N= 2002), testing five tariffs including static/dynamic time of use (TOU) pricing (with/without automated response to price changes) and direct load control (DLC) of heating on a below-average <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> The <b>tariff</b> permitting limited DLC of heating was significantly (p<. 01) more popular than the TOU tariffs. This was surprising given evidence for concern around loss of control in DLC, and suggests that for many people DLC is acceptable in principle (within tight bounds and with override ability). The option of automated response made dynamic TOU (otherwise the least popular tariff) as acceptable as static TOU. This is important because dynamic TOU offers additional network benefits, while automation can improve duration and reliability of response. The TOU <b>tariffs</b> were <b>rated</b> highly for giving people control over spending on electricity, but other factors were more associated with overall acceptance...|$|R
40|$|Replacement of {{conventional}} power plants by RES generation requires future {{involvement of the}} new generators also {{in the fields of}} power balancing and ancillary services. Nowadays, small and medium-size CHP as decentralized generators with a significant potential for demand driven electricity production do not provide such services in most European countries. In contrary: implemented incentives like <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> feed-in <b>tariffs</b> promote an arbitrary or continuous production. In the course of the development of Smart Grid technologies, these small, decentralized generators will get incentives to produce electricity on demand and therefore take part in balancing. Furthermore, a rising participation in reserve markets and further system services is likely. The German pilot project eTelligence realized a sustainable energy supply system with a regional energy marketplace as key element. The integrative approach developed within the project has been tested in practice in a field test in 2011. Amongst a larger number of private customers, PV and wind generators and large controllable loads, a number of medium-size CHP became participants of a regional energy market in Cuxhaven selling all electricity to the market while serving the needs of local thermal loads. The project showed that intelligent market participation can replace feed-in tariffs with limited technical effort. The analysis of the field test shows the significance of the marketing and forecasting risk for decentralized generators within the approach. Nevertheless, the results prove the functionality of the marketplace approach to raise the potential benefit for CHP operators as well as the increased system integration as compared to conventional mechanisms for the promotion of distributed CHP...|$|R

Wireless resources (spectrum, time, space) are limited and shared, and transmission rates cannot be improved anymore solely with physical layer innovations. On the consumer side, <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> type <b>tariffs</b> have established unnecessarily high expectations and often wasteful consumption Dealing with congestion is unavoidable {{as a consequence of}} operating in a regime where demand is close to, equal to, or exceeding the supply. We can no longer assume that the current over-provisioning approach continues to be feasible. Complementary to the engineering for the growth of the supply side, this article focuses on the engineering for the control of the demand side. An approach referred to as the “user-in-the-loop “ (UIL) is therefore motivated here. This article proposes spatial control, in which the user is encouraged to move to a less congested location, and temporal control, in which incentives (e. g., dynamic pricing) ensure that the user reduces (or postpones) his current data demand in case the network is congested. Results from a survey, which measures how willing a user is to respond to such control, are also presented. As users are modeled by a system-theoretic box in a closed-loop (control) system, they feature an input handle for incentives and an output handle for the reaction. Incentives can be progressive tariffs, reward programs, higher access rates, or even environmental (green) indicators. Incentives are tailored to the major Quality-of-Service (QoS) classes and help to shape the demand at the application layer- 7 as well as the user (“layer- 8 ”).

In this case, the cost cap tariff is always dominated by either the pay-per-use plan or the flat rate. However, if consumers have uncertainty in their preferences, the cost cap tariff may generate a higher (expected) consumer surplus than a pay-per-use plan or a flat rate. This holds true even though consumers are charged more at the margin than in a pay-per-use tariff and the maximum possible bill amount is higher under a cost cap compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tariff.</b> This is because the cost cap tariff does not only provide cost insurance in case of high demand (like a flat rate), but also cost flexibility in case of low demand (like a pay-per-use tariff).

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the potential impacts of energy pricing on efficiency, equity and sustainability in groundwater use. The analysis uses empirical data on water productivity in agriculture for crops, dairying and farms for north Gujarat, east US and south Bihar. For north Gujarat, the analysis uses data from well owners who pay <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tariff,</b> and well owners who pay pro-rata tariff. For eastern UP and south Bihar, the analysis uses data from well owners and water buyers from diesel and electric well commands. The analysis also compares data from diesel well owners and electric well owners in south Bihar. The findings are as follows: Introducing marginal cost for electricity motivates farmers to use water more efficiently {{at the farm}} level through careful use of irrigation water; use of better agronomic inputs; optimize costly inputs; optimize livestock composition and carefully select crops and cropping patterns, which give higher return from every unit of water and grow low water consuming crops. It also shows that higher cost of irrigation water (because of higher energy cost) will not lower net return from every unit of water used as the farmers will modify their farming system accordingly. Further, change {{in the structure of}} power tariff from flat rate to pro-rata will not have any adverse effects on access and equity in groundwater use. Nor will it increase the monopoly power of well owners. The number of potential water sellers and not the number of potential buyers of water govern the price of water. Pro-rata pricin...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the International Conference on Comparative Development, New Delhi, India, 18 - 20 December 2007 West Bengal {{is a state of}} plentiful rainfall and high groundwater potential. It {{is also one of the}} poorer states in India. In view of this, many agencies such as RBI and the World Bank have recommended groundwater irrigation as a tool for poverty alleviation. West Bengal had recorded high agricultural growth rates in the early 1990 s. Unfortunately, this growth could not be sustained. This paper argues that one of the main reasons for recent stagnation in West Bengal's agriculture is the severe 'energy-squeeze' it is experiencing due to overwhelming dependence on diesel pumps, recent escalation in diesel prices and low rates of rural electrification. This paper argues that the current groundwater related policies have a resource conservation bias because they have been inordinately influenced by the dominant discourse on scarcity and depletion - a discourse which does not hold good in the case of West Bengal - a water abundant state steeped in poverty. In view of this paradox of scarcity amidst plenty, this paper based on primary data from 40 villages and 580 respondents makes a case for deploying groundwater irrigation for poverty alleviation through electrification of irrigation tubewells and continuation of high <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tariff.</b> Quite contrary to the received wisdom that electricity subsidies benefit only the rural rich and that metering of irrigation tubewell is the only answer, this paper argues that neither is necessarily true in the case of water abundant eastern India where efficient and largely equitable groundwater markets operate...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Time-of-use {{electricity}} pricing is characterised by high 'peak' prices, generally {{throughout the day}} and evening, and low 'off-peak' prices, generally at night. Consumers can benefit from time-of-use pricing provided their ratio of peakto- off-peak electricity consumption {{is less than a}} ratio of the relative prices of the two tariffs. To alter their consumption ratio, consumers can time-shift their demand, known as demand response. Consumers with grid-connected PV systems, however, already have reduced net demand during the day-time peak, due to the PV generation. The first question of interest to this paper is whether consumers with PV systems would benefit financially from switching to timeof- use pricing even if they do not engage in demand response. There remains the concern, however, of high prices during the evening peak, when the PV is not generating. Consumers unwilling or unable to engage in demand response during these periods can install battery storage systems, which are charged during the day and discharged during the evening. Two additional questions are therefore: what is the additional financial benefit of battery storage to PV systems with time-ofuse pricing and are batteries financially viable for domestic consumers with PV? These questions are answered using data from real dwellings with PV in the UK and simulating power flows using a published lead-acid battery model. Economic impacts are measured for a range of time-of-use pricing tariffs from the UK and Ireland. Results indicate that PV has little effect on the financial benefit of time-of-use pricing with day period prices that are similar to the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> price. For <b>tariffs</b> where the day period price is greater than the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> price, PV improves the benefit, but not enough to make it an economic choice for the average consumer. Battery storage improves the financial return, but this is not enough to make the business case positive.

40|$|The use of {{batteries}} {{in combination with}} PV systems in single homes is expected to become a widely applied energy storage solution. Since PV system cost is decreasing and the electricity market is constantly evolving there is marked interest in understanding the performance and economic benefits of adding battery systems to PV generation under different retail tariffs. The performance of lead-acid (PbA) and lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery systems in combination with PV generation for a single home in Switzerland is studied using a time-dependant analysis. Firstly, the economic benefits of the two battery types are analysed for three different types of tariffs, i. e. a dynamic tariff based on the wholesale market (one price per hour for {{every day of the}} year), a flat rate and time-of-use tariff with two periods. Secondly, the reduction of battery capacity and annual discharge throughout the battery lifetime are simulated for PbA and Li-ion batteries. It was found that despite the levelised value of battery systems reaches up to 28 % higher values with the dynamic tariff compared to the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tariff,</b> the levelised cost increases by 94 % for the dynamic tariff, resulting in lower profitability. The main reason for this is the reduction of equivalent full cycles performed with by battery systems with the dynamic tariff. Economic benefits also depend on the regulatory context and Li-ion battery systems were able to achieve internal rate of return (IRR) up to 0. 8 % and 4. 3 % in the region of Jura (Switzerland) and Germany due to higher retail electricity prices (0. 25 CHF/kW h and 0. 35 CHF/kW h respectively) compared to Geneva (0. 22 CHF/kW h) where the maximum IRR was equal to − 0. 2 %...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{supply and demand}} side {{benefits}} and costs of low cost urban electrification in Mbayani Township in Blantyre City in Malawi. The low cost urban electrification program, which used compact ready boards to provide electricity to poor households in Mbayani, is the first such program in the country. The study therefore examines the strategies used to assess how they impact the service provider and the newly electrified households in terms of benefits and costs in order to draw lesson for similar programs in the future. Using an interview, the study first examines the financing and planning strategies, technologies used, tariff design and cost recovery strategies on the supply side. On users' side, the study uses a sample household survey {{to examine the effects}} of electrification on households' expenditures, fuel use and on the small and medium scale enterprises sector in Mbayani. The study conducted key informant interviews to assess community leaders' perception of the program. In addition, the study reviews the South African electrification program from which it draws lessons for Malawi. On the supply side, the strategies used reduced electrification costs and enabled the service provider to use infrastructure that was previously under-utilised. However, limited financing and planning which ignored user needs has negative implications on the program outcomes. Electricity tariffs were based on a monthly <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tariff,</b> which is likely to negatively impact on the utility's revenue. However, at the scale that the program was carried out, this impact is negligible. The tariff nevertheless ensures cost recovery over a period of 5 years. While lack of data from the utility hindered detailed analysis of the supply side impacts, the study concluded that the strategies used yielded net costs for the utility. On the demand side, the study found that electrification strategies used had a positive impact on households' energy burden and budget control and that most households have switched to electricity for lighting, powering radios and partly for cooking. Major barriers in maximising benefits are high costs of electrical appliances and poor supply quality. The study recommends that future programs should use holistic participatory planning and should diversify sources of funding. Electrification strategies must also target small and medium enterprises and promote support for acquisition of better quality appliances...|$|E

This is the one of outcome of the researches were done by CEB in past few years and the successfulness of this implementation is depend upon the awareness of the consumers. Due to the lack of past investigations to prove the benefits or losses to the consumers {{as well as to the}} CEB by introducing this new tariff structure, the results of this project will be more important to the both parties. This investigation initiated by the selection of sample of industries and the selected sample covers major categories of industries as ceramic, rubber, food processing, hotel, and apparel. When the selection it was also considered the operational pattern of these industries as one shift, two shifts, and three shifts per day. The priority was given to their personal interests as well to carry out these investigations in their factories. As a first step the data were collected using data loggers to identify the loading patterns and major electricity consumed sections of these industries. Then the well suit options for the change of loading-patterns were identified with the involvement of responsible officers of same industries and then evaluated the expected benefits which could be obtained by tariff part time of day tariff with the proposed changes. At the end the reduction of peak electricity demand of Sri Lanka was caloulated to generalise the results obtained in this investigation and identified some drawbacks of newly introduced three part time of day tariff.
