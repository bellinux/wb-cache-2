5|$|In early January 1959, {{there were}} {{plans for a}} <b>federation</b> linking the Sudanese Republic with Senegal, Dahomey, and the Upper Volta in a <b>federation</b> of {{autonomous}} states. By April, however, neither Dahomey's nor Upper Volta's legislatures had ratified the <b>federation,</b> and so the Mali <b>Federation</b> was formed with only the Sudanese Republic and Senegal. In 1959, Modibo Keïta's RDA party won all 70 seats in the legislative elections in the Sudanese Republic and joined forces with the dominant party in Senegal, headed by Léopold Sédar Senghor. The <b>federation</b> achieved independence on 20 June 1960 within the French Community; however, divisions between Senghor and Keïta on the governance of the <b>federation</b> resulted in its dissolution on 20 August 1960. The area of French Sudan formally proclaimed itself the Republic of Mali and, with increasing radicalization of Keita, left the French Community in September 1960.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the inquiry}} opened, a poll was {{conducted}} in Tunstall where ratepayers of the town showed themselves to be in favour of <b>federation.</b> As the council itself had voted against <b>federation,</b> it decided not to oppose or support <b>federation</b> but instead to achieve the best deal it could for the town. The three-day inquiry opened on 8 January 1908 and was chaired by Major Norton, {{an officer of the}} Local Government Board. Norton's appointment itself caused controversy with the delegation from Burslem walking out on the first day protesting that Norton had already declared himself in favour of <b>federation.</b> The walkout did not disrupt the hearing but left only Fenton and Staffordshire County Council opposed to the plan, with Tunstall neutral and Hanley, Stoke and Longton in favour. The bulk of the inquiry examined rating schemes based largely on the Owen or Geen proposals from the previous <b>federation</b> attempt.|$|E
