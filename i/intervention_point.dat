5000|$|The humanization {{processes}} {{takes advantage}} of the fact that production of monoclonal antibodies can be accomplished using recombinant DNA to create constructs capable of expression in mammalian cell culture. That is, gene segments capable of producing antibodies are isolated and cloned into cells that can be grown in a bioreactor such that antibody proteins produced from the DNA of the cloned genes can be harvested en masse. The step involving recombinant DNA provides an <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> that can be readily exploited to alter the protein sequence of the expressed antibody. The alterations to antibody structure that are achieved in the humanization process are therefore all effectuated through techniques at the DNA level. Not all methods for deriving antibodies intended for human therapy require a humanization step (e.g. phage display) but essentially all are dependent on techniques that similarly allow the [...] "insertion" [...] or [...] "swapping-out" [...] of portions of the antibody molecule.|$|E
5000|$|While it {{is almost}} {{impossible}} to determine an exact <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> to prevent pregnancy-associated homicides, some possible opportunities can be pinpointed. The medical community is one of those points. Women may feel safe speaking to their health care providers about the abuse, especially after discovering they are pregnant. Some medical office and hospital policies specify that doctors will examine the patient privately without allowing the partner access. In a 2001 editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Victoria Frye writes, [...] "Homicide by intimate partners may offer a focal point for effective pregnancy-associated mortality prevention efforts because many of these women come into contact with the health care system before their deaths." [...] Reviews of Intimate Partner Homicide policy and research has identified several needs: System-wide training in healthcare on signs of domestic violence and system-wide screening for domestic violence by health care providers, as well as the knowledge of where to refer women to that need services when abuse is disclosed.|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} study of maternal serum alphafetoprotein (α-FP) screening of 9838 women {{in an area}} with low prevalence of neural tube defects and predominance of anencephalics revealed that an <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> of single serum α-FP level above 2 · 8 times the median was appropriate for this population. Ninety per cent of anencephalics and all fetuses with anterior abdominal wall defects were detected. There was no spina bifida among the population screened. Two per cent of the population screened had serum α-FP level above this cut-off level. Thirty-two per cent of twin pregnancies, 7 per cent of small-for-gestational age infants and 9 per cent of pregnancies which ended in either abortion or perinatal death in the population screened also had one serum α-FP level above this <b>intervention</b> <b>point.</b> The false positive rate was 66 per cent. This false positive rate was only reduced to 63 per cent if insted of one, two serum α-FP level above this <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> was considered abnormal. Using this strategy {{there was no significant}} reduction in the detection rate of fetal anomalies and other pregnancy complications. Because of the predominance of anencephalics in this population the diagnosis of fetas anomaly in women with abnormal serum α-FP level was made by ultrasound examination alone. The reason amniocentesis was not performed in these patients was to avoid unnecessary loss of normal pregnancies which may result from this procedure. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Developments {{are being}} made that allow pilots to have more {{flexibility}} over the control of their aircraft. This new concept is called Free Flight. Free Flight strives to move the current air traffic system into an age where space technology is used to its fullest potential. Self-separation is {{one part of the}} Free Flight system. Self-separation provides pilots the opportunity to choose their own route to reach a specified destination provided that they maintain the 'minimum required separation distance between airplanes. In the event that pilots are unable to maintain separation, controllers will need to have the aircraft separation authority passed back to them. This situation is known as a procedural <b>intervention</b> <b>point.</b> This project attempted to examine and diagnose those particular situations in an effort to avoid reaching a procedural <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> in the near future. Crews that reached procedural intervention points were compared with crews that made similar maneuver types in the same scenario, but did not reach procedural intervention points. Results showed that {{there were no significant differences}} between crews in a high-density acute angle flight conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Conceptual {{modeling}} is {{a decisive}} stage in any modeling process, but especially relevant {{for the analysis}} of complex, large systems. Here, researchers must filter out those processes that appear relevant, even before specific research questions can be posed. For this step of conceptual model reduction, we propose an explicit framework. Our research project assessed causes for biodiversity loss in German orchard meadows. A large conceptual model was assembled using literature review and expert interviews, creating an excessively large model. Then, two different approaches were applied to simplify this model and identify policy <b>intervention</b> <b>points.</b> Both approaches yielded different cause-effect explanations and pointed to very different research questions and <b>intervention</b> <b>points.</b> We found that combining an actor-centred approach with a macro-perspective greatly improved the relevance of our conceptual model with respect to policy advice...|$|R

40|$|Bank {{equity capital}} can play several roles; for example {{as a buffer}} against (unexpected) loss, as {{protection}} for other creditors in bankruptcy, and as 'skin in the game'.

40|$|The pluripotency {{of human}} {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) is important to investigations of early development and to cell replacement therapy, but the mechanism behind pluripotency is incompletely understood.

By mapping the distribution of metals in hESCs at high resolution by x-ray fluorescence microprobe (XFM) and by analyzing subcellular metal content, we have found evidence that loss of pluripotency is directly correlated with an increase in nuclear zinc. Zinc elevation not only redefines our understanding of the mechanisms that support pluripotency, but also may act as a biomarker and an <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> for stem cell differentiation...|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} {{also has some}} {{practical}} implications for individual career development. Firstly, although an individual’s later income is influenced by his/her childhood economic status, which seems to demonstrate low intergenerational mobility, this influence is not direct but through the effect of networking ability. The finding {{that the impact of}} CES on later income is mediated by networking ability provides critical knowledge for organizations that aim to promote intergenerational mobility. Organizations may treat networking ability as a key <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> to help individuals from low CES households to increase their later income. Specifically, by providing training and a favorable environment to develop individuals’ networking ability, their income level in the future will be increased, especially for those low CES individuals.|$|E

40|$|We use {{probabilistic}} boolean {{networks to}} simulate the pathogenesis of Dengue Hemorraghic Fever (DHF). Based on Chaturvedi’s work, the strength of cytokine influences are modeled stochastically as inducement probabilities. Two basins of attractors are observed with synchronous updating; the Null Infection cycle attractor shows an expected cross-regulation of Th 1 and Th 2 cytokines corresponding to the homeostasis of an uninfected person, while the DHF Infection attractor shows the onset of DHF. With asynchronous updating, our model remains valid with clinical comparisons against qualitative changes in signal durations. In order to find <b>intervention</b> <b>points</b> that could prevent DHF, we design a genetic algorithm to shift the DHF attractor to the DF attractor basin by using the DF final state as the fitness measure.

Finally, it draws on primary international research to show that the training advantages that local-level organisations can provide are valued by employers and vocational training practitioners, confirming the potential benefit of such interventions...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{guidelines}} {{based on}} systematic {{reviews of the}} evidence recommend identification and treatment of patients with coronary heart disease and depression. The evidence shows that depression is an independent risk factor for heart disease, and when present after an acute coronary event, is a predictor of poor prognosis. This paper will describe our experience of getting that evidence into practice using change management based on mapping the processes of the patient's journey through the healthcare system. This allowed identification of the points in the journey where screening and intervention could take place. Cardiac rehabilitation is the <b>intervention</b> <b>point</b> for acute presentation, and primary care has the role in long term follow up of risk factors including depression.

40|$|Health disparities {{are both}} real and deadly, but disparities are not inevitable. The causes of health disparities are complex, and their {{elimination}} will require multi-dimensional interventions. We {{have developed a}} threedimensional model {{for the elimination of}} health disparities. The foundation of public health is surveillance, which is the first dimension. We must continually measure racialethnic disparities in each specific disease, in its risk factors, and in outcome-relevant quality of care. The second dimension is research into the causes of disparities and potential <b>intervention</b> <b>points</b> to eliminate disparities. These causes and potential <b>intervention</b> <b>points</b> can be in the individual’s biology or their behavior, or in their physical and social environment, or in the healthcare arena (quality and access). The third dimension is intervention, which requires moving from what we know to what we do.
