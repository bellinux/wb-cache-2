50|$|One of {{the factors}} that {{influences}} the latency of N1 is processing effort: N1 increases as effort at processing is also increased. Specifically, latency seems to increase during tasks that are significantly complex or difficult and, thus, require greater active attention or effort. For example, the onset, peak, and offset latencies of the N1 occur significantly earlier in response to moving stimuli in a simple detection task vs. an identification task. N1 is also sensitive to the manipulation of a visual stimulus' intensity. N1's peak latency is shortened as the brightness of stimulus flashes is increased. Therefore, it appears that N1 latency is affected by perceptual factors, such as <b>flash</b> <b>intensity,</b> as well as the level of attentional demand or processing effort.|$|E
50|$|Polyaniline nanofibers {{have been}} used in the {{creation}} of monolithic actuators. They can be used in this application due to their ability to be flash-welded. When exposed to light, polyaniline converts the absorbed energy directly into heat. In a polyaniline film, the heat is dispersed throughout the polymer. In polyaniline nanofibers, however, the heat is trapped within the individual fibers. Therefore, if the intensity of the light is great enough, it will cause the temperature of the nanofibers to rise rapidly, which causes them to weld together or burn. With a moderate <b>flash</b> <b>intensity,</b> the nanofibers will melt rapidly to form a smooth film. Using mask, welds in specific patterns can be made using this technique. In a thick enough sample of nanofibers, only the side exposed to the flash will be welded, creating an asymmetric film where one side remains intact as nanofibers while the other side is effectively crosslinked due to welding. These asymmetric films demonstrate rapid reversible actuation in the presence of acids and bases, in the form of bending and curling. The advantages polyaniline nanofiber asymmetric films have over other actuators include the ease of synthesis, large degree of bending, patternability, and no delamination. These actuators could be used in the development of microtweezers, microvalves, artificial muscles, chemical sensors, and patterned actuator structures.|$|E

40|$|Delivery of intense, brief {{flashes of}} {{monochromatic}} light are required in single-cell physiological experiments to photolyze cellular chromophores or pigments. In the xenon flash instrument constructed, flashes are collimated, made monochromatic with selectable bandpass filters and imaged into a small-core fiber. The flash is transmitted over meters to the epiflourescent port of a microscope where additional optics again collimate the beam. The objective {{lens of the}} microscope functions to condense flash energy into a microbeam in the specimen (field) plane and to image the cell under parafocal conditions. Spot diameters are 228 and 166 μm (full width half maximum) for 40 × 40 × and 60 × 60 × objectives. <b>Flash</b> <b>intensities</b> can be measured with this instrument during experiments using the microscope phase/differential interference contrast condenser to couple the microbeam to a calibrated photodiode. <b>Flash</b> <b>intensities</b> between 108108 and 109  photons/μm 2109 photons/μm 2 were achieved across the near-ultraviolet/visible spectrum.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{leading edge}} of the {{response}} ofLimulus ventral photoreceptors to brief flashes was investigated using a voltage clamp. The {{leading edge of}} responses increases linearly with <b>flash</b> <b>intensity</b> when dim flashes produce less than one photoisomerization per square micron of cell surface. Brighter flashes accelerate the initial portion of the response, resulting in a fourth-power relationship between the magnitude of the response at brief times after the flash and the <b>flash</b> <b>intensity.</b> The onset of this nonlinearity with increasing <b>flash</b> <b>intensity</b> is determined by the local density of photoisomerizations within the receptor. Responses to bright 10 - 15 -iAm-diam spots therefore rise faster than responses to diffuse flashes producing the same number of photoisomerizations within the receptor. Background illumination shortens the response latency and suppresses the initial nonlinearity. These phenomena can be explained by a model of transduction in which light activates two parallel cascades of reactions. Particles released by the first of these cascades open ionic channels, while the second produces an agent that accelerates the rate of production of particles by the first. Injection of the calcium buffer EGTA slows the initial portion of the response to bright flashes and suppresses its nonlinearity, which suggests that the accelerating agent released by the second cascade is calcium...|$|E

The second experiment displayed the letters with multiple flashes at different frequencies to determine the probability that the sequence of flashes would be perceived as fused.

After 30  minutes of dark adaptation luminance response functions were obtained using flashes of increasing scotopic luminance (highest 9. 4  cd/s/m 2, lowest 5. 5  log units below it). The parameters Vmax, n, and K of the Naka-Rushton equation were computed from the measurement values based on the usual fitting procedure. These parameters, together with b-wave amplitudes and implicit times for all <b>flash</b> <b>intensities,</b> were compared interocularly and between the normal subjects and those with glaucoma. Correlations were computed between interocular differences of the mean deviation and interocular differences of Vmax, n, K, b-wave amplitudes, and implicit times between the two fellow eyes of the patients with asymmetrical glaucomatous damage.  RESULTS—Implicit times were significantly longer (p< 0. 005) in the glaucoma patients than in the normal group for <b>flash</b> <b>intensities</b> of 9. 4,  5. 3,  1. 7,  0. 53, and 0. 17  cd/s/m 2. b-Wave amplitudes {{did not differ significantly}} between the two study groups.

This pilot study examined whether symptom reduction was greater with more frequent administration and with higher daily doses. In addition, we explored possible effect modification by equol producer status. METHODS: We randomized 130 perimenopausal (no menses in the past 3 mo) and postmenopausal (≥ 12 mo of amenorrhea) women with a mean of five or more moderate/severe hot flashes per day to treatment arms with varying total daily isoflavone doses and dosing frequency, separately for equol producers and nonproducers. Participants recorded the daily frequency and severity of hot flashes. Analyses compared mean daily hot <b>flash</b> <b>intensity</b> scores (sum of hot flashes weighted by severity) by total daily dose and by dosing frequency. Dose- and frequency-related differences were also compared for equol producers and nonproducers. RESULTS: Hot <b>flash</b> <b>intensity</b> scores were lowest in women randomized to the highest total daily dose (100 - 200 mg) and in women randomized to the highest dosing frequency (twice daily to thrice daily), with greater benefits on nighttime scores than on daytime scores. Dose- and frequency-related differences were somewhat larger in equol producers than in nonproducers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a twice-daily to thrice-daily dosing frequency may improve the benefit of isoflavones for vasomotor symptom relief, particularly in equol producers and for nighttime symptoms.
