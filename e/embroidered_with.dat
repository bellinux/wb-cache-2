5|$|Like many Palestinian villages, {{the women}} of Jifna have their own {{traditional}} dress. Costumes in the village, known as rumi abyad ("Greek White") and rumi aswad ("Greek Black"), were dresses of hand-woven linen <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> the Jifna's own motifs. Preparing burbara, a sweet pudding-like dish made from whole grain wheat, on the Feast of Saint Barbara has been a tradition in Jifna for several centuries.|$|E
5|$|Mary's robe is <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> Latin text, {{taken from}} the : Est enim haec speciosior sole et super omnem stellarum dispositionem. Luci conparata invenitur prior ("For she is more {{beautiful}} than the sun, and excels every constellation of the stars. Compared with the light she {{is found to be}} superior"). Van Eyck used a similar device in his Berlin Madonna in the Church, completed c. 1438–40.|$|E
5|$|The mantles for the prelate and {{chancellor}} {{are dark}} blue {{like those of}} the members (as a member, the chancellor wears a member's mantle), but the mantles for the other officers are dark red. All mantles are <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> a heraldic shield of St George's Cross. For Garter ceremonies, Garter Principal King of Arms wears this red mantle rather than the tabard of the royal arms worn for other State ceremonial occasions.|$|E

5|$|When the College {{first opened}} in 1888 {{there was no}} uniform, instead the girls wore long cotton dresses, gloves and hat. A straw boater was {{introduced}} in the early 20th century, worn with a red and white hat band featuring the college crest with its burning bush woven into it in red. During this time Prefects wore red silk arm-bands <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> a gold crest.|$|E
5|$|As seen in Parthian coinage, the headdresses {{worn by the}} Parthian kings {{changed over}} time. The {{earliest}} Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps, known as the bashlyk (Greek: kyrbasia). This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the pointy hats depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and Persepolis. The earliest coins of Mithridates I show him wearing the soft cap, yet coins from {{the latter part of}} his reign show {{him for the first time}} wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem. Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian tiara, <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau's {{coronation}} {{was celebrated}} on 23 August 1389 with a lavish ceremonial entry into Paris. Her second cousin and sister-in-law Valentina Visconti, who had married her own cousin Louis of Orléans (Charles' younger brother) {{two years earlier}} by proxy and papal dispensation, arrived in style, escorted across the Alps from Milan by 1,300 knights carrying personal luxuries such as books and a harp. The noblewomen in the coronation procession were dressed in lavish costumes with thread-of-gold embroidery, and rode in litters escorted by knights. Philip the Bold wore a doublet <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> 40 sheep and 40 swans, each decorated with a bell made of pearls.|$|E

5|$|Mandarin square: Mandarin squares {{were large}} {{embroidered}} badges sewn onto the surcoat of an officials in Imperial China, Korea and Vietnam. It was <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> detailed, colourful animal or bird insignia indicating {{the rank of}} the official wearing it. Mandarin squares were first authorized for wear in 1391 by the Ming Dynasty. The use of squares depicting birds for civil officials and animals for military officials was {{an outgrowth of the}} use of similar squares, apparently for decorative use, in the Yuan Dynasty. The original court dress regulations of the Ming Dynasty were published in 1368, but did not refer to badges as rank insignia.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels include 16 silver {{trumpets}} {{dating from}} between 1780 and 1848. Nine {{of these are}} draped with red silk damask banners <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> coats of arms in gold, originally made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. They have not been used since the Corps of State Trumpeters was disbanded by the Duke of Wellington as a cost-cutting measure in the 19thcentury. The trumpeters' main job was to sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall. Today, the Band of the Household Cavalry and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force play their own trumpets at state occasions.|$|E
5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E

50|$|In Xiang Embroidery, Landscape, {{animals and}} {{characters}} are common subjects, and the peonies, tigers, cats, dogs and dragons {{are the most}} representative designs characterized by rich changes in the layering of the colors and the high sense of painting. Embroidering landscape is relatively easier than embroidering animals, but characters are the most difficult ones to <b>embroider</b> <b>with</b> its higher requirements for {{the density of the}} thread, furthermore, it’s not easy to capture the characters’expression.|$|R
5|$|Delhi's {{association}} and geographic {{proximity to the}} capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance of national events and holidays like Republic Day, Independence Day (15 August) and Gandhi Jayanti. On Independence Day, the Prime Minister addresses the nation from the Red Fort. Most Delhiites celebrate the day by flying kites, which are considered a symbol of freedom. The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military strength. Over the centuries, Delhi has become known for its composite culture, and a festival that symbolises this is the Phool Walon Ki Sair, which takes place in September. Flowers and pankhefans <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> flowersare offered to the shrine of 13th century Sufi saint Khwaja Bakhtiyar Kaki and the Yogmaya temple, both situated in Mehrauli.|$|E
5|$|On December 22, 1990, {{the last}} Polish president-in-exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, handed the presidential insignia, {{including}} one of the banners rescued by Mościcki in 1939, to Lech Wałęsa, the first democratically elected president of post-war Poland. The ceremony, held at the Royal Castle in Warsaw {{was seen as a}} symbol of the Third Republic's continuity with the pre-war Second Republic. However, since legal regulations on national symbols did not recognize a national banner at that time, the banner brought by Kaczorowski did not become the presidential insignia again but was instead donated to the Royal Castle museum where it is now on display. The other of the two banners remains in the Sikorski Institute in London. Today, a kilim <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> the design of the pre-war Banner of the Republic is hanging in the Senate chamber, above the chair reserved for the President of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the lion}} too {{has always had}} a close {{association}} with Iranian kingship. The garments and throne decorations of the Achaemenid kings were <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> lion motifs. The crown of the half-Persian Seleucid king Antiochus I was adorned with a lion. In the investiture inscription of Ardashir I at Naqsh-e Rustam, the breast armour of the king is decorated with lions. Further, in some Iranian dialects the word for king (shah) is pronounced as sher, homonymous with the word for lion. Islamic, Turkish, and Mongol influences also stressed the symbolic association of the lion and royalty. The earliest evidence for the use of a lion on a standard comes from the Shahnameh, which noted that the feudal house of Godarz (presumably a family of Parthian or Sassanid times) adopted a golden lion for its devices.|$|E
25|$|Women wear {{embroidered}} silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores {{that can}} take months to weave or <b>embroider</b> <b>with</b> local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.|$|R

50|$|Textile {{manufacturing}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} human activities. The oldest known textiles date back to about 5000 B.C. In order to make textiles, the first requirement is a source of fibre from which a yarn can be made, primarily by spinning. The yarn is processed by knitting or weaving to create cloth. The machine used for weaving is the loom. Cloth is finished by what are described as wet processes to become fabric. The fabric may be dyed, printed or decorated by <b>embroidering</b> <b>with</b> coloured yarns.|$|R
5|$|The Orkneyinga saga relates how {{after the}} death of Earl Hákon Pálsson, his sons, Haraldr Hákonsson, and Páll Hákonsson, divided the earldom between themselves. However, the half-brothers soon began to {{disagree}} with one another, and their vassals divided into competing factions. The saga relates how one day Frakökk, and her sister Helga (mother of Earl Haraldr), were sewing a snow-white garment <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> gold. This garment was enchanted, and the two sisters had intended it for Earl Haraldr's half-brother, Earl Páll. Unfortunately for the sisters, Earl Haraldr noticed the beautiful garment and, despite their protestations, put the garment on and soon after died. The saga states that Earl Páll immediately took control of his deceased half-brother's possessions, and that he was highly suspicious of the two sisters. In consequence, Frakökk and Helga were no longer welcome in the earldom, and they left for Caithness, and from there move to Sutherland where Frakökk had an estate. In time, several of Frakökk's descendants were brought up in Sutherland—including her daughter, Steinnvör 'the Stout', and grandson, Ölvir.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half the width of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E
5|$|The story {{continues}} {{with the arrival}} of several more Christian princes and their armies. Radiaro and Calafia issue a challenge to two Christian warriors to engage them in single combat for the purpose of deciding the battle. King Amadis and his son Esplandián accept the challenge. The black-skinned warrior woman chosen as messenger tells Calafia that Esplandián is the most handsome and elegant man that has ever existed. Calafia determines that she must see the man herself before engaging him in combat. She stays awake all night wondering whether to wear royal robes or warrior's armor. Deciding in favor of a thick golden toga <b>embroidered</b> <b>with</b> jewels, topped by a golden hood, she rode to meet her enemies, escorted by 2,000 women warriors. After being seated among the Christian kings, she immediately recognized Esplandián from his great beauty, {{and fell in love with}} him. She tells him she will meet him on the field of battle and, if they should live, that she wishes to speak further with him. Esplandián considers Calafia an infidel, an abomination of the rightfully subservient position of woman in relation to man, and he makes no response.|$|E
