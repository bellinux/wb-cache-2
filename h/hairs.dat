5|$|Most mammals have agouti hair, {{with each}} {{individual}} hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to {{two different types}} of melanin pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the <b>hairs</b> have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard <b>hairs,</b> which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense <b>hairs</b> which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard <b>hairs</b> which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.|$|E

5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is a {{terrestrial}} rodent {{with short}} forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz) {{in the only}} known complete specimen, it is much larger than M.bastardi, and its measurements fall {{at or above the}} upper end of the known range of variation in M.ingens. The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover <b>hairs</b> (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover <b>hairs</b> there are entirely dark brown. The <b>hairs</b> are 6 to 8mm (0.2 to 0.3in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9mm (0.3 to 0.4in) on the back. The guard <b>hairs</b> are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover <b>hairs,</b> they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60mm (2.4in), and white or black in color. The pinnae (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray <b>hairs,</b> and ear length is 32mm (1.3in).|$|E

5|$|The {{coloration}} of the upperparts {{is generally}} uniform, with some scattered darker <b>hairs.</b> There is a yellow {{ring around the}} eyes, which is more prominent than in A.sylvanus. The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown to gray. There are some scattered white <b>hairs</b> on the chin. Although this white spot is better developed than in A.sylvanus, A.spegazzinii lacks the conspicuous white spot seen in A.simulator. The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown to gray. Ungual tufts of <b>hairs</b> cover the claws; these <b>hairs</b> are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of hair on the tail is variable, but it is dark brown above and white to yellow-brown below. High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hair</b> {{is one of}} the {{defining}} characteristics of mammals. In humans, <b>hair</b> can be scalp <b>hair,</b> facial <b>hair,</b> chest <b>hair,</b> pubic <b>hair,</b> axillary <b>hair,</b> besides other places. Men tend to have <b>hair</b> in more places than women. <b>Hair</b> does not in itself have any intrinsic sexual value other than the attributes given to it by individuals in a cultural context. Some cultures are ambivalent in relation to body <b>hair,</b> with some being regarded as attractive while others being regarded as unaesthetic. Many cultures regard a woman's <b>hair</b> to be erotic. For example, many Islamic women cover their <b>hair</b> in public, and display it only to their family and close friends. Similarly, many Jewish women cover their <b>hair</b> after marriage. During the Middle Ages, European women were expected to cover their <b>hair</b> after they married.|$|R

The dorsofrontal area of the head (the back of an insect), and the dorsal surfaces of the gaster, mesosoma and petiole are covered by erect <b>hairs,</b> and slightly longer <b>hairs</b> are present on the ventral regions of the mesosoma and gaster. The apical segments of the gaster have a greater density of setose (bristles) with longer decumbent <b>hairs</b> (meaning that these <b>hairs</b> are lying down).|$|E
5|$|The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers on {{the upper}} lips) reach {{the tips of the}} ears when pressed against the head.

The digits and metapodials are mostly covered by white <b>hairs.</b> Short ungual tufts of <b>hairs</b> surrounding the bases of the claws are present. There are five pads on the forefeet and six on the hindfeet. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is nearly as long as the middle three and the first (the hallux) is much shorter. The tail is longer than the head and body and appears naked for most of its length, but fine <b>hairs</b> are visible near the tip. Although the lower side is slightly lighter, there is no clear difference in coloration between the upper and lower sides. The skin of the tail is gray, and it is covered lightly by fine <b>hairs</b> that are dark brown over most of the length of the tail, but white near the tip.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hair</b> {{exists in}} a variety of textures. Three main aspects of <b>hair</b> texture are the curl pattern, volume, and consistency. The derivations of <b>hair</b> texture are not fully understood. All {{mammalian}} <b>hair</b> is composed of keratin, so the make-up of <b>hair</b> follicles is not the source of varying <b>hair</b> patterns. There are a range of theories pertaining to the curl patterns of <b>hair.</b> Scientists {{have come to believe that}} the shape of the <b>hair</b> shaft has an effect on the curliness of the individual's <b>hair.</b> A very round shaft allows for fewer disulfide bonds to be present in the <b>hair</b> strand. This means the bonds present are directly in line with one another, resulting in straight <b>hair.</b> The flatter the <b>hair</b> shaft becomes, the curlier <b>hair</b> gets, because the shape allows more cysteines to become compacted together resulting in a bent shape that, with every additional disulfide bond, becomes curlier in form. As the <b>hair</b> follicle shape determines curl pattern, the <b>hair</b> follicle size determines thickness. While the circumference of the <b>hair</b> follicle expands, so does the thickness of the <b>hair</b> follicle. An individual's <b>hair</b> volume, as a result, can be thin, normal, or thick. The consistency of <b>hair</b> can almost always be grouped into three categories: fine, medium, and coarse. This trait is determined by the <b>hair</b> follicle volume and the condition of the strand. Fine <b>hair</b> has the smallest circumference, coarse <b>hair</b> has the largest circumference, and medium <b>hair</b> is anywhere between the other two. Coarse <b>hair</b> has a more open cuticle than thin or medium <b>hair</b> causing it to be the most porous.|$|R
