50|$|Severe local fallout {{contamination}} {{can extend}} {{far beyond the}} blast and thermal effects, {{particularly in the case}} of high yield surface detonations. The ground track of fallout from an explosion depends on the weather from the time of detonation onwards. In stronger winds, fallout travels faster but takes the same time to descend, so although it covers a larger path, it is more spread out or diluted. Thus, the width of the fallout pattern for any given dose rate is reduced where the downwind distance is increased by higher winds. The total amount of activity deposited up to any given time is the same irrespective of the wind pattern, so overall casualty figures from fallout are generally independent of winds. But thunderstorms can bring down activity as rain more rapidly than <b>dry</b> <b>fallout,</b> particularly if the mushroom cloud is low enough to be below ("washout"), or mixed with ("rainout"), the thunderstorm.|$|E

The ten-day-average rate of <b>dry</b> <b>fallout</b> of sea-salt particles is de-termined in Kyoto for three years since November, 1962. The rate of fallout is high in winter, low in summer, and nearly the same feature is observed for three years.

The total <b>dry</b> <b>fallout</b> of sea salt in Kyoto is found to be 1. 7 x 1 o-s gm cm- 2 year- 1, and the average size distribution of the particles is determined. It is also found that there is a conspicuous diurnal va-riation in the rate of dry fallout: the value is several times larger at night than in the daytime. This is caused by diurnal variations in relative humidity and number concentration of the particles in the lowest atmosphere. The fact that the rate of <b>dry</b> <b>fallout</b> is only a small per cent of the total ground sink of sea-salt particles is noticed, and a discussion is given. 1...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} zinc isotopes as tracers of atmospheric sources and focuses on the potential fractionation of Zn isotopes through anthropogenic processes. In order to do so, Zn isotopic ratios are measured in enriched ores and airborne particles associated with pyrometallurgical activities {{of one of the}} major Pb-Zn refineries in France. Supporting the isotopic investigation, this paper also compares morphological and chemical characteristics of Zn particles collected on dry deposition plates ("environmental samples") placed within a 5 km radius of the smelter, with those of Zn particles collected inside the plant ("process samples"), i. e. dust collected from the main exhaust system of the plant. To ensure a constant isotopic "supply", the refinery processed a specific set of ores during the sampling campaigns, as agreed with the executive staff of the plant. Enriched ores and dust produced by the successive Zn extraction steps show strong isotope fractionation (from - 0. 66 to + 0. 22 ‰) mainly related to evaporation processes within the blast furnaces. Dust from the main chimney displays a δ 66 Zn value of - 0. 67 ‰. Application of the Rayleigh equation to evaluate the fractionation factor associated with the Zn vapor produced after a free evaporation gives a range of αore/vapor from 1. 0004 to 1. 0008. The dry deposits, collected on plates downwind of the refinery, display δ 66 Zn variations of up to + 0. 7 ‰. However, it is to be noted that between 190 and 1250 m from the main chimney of the refinery, the dry deposits show a high level of large (> 10 μm) Zn, S, Fe and O bearing aggregates characterized by positive δ 66 Zn values (+ 0. 02 to + 0. 19 ‰). These airborne particles probably derive from the re-suspension of slag heaps and local emissions from the working-units. In contrast, from 1720 to 4560 m, the dry deposits are comprised of small (PM 10) particles, including spherical Zn-bearing aggregates, showing negative δ 66 Zn values (- 0. 52 to - 0. 02 ‰). Our results suggest that the source of the distal <b>dry</b> <b>fallouts</b> is the main chimney plume, whose light Zn isotopic signature they preserve. Based on Zn isotopic analysis in combination with morphological and chemical characteristics of airborne particles, the present study suggests the traceability of smelter dusts by Zn isotopes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The use of 36 C 1 as an {{environmental}} tracer of hydrologic processes has become increasingly popular over the last twenty years. The use of this isotope in hydrogeology has been limited, however, by uncertainty in the input function for 36 C 1 entering groundwater. To address this problem and to evaluate current 36 C 1 /C 1 distribution models, 36 C 1 /C 1 was measured for 183 groundwater samples collected from sites located throughout the United States. On the continental scale, values of 36 C 11 C 1 range from less than 100 x 10 - 15 in coastal regions to over 1, 200 x 1015 in Wyoming. This distribution {{is dominated by the}} spatial variability of stable chloride fallout. The depositional flux of 36 C 1 is approximately constant over the United States with a mean of 21. 3 + 2. 7 atoms 111 - 2 S- 1 which is equivalent to a global flux of 13. 6 + 1. 7 atoms r 62 s 4. A simple model developed in this study, which assumes constant 36 C 1 deposition, consistently yields high estimates of 36 C 11 C 1 in the southwestern part of the country. This discrepancy may indicate that the relative amount of <b>dry</b> to total <b>fallout</b> {{is an important factor in}} controlling 36 C 1 /C 1 in arid areas and requires further investigation. Variability of 36 C 11 C 1 at the local scale is primarily controlled by subsurface sources of chloride.

To establish the first data set on the depositional fluxes of 210 Po in bulk precipitation and concentrations in air samples from the midwestern United States, we measured the depositional fluxes of 210 Pb and 210 Po in the bulk (wet plus dry) and <b>dry</b> <b>fallout</b> by deploying a rain collector (dry and bulk) for a period of 17 months. We also collected 30 aerosol samples during this period to assess the temporal variations of these nuclides in the surface air in Detroit, Michigan. The activity of 210 Po in the surface air ranged from below detection limit to 0. 118 mBq m− 3 (mean of 0. 072 mBq m− 3). The specific activities of 210 Po and 210 Pb in aerosols ranged between 0. 28 and 4. 48 Bq g− 1 (mean of 0. 87 Bq g− 1) and 2. 7 and 30 Bq g− 1 (mean of 13. 6 Bq g− 1), respectively; these values are about 1 – 2 orders of magnitude higher than the surface soil. The mean activity ratios of 210 Po/ 210 Pb in the bulk precipitation and <b>dry</b> <b>fallout</b> were found to be 0. 049 (n = 27) and 0. 25 (n = 8), corresponding to residence times of 15 and 75 days, respectively.

40|$|The Florida Everglades is an {{oligotrophic}} wetland {{system with}} tree islands {{as one of}} its most prominent landscape features. Total soil phosphorus concentrations on tree islands can be 6 to 100 times greater than phosphorus levels in the surrounding marshes and sloughs, making tree islands nutrient hotspots.

A conceptual model is proposed, in which the focused redistribution of limiting nutrients, especially phosphorus, onto tree islands controls their maintenance and expansion.

Human changes to hydrology have greatly decreased the number and size of tree islands in parts of the Everglades.

Heavy metal contamination of lake water ecosystems is a worldwide environmental problem. Though some of the heavy metals like Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn are essential as micronutrients for the life processes in animals and plants in very small amounts, other metals like Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb have no known physiological activities and exhibit extreme toxicity even at trace levels (Nicolau et al. 2006; Kar et al. 2008). In freshwater bodies, there is always presence of some amount of heavy metals derived mostly from the mineralogy and weathering (Samarghandi et al. 2007; Karbassi et al. 2008).

Stable isotopes of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and sulfur were successfully used to delineate recharge zones and identify solute sources. Laboratory study of water-rock interactions established the source of solutes {{and the nature of the}} chemical reactions that control ground-water chemistry. Most ground water on La Palma originates in a recharge zone that encircles the island from 500 to 1800 meters above sea level. <b>Dry</b> <b>fallout</b> and seaspray are minor sources of solutes, however, evaporative concentration during recharge may produce elevated chloride levels in some portions of the island.

The geochemical evolution of most waters is controlled by the availability of dissolved carbon dioxide gas. However, oxidation of pyrite enhances the reactivity of ground water in some portions of the island. Waters in the early phases of chemical evolution appear to be in equilibrium with a kaolinite alteration product, whereas more mineralized waters have compositions consistent with smectite equilibrium.

This lead isotope enters surface waters unsupported by its parents in the U- 238 series, such as radium or radon. Rapidly removed to the sediments, its decay can be measured over an interval of about 100 yr. Yearly strata can be identified.

Recharge rates below a few mm/yr are reliably detected with CMB; however, estimates above a few mm/yr appear to be less reliable. We tested the CMB method against 26 years of drainage from a 7. 6 -m-deep lysimeter at a simulated waste-burial ground, located on the Department of Energy s Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State, USA where land-use change has increased recharge rates. Measured drainage from the lysimeter for the past 26 years averaged 62 mm/yr. Precipitation averaged 190 mm/yr with an estimated chloride input of 0. 225 mg/L. Initial pore-water chloride concentration was 88 mg/L and decreased to about 6 mg/L after 26 years, while the drainage water decreased to less than 1 mg/L. A recharge estimate made using chloride concentrations in drain water was within 20 percent of the measured drainage rate. In contrast, recharge estimates using 1 : 1 (water: soil) extracts were lower than actual by factors ranging from 2 to 8 or more. The results suggest that when recharge is above a few mm/yr, soil water extracts can lead to unreliable estimates of recharge. For conditions of elevated recharge, direct sampling of pore water is the preferred method, because chloride concentrations are often 20 to 50 times higher in directly-sampled pore water than in pore-water extracts...|$|E

Perkin Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer models 303 and 360 were used for the analyses. Samples collected at the R. I. coastal site were divided into 3 different categories, namely, 2 ̆ 2 marine 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 land 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 mixed 2 ̆ 2 samples depending on the local surface wind direction during sampling. Based upon the Mg/Na ratio, it appears that most of the Na and Mg in 2 ̆ 2 marine 2 ̆ 2 samples were derived from the ocean while 2 ̆ 2 land 2 ̆ 2 samples essentially consist of Na and Mg of crustal origin and 2 ̆ 2 mixed 2 ̆ 2 samples were a combination of the two. The rate of wet removal of atmospheric Na and Mg, calculated from 2 ̆ 2 marine 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 land 2 ̆ 2 samples and the rate of dry deposition of sea salt calculated only from 2 ̆ 2 marine 2 ̆ 2 samples, appear to be proportional to the wind speed.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} role of the {{atmospheric}} <b>dry</b> <b>fallout</b> as a source of new nitrogen and phosphorus to the surface Levantine seawater. Leaching experiments of inorganic nitrogen (LINO- 3, LINH+ 4) and phosphorus (LIPO 4), using SE Mediterranean surface seawater, were performed on 41 aerosol (hereafter dust) samples collected on Whatman 41 filters between April 1996 and January 1999 at Tel Shikmona, Israel and on four desert-event dust powder samples. A geometric mean of 2. 8 and 3. 2 mmol NO- 3 and NH+ 4 per gram of dust was leached by seawater from normal (background) dry deposition captured by the filters. Significantly lower amounts of IN with lower NH+ 4 :NO- 3 ratios were leached from both the filters and the dust powder sampled during dust events (mean of 0. 18 and 0. 02 mmol NO- 3 and NH+ 4 per gram of dust). Similarly, relatively lower values of LIPO 4 were measured in desert type events, attributed to systematic decrease in IP solubility with increased rock/soil component. The calculated LINO- 3 and LINH+ 4 fluxes were 34 and 20 mmol m- 2 yr- 1 from normal dry deposition, 2. 5 higher than the wet IN deposition, and twice the riverine input (23 mmol m- 2 yr- 1, Guerzoni et al.). This high ratio is due to the semiarid climate in this basin. The estimated flux of total dry IP was 1 mmol P m- 2 yr- 1, approximately 3 times higher than the input of wet IP and somewhat lower than the estimated riverine input (1. 4 mmol m- 2 yr- 1, Guerzoni et al. 1999). The similarity of atmospheric and burial fluxes of P in the Levantine basin reinforces the hypothesis that the atmosphere is the dominant source of P to the sediments in the deeper parts of the basin. It was estimated that the leachable fluxes of IP and IN (dry 1 wet) can support between 15 or 70...|$|E
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the ability of}} the lead isotope signature technique to evidence the spatial extent of an industrial Pb deposition plume at a local scale, dry deposition of lead in the urban environment of a Pb-Zn refinery was investigated, as a study case, using transient ("short-lived") isotopic signatures of the industrial source. Sampling campaigns were achieved in representative weather conditions, on an 8 -h basis. Dry deposition rates measured downwind from refinery emissions (≈ 102 - 10 3 μgPbm- 2 h- 1), cross-sectionally in a 3 - 5 km radius area around the plant, represent 10 - 100 times the urban background <b>dry</b> <b>fallout,</b> measured upwind, as well as fallout measured near other potential sources of anthropogenic Pb. The Pb-Zn refinery isotopic signature (approx. 1. 100 < 206 Pb/ 207 Pb< 1. 135) is made identifiable, using the same set of Pb and Zn ores for 2 days before sampling and during field experiments, by agreement with the executive staff of the plant. This source signature is less radiogenic than signatures of urban background Pb aerosols (1. 155 < 206 Pb/ 207 Pb< 1. 165) and minor sources of Pb aerosols (1. 147 < 206 Pb/ 207 Pb< 1. 165). By a simple binary mixing model calculation, we established the extension of the industrial Pb deposition plume. Fifty to eighty percents of total lead settled by the dry deposition mode, 3 - 4 km away from the refinery, still have an industrial origin. That represents from 40 to 80 μgPbm- 2 h- 1, in an area where the blood lead level exceeds 100 μgPbl- 1 for 30 % of men and 12 % of women living there. We demonstrate here that stable Pb isotope analysis is able to evidence the Pb dry deposition plume in stabilised aerodynamic conditions, using a short-lived source term, suggesting that this methodology is able to furnish valuable data to validate industrial Pb aerosols dispersion models, at the urban scale. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The depositional fluxes in {{the bulk}} and <b>dry</b> <b>fallout</b> {{as well as}} the {{concentrations}} of 7 Be and 210 Pb in aerosols were measured for a period of 17 months at Detroit, Michigan. The bulk depositional fluxes of 7 Be and 210 Pb varied between 3. 11 and 63. 0 dpm cm− 2 yr− 1 (mean of 11. 4 dpm cm− 2 yr− 1) and 0. 35 and 10. 3 dpm cm− 2 yr− 1 (mean of 1. 41 dpm cm− 2 yr− 1), respectively, and this variability in the depositional fluxes is attributed to the frequency and amount of precipitation and seasonal variations in the depositional fluxes. The dry depositional fluxes of 7 Be and 210 Pb contributed 2. 1 – 19. 8 % and 3. 6 – 48. 6 % of the bulk depositional fluxes, respectively. The higher precipitation-normalized enrichment factor for 7 Be during spring is attributed to the stratosphere-troposphere exchange of air masses during spring and large-scale atmospheric mixing during summer. We report that snow is more efficient than rain in removing 210 Pb from the atmosphere, and this is likely due to higher surface area of snow flurries compared to the rain droplets. The volume-weighted concentrations of 7 Be and 210 Pb are the highest reported in literature so far. The concentration of 7 Be in the air showed a seasonal increase during the spring and summer months, and no seasonal variation was observed for 210 Pb. The mean deposition velocities of aerosols calculated using concentrations of 7 Be and 210 Pb in air and precipitation are 1. 6 and 1. 1 cm s− 1, respectively, and the corresponding washout ratios are 948 and 637. There is no significant correlation between the aerosol mass and depositional velocities of 7 Be and 210 Pb in the air masses. We propose that a relatively minor portion of the aerosols actively participate in the removal of these nuclides from the air masses...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the nuclear era, starting during the 1940 s, large amount of radioactivity has been released into the environment. This thesis deals with the temporal and spatial distribution of the anthropogenic radioisotope 129 I (T 1 / 2 = 15. 7 Myr) in northern Europe. A routine sample preparation procedure for extraction of iodine from milligram amounts of solid materials has been developed and aimed for measuring the 129 I concentration by the ultra-sensitive accelerator mass spectrometry method. The technique was further used for the analysis of 129 I in sediments collected from two lakes in Sweden and one lake in Finland as well as sediments from two sites in the Baltic Sea. In addition, 129 I concentrations in aerosol samples from northern and southern Sweden covering the period 1983 to 2000 have been measured. The results reveal a gradual increase in the anthropogenic 129 I fluxes since the 1950 s that are linked to emissions from the nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in Sellafield (UK) and La Hague (France). A sharp increase coinciding with the Chernobyl accident is identified from the Swedish lakes located in areas characterised by relatively high Chernobyl fallout. Numerical modeling of the 129 I deposition predicts that > 50 % of the flux to the lake sediments is related to the liquid emissions from the reprocessing facilities. The modeling also reasonably simulates the contribution of the Chernobyl event to the total 129 I flux. The novel time series from northern Europe on 129 I in aerosols show about one order of magnitude higher concentration in northern compared to southern Sweden. Estimate of 129 I <b>dry</b> <b>fallout</b> based on the aerosol data suggests < 25 % contribution to the total fallout. The distribution of 129 I in the sediment archives demonstrates the potential of the isotope as a new time marker for chronological and environmental investigations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Chloride Mass Balance (CMB) {{method was}} used to obtain {{long-term}} recharge values for the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) site, which features a groundwater flow system beneath an upland ridge formed of sandstone and shale beds in the Simi Hills, Ventura County, southern California. This application relied {{on the availability of}} on-site measurements of bulk atmospheric chloride deposition comprised of <b>dry</b> <b>fallout</b> and wet concentration, a large number of groundwater samples (∼ 1490) collected over three decades from 206 wells spanning a depth range from 10 to 360 m, and measurements of chloride in surface runoff during rain events. The use of the CMB method is suited to the assessment of recharge for the study area because the mean chloride values in groundwater show minimal spatial trends, indicating no sources other than atmospheric. In addition, the Cl/Br ratio {{was used to}} exclude wells with possible anthropogenic chloride. The site-wide average recharge ranges between 1. 8 and 9. 5 % of the mean annual precipitation (455 mm) with a mean value of 4. 2 %. The measured surface runoff varies from 2. 3 to 10. 2 % with mean value of 6. 1 % (28 mm) and, therefore, the volume of water lost to evapotranspiration is between 95. 9 and 80. 3 % with a mean value of 89. 6 % (408 mm). The long-term recharge calculated using the CMB method is consistent with tritium distribution based on a subset of groundwater monitoring wells and with an analysis of steady flow in the groundwater mound beneath the SSFL. Furthermore, the recharge value matches those in the literature for sandstone aquifers in arid and semi-arid climates. This recharge estimate has important relevance for site characterization in terms of constraining the volumetric groundwater flow rates and water balance and understanding the mechanisms of transport towards the water table. Moreover, this is the first application of the CMB in an upland area of California. Hence, the method is demonstrated to be robust and applicable to many upland bedrock areas in southern California and similar regions around the world, and can be used to quantify groundwater flow rates and supplies relevant to water resource management...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiple}} scattering {{radiative transfer}} {{model in the}} shortwave wavelength region has been developed for the atmosphere-snow {{system in which the}} absorption and scattering by the realistic gases， aerosols and clouds were included and a radiative interaction between the atmosphere and the snow was simulated. Using this model the atmospheric effects on spectral albedo and radiation budget at the snow surface and the top of the atmosphere were investigated. Furthermore, observations of spectral albedo and bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) with the spectrometer have been made together with the snow pit works on some snowfields. The results of spectral observations were compared with the theoretically calculated ones with a multiple scattering model for the atmosphere-snow system and the effects of snow physical parameters on spectral albedo and BRDF were investigated． 　　In Chapter 1, the approximation methods for Mie phase function were discussed in calculating the spectral albedo of snow surface by taking account of the multiple scattering by snow particles. The particles such as snow grains which are large compared to the wavelength have a strong forward peak in the phase function of single scattering. It has been known that a large error is led by the calculation of multiple scattering directly using such phase function. Therefore, four types of approximations of Mie phase function were investigated in calculating the multiple scattering by snow particles using the "doubling" method. These involve Hansen 2 ̆ 7 s renormalization, Grant 2 ̆ 7 s renormalization, the delta-M method and the truncation method. Using these approximations, the spectral albedos of snow surface were calculated under the conditions of effective grain radii of 50, 200 and 1000 μm in a wavelength region from 0. 3 to 3. 0 μm， and were compared to that calculated using the delta-Eddington approximation. The reason to compare with the delta-Eddington approximation is that this method does not need a phase function and a behavior of the systematic error is understood. In the Hansen 2 ̆ 7 s renormalization, the maximum albedo error exceeded 0. 1 for the snow with an effective radius of 1000 μm at small solar zenith angles. The delta-M method overestimated the snow albedos at all solar zenith angles at the wavelengths less than 1. 4 μm for the snow with an effective radius of 1000 μm. Reasonable results were obtained by the Grant’s renormalization and the truncation method for all three cases of effective grain radii studied. 　It was also found that these methods save computation time and memory because sufficient accuracy was obtained even with an angle resolution of 0. 1 ° in the forward peak region of phase function. 　In case of truncation method, the result was not sensitive to the choice of a truncation angle between 5 ° and 20 °. 　　In Chapter 2, the atmospheric effects on spectral and spectrally integrated snow albedos at the snow surface and the top of the atmosphere were investigated. A multiple scattering radiative transfer model based on the "doubling and adding" method combined with the Mie theory was applied to estimate the effects of absorption and scattering by the atmospheric molecules, absorptive gases, aerosols and clouds. Based on the result of Chapter 1, the truncation method with a truncation angle of 10 ﾟ was employed to correct the anisotropic Mie phase function. It was shown that the spectral surface albedo was reduced by the atmospheric absorptive gases at large solar zenith angles. The solar zenith angle dependence was weakened at the wavelengths less than 0. 5 μm by the Rayleigh scattering and at almost all wavelengths by the atmospheric aerosols and cloud cover. H 2 O rich atmosphere decreased the spectral surface albedo at large solar zenith angle in the H 2 O bands, while the additional reduction of downward solar flux in the near infrared region by H 2 O absorption caused the spectrally integrated surface albedo to increase by several percent. Aerosols increased the spectrally integrated surface albedo at small solar zenith angles and reduced it at large solar zenith angles, however they reduced the spectrally integrated planetary albedo except at large solar zenith angles. Optically-thick cloud cover increased both the spectrally integrated surface and planetary albedos at any solar zenith angle. In the visible region at small solar zenith angles the downward solar flux on the snow surface under cloudy sky could exceed that for clear case， and both further could exceed the extraterrestrial solar flux, resulting from the multiple reflection between snow surface and the atmosphere (cloud cover). 　　It is concluded, from what has been said above, that the snow surface albedo is affected by the appearances of cloud or aerosols of high concentration. It is also found that the snow surface albedo is affected by the Rayleigh scattering at shorter wavelengths and by the atmospheric absorption at large solar zenith angles. Thus, it is necessary to take the atmospheric effects into account for comparison of the theoretical albedo of snow surface with the measured one, according to the conditions of clouds，aerosols, water vapor and solar zenith angle. 　　In Chapter 3, the spectral albedo in the wavelength region of 0. 35 - 2. 5 μm observed on the snowfield under the cloudy sky at Barrow, Alaska in April, 1997 was discussed. The observed spectral albedo was compared with the theoretical ones calculated by a multiple scattering model for the atmosphere-snow system using the snow physical parameters obtained from the snow pit work. It was found that for new snow consisting of dendrites the optically effective snow grain size was not a crystal size, but of the order of a branch width. The observed spectral albedo was lower than theoretically calculated one for "pure snow" in the visible region and a part of the near infrared region; such reduction was explained by the internal mixture of soot and the external mixture of dust for snow particles. The theoretical spectral albedo calculated for a two-layer snow model that contains impurities agreed well with the measured one at all wavelengths. 　　In Chapter 4, the effects of snow physical parameters on spectral albedo and bidirectional reflectance of snow surface were discussed by comparing the observed spectral data with the theoretical ones. 　The observations of spectral albedo and bidirectional reflectance in the wavelength region of 0. 35 - 2. 5 μm were made together with snow pit work on a flat snowfield under the clear sky in eastern Hokkaido, Japan in February, 1998. The effects of snow impurities, density, layer structure, and grain size attained by in situ and laboratory measurements were taken into account in snow models for which spectral albedos were calculated using a multiple scattering model for the atmosphere-snow system. Comparisons of these theoretical albedos with measured ones suggest that the snow impurities were concentrated at the snow surface by <b>dry</b> <b>fallout</b> of atmospheric aerosols. The optically equivalent snow grain size was found to be of the order of a branch width of dendrites or of a dimension of narrower portion of broken crystals as was same in Chapter 3. This means that the optical equivalent snow grain size is smaller than the so-called snow grain size measured glaciologically. The observational results for the BRDF normalized by the radiance at the nadir showed that the anisotropic reflection was very significant in the near infrared region especially at the wavelengths longer than 1. 4 μm, while the visible normalized BRDF (NBRDF) patterns were relatively flat. Comparison of this result with two kinds of theoretical NBRDFs, where one having been calculated using single scattering parameters by the Mie theory and the other using the same parameters except for Henyey-Greenstein (HG) phase function obtained from the same asymmetry factor as in the Mie theory, showed that the observed NBRDF agreed with the theoretical one using HG phase function rather than with that using Mie phase function, while the albedos calculated with both phase functions agreed well with each other. This suggests that the optically effective snow grain shape is neither the sphere nor the ordinary hexagonal column, by which respectively the rainbow or halo appear in the theoretical BRDF pattern, but is the nonspherical particle having the smooth phase function...|$|E
