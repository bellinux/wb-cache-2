5|$|The current {{president}} is Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, {{who took over}} <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> Nurse on 30 November 2015.

The Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 left the president {{as one of the few}} individuals capable of certifying that a particular experiment on an animal was justified. In addition, the president is to act as the government's chief (albeit informal) advisor on scientific matters. Yet another task is that of entertaining distinguished foreign guests and scientists.|$|E
5|$|The {{opponent}} for Celtic in {{the fourth}} round was German Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart. Celtic went into the first leg at Celtic Park with John Hartson suspended and Henrik Larsson absent due to sustaining a broken jaw in league match. Despite Stuttgart's Marcelo Bordon getting sent off on 16 minutes, the German's still took the lead with a goal from Kevin Kurányi on 27 minutes.

5|$|Arsenal began brightly {{in front}} of a crowd of 65,483, {{creating}} the first chance of the match in the 17th minute. Paul Davis set up striker Kevin Campbell, who hooked the ball high over goal. Four minutes later, Alan Smith headed the ball into the goal net, meeting a cross <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> Merson; it was ruled out by referee Terry Holbrook for offside. Tottenham improved shortly after, with Gary Mabbutt heading the ball directly at Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to create their first chance of the match. Their best opportunity to score was in the 36th minute. Vinny Samways set up Gary Lineker to break past the Arsenal defence. Having nudged the ball past Tony Adams, Lineker looked up, before making a cross for Nayim to head; the shot was acrobatically saved by Seaman's right foot.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1986, Barry Levinson {{intended}} {{to produce and}} direct a biopic based {{on the life of}} Bobby Darin with funding from his own production company, Baltimore Pictures. With writer Lewis Colick, Levinson pitched the idea to Warner Bros. Pictures, who agreed to co-finance The Bobby Darin Story and cover distribution duties. Producer Arthur Friedman, a fan of Darin's work, began to laboriously negotiate for crucial music licensing rights with Darin's ex-wife, Sandra Dee; his son, Dodd; and former manager Steve Blauner. Colick wrote the first draft in 1987 before Warner Bros. and Levinson commissioned rewrites <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> Attanasio and Paul Schrader. Their scripts, which kept The Bobby Darin Story title, concentrated on Sandra Dee's alcoholism and childhood molestation by her stepfather. David Gershenson, Darin's longtime friend, publicist and manager, joined the project as a historical consultant. Tom Cruise was reportedly under consideration to portray Darin.|$|E
5|$|By 1970, Takemitsu's {{reputation}} as a leading member of avant-garde community was well established, and during his involvement with Expo '70 in Osaka, he was at last able to meet more of his Western colleagues, including Karlheinz Stockhausen. Also, during a contemporary music festival in April 1970, produced by the Japanese composer himself ("Iron and Steel Pavilion"), Takemitsu met among the participants Lukas Foss, Peter Sculthorpe, and Vinko Globokar. Later that year, {{as part of a}} commission <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> Sacher and the Zurich Collegium Musicum, Takemitsu incorporated into his Eucalypts I parts for international performers: flautist Aurèle Nicolet, oboist Heinz Holliger, and harpist Ursula Holliger.|$|E
5|$|Everton {{picked up}} four points from their opening 12 league {{games of the}} 1994–95 season, and Southall {{received}} death threats after being confronted by an Everton fan during a match at Goodison Park. Walker was sacked and replaced by Joe Royle, who led the club to a 2–0 win over Liverpool in his first match in charge – this game also marked a record 35th Merseyside derby appearance for Southall. It was also the second match of seven consecutive games Everton went without conceding a goal – another club record. Southall then conceded just one goal (a penalty) in five games {{en route to the}} 1995 FA Cup Final against Manchester United. Everton won the game 1–0, with Southall making a double save <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> Scholes; the victory left Southall as the most decorated Everton player in the club's history.|$|E

5|$|On the July 3 {{episode of}} Raw, a triple threat match was booked between Rob Van Dam, Edge, and John Cena for the WWE title, after Van Dam made the stipulation. Edge, {{as part of}} scripted events, {{defeated}} both Van Dam and Cena to become the new WWE champion, after pinning Van Dam. The following night on ECW on Sci Fi, Van Dam lost the ECW title to The Big Show, after the Big Show received assistance <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> Heyman, who declined to make the three-count for Van Dam, but instead gave the pinfall to the Big Show. Later on WWE's official website, {{it was announced that}} Heyman suspended Van Dam for 30 days without giving a reason. This angle was written after WWE suspended Van Dam for his recent drug possession arrest.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{had been}} uninvolved in the {{upbringing}} {{of all his}} children. This provided producers with scope to introduce estranged family members. In 2006, writers devised a long-running storyline in-which Paul's son Robert (Adam Hunter) plans a revenge campaign against his father. Robert's motives for his vendetta stem <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> not being around while he grew up. Paul was happy that he had triplet children Elle, Robert and Cameron Robinson (also played by Hunter) back in his life. He tries to make amends with Robert and attempts to bond with him unaware that he is being plotted against. Writers decided to mark the show's 5000th episode with the story and Robert takes Paul hostage down a mineshaft. Dennis filmed the scenes in a filthy studio set surrounded by cameras, lighting and crew. He told Herbison (Inside Soap) that he {{found it difficult to}} pretend he was trapped underground.|$|E

He kidnapped Bearer after this and used him to cost Kane his match with Big Show On November 19, Edge tortured Paul Bearer forcing him to play dodge ball and force feeding him, planning to wear down Kane. He then ambushed Kane in the garage {{when he was a}} few feet <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> Bearer and drove away with his hostage.|$|E

5|$|The semi-final pitted United against Barcelona; {{the teams}} had not met since the group {{stage of the}} 1998–99 tournament, the last time United won it. The teams also had {{identical}} records going into the semi-final, each having won eight and drawn two of their 10 games, scoring 18 goals and conceding just five. The first leg at the Camp Nou saw United {{spend most of the}} game defending, while Barcelona tried to pass the ball around them. United were awarded a penalty in the first minute, but Ronaldo sent the ball wide, hitting the stanchion behind the goal. That was as close as either team got to a goal in the first leg and it ended 0–0. The second leg at Old Trafford was a game of higher tempo, which United won 1–0 thanks to a goal <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> Scholes after 14 minutes. This result increased United's consecutive home win record in the Champions League to 12 and ensured that they reached the final unbeaten.|$|E
5|$|Victorian {{painting}} {{had gone}} through radical changes, and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites {{had given way to}} the ideas of the Aesthetic Movement, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.|$|E
5|$|When NY3 was {{assigned}} in 1924, it followed a significantly different routing through the North Country {{than it does}} today. NY3 entered Franklin County near Hogansburg and served Malone, Paul Smiths, Gabriels, and Harrietstown before leaving the county near Saranac Lake. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY3 was rerouted east of Watertown to follow its modern alignment through the North Country. The portion of NY3's former routing from Harrietstown to a junction southeast of Gabriels was designated as NY408 while the segment between Paul Smiths and the vicinity of Gabriels became part of NY192, an east–west highway extending <b>from</b> <b>Paul</b> Smiths to the realigned NY3 in Bloomingdale.|$|E
