5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason it}} <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> have {{statistics}} for female-assigned cross-dressers {{is that the}} line where cross-dressing stops and cross-dressing begins has become blurred, whereas the same line for men is as well defined as ever. This {{is one of the}} many issues being addressed by third wave feminism as well as the modern-day masculist movement.|$|E
500|$|The Historian {{has been}} {{described}} as a combination of genres, including Gothic novel, adventure novel, detective fiction, travelogue, postmodern historical novel, epistolary epic, and historical thriller. Kostova was intent on writing a serious work of literature and saw herself as an inheritor of the Victorian style. Although based in part on Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Historian is not a horror novel, but rather an eerie tale. It is concerned with history's role in society and representation in books, as well as the nature of good and evil. As Kostova explains, [...] "Dracula is a metaphor for the evil that <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> undo in history." [...] The evils brought about by religious conflict are a particular theme, and the novel explores the relationship between the Christian West and the Islamic East.|$|E

6000|$|The father {{kissed his}} daughter, {{and pressed her}} to his heart; but still he said nothing: it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> him to speak of his own sorrows; he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> shy a man even with his own child! ...|$|R
500|$|As Kostova explains, [...] "Dracula is {{a metaphor}} for the evil that <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> undo in history." [...] For example, he is shown {{influencing}} Eastern European tyrants and supporting national socialism in Transylvania. He is [...] "vainglorious, vindictive, [...] vicious". As Michael Dirda explains in The Washington Post, the novel conveys the idea that [...] "Most of history's worst nightmares result from an unthinking obedience to authority, high-minded zealotry seductively overriding our mere humanity." [...] It is in the figure of the vampire that Kostova reveals this, since [...] "our fear of Dracula lies in the fear of losing ourselves, of relinquishing our very identities as human beings". In fact, the narrator is never named in the novel, suggesting, as one critic explains, [...] "that the quest for the dark side of human nature is more universal than specific to a concrete character".|$|E
