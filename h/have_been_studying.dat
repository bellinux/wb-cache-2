25|$|Researchers at the University of Nice in France <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying</b> a tiny aquatic slug {{which is}} a natural {{predator}} of C. taxifolia. Called Elysia subornata, it was found {{off the coast of}} Florida, in waters warmer than those in the Mediterranean. This slug is believed to feed exclusively on C. taxifolia, by sticking its proboscis into the stem and sucking out the white viscous liquid inside the stem: this causes the alga to become limp, discolored, and dead. As the slug does so, it absorbs the alga's poison. The slug has an enzyme which neutralizes the noxious effect of the poison, and at the same time, the poison protects the slug from being eaten by fish. However, this slug cannot survive in the cooler waters of the Mediterranean and, therefore, is unable to control the invasive alga there.|$|E
500|$|In 1931, aged 19, Ferrier {{passed her}} Licentiate {{examinations}} at the Royal Academy of Music. In that year she started occasional singing lessons, and in December sang a small mezzo-soprano {{role in a}} church performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio Elijah. However, her voice was not thought to be exceptional; her musical life centred on the piano and on local concerts, at King George's Hall and elsewhere. Early in 1934 she transferred to the Blackpool telephone exchange and took lodgings nearby, {{to be close to}} her new boyfriend, a bank clerk named Albert Wilson. While at Blackpool she auditioned for the new [...] "speaking clock" [...] service which the GPO was preparing to introduce. In her excitement, Ferrier inserted an extra aspirate into her audition, and was not chosen for the final selection in London. Her decision in 1935 to marry Wilson meant the end of her employment with the telephone exchange, since at that time the GPO did not employ married women. Of Ferrier's career to this point, the music biographer Humphrey Burton wrote: [...] "For more than a decade, when she should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying</b> music with the best teachers, learning English literature and foreign languages, acquiring stage craft and movement skills, and travelling to London regularly to see opera, Miss Ferrier was actually answering the telephone, getting married to a bank manager and winning tinpot competitions for her piano-playing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{departments}} of computer science <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying</b> {{the technical aspects}} of video games for years, theories that examine games as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the humanities. The two most visible schools in this emerging field are ludology and narratology. Narrativists approach video games in the context of what Janet Murray calls [...] "Cyberdrama". That is to say, their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that arises out of interactive fiction. Murray puts video games {{in the context of the}} Holodeck, a fictional piece of technology from Star Trek, arguing for the video game as a medium in which the player is allowed to become another person, and to act out in another world. This image of video games received early widespread popular support, and forms the basis of films such as Tron, eXistenZ and The Last Starfighter.|$|E
2500|$|There {{periodically}} {{is a dead}} zone, {{or region}} of low oxygen, in the lake whose exact location varies. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>studying</b> the lake's blue-green algae blooms, {{and trying to find}} ways to predict when they are spreading or where they might hit landfall; typically the blooms arrive late each summer. This problem was extreme in the mid and late 1960's and the Lake Erie Wastewater Management Study (LEWMS) conducted by the Buffalo District of the US Army Corps of Engineers determined that the eutrophication was due to [...] "point sources" [...] such as industrial outfalls and municipal sanitary and storm sewer outfalls, as well as [...] "diffuse sources", such as overland runoff from farm and forest land. All these sources contribute nutrients, primarily phosphorus, to the lake. Growth of organisms in the lake is then spiked to the point that oxygen levels are depleted. LEWMS made recommendations for reducing point source outflows, as well as reducing farm contributions of phosphorus by changing fertilizer usage, employing [...] "no-till" [...] farming and other conservative practices. Many industrial and municipal sources have since then been greatly reduced. The improved farming practices, which were voluntary, were followed for a while, resulting in remarkable recovery of the lake in the 1970s.|$|E
