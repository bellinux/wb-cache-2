50|$|As {{the need}} for action to meet the UK’s {{emissions}} reduction targets has become more urgent the Government has provided an increased level of steering through both market-based incentives and regulation. The Government has intervened to ensure that market signals provided by the carbon price and incentives for low-carbon generation {{are strong enough to}} encourage sufficient investment in <b>decarbonisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom is {{committed}} to legally binding greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of 34% by 2020 and 80% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, {{as set out in}} the Climate Change Act 2008. <b>Decarbonisation</b> of electricity generation will form a major part of this reduction and is essential before other sectors of the economy can be successfully decarbonised.|$|E
50|$|The Government {{published}} Planning Our Electric Future: A White Paper for Secure, Affordable and Low-Carbon Electricity in July 2011.

50|$|The {{level at}} which the EPS is set {{recognises}} that fossil fuel generation currently still has {{an important role to}} play in ensuring security of supply, providing stable base-load and flexibility, whilst at the same time retaining consistency with <b>decarbonisation</b> objectives by preventing the construction of new coal-fired power stations without carbon capture and storage technology and maintaining affordable electricity prices.|$|E
50|$|The Government’s {{proposals}} for electricity market reform, {{published in a}} White Paper in July 2011, included three initiatives to encourage <b>decarbonisation</b> of electricity generation in the UK: A Carbon Price Floor to complement the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS); Feed-in tariffs which will eventually replace the Renewables Obligation; and an Emissions Performance Standard to restrict future use of the most carbon intensive forms of generation.|$|E

50|$|The {{proposed}} EPS only {{applies to}} electricity generation, and {{is set at}} a level to balance the delivery of <b>decarbonisation</b> targets against the cost of electricity. Using the argument that decarbonising electricity is key to decarbonising UK energy supplies, many commentators have criticised H.M.Government for not introducing a far more onerous 2030 electricity EPS. This argument {{is based on the}} incorrect assumption that gas cannot be decarbonised economically at large scale.|$|E
5000|$|The Energy Act 2013 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, {{relating}} to the energy sector. It succeeded the Energy Act 2010. The Act focuses on setting <b>decarbonisation</b> targets for the UK, and reforming the electricity market. The Act was intended by Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey to [...] "attract investment {{to bring about a}} once-in-a-generation transformation of our electricity market".|$|E
50|$|A simple {{modification}} to the British Gas SNG {{technology will}} enable carbon negative SNG to be produces at 60 bar pressure, and high purity supercritical CO2 {{to be produced}} at 150 bar pressure, at near zero net loss of energy efficiency, or additional cost. Carbon negative SNG {{can be used to}} generate carbon negative electricity at lower cost than incumbent fossil gas or electricity. Given that electricity and gas can both be decarbonised with equal facility, and at nearly equal low costs, {{there is no need to}} introduce an onerous EPS with a view to largely 'squeezing' gas fired electricity generation off the grid by 2030. Instead it is proposed that technology neutral equal renewables and <b>decarbonisation</b> targets are introduced for both low carbon gas and electricity, with Contracts for Differences for both low carbon gas and low carbon electricity, the relative 'strike prices' to be set by reference to the historic gas to electricity price ratio. This will spread cost-effective <b>decarbonisation</b> equally over both the gas and electricity grids, and their associated infrastructure.|$|E
50|$|In May 2012, WBGU {{hosted a}} {{high-level}} international Symposium „Towards Low-Carbon Prosperity: National Strategies and International Partnerships“ in Berlin.

The keynote was delivered by Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel. The summary video of the entire event, all speeches as videos and the text documenation are available here.|$|E
50|$|Ultra-high-voltage (UHV) {{electricity}} transmission {{has been used}} in China since 2009 to transmit both AC and DC electricity over long distances separating China's energy resources and consumers. Expansion of both AC and DC capacity continues in order to match generation to consumption demands while minimizing transmission losses. <b>Decarbonisation</b> improvements will result from the replacement of lower efficiency generation, located near the coast, by more modern high efficiency generation with less pollution near the energy resources.|$|E
50|$|The <b>decarbonisation</b> {{incentives}} {{provided by}} the Carbon Price Floor and Feed-In Tariffs are further supplemented by the proposed introduction of an Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) to {{limit the amount of}} carbon dioxide that new power stations can emit per kWh of electricity generated. An Emissions Performance Standard is deemed to be required in the event that the market incentives detailed above are not sufficient in themselves to steer the electricity sector away from the most carbon intensive forms of generation.|$|E

50|$|El Surar is {{the southernmost}} cork oak forest in Valencia. It {{consists}} {{of a series of}} open copses that are the remains of more extensive, older forests. Unlike the cork forests located further {{to the north of the}} Valencian Community, it has the singularity of inhabiting soils evolved from calcareous subsoils. Cork oak forests usually occur in siliceous soils, and as such its presence in El Surar is explained by the intense rainfall recorded in the area, which washes away the soil and results in high levels of <b>decarbonisation</b> and acidification.|$|E
