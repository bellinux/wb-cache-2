5|$|Relations had {{apparently}} warmed between Tyndall and Jordan, for they met {{up after the}} latter {{was released from prison}} in 1968, and Tyndall again met with Jordan in Coventry in 1972, there inviting him to join the NF. However, a poor showing in the February 1974 general election resulted in Tyndall being challenged by two groups within the party, the 'Strasserites' and the 'Populists', the latter of whom were largely Powellite ex-members of the Conservative Party. The Populist challenge was successful and in October 1974 Tyndall was replaced as chairman by John Kingsley Read. Tyndall then used Spearhead as a vehicle to criticise rival factions with the NF. As a result, he was expelled from the party during a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>tribunal</b> in November 1975. Tyndall took the issue to the high court, who overturned the expulsion. The 'Populists' then left the party, splitting to form the National Party in January 1976, which for a short time proved more electorally successful than the NF. Back in the party and with his main rivals gone, Tyndall regained the position of chairman.|$|E
25|$|Complaints {{about the}} conduct of advocates and solicitors may be {{referred}} by the Council of the Law Society of Singapore to an inquiry panel appointed by the Chief Justice. The inquiry panel investigates the complaint and reports on the matter to the Council. The Council, on considering the report, may decide that no formal investigation is necessary, impose a penalty on the lawyer concerned, or apply to the Chief Justice for a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>tribunal</b> to be appointed to formally investigate the complaint. If a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>tribunal</b> is convened, it hears and investigates the matter and decides whether any disciplinary action against the lawyer is warranted. If not, it may dismiss the matter or impose a penalty appropriate to the misconduct. However, if it determines that disciplinary action is necessary, the Law Society must apply to the Supreme Court for the matter to be heard by a court of three judges, which has power to order that a lawyer be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors, suspended from practice for not more than five years, fined up to $100,000, or censured.|$|E

40|$|The {{sense that}} 'something {{does not fit}} it', which {{is a form of}} gut feelings, is {{frequently}} mentioned in judgements made by medical <b>disciplinary</b> <b>tribunals</b> as reported in the Dutch medical journal Medisch Contact. Since judgements made by these tribunals are regarded as setting the standard for good professional practice, we investigated {{the way in which they}} include and evaluate these feelings when making judgements. Exploratory, descriptive investigation. A search was performed for the term 'niet-pluis' ('something does not fit it') in medical tribunal databases and the Medisch Contact archives for the period 2000 - 2008. The tribunal judgements found were analysed and classified. A feeling that 'something does not fit it' was mentioned in judgements in 34 cases, all relating to situations involving diagnostic uncertainty or diagnostic mistakes. In almost every case this involved potential or actual serious damage to health. In 19 cases disciplinary action was imposed in the final judgement. <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>tribunals</b> regarded the sense of 'something does not fit it' as a diagnostic instrument.

500|$|In the 2009–10 season Millwall {{were drawn}} away to West Ham in the League Cup, {{which was the}} first meeting between the teams in the competition. The police cut the number of tickets given to {{travelling}} Millwall fans from 3,000 to 1,500, sparking anger among supporters; Millwall warned police of a higher probability of trouble. West Ham won the game 3–1 on 25 August 2009, their first win over Millwall in seven games played over in 18 years. Neil Harris had given Millwall the lead, but a goal from Junior Stanislas three minutes from the final whistle forced the game into extra-time. Stanislas added another and Zavon Hines a third for the win. Violence marred the match before, during and after kick-off, with multiple pitch invasions by Hammers supporters. Lions fan Alan Baker was stabbed outside the ground and suffered a punctured lung, but made a full recovery. He was one of 20 people injured. The police concluded that the violence, because of its large scale, was organised beforehand. The Football Association brought misconduct charges against both clubs. A <b>disciplinary</b> <b>tribunal</b> fined West Ham £115,000 for [...] "failing to ensure that their fans did not enter the field of play and refrained from violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour", but concluded that the allegations against Millwall of [...] "violent, racist behaviour and throwing missiles or dangerous objects on to the pitch" [...] had not been proved.|$|E

40|$|Study {{examined}} 27 {{reports from}} <b>disciplinary</b> <b>tribunals</b> against medical practitioners who abused narcotic analgesics (often {{combined with other}} drugs of addiction) between 2010 and 2015. The study covered all States and Territories except Tasmania (no reports were accessible for this jurisdiction. The reports revealed that 12 medical practitioners were in their 40 s; five in their 30 s; and one person still in the 20 s. Although majority were General Practitioners (15 out of 27), other medical specialties were also represented. Self-administered Pethidine was the most prevalent opioid (11 out of 27), and was the only drug used alone. Morphine was self-administered by six doctors; the same number used high doses of Panadeine Forte, Codeine and Codeine Phosphate, and Fentanyl was abused by five doctors. Surprisingly, fewer medical practitioners appear to use such opiates such as Propofol, Tramadol and Tramol, Oxycodone and Endone. The examination of cases suggests lack of consistency in the imposition of professional sanctions and penalties by the relevant tribunals. The study concludes that <b>disciplinary</b> <b>tribunals</b> should apply the test of proportionality {{in the form of}} ‘reasonable necessity’ when deciding whether to remove or suspend the addicted medical practitioner from the Register...|$|R

40|$|A {{sense of}} alarm, {{which is a}} form of "gut feeling" {{sometimes}} plays a part in the decisions of medical <b>disciplinary</b> <b>tribunals</b> in The Netherlands. Since these judgments are regarded as setting standards for professional attitudes in The Netherlands, the question arises how Dutch tribunals have evaluated gut feelings, and how tribunals in other European countries deal with them. An exploratory study searched two Dutch digital databases (2000 - 2008) and asked 26 national representatives of the European General Practice Research Network for information about the role of gut feelings in tribunals' decisions. A sense of alarm was mentioned in judgments in 34 Dutch cases. Defendants were hardly ever reproached for missing the correct diagnosis, but mostly for not acting in a professional manner. The sense of alarm was referred to as a diagnostic tool to assess a patient's situation, although the judgments indicate that it must be followed by further diagnostic steps. The role of gut feelings in decisions of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>tribunals</b> in Europe is unclear. The authors conclude that the sense of alarm as a diagnostic tool has been taken seriously by Dutch tribunals.

In addition it allows the Law Society to suspend any solicitor convicted of fraud or serious crime (if the Law Society has informed the Solicitors <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>Tribunal)</b> for six months, with a possible extension to twelve months.
