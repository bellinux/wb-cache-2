50|$|A <b>fan</b> <b>filter</b> <b>unit</b> (FFU) {{is a type}} of {{motorized}} {{air filtering}} equipment. It is used to supply purified air to cleanrooms, laboratories, medical facilities or microenvironments by removing harmful airborne particles from recirculating air. The units are installed within the system's ceiling or floor grid. Large cleanrooms require a proportionally large number of FFUs, which in some cases may range from several hundred to several thousand. Units often contain their own pre-filter, HEPA filter and internally controllable fan air distribution.|$|E

40|$|Fan {{filter units}} (FFU) {{are widely used}} to deliver re-circulated air while {{providing}} filtration control of particle concentration in controlled environments such as cleanrooms, minienvironments, and operating rooms in hospitals. The objective {{of this paper is}} to document an innovative method for characterizing operation and control of an individual <b>fan</b> <b>filter</b> <b>unit</b> within its operable conditions. Built upon the draft laboratory method previously published [1], this paper presents an updated method including a testing procedure to characterize dynamic operation of fan filter units, i. e., steady-state operation conditions determined by varied control schemes, airflow rates, and pressure differential across the units. The parameters for dynamic characterization include total electric power demand, total pressure efficiency, airflow rate, pressure differential across fan filter units, and airflow uniformity...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of <b>fan</b> <b>filter</b> <b>unit</b> (FFU) systems was {{developed}} and evaluated in this study. Capable of controlling the volume airflow rate through a networked feedback control system, the innovative smart FFU systems can supply much more uniform airflow distribution at the exit of the FFUs than common FFUs that are commercially available in the market. The development of the smart FFU was described and the comparisons of exit airflow velocities between the smart FFU and other conventional FFUs were made. The measurements {{have shown that the}} velocity uniformity values of the exit airflow of the smart FFUs were less than 5. 0 % while the conventional FFUs showed the uniformity values in the range of 14. 0 – 28. 0 %. In addition, the test results in this study demonstrate that smart FFU systems are capable of reaching preset airflow rates relatively quickly, i. e., within 5 s, and maintaining the stable airflow supply to the cleanroom...|$|E

With each strategy {{the speed of the}} recirculation <b>fan</b> <b>filter</b> <b>units</b> was reduced to save energy. When the control was based on particle counts, the energy use was 60 % of the baseline configuration of continuous fan operation. With simple occupancy sensors, the energy usage was 63 % of the baseline configuration.

40|$|Assembly of {{hard disk}} drives (HDDs) {{needs to be}} done in an {{automated}} assembly machine (AAM) virtually free of particulate contamination that can cause them to malfunction. <b>Fan</b> <b>filter</b> <b>units</b> (FFUs) are installed above the AAM to reduce the number of suspended particles in the recirculating air flowing over and around them. At one time, several HDDs were found to be defective. To find out the root cause of this problem, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to investigate the airflow over and around the AAM. It was found that the cause of the high particle counts was improper air speed from the FFUs. The optimal FFUs air speed needed to be in the range of 0. 35 – 0. 65 [*]m/s in which the airflow would block out nearby airborne particles and purge away particles generated by the AAM effectively which would, in effect, reduce the particle counts down below the threshold level of class 100 clean room. A few available measurement tools at the factory were then used to perform validating measurements against the simulation results, and the validation was positive. This optimal speed range was implemented at the factory after which the level of contamination was reduced to an acceptable level...|$|R
5000|$|... 4' x 2' or 2' x 2' FFUS are {{designed}} to be placed in ceiling grid bays with similar dimensions. [...] Ceiling grids with standard size bays that match FFU dimensions are used to construct cleanrooms. Depending on the cleanliness requirements of the controlled space, more <b>fan</b> <b>filter</b> <b>units</b> can be added to the grid in order to meet ISO standards for airflow velocity and air changes per hour. [...] FFUs can be used in place of a more conventional recirculating air unit such as a ducted or plenum air system. As FFUs require space above the ceiling grid (13" [...] for the FFU module plus another 1-2 feet of [...] "empty" [...] air-filled space), plenums are commonly used for clean rooms with height restrictions; they are the only air systems that work in layouts with smaller internal floor dimensions. Additionally, when less than 20 filters are installed in a room, a fan- powered HEPA, FFU is generally considered to be less expensive than a more conventional ducted supply system. When a microenvironment of clean air is required, FFUs can be used to construct enclosed work spaces, or laminar flow cabinets. Applying the same principle as the larger cleanroom grid, FFUs can be placed directly in a free- standing grid above the space that requires clean air. In fact, this approach is also used for silicon wafer etching in the semiconductor industry.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the applicability of adiabatic humidification in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of semiconductor cleanrooms. Accurate temperature and humidity control are essential in semiconductor cleanrooms and high energy consumption steam humidification is commonly used. Therefore, we propose an adiabatic humidification system employing a pressurized water atomizer to reduce the energy consumption. The annual energy consumption of three different HVAC systems were analyzed {{to evaluate the}} applicability of adiabatic humidification. The studied cases were as follows: (1) CASE 1 : a make-up air unit (MAU) with a steam humidifier, a dry cooling coil (DCC), and a <b>fan</b> <b>filter</b> <b>unit</b> (FFU); (2) CASE 2 : a MAU with the pressurized water atomizer, a DCC, and a FFU; and (3) CASE 3 : a MAU, a DCC, and a FFU, and the pressurized water atomizer installed in the return duct. The energy saving potential of adiabatic humidification over steam humidification has been proved, with savings of 8 % and 23 % in CASE 2 and CASE 3 compared to CASE 1, respectively. Furthermore, the pressurized water atomizer installed in the return duct exhibits greater energy saving effect than when installed in the MAU...|$|E

A cleanliness of class 1 according to Federal Standard 209 E was achieved in the tunnel.

For each of them a demonstration system was built. All systems worked satisfactorily and could be integrated into SMIF interfaces. But only two are really suitable for use in IC manufacturing lines.

40|$|Abstract—In {{multimedia}} stream filtering scenario, there usually exist many filtering {{rules that}} specify the filtering objectives and many <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> that estimate the filtering rules. A filtering rule may connect to several different <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> and a <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> may connect to several different filtering rules. An open problem {{in such a}} filtering scenario is how to order the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> in an optimal sequence so as to decrease the filtering cost. Existing methods {{are based on a}} greedy strategy which orders the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> according to three factors of the <b>filtering</b> <b>units,</b> i. e., the selectivity, popularity, and cost. Although all these methods reported good results, there is still one important problem that hasn’t been addressed yet. The selectivity factor is set empirically, which is unable to adaptively adjust with stream passing by. Under these observations, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive ordering framework (AOF) which executes an adaptive ordering strategy. In AOF, all the temporal filtering results are preserved in each sliding window. Accordingly, the selectivity can adjust automatically and thus all the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> can be ordered with respect to the adapted selectivity. Experiments on both synthetic and real life multimedia streams demonstrate that our AOF method outperforms other simple filtering methods.
