40|$|This paper establishs the {{importance}} of <b>hard</b> <b>streak</b> in bit selection. The <b>hard</b> <b>streak</b> is associated with siliceous-ferruginous sandstone with traces of siltstone rapped in augen of shale. Hitherto the drilling industry is disturbed with challenges of optimal bit selection due to a fact that current bit models in market are bias to very hard Formation like <b>hard</b> <b>streak.</b> In Soku Oil field of Niger Delta in Nigeria, West Coast of Africa, there exits challenges on proper bit to drill the section of this hard Formation. This segment of Formation is called drillers ’ nightmare because it affects every inch of drilling – from the bit in the drilling string to drilling tools, mud, hole diameter and general rig operation. Most of the current models were propagated by experiements without reference to field practical imput. Engineers that specialize in drill bit optimization, including Directional Drillers, possess the analytical skill to evaluate the drilling problems in a methodical fashion, carefully considering {{the larger context of}} the drilling process. Therefore, to tackle the menace of the <b>hard</b> <b>streak,</b> great experience, mineralogical investigation of the streak, regrouping and remodelling of existing models were done. Data for this study were gathered through personal observation as a Directional Driller at Soku field and operators in Niger Delta. They were subjected to analytical methods, presented in tables, figures and charts. Based on the data analysis, {{the findings of this study}} are that: Insert bits are perfectly good to drill all sections of <b>hard</b> <b>streak</b> provided rotation at bottom is not more tha...|$|E

40|$|The first well logs {{collected}} {{below the}} Antarctic circle were obtained during Leg 113 at Site 693 on the Dronning Maud Land Margin (Antarctica) in the Weddell Sea. Gamma-ray, resistivity, and sonic logs were collected between 108. 0 and 439. 0 mbsf. The downhole logs show good {{agreement with the}} data collected from cores and provide a con-tinuous measurement of the sedimentary record. These continuous log records show that the rather uniform Tertiary li-thology seen in cores is characterized by high-frequency variability in the log data. Several thin <b>hard</b> <b>streaks</b> are identi-fied, the largest of which coincides with a major Miocene hiatus. Associated with this hiatus is a change to lower illite content (and correspondingly lower gamma-ray counts) and to {{a significant increase in}} diatom content. Spectral analysis of the logs was performed on the lower Pliocene through upper Oligocene interval (108. 0 - 343. 0 mbsf). Between 108. 0 and 245. 0 mbsf, average sedimentation rates (50 and 26 m/m. y.) are high enough to show that variance is present in the orbital eccentricity (— 95 k. y.) and obliquity (— 41 k. y.) bands. Between 253. 0 and 343. 0 mbsf, the sedimentation rate (8 m/m. y.) is too low to resolve high frequency variations. The Milankovitch frequencies are best developed in the resistivity logs. Resistivity is responding to changes in porosity, which in these sediments is controlled by the abundance of biosiliceous sediments, particularly diatoms. The orbital forcing suggested by the Milankovitch frequencies may be influencing diatom productivity by inducing oscillations in upwelling, ice coverage, pack ice, and/or polynya. Although variations in diatom abundance were observed in the cores, they were not attributed to a Mi-lankovitch signal, and therefore in this environment, downhole logs are an important contribution to the detection and understanding of orbitally influenced changes in sedimentation...|$|R

5|$|Difficult {{conditions}} {{greeted the}} teams upon their {{arrival at the}} Silverstone Circuit, as parts of the Midlands received a month's rainfall {{in the space of}} two days. The torrential rain lasted throughout the weekend, forcing qualifying to be suspended for ninety minutes, before race day dawned clear. The circuit was declared dry, allowing the drivers to start on the tyre compound of their choice, with Alonso on the <b>harder</b> tyre <b>streaking</b> away at the start while Paul di Resta crashed at Aintree on the first lap after making contact with Romain Grosjean. As the leaders settled into a rhythm, Pastor Maldonado and Sergio Pérez collided at Brooklands, prompting an angry response from the Mexican driver. Perez's team mate Kamui Kobayashi also ran into trouble, locking his tyres as he entered his pit box and hitting three members of his pit crew, though none were seriously injured. The race was ultimately decided by the choice of tyre in the first stint as Alonso moved onto the softer option and Webber onto the harder prime for the final phase of the race. Webber caught Alonso with five laps to go, passing him on the Wellington Straight. Webber held on for his second win of the season, with Vettel third and Felipe Massa in fourth, his best result since achieving a podium in South Korea in 2010. The result meant Webber closed to within thirteen points of Alonso's championship lead, with both drivers breaking away from third-placed Vettel. After showing early promise in the wet conditions, McLaren went backwards in the dry, losing second place in the Constructors' Championship to Ferrari and third to Lotus.|$|R
40|$|Fast {{phenomena}} occurring after laser excitation {{were studied}} using time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TXRD). In most experiments, a femtosecond laser pulse {{was used to}} excite the sample, and X-rays were used as a probe. The X-ray diffraction technique was used to study bulk semiconductor samples, molten liquids, ferro-electric domain switching in potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), and strain propagation in graphite and semiconductor nanowires. When a laser pulse is absorbed by a solid, {{a wide range of}} phase transitions and phenomena can be induced. If the laser fluence is high enough to melt the material, repetitive illumination will create periodic structures {{on the surface of the}} sample. This effect was studied using static X-ray diffraction, and it was shown that the effect is important if liquid scattering experiments are carried out on molten samples using the laser in repetitive mode. When the laser fluence is too low to cause sample melting, coherent acoustic phonons can be excited, and this effect was studied in semiconductor nanowires. The time resolution of the synchrotron light source is defined by the length of the electron bunch in the storage ring, and is typically 50 - 300 ps. In order to achieve higher time resolution, short X-ray pulses, such as those at the SLS, or fast detectors, such as the streak cameras available at MAX-lab can be used. X-ray diffraction is a very sensitive technique for the study of structures, since X-ray photons scatter from all the electrons in the sample. Scattered X-rays can be used to recreate the atomic structure in the sample. In TXRD the sample is perturbed and subsequently probed after a certain delay, giving a snapshot of the structure at a given time. Several images can be merged providing a real-time movie of the structural changes. This was achieved with nanosecond time resolution at MAX-lab, when a laser-created liquid was studied. The development of a sub-picosecond, <b>hard</b> X-ray <b>streak</b> camera was one of the prerequisites for many of the studies presented in this thesis. This detector was used to study the acoustic vibrations in InSb nanowires. Oscillations with a period of 30 - 70 ps were recorded, and were attributed to acoustic phonons in the semiconductor nanowire. A dramatic decrease in the velocity of acoustic waves was also observed in these structures...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{have been}} made of the {{in-flight}} dynamics of imploding capsules indirectly driven by laser energies of 1 &# 8211; 1. 7 &# 8201;MJ at the National Ignition Facility [Miller et al., Nucl. Fusion 44, 228 (2004) ]. These experiments were part of the National Ignition Campaign [Landen et al., Phys. Plasmas 18, 051002 (2011) ] to iteratively optimize the inputs required to achieve thermonuclear ignition in the laboratory. Using gated or <b>streaked</b> <b>hard</b> x-ray radiography, a suite of ablator performance parameters, including the time-resolved radius, velocity, mass, and thickness, have been determined throughout the acceleration history of surrogate gas-filled implosions. These measurements have been used to establish a dynamically consistent model of the ablative drive history and shell compressibility throughout the implosion trajectory. First results showed that the peak velocity of the original 1. 3 -MJ Ge-doped polymer (CH) point design using Auhohlraums reached only 75 % of the required ignition velocity. Several capsule, hohlraum, and laser pulse changes were then implemented to improve this and other aspects of implosion performance and a dedicated effort was undertaken to test the sensitivity of the ablative drive to the rise time and length of the main laser pulse. Changing to Si rather than Ge-doped inner ablator layers and increasing the pulse length together raised peak velocity to 93 %&# 8201;&# 0177;&# 8201; 5 % of the ignition goal using a 1. 5 &# 8201;MJ, 420 TW pulse. Further lengthening the pulse so that the laser remained on until the capsule reached 30 % (rather than 60 %&# 8211; 70 %) of its initial radius, reduced the shell thickness and improved the final fuel &# 0961;R on companion shots with a cryogenic hydrogen fuel layer. Improved drive efficiency was observed using U rather than Auhohlraums, which was expected, and by slowing the rise time of laser pulse, which was not. The effect of changing the Si-dopant concentration and distribution, as well as the effect of using a larger initial shell thickness were also examined, both of which indicated that instabilities seeded at the ablation front are a significant source of hydrodynamic mix into the central hot spot. Additionally, a direct test of the surrogacy of cryogenic fuel layered versus gas-filled targets was performed. Together all these measurements have established the fundamental ablative-rocket relationship describing the dependence of implosion velocity on fractional ablator mass remaining. This curve shows a lower-than-expected ablator mass at a given velocity, making the capsule more susceptible to feedthrough of instabilities from the ablation front into the fuel and hot spot. This combination of low velocity and low ablator mass indicates that reaching ignition on the NIF will require > 20 &# 8201;&# 0956;m (&# 8764; 10 %) thicker targets and laser powers at or beyond facility limits...|$|R
