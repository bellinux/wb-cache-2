5|$|The 1894 Championship {{began with}} a loss for the {{defending}} champions against England, during {{a game in which}} Welsh in-fighting affected the result. Before the game, Gould instructed his forwards to heel the ball from the scrums swiftly, so it would get to the backs quickly and allow them to run at the English. Frank Hill decided that this was the wrong option and put all <b>his</b> <b>might</b> into wheeling the scrums instead, which worked against the efforts of Jim Hannan, who was trying to follow his captain's wishes. In the next match Gould was partnered by Dai Fitzgerald in a win over Scotland, but was unavailable for the encounter with Ireland and was replaced by Jack Elliott from Cardiff RFC.|$|E

25|$|Condé {{came down}} on Marshal's section with such vigour it {{surprised}} and destroyed the French resistance. Don Juan José de Austria stood out due to his brave action, unleashing <b>his</b> <b>might</b> on the French quarters. Turenne then repelled a false attack from the Spanish on his quarters, {{and went to the}} aid of Maréchal La Ferté but it was in vain, so he felt obliged to retreat as far as Quesnoy, where he reorganised his forces.|$|E

25|$|After a {{short and}} {{unremarkable}} amateur career, Schilling turned professional on September 30, 2006, taking on Lawson Baker in an 84kg/185lb bout on ten days' notice in Inglewood, California. He recalls striking his opponent with all <b>his</b> <b>might,</b> only {{to watch him}} continue to advance unfazed. After being dropped multiple times and nearly throwing in the towel, Schilling finally found the one weapon that worked, elbows. 47 landed elbows later, {{he won his first}} professional Muay Thai fight by way of split decision.|$|E
25|$|When David {{heard that}} God had blessed Obed-Edom {{because of the}} Ark, David brought the Ark to Jerusalem with joy. When those who bore the Ark had gone six paces, they sacrificed an ox and a fatling. The Israelites brought up the Ark with {{shouting}} {{and the sound of}} the horn, and David danced with all <b>his</b> <b>might</b> girded with a linen ephod. As the Ark came into the city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out the window and saw David leaping and dancing, and she despised him in her heart.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{theories}} to {{the origin of}} the Kadamba dynasty, a native Kannadiga origin and the other a north Indian origin. Mention of the north Indian origin of the Kadambas are only found in their later records of their offshoot descendent dynasty and is considered legendary. The earliest record making this claim is the 1053 and 1055 inscriptions of Harikesari Deva which are copied in inscriptions thereafter, describing Mayurasharma as the progenitor of the kingdom who established <b>his</b> <b>might</b> on the summit of Mount Himavat. But this theory has not found popularity as there is no indication of this account in any of their early records. On the contrary, the family derives its name from the Kadamba tree that is common only to the South India region.|$|E

25|$|A {{long time}} ago, {{there was a}} rich {{merchant}} and his beautiful wife who lived happily in a big house. Despite their good fortune, the couple didn't have any children. One day, they went together to a shrine and made an offering of twelve banana hands to a tree spirit. Not long thereafter the wife became pregnant and the rich man wished with all <b>his</b> <b>might</b> that the child would be a boy, but his wife {{gave birth to a}} girl. His wife, however, conceived again and again. She became pregnant twelve times and each time she had a daughter. By that time his business started to go wrong for him since the ships that took his goods to sell in another country were robbed several times. Finally the rich merchant ended up borrowing a lot of money from his friends trying to fix his business problems. Yet, no matter what he did, his family kept getting poorer.|$|E
25|$|Bart D. Ehrman {{argues that}} {{different}} parts of the Bible give different answers. One example is evil as punishment for sin or as a consequence of sin. Ehrman writes that this seems to be based on some notion of free will although this argument is never explicitly mentioned in the Bible. Another argument is that suffering ultimately achieves a greater good, possibly for persons other than the sufferer, {{that would not have been}} possible otherwise. The Book of Job offers two different answers: suffering is a test, and you will be rewarded later for passing it; another that God in <b>his</b> <b>might</b> chooses not to reveal his reasons. Ecclesiastes sees suffering as beyond human abilities to comprehend. Apocalyptic parts, including the New Testament, see suffering as due to cosmic evil forces, that God for mysterious reasons has given power over the world, but which will soon be defeated and things will be set right.|$|E
500|$|In a Rolling Stone review, Christopher Connelly {{describes}} [...] "Beat It" [...] as {{the best}} song on Thriller, adding that it [...] "ain't no disco AOR track". He notes of the [...] "nifty dance song", [...] "Jackson's voice soars all over the melody, Eddie Van Halen checks in with a blistering guitar solo, you could build a convention center on the backbeat". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that the song is both [...] "tough" [...] and [...] "scared". Robert Christgau claimed that the song has Eddie Van Halen [...] "wielding <b>his</b> <b>might</b> {{in the service of}} antimacho". Slant Magazine observed that the song was an [...] "uncharacteristic dalliance with the rock idiom". The track also won praise from Jackson biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, who stated that the song was [...] "rambunctious".|$|E

500|$|No {{definite}} record exists of {{how exactly}} Pericles managed {{to convince the}} residents of Attica to agree {{to move into the}} crowded urban areas. For most, the move meant abandoning their land and ancestral shrines and completely changing their lifestyle. [...] Therefore, although they agreed to leave, many rural residents were far from happy with Pericles' decision. Pericles also gave his compatriots some advice on their present affairs and reassured them that, if the enemy did not plunder his farms, he would offer his property to the city. This promise was prompted by his concern that Archidamus, who was a friend of <b>his,</b> <b>might</b> pass by his estate without ravaging it, either as a gesture of friendship or as a calculated political move aimed to alienate Pericles from his constituents.|$|E
500|$|During all of this, the sky splits into two. From the split, the [...] "sons of Muspell" [...] ride forth. Surtr rides first, {{surrounded}} by flames, his sword {{brighter than the}} sun. High says that [...] "Muspell's sons" [...] will ride across Bifröst, described in Gylfaginning as a rainbow bridge, and that the bridge will then break. The sons of Muspell (and their shining battle troop) advance {{to the field of}} Vígríðr, described as an expanse that reaches [...] "a hundred leagues in each direction", where Fenrir, Jörmungandr, Loki (followed by [...] "Hel's own"), and Hrym (accompanied by all frost jötnar) join them. While this occurs, Heimdallr stands and blows the Gjallarhorn with all <b>his</b> <b>might.</b> The gods awaken at the sound, and they meet. Odin rides to Mímisbrunnr in search of counsel from Mímir. Yggdrasil shakes, and everything, everywhere fears.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{have also}} noted Indo-European {{parallels}} to the wolves Geri and Freki as companions of a divinity. 19th century scholar Jacob Grimm observed {{a connection between}} this aspect of Odin's character and the Greek Apollo, to whom both the wolf and the raven are sacred. Philologist Maurice Bloomfield further connected the pair with the two dogs of Yama in Vedic mythology, and saw them as a Germanic counterpart to a more general and widespread Indo-European [...] "Cerberus"-theme. Michael Speidel finds similar parallels in the Vedic Rudra and the Roman Mars. Elaborating on the connection between wolves and figures of great power, he writes: [...] "This is why Geri and Freki, the wolves at Woden's side, also glowered on the throne of the Anglo-Saxon kings. Wolf-warriors, like Geri and Freki, were not mere animals but mythical beings: as Woden's followers they bodied forth <b>his</b> <b>might,</b> and so did wolf-warriors." ...|$|E

500|$|Fireworks {{are a part}} of {{many public}} {{entertainments}} and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a [...] "crowning feature of elaborate celebrations" [...] in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for pyrotechnists, especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays. Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays [...] "inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in <b>his</b> <b>might.</b> Birthdays, name-days, weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration." [...] One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the War of the Austrian Succession and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire, the accompanying Music for the Royal Fireworks written by Handel has been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian Dashavatara Kala of Gomantaka [...] "the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks".|$|E
500|$|Snow was {{designed}} by Nao Ikeda and Tetsuya Nomura. He {{was designed}} around a motif of ice, with his bandanna inspired by an unused costume element from Kingdom Hearts coded designed by Kamikokuryo. For XIII-2, the bandanna was removed and {{he was given a}} new hairstyle. Originally to have been called [...] "Storm", the development team nicknamed the character [...] "Mr. 33 cm" [...] in reference to his shoe size while his name was still a secret. Nomura designed his darker look in Lightning Returns. Snow's personality in XIII, which carried over to XIII-2, was created to be passionate, optimistic and impulsive, opposing and acting as a foil for Lightning's cold mannerisms. He has also been described in interviews as the [...] "tough guy" [...] type, and not having a jealous side to him. He was originally to have been a more negative delinquent athletic type, but this was changed to his [...] "big brother" [...] persona. Concerning his stance in Lightning Returns, Kitase described Snow as [...] "struggling with all <b>his</b> <b>might</b> to keep himself from falling apart from the sadness of losing Serah." [...] His design was intended to reflect the state of the world, as he had changed from his lighthearted former self because of the world's fate. His darker portrayal was emulated by his weapon in the opening cinematic. Watanabe enjoyed writing the character's story, as he was able to give Snow scenes where he appeared [...] "cool", rather than taking on a [...] "thankless" [...] roles. VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole called his relationship with Lightning and Hope, and the way he coped with Serah's fate, {{one of the most interesting}} aspects of the original game. Aside from his appearance in the XIII games, the character was featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy XIII, and his outfit from that game was featured as an optional character costume in [...] along with Lightning's Guardian Corps uniform. Snow is voiced by Troy Baker in English and by Daisuke Ono in Japanese.|$|E
