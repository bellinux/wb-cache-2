40|$|Jane Austen revises {{the sentimental}} epistolary {{tradition}} by introducing a structural epistolarity that replaces the anatomical vocabulary of female corporeality with the domiciliar terminology of female domesticity. In Austen's novels, the epistolary {{metaphor of the}} passport links letter reading, the heroine's education process, and views of domestic space. Epistolary issues aligned with domestic spaces indicate the metaphorical relationship between the structural dialectic of closed and open and the epistolary paradox of writing to dissemble character and reading to reveal character. Letter writing and reading represent the spatial order within prescribed views and tours of houses and grounds. The heroine's critical letter reading allows her to distinguish between character types presented through different <b>domestic</b> <b>contents,</b> and the letter's interpretive authority finalizes her social education by serving as a passport figuratively transferring her between natal and martial households...|$|R

During the 1991 retooling for production of 1992 models at its St. Thomas, Ontario facility, Ford switched a number of its parts suppliers from Canada and the United States to suppliers outside North America, bringing the <b>domestic</b> parts <b>content</b> of the Grand Marquis and Crown Victoria below 75%.

50|$|After {{becoming}} a Minister, Rousseff defended a new industrial policy from the government, ensuring that Petrobras' platforms had a minimum <b>domestic</b> <b>content,</b> what could generate 30 thousand {{new jobs in}} the country. She {{argued that it was}} unthinkable that a billion dollar building was not being made in Brazil. The bids for the P-51 and P-52 platforms were then the first in the country to require a minimum <b>domestic</b> <b>content.</b> The requirement was heavily criticized, {{on the grounds that it}} would increase the costs of Petrobras, but Rousseff defended the country's ability to produce ships and platforms, stating that the nationalization rates of the platforms, which varied between 15% and 18% rose to more than 60% after the requirement. Lula acknowledged that, from the perspective of the company, the costs did in fact go higher, but that Petrobras should not only target the immediate costs, but also the strengthening of national science and technologies. In 2008, the shipbuilding industry as a whole employed 40 thousand people, compared to 500 people in the mid-90s, in part because of the nationalization requirement. Brazil now has the 6th largest shipping industry in the world.|$|E

500|$|Plaza C was {{separated}} from Plazas A and B by a [...] wall and was the palace complex of the Ahpo Xahil, the junior co-ruler. Plaza C also had two temples facing {{each other across the}} plaza. The Xahil ballcourt was on the southwest side of Plaza C and the palace proper of the Ahpo Xahil was on the southeast side of the plaza. The Xahil Palace was built with an east-west alignment with the entry courtyard on the western side of the palace and had a central altar. The main palace was entered from {{the eastern side of the}} entry courtyard. The rooms and courtyards of the Xahil Palace contained a great deal of domestic artefacts. The Xahil Palace was destroyed by a major fire that resulted in the collapse of the adobe walls and it may be that this was the complex where Pedro de Alvarado was lodged with his Spanish soldiers. It would also be the same building that Spanish deserters burned in 1526. The collapse of the building preserved the <b>domestic</b> <b>contents</b> of the palace for archaeologists, unlike the palace of the Ahpo Sotz'il where comparatively few artefacts were recovered.|$|R

40|$|Listening to songs is a {{frequent}} activity for many people in Western societies. Not only are people exposed to songs {{in a variety of}} places, but many people increasingly choose to listen to songs. Some songs are popular despite the antisocial or prosocial nature of the lyrics on important societal topics, such as domestic violence. However, both music and lyrics have the power to communicate, and are processed by the human brain at a complex and detailed level. Of interest to the present study is whether people perceive song narratives and messages differently across these two presentations. The present study explored whether people change their perception of songs with <b>domestic</b> violence <b>content</b> as promoting or opposing domestic violence, when listening to the song compared to reading the lyrics without music. Primarily, the present study aimed to explore the selfreported reasons for changes in song interpretation and perception between the two presentations. Twenty-seven adults (18 females and 9 males), aged between 18 and 65 years, participated in the study. Participants were recruited from both the community and a university in Auckland, New Zealand. A survey research design was used to obtain data in relation to each of eight songs with <b>domestic</b> violence <b>content,</b> and a mixed-method of quantitative and qualitative analyses were employed to analyse the data. The data from the present study showed few statistically significant differences in perceptions between the presentations of song versus lyrics in relation to the potentially prosocial and antisocial <b>domestic</b> violence <b>content</b> of songs. However, qualitative analyses showed that the interpretation of song narratives and messages involves information perceived from both music and lyrics, which can influence the perception of songs. The study also found that incongruence between music and lyrics can result in softer perceptions of antisocial lyrics. Thus, people may not find antisocial messages in songs objectionable when the music of those songs is pleasant. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|R
