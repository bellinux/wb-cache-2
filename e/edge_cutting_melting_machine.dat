FEM {{modeling and simulation}} of orthogonal cutting process using uniform and variable <b>edge</b> <b>cutting</b> tools were studied with dynamics explicit ALE method. AISI 1045 steel was chosen for workpiece, and cemented carbide was chosen for cutting tool. Three sections of uniform and variable edges were chosen for analysis. Cutting forces and temperature distributions were calculated for uniform and variable <b>edge</b> carbide <b>cutting</b> tool. Simulation results show that variable <b>edge</b> <b>cutting</b> tool obtains small cutting forces. Ploughing force tends to reduce when variable <b>edge</b> <b>cutting</b> tool was used. Variable <b>edge</b> <b>cutting</b> tool reduces the heat generation and presents reasonable temperature distributions, which is beneficial to cutting life. The force and temperature distributions demonstrate the advantages of variable <b>edge</b> <b>cutting</b> tool...|$|R

40|$|In microdrilling, {{because of}} lower feed, the microdrill <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius is {{comparable}} to the chip thickness. The <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> therefore should be regarded as rounded edges, which results in a more complex cutting mechanism. Because of this, the macrodrilling thrust modeling is not suitable for microdrilling. In this paper, a mathematical modeling to predict microdrilling thrust is developed, and the geometric characteristics of microdrill were considered in force models. The thrust is modeled in three parts: major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> and indentation zone. Based on slip-line field theory, the major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> and secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> are divided into elements, and the elemental forces are determined by an oblique cutting model and an orthogonal model, respectively. The thrust modeling of the major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> and second <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> includes two different kinds of processes: shearing and ploughing. The indentation zone is modeled as a rigid wedge. The force model is verified by comparing the predicted forces and the measured cutting forces...|$|R
