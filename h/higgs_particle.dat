25|$|Weak boson fusion. Another {{possibility}} {{when two}} (anti-)fermions collide {{is that the}} two exchange a virtual W or Z boson, which emits a Higgs boson.

25|$|On July 2, 2012, {{two days}} before a {{scheduled}} announcement at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), scientists at the Tevatron collider from the CDF and DØ collaborations announced their findings from the analysis of around 500 trillion collisions produced since 2001: They found {{that the existence of}} the Higgs boson was likely with a mass in the region of 115 to 135 GeV. The statistical significance of the observed signs was 2.9 sigma, which meant that there is only a 1-in-550 chance that a signal of that magnitude would have occurred if no particle in fact existed with those properties. The final analysis of data from the Tevatron did however not settle {{the question of whether the}} <b>Higgs</b> <b>particle</b> exists. Only when the scientists from the Large Hadron Collider announced the more precise LHC results on July 4, 2012, with a mass of 125.3 ± 0.4 GeV (CMS) or 126 ± 0.4 GeV (ATLAS) respectively, was there strong evidence through consistent measurements by the LHC and the Tevatron for the existence of a <b>Higgs</b> <b>particle</b> at that mass range.|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} we review the {{prospects}} for Higgs physics at LEP 2. The theoretical aspects and the phenomenology of <b>Higgs</b> <b>particles</b> are discussed within the Standard Model (SM) and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The experimental search techniques are described and the discovery limits for Higgs bosons in the LEP 2 energy range are summarized. In addition, opportunities of detecting <b>Higgs</b> <b>particles</b> in non-minimal extensions of the SM and the MSSM are investigated...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Higgs</b> <b>particle</b> is {{a massive}} scalar {{elementary}} particle theorized by Peter Higgs in 1964 when he showed Goldstone's 1962 theorem (generic continuous symmetry which is spontaneously broken) provides a third polarisation of a massive vector field. Hence, Goldstone's original scalar doublet, the massive spin-zero particle, was proposed as the Higgs boson. (see 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers) and is a key building block in the Standard Model. It has no intrinsic spin, {{and for that reason}} is classified as a boson (like the gauge bosons, which have integer spin).|$|E
25|$|Gluon fusion. If the {{collided}} {{particles are}} hadrons {{such as the}} proton or antiproton—as {{is the case in}} the LHC and Tevatron—then it is most likely that two of the gluons binding the hadron together collide. The easiest way to produce a <b>Higgs</b> <b>particle</b> is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of virtual quarks. Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass, this process is more likely for heavy particles. In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual top and bottom quarks (the heaviest quarks). This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and Tevatron being about ten times more likely {{than any of the other}} processes.|$|E
25|$|The Standard Model {{leaves the}} mass of the Higgs boson as a {{parameter}} to be measured, rather than a value to be calculated. This is seen as theoretically unsatisfactory, particularly as quantum corrections (related to interactions with virtual particles) should apparently cause the <b>Higgs</b> <b>particle</b> to have a mass immensely higher than that observed, {{but at the same time}} the Standard Model requires a mass of the order of 100 to 1000 GeV to ensure unitarity (in this case, to unitarise longitudinal vector boson scattering). Reconciling these points appears to require explaining why there is an almost-perfect cancellation resulting in the visible mass of ~ 125 GeV, and it is not clear how to do this. Because the weak force is about 1032 times stronger than gravity, and (linked to this) the Higgs boson's mass is so much less than the Planck mass or the grand unification energy, it appears that either there is some underlying connection or reason for these observations which is unknown and not described by the Standard Model, or some unexplained and extremely precise fine-tuning of parameters – however at present neither of these explanations is proven. This is known as a hierarchy problem. More broadly, the hierarchy problem amounts to the worry that a future theory of fundamental particles and interactions should not have excessive fine-tunings or unduly delicate cancellations, and should allow masses of particles such as the Higgs boson to be calculable. The problem is in some ways unique to spin-0 particles (such as the Higgs boson), which can give rise to issues related to quantum corrections that do not affect particles with spin. A number of solutions have been proposed, including supersymmetry, conformal solutions and solutions via extra dimensions such as braneworld models.|$|E

2500|$|If <b>Higgs</b> <b>particle</b> {{theories}} are valid, then a <b>Higgs</b> <b>particle</b> {{can be produced}} much like other particles that are studied, in a particle collider. This involves accelerating {{a large number of}} particles to extremely high energies and extremely close to the speed of light, then allowing them to smash together. Protons and lead ions (the bare nuclei of lead atoms) are used at the LHC. In the extreme energies of these collisions, the desired esoteric particles will occasionally be produced and this can be detected and studied; any absence or difference from theoretical expectations {{can also be used to}} improve the theory. The relevant particle theory (in this case the Standard Model) will determine the necessary kinds of collisions and detectors. The Standard Model predicts that Higgs bosons could be formed in a number of ways, although the probability of producing a Higgs boson in any collision is always expected to be very small—for example, only 1 Higgs boson per 10 billion collisions in the Large Hadron Collider. The most common expected processes for Higgs boson production are: ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Standard Model, the <b>Higgs</b> <b>particle</b> is a boson with no spin, {{electric}} charge, or colour charge. It is {{also very}} unstable, decaying into other particles almost immediately. It is a quantum excitation {{of one of the}} four components of the Higgs field. The latter constitutes a scalar field, with two neutral and two electrically charged components that form a complex doublet of the weak isospin SU(2) symmetry. The Higgs field has a [...] "Mexican hat-shaped" [...] potential. Consequently, the field in its ground state has a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), and below a very high energy it breaks the weak isospin symmetry of the electroweak interaction. (Technically the non-zero expectation value converts the Lagrangian's Yukawa coupling terms into mass terms). When this happens, three components of the Higgs field are [...] "absorbed" [...] by the SU(2) and U(1) gauge bosons (the [...] "Higgs mechanism") to become the longitudinal components of the now-massive W and Z bosons of the weak force. The remaining electrically neutral component either manifests as a <b>Higgs</b> <b>particle,</b> or may couple separately to other particles known as fermions (via Yukawa couplings), causing these to acquire mass as well. Some versions of the theory predicted more than one kind of Higgs fields and bosons. Alternative [...] "Higgsless" [...] models were considered until the discovery of the Higgs boson.|$|E
2500|$|The Minimal Standard Model as {{described}} above is the simplest known model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field. However, an extended Higgs sector with additional <b>Higgs</b> <b>particle</b> doublets or triplets is also possible, and many extensions of the Standard Model have this feature.

2500|$|The {{original}} {{motivation for}} proposing the MSSM was {{to stabilize the}} Higgs mass to radiative corrections that are quadratically divergent in the Standard Model (hierarchy problem). [...] In supersymmetric models, scalars are related to fermions and have the same mass. [...] Since fermion masses are logarithmically divergent, scalar masses inherit the same radiative stability. [...] The Higgs vacuum expectation value {{is related to the}} negative scalar mass in the Lagrangian. In order for the radiative corrections to the Higgs mass to not be dramatically larger than the actual value, the mass of the superpartners of the Standard Model should not be significantly heavier than the Higgs VEV—roughly 100 GeV.
