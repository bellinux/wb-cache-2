5|$|A riot {{that lasted}} four days broke out on November 2 when strikebreakers {{attempted}} to restart transit services. At its height, {{eight to ten}} thousand rioters flooded downtown Indianapolis and vandalized the city's main business district.

5|$|After Bara's {{contract}} with Fox ended, Woods approached her about appearing in a play. She had performed on stage {{early in her}} career, working with touring companies and in summer stock, but had not performed on Broadway. Bara told a reporter that she was offered a few scripts to consider, and chose The Blue Flame (at that time titled The Lost Soul) because it allowed her to play {{two versions of the}} character, one good and the other bad. She also hoped moving to the stage would bring her new career opportunities. Woods gave Bara a lucrative contract. Each week she received a salary of $1500. This was considerably less than the $4000 per week she had earned in her last year with Fox, but Bara was also promised half the production's net profits. For example, the play's two-week run in Boston netted Bara $10,700. Woods also provided a finely appointed private railroad car to take her <b>from</b> <b>city</b> to city when the show toured.|$|E
5|$|After the Duke of Northumberland's {{attainder}} {{the entire}} Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons {{had to start}} from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes, as they had renounced any rights to their father's former possessions or titles when their own attainders had been lifted in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans <b>from</b> <b>City</b> of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence, worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father's lands, but since he was not the family heir {{it was a matter of}} some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. Other grants were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E

Despite legal challenges initiated during his term, Newark Public Schools has remained under {{control of the state}} for nearly twenty years. Newark received $32 million in emergency state aid in 2011 and 2012, requiring a memorandum of understanding between Newark and the state that obligates the city to request and the state to approve appointments to city hall administrative positions.|$|E

5|$|Born in Dalton-in-Furness, Lancashire, Johnson {{became an}} {{apprentice}} {{at the local}} shipyard. He played football part-time for Dalton Athletic and Dalton Casuals until 1919, when he signed a professional contract with Manchester City following a recommendation <b>from</b> <b>City</b> defender Eli Fletcher; Fletcher had threatened to leave the club if Johnson was not signed. He made a goalscoring debut in a war league match against Blackburn Rovers on 22 February 1919, and scored a hat-trick against Port Vale a fortnight later. League football returned in August 1919, but Johnson did not play for the first team until much later in the season. He made his league debut against Middlesbrough on 18 February 1920 scoring both goals in a 2–0 win, playing in the position previously occupied by Tommy Browell. He kept his place for a further six matches, scoring one more goal. The final match in this run of appearances was a 2–1 win against Liverpool at Hyde Road, which was attended by the reigning monarch, King George V. Johnson made a further three appearances {{in the remainder of}} the season.|$|E

The takeover was authorised, but the new railway works were removed from the bill after opposition <b>from</b> <b>City</b> property owners. The following year, a bill was jointly presented by the Met and GNR with amended plans that would have also allowed a connection between the GN and GNR at Finsbury Park. Opposed, this time by the North London Railway, this bill was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1877, {{tensions}} erupted in stoppages and civil unrest across the nation in what would {{become known as the}} Great Railroad Strike or simply the Great Strikes. Violence began in Martinsburg, West Virginia and spread along the rail lines through Baltimore and on to several major cities and transportation hubs of the time, including Reading, Scranton and Shamokin, Pennsylvania; a bloodless general strike in St. Louis, Missouri; and a short lived uprising in Chicago, Illinois. In the worst case, rioting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania left 61 dead and 124 injured. Much of the city's center was burned, including more than a thousand rail cars destroyed. What began as the peaceful actions of organized labor attracted the masses of working discontent and unemployed of the depression, along with others who took opportunistic advantage of the chaos. In total, an estimated 100,000 workers participated nationwide. State and federal troops followed the unrest as it spread along the rail lines <b>from</b> <b>city</b> to city, beginning in Baltimore, where the movement of troops itself provoked a violent response that ultimately required federal intervention to quell.|$|E
