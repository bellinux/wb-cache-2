The levying of impôts (duties) {{different from those of}} the United Kingdom was granted by Charles II and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this <b>fiscal</b> <b>reform</b> also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing income tax was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a flat rate of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.|$|E

The China Water Institutions and Management Panel Survey data show that village leaders, water user associations, farmers, and upper level governments have all contributed to irrigation investment in villages throughout the study period between 1996 and 2007. Both descriptive and multivariate analyses suggest that changes brought by <b>fiscal</b> <b>reforms</b> have significantly reduced village collectives' capacity to fund irrigation infrastructure in villages. There was a significant drop in upper level government investment during the posttax-for-fee period (2002 - 2004 in the sample areas). Since 2005, upper level government has increased its investment to prereform levels and partly filled the public investment void in irrigation infrastructure. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>reforms</b> had the least impact on farmers' investment, which has been the most stable source of funding for village-level irrigation projects.

25|$|A {{distinctive}} {{trait of}} the Dutch economy {{emerging in the}} 18th century was the fiscal-financial complex. The historically large public debt, resulting from the Republic's participation in the European wars {{around the turn of}} the 18th century, was held by a small percentage of the Dutch population (there was hardly any external debt). This implied that the Dutch fiscal system now became yoked to the service of this debt in a way that served the interests of this small rentier class. No less than 70 percent of the annual revenue of the province of Holland (the main debtor) had to be dedicated to debt service. These revenues consisted mainly of regressive indirect taxes with the perverse effect that income was transferred from the poorer classes to the richer to the amount of 14 million guilders a year (approximately 7 percent of the Gross National Product at the time). This debt burden rested preponderantly on the tax payers from Holland, as the finances of the provinces were separated in the confederal system of the Republic, and this unequal debt burden militated against other provinces agreeing to <b>fiscal</b> <b>reform.</b> <b>Fiscal</b> <b>reform</b> was also opposed by the rentiers that had a vested interest in retaining their interest income, but not in paying (direct) income taxes to pay for the debt service.|$|E
25|$|Others, such {{as former}} Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter G.

He estimated that 25–33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. He also recommended that a budget be established for government healthcare expenses, through establishing spending caps and pay-as-you-go rules that require tax increases for any incremental spending. He has indicated that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts will be required. All of these issues would be addressed under the aegis of a <b>fiscal</b> <b>reform</b> commission.|$|E
25|$|When the Daoguang Emperor came to {{the throne}} in 1820, he was alarmed at the outflow of silver to pay for opium. In the {{years leading up to}} the Opium Wars <b>fiscal</b> <b>reform</b> became an {{emotional}} as well as fiscal issue. In 1832, the emperor appointed the reform minded official Tao Zhu to head the Lianghuai Salt Administration. Tao immediately ended the Ming franchise system in favor of a relatively open market. He ordered that merchants of good standing could buy salt certificates for a large or small amount of salt which could be retailed wherever the merchant wished. The certificates themselves could be bought and sold. In the short term, however, Tao could not make good on his promises for delivery of salt and revenue, and was forced to retire. Nevertheless, the system had been changed and the bureaucracy of the dynasty showed a greater ability to adapt than later critics gave it credit for.|$|E

25|$|President Collor de Mello was impeached in September 1992 {{on charges}} of corruption. Vice {{president}} Itamar Franco {{was sworn in as}} president (1992–94), but he had to grapple to form a stable cabinet and to gather political support. The weakness of the interim administration prevented it from tackling inflation effectively. In 1993 the economy grew again, but with inflation rates higher than 30 percent a month, the chances of a durable recovery appeared to be very slim. At the end of the year, it was widely acknowledged that without serious <b>fiscal</b> <b>reform,</b> inflation would remain high and the economy would not sustain growth. This acknowledgment and the pressure of rapidly accelerating inflation finally jolted the government into action. The president appointed a determined minister of finance, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and a high-level team was put in place to develop a new stabilization plan. Implemented early in 1994, the plan met little public resistance because it was discussed widely and it avoided price freezes.|$|E
25|$|After {{the electoral}} victory of 2011, {{the ruling party}} regained control over both {{chambers}} of Congress. They initiated a period of <b>fiscal</b> <b>reform,</b> which included several tax increases, limits to wage increases, but increases in protectionism and reorganization of state-owned enterprises. Congress passed an anti-terrorism law, criticized for its vague and imprecise terms, that may {{allow it to be}} used against political opponents of the government. Hugo Moyano, main union leader, who was a strong supporter of kirchnerism, began to oppose the President. Moyano would later organize a big protest at Plaza de Mayo, with 30,000 people, requesting the abolition of capital gains tax. However, her close union ally Enrique Omar Suárez, another powerful union leader, has remained in support of her. The Vice President Amado Boudou got involved in a political scandal, suspected of favoring the Ciccone currency printing business. The poor maintenance of rail services led to a rail disaster that left 51 dead and 703 injured. The government has also begun to devote more attention to the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute (prompted by the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War). Fernández also supported the nationalization of YPF.|$|E
25|$|The Service sector {{dominates the}} economy of Maharashtra, {{accounting}} for 61.4% of the value addition and 69.3% {{of the value of}} output in the country. The state's per-capita income is 40% higher than the all-India average. The gross state domestic product (GSDP) at current prices for 2011–12 is estimated at 11,995.48billion and contributes about 14.4% of the GDP. The agriculture and allied activities sector contributes 12.9% to the state's income. Net State Domestic Product (State Income), as per the first revised estimates was 10,827.51billion and Per Capita State Income was 95,339 during 2011–12. The percentage of fiscal deficit to GSDP was 1.7 per cent and debt stock to GSDP was 18.4 per cent during 2012–13, well within Consolidated <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Reform</b> Path stipulated by the Thirteenth Finance Commission. In 2012, Maharashtra reported a revenue surplus of 1524.9million (US$24million), with a total revenue of 1,367,117million (US$22billion) and a spending of 1,365,592.1million (US$22billion). Maharashtra ranks first in FDI equity and percentage share of total FDI inflows is 32.28%. Total FDI inflows into Maharashtra are US$53.48billion.

500|$|The Ordinances of 1311 were {{a series}} of {{regulations}} imposed upon King Edward II by the peerage and clergy of the Kingdom of England to restrict {{the power of the}} king. The twenty-one signatories of the Ordinances are referred to as the Lords Ordainers, or simply the Ordainers. English setbacks in the Scottish war, combined with perceived [...] extortionate royal fiscal policies, [...] set the background for the writing of the Ordinances in which the administrative prerogatives of the king were largely appropriated by a baronial council. The Ordinances reflect the Provisions of Oxford and the Provisions of Westminster from the late 1250s, [...] but unlike the Provisions, the Ordinances featured a new concern with <b>fiscal</b> <b>reform,</b> specifically [...] redirecting revenues from the king's household to the exchequer.|$|E
500|$|Catholic historians, such as John Lingard, thought Mary's {{policies}} failed {{not because}} they were wrong but because she had too short a reign to establish them and because of natural disasters beyond her control. In other countries, the Catholic Counter-Reformation was spearheaded by Jesuit missionaries; [...] Mary's chief religious advisor, Cardinal Reginald Pole, refused to allow the Jesuits in England. Her marriage to Philip was unpopular among her subjects and her religious policies resulted in deep-seated resentment. The military loss of Calais to France was a bitter humiliation to English pride. Failed harvests increased public discontent. Philip {{spent most of his time}} abroad, while his wife remained in England, leaving her depressed at his absence and undermined by their inability to have children. After Mary's death, Philip sought to marry Elizabeth but she refused him. Although Mary's rule was ultimately ineffectual and unpopular, the policies of <b>fiscal</b> <b>reform,</b> naval expansion, and colonial exploration that were later lauded as Elizabethan accomplishments were started in Mary's reign.|$|E
500|$|Many Dutch statesmen were {{essentially}} politiques; they soon became disenchanted with the Earl's enthusiastic fostering {{of what he}} called [...] "the religion". His most loyal friends were the Calvinists at Utrecht and Friesland, provinces in constant opposition to Holland and Zeeland. Those rich provinces engaged in a lucrative trade with Spain which was very helpful to either side's war effort. On Elizabeth's orders Leicester enforced a ban on this trade with the enemy, thus alienating the wealthy Dutch merchants. He also effected a <b>fiscal</b> <b>reform.</b> In order to centralise finances and to replace the highly corrupt tax farming with direct taxation, a new Council of Finances was established which was not under supervision of the Council of State. The Dutch members of the Council of State were outraged at these bold steps. English peace talks with Spain behind Leicester's back, which had started within days after he had left England, undermined his position further.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the second}} half of the 1980s, it became {{increasingly}} clear that a large-scale <b>fiscal</b> <b>reform,</b> one that enabled noninflationary financing of the public sector, was needed not only to control inflation but also to restore the public sector's capacity to invest. Both were essential for an economic recovery. However, political obstacles prevented the reform from materializing. And, because inflation had become the most visible symptom of the public-sector disequilibrium, there were several attempts to bring inflation under control through what came to be known as [...] "heterodox economic shocks". The period saw three such shocks: the Cruzado Plan (1986), the Bresser Plan (1987), and the Summer Plan (1989).|$|E
2500|$|That is {{a primary}} reason why [...] the major credit rating {{agencies}} – Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch – have downgraded Costa Rica’s risk ratings. For example, Moody's Investors Service in early 2017 reduced the rating to Ba2 from Ba1, with a negative outlook due to the [...] "rising government debt burden and persistently high fiscal deficit, which was 5.2% of GDP in 2016" [...] and [...] the [...] "lack of political consensus to implement measures to reduce the fiscal deficit [...] will result in further pressure on the government's debt ratios".
