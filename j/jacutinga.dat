50|$|Before the Portuguese {{arrived in}} Rio de Janeiro (in 1503), the <b>Jacutinga</b> Indians already {{inhabited}} the western {{bank of the}} Iguaçu River. This Indigenous tribe helped the French when they arrived in the region.CHAround 1565, after the expulsion of the French from Guanabara Bay, the village of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro was founded. There {{was at that time}} intense piracy promoted by French, British and Dutch privateers on the coast of the new Portuguese colony.|$|E
50|$|A {{few years}} after the {{expulsion}} of the French, the governor of Rio de Janeiro, Christopher de Barros, gave the captain Belchior Azeredo one sesmaria on the river Sarapuí, in the old village of Jacutingas Indians. There, he founded the Santo Antônio mill <b>Jacutinga,</b> which in the future would be the current municipality of Belford Roxo. A shrine to St. Anthony was built on a hillside 750 meters from the river bank Sarapuí, near the site established for port activities.|$|E
50|$|At {{the dawn}} of the seventeenth century, the Holy mill Antonio <b>Jacutinga</b> was dismembered, {{appearing}} then the maxambomba mill (Nova Iguaçu) and the ingenuity of Poce (Tenure).

50|$|However, other European pirates, mainly British and Dutch, {{continued}} to steal Brazil wood, showing the War mostly useless, since {{the absence of}} colonization {{on the coast of}} Rio de Janeiro {{continued to}} provide profit to European privateers. There was no interest in colonizing the region of Cabo Frio after this massacre, but the settlers decided to populate the Recôncavo Fluminense (area around Guanabara Bay).

5000|$|Data {{confirms}} that the other blue-wattled species, the blue-throated piping guan, is the Trinidad species' closest living relative. Interestingly, the same data suggests that these diverged some 400.000 years ago at latest, perhaps as early as 1.6 mya, whereas Trinidad has been an island only {{since the end of}} the last ice age. This indicates that the Trinidad piping guan evolved in mainland South America, being driven to its relict island range in more recent times. The holotype of this species was supposedly collected in the [...] "Orinoco River region near Cumaná" [...] (del Hoyo 1994a,b). This locality has usually been considered erroneous. However, as it indicates an area on the mainland roughly opposite Trinidad, it might actually be correct and indicate that the Trinidad piping guan was not extirpated from Venezuela until around 1800. In South America, the form cumanensis has a greenish gloss to the plumage, a white face and crest, and a blue wattle, cujubi has a blue face and a red wattle, and [...] <b>jacutinga</b> has a black face and a red wattle." ...|$|E
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{can cause}} deleterious effects on bird species, leading to population decline and extinction. Haemosporidia can {{be recognized by}} their negative effects on host fitness, including reproductive success and immune responses. In captivity, outbreaks of haemosporidian infection have been observed in birds in zoos and aviaries. The endemic Brazilian Atlantic rainforest species Aburria <b>jacutinga</b> {{is one of the}} most endangered species in the Cracidae family, and wild populations of this species are currently found mainly in conservation areas in only two Brazilian states. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of avian haemosporidia on hematological and biochemical parameters in two captive populations of A. <b>jacutinga.</b> Forty-two animals were assessed, and the haemosporidian prevalence was similar for males and females. The occurrence of haemosporidian infection in captive A. <b>jacutinga</b> observed in this study was similar to results found in other captive and wild birds in Brazil. We found three different lineages of haemosporidia. Two lineages were identified as Plasmodium sp., one of which was previously detected in Europe and Asia, and the other is a new lineage closely related to P. gallinaceum. A new third lineage was identified as Haemoproteus sp. We found no significant differences in hematological and biochemical values between infected and non-infected birds, and the haemosporidian lineage did not seem to have an impact on the clinical and physiological parameters of A. <b>jacutinga.</b> This is the first report on an evaluation of natural haemosporidian infections diagnosed by microscopic and molecular methods in A. <b>jacutinga</b> by hematology, blood biochemistry, and serum protein values. Determining physiological parameters, occurrence and an estimation of the impact of haemosporidia in endangered avian species may contribute to the management of species rehabilitation and conservation...|$|E
40|$|Palladian gold {{from the}} Cau ~ iron mine, Itabira District, Minas Gerais, Brazil {{is found in}} horizons of hydrothermally-altered Lake Superior-type oxide-facies iron-formation locally called <b>jacutinga.</b> Palladium content of the gold grains varies from 1 % to 20 %, high {{palladium}} values being associated with palladium-copper-oxide inclusions and showing island-mainland and replacement (relict) textures in the Corpo Y and Corpo X orebodies.

Palladium was deposited early during the generation of Sl-mylonitic foliation, {{and was replaced by}} gold during progressive deformation. At high oxygen fugacities (hematite stability field) and high temperatures (up to 600 ~ Pd and Au may have been transported as chloride complexes, and their deposition may have occurred mainly as a result of changes in pH, but dilution of C 1 concentrations may have also caused Pd and Au precipitation.

40|$|Precambrian banded iron {{formations}} (BIFs) in the Quadrilátero Ferrífero host {{a special}} kind of Au–Pd mineralization known as <b>Jacutinga.</b> The main orebodies are hosted within the Cauê Syncline, a SW-verging fold that involves Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks in the Itabira District, a regional synclinorium with BIFs in the core of synclinal folds in the northeastern part of Quadrilatéro Ferrífero,Minas Gerais. Structural analysis reveals two important features of the district: the polydeformed character of the rocks and the importance of brittle structures in the control of the orebodies. Two deformational events are recognized in this area. The first event developed the main foliation, S 1, that is the enveloping surface of the Cauê Syncline. The second event is better defined in the northern boundary of the structure where it is represented by a right-lateral wrench fault zone that has developed a foliation, S 2, that truncates S 1. This wrench fault was also responsible {{for the development of a}} system of fractures (Frm) that host the Au–Pd mineralization. The auriferous bodies of Cauê Syncline (Y, X, Área Central, Aba Norte, Noroeste and Aba Leste/Aba Leste Inferior) were generated during this second event. Shear fractures (R, R′ and P) and tension fractures (T) developed in response to the wrench fault system under brittle conditions. The best-developed, and most commonly mineralized fractures are R and T in all auriferous bodies. Elsewhere, the best mineralization occurs in the contacts of hematite bodies (soft/hard) and intrusive rocks with fractured itabirites. Other mineralization (Aba Norte, Área Central and X) is hosted on the contacts of other units. A system of fractures, as well as their intersections, thus represents the structural control on <b>Jacutinga</b> bodies and is responsible for the geometry of the orebodies. Of importance, there is no control by mineral/stretching lineations, fold axes and other ductile structure on the geometry and plunge of the orebodies...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of land use and occupation on the density and distribution of aeglids in the hydrographic basin of the <b>Jacutinga</b> river (northern state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). Sampling was carried out {{during the summer and}} winter of 2004, at 12 sites distributed in river spring, agriculture, grazing, and urban areas. Animals were collected using a Surber sampler. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to evaluate differences in the density of species in each land use and sampling period. Biological data were classified using cluster analysis (Euclidian distance; UPGMA). A total of 226 aeglids were captured, including 167 (78. 89 %) specimens of Aegla platensis Schmitt, 1942 and 59 (26. 11 %) specimens of A. singularis Ringuelett, 1948.
