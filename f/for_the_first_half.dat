5|$|For his campaign, Romney {{assembled}} a veteran group of Republican staffers, consultants, and pollsters. He was little-known nationally, though, and stayed around the 10percent support range in Republican preference polls <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> of 2007. He proved {{the most effective}} fundraiser {{of any of the}} Republican candidates and also partly financed his campaign with his own personal fortune. These resources, combined with the mid-year near-collapse of nominal front-runner John McCain's campaign, made Romney a threat to win the nomination and the focus of the other candidates' attacks. Romney's staff suffered from internal strife; the candidate himself was at times indecisive, often asking for more data before making a decision.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>half</b> of Letcher's term, {{the state}} was still {{struggling}} {{to recover from the}} financial Panic of 1837.

To ameliorate the state's dire financial situation, Letcher drastically cut spending, including the suspension of turnpike construction and improvements on the Green, Kentucky, and Licking rivers. These actions greatly reduced the state's deficit and improved its credit. In each of Letcher's years in office, the state showed a small but growing budget surplus.|$|E
