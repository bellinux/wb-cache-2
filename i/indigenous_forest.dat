However, much of the <b>indigenous</b> <b>forest</b> was felled by the early European {{settlers}} for fuel for the lime kilns needed during {{the construction of the}} Castle. The exact extent of the original forests is unknown, though most of it was probably along the eastern slopes of Devil's Peak, Table Mountain and the Back Table where names such as Rondebosch, Kirstenbosch, Klaassenbosch and Witteboomen survive (in Dutch [...] "bosch" [...] means forest; and [...] "boomen" [...] means trees) [...] Hout Bay (in Dutch [...] "hout" [...] means wood) was another source of timber and fuel as the name suggests. In the early 1900s commercial pine plantations were planted on these slopes {{all the way from the}} Constantiaberg to the front of Devil’s Peak, and even on top of the mountains, but these have now been largely cleared allowing fynbos to flourish in the regions where the indigenous Afromontane forests have not survived, or never existed.|$|E

Martial eagles, pythons, fish eagles, lesser-spotted and African hawk-eagles, kites, vultures and hobby falcons are amongst the raptors that concentrate on the roost for easy pickings, whereas leopard, water monitors and crocodiles make off with those bats unfortunate enough to drop to the forest floor.|$|E
