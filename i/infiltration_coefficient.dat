40|$|Current design {{methods for}} {{sustainable}} drainage system infiltration devices, such as soakaways, permeable pavements and infiltration basins, require {{knowledge of the}} empirical soil <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> as determined using a soakage test procedure. However, the control that seasonal antecedent hydrological conditions, specifically unsaturated zone soil moisture and water table position, have on the <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> is uncertain. This paper uses exploratory numerical modelling to investigate this uncertainty. Results show that antecedent water table position has a significant control on the <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient,</b> whilst for a properly conducted test the seasonal antecedent soil moisture is less important. To avoid over-estimating the <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient,</b> soakage testing should ideally be performed under the most onerous hydrological conditions and three successive drain downs must be used. Model outputs such as those presented {{can be used to}} reduce the design <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> to account for tests made during periods of lower groundwater level and higher design water table positions. Additionally, the current <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> calculation is shown to be biased toward the initial, more rapid, infiltration rate. Therefore, an alternative full depth <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> calculation is proposed. Finally a potential detrimental feedback is hypothesised between infiltration device performance and groundwater mounding. Significant design implications are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Current UK {{guidance}} {{for the design}} of sustainable drainage systems recommends that infiltration devices, such as soakaways, permeable pavements and infiltration basins, should be able to operate during periods of extreme groundwater level. Furthermore, higher groundwater levels have recently been shown to cause a reduction in the empirical soil <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient,</b> as used in the design of infiltration devices. However, there is currently no simple method available to estimate the required reduction in the design <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> to account for an extreme groundwater level. This paper uses exploratory numerical sub-surface saturated-unsaturated hydrological modelling to quantify the effect of groundwater level on the <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> for six typical soil types. The fixed resolution finite element simulations are also benchmarked against a solution employing adaptive mesh refinement. The modelling results are distilled into charts and a simple equation to allow the calculation of adjustment factors, with which to reduce the design <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> to account for a higher design groundwater level. Varying soil type sensitivity is highlighted. These factors could also be used to correct for soakage tests made during periods of lower groundwater level.

In addition, the effectiveness of different farm management on infiltration are significant. The main objective {{of this research was}} to simulate the seasonal variation (SV) of <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficients</b> in Kostiakov-Louise equation (KLE) in a cracking soil under two traditional farm managements. Farm studies carried out in a clay-loam soil in Karaj. The two management treatments were soil without wheat residual and soil with wheat residual by a 5 ton/ha rate. There were 22 furrows with 0. 75 m width in the farm. KLE <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficients</b> were measured using inflow-outflow and two point’s methods in six furrows. The results of this study indicated that the SV of a and k coefficients were not significant, but variation of f 0 was significant which was simulated with a logarithmic model. The effectiveness of SV on cumulative infiltration (Z) was also evaluated and indicated to be significant that were simulated with a logarithmic model too. Finally, dimensionless parameter such as Z* were developed to predicate Z parameter in different irrigation time, irrigation events and different residual management. Base on the result, although residue management causes a significant difference between value of f 0 and Z in two treatments, but it doesn’t effect on trend of variation during the season. It means that the trend of variation is independent of residue in soil. It is probably done because of change in some of soil physical properties such as soil bulk density and aggregate stability...|$|R

The straw mulches as a biological material, {{has the ability to}} be a significant physical barrier against the impact of raindrops and reduce the detachment of soil aggregates. The present study is an attempt to determine the efficiency of straw mulch as conservation treatment in changes in the splash erosion, time-to-runoff, runoff coefficient, <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient,</b> time-to-drainage, drainage coefficient, sediment concentration and soil loss. The laboratory experiments have been conducted for sandy-loam soil taken from deforested area, about 15 km of Warsaw west, Poland under lab conditions with simulated rainfall intensities of 60 and 120 mmh– 1, in 4 soil moistures of 12, 25, 33 and 40 % and the slope of 9 %.

This paper describes a measurement protocol to determine the yearly averaged indoor PM 2, 5 concentration and gives reference values for five quality classes: < 2, 5 μg/m 3 (A+), < 10 μg/m 3 (A: WHO annual advisory value), < 17, 5 μg/m 3 (B), < 25 μg/m 3 (C: EU limit value) and above (D). The indoor PM 2, 5 concentration is measured with an optical particle counter. The hourly outdoor concentration is derived from an outdoor station of an air quality monitoring network.

The study was conducted in four viticultural areas with different characteristics (Valencia and Málaga in Spain, Ruwer-Mosel valley and Saar-Mosel valley in Germany).

The same portable rainfall simulator with identical rainfall intensity (40 mmh(- 1)) and sampling intervals (30 min of test duration, collecting the samples at 5 -min-intervals) was used over a circular test plot with 0. 28 m(2). The results of 83 simulations have been analysed and correlation coefficients were calculated for each study area to identify the relationship between environmental plot characteristics, soil texture, soil erosion, runoff and infiltration. The results allow for identification of the main factors related to soil properties, topography and management, which control soil erosion processes in vineyards.

To document this issue, rainfall simulation experiments were carried out on 37 undisturbed 1 -m 2 plots located along a pedo-climatic transect across West Africa. An important part of the variability of <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> (R 2 = 0. 71) could be explained by a simple model based on the position of rock fragments in the top layer and accounting for the areal percentages of three types of soil surface : (1) bare surface, (2) soil surface covered with rock fragments embedded in the soil surface, and (3) surface with rock fragments resting on top of the soil surface. An even higher determination coefficient (R 2 = 0. 76) was gained when rock fragment size were accounted for in combination with vesicular porosity. Furthermore, a positive linear relationship was obtained between <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> and mean annual rainfall suggesting that additional factors related to climate might be involved, including organic matter content and clay mineralogy. Two main regions could thus be differentiated. In the arid and semi-arid zones, coarse gravel and cobbles embedded in a seal are predominant and generate high runoff. Conversely, fine and medium gravel, mainly free at soil surface, are dominant in the wetter zone, favouring therefore higher infiltration rate. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of groundwater recharge for karst aquifers of southern Italy {{is a major}} scientific task due to the relevant socio-economic and environmental role of the related groundwater resources. In this paper, the results of two methods, applied at different spatial and time scales, are reported. At regional and mean annual scales, through a multidisciplinary approach, the mean Annual Groudwater Recharge Coefficient (AGRC) was estimated for four sample karst aquifers, with available long-lasting spring discharge time series. Such estimations were extended to other karst aquifers of southern Italy {{by means of an}} empirical law that was found linking the AGRC to percentages of outcropping lithologies and endorheic/summit plateau areas. At local and episodic scales, the groundwater recharge of a test perched karst aquifer, belonging to the Mount Terminio hydrogeological structure (Campania region, southern Italy) was estimated. For such a purpose, an improvement of the Water Table Fluctuation (WTF) method, known as Episodic Master Recession (EMR), was applied to estimate the Recharge to Precipitation Ratio (RPR) coefficient, which represents the amount of precipitation recharging groundwater. Results obtained through the first approach furnished AGRC values varying between 50 % and 79 % and well matching with estimations of <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficients</b> known in literature for other karst aquifers of Europe. Moreover, the mean value of RPR determined for the local karst aquifer (73 %) resulted well matching with the AGRC estimated for the whole Mount Terminio karst aquifer (79 %). By the comparison of these outcomes, at the regional and mean annual scales, the groundwater recharge of karst aquifers was found as mainly controlled by both the extension of outcropping lithologies and endorheic/summit plateau zones. While at the local and episodic scales, the groundwater recharge was recognized as chiefly influenced by the rainfall intensity and soil hydrological condition...|$|R

The Darcy-Buckingham macroscopic approach to soil-water modelling, leading to a nonlinear Richards’ diffusion-convection equation, has been very useful for many decades. Some sharp results of the 1970 s by W. Brutsaert and J. -Y. Parlange have been an influence on many, including myself. Since the 1980 s, several groups have used an integrable one-dimensional version of Richards’ equation, with realistic nonlinear transport coefficients, to predict experimentally verifiable quantities. Neat expressions have been derived for time to incipient ponding, for the dependence of sorptivity on pond depth and for the second and higher <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficients.</b> These exact results are at odds with those of the traditional Green-Ampt model. In the limit of delta-function diffusivity, the water content profile approaches a step function, so the water content is everywhere close to either the boundary value or the initial value. As explained by Barry et al (1995), far from there being a unique “Green-Ampt limit”, practical predictions in the limit of a delta function diffusivity depend subtly on the relationship between diffusivity and conductivity at intermediate values of water content. In fact, the traditional Green-Ampt predictions, with a constant potential at the wet front, may be recovered from a linear, rather than step-function behaviour of conductivity vs water content. A number of practical predictions of the integrable model agree exactly with those of the approximate analytic method originated earlier by Parlange, involving approximations within an integrand after expressing the water conservation equation in integral form. The exactly solvable model refutes the traditional Green-Ampt model and validates the quasi-analytic integral formulation. 1 _g 813 fec...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the active recharge of karst aquifers is an important tool to estimate the groundwater resource availability in these complex hydrogeological systems, characterized by spatial and temporal variability of many hydrogeological factors, involved in groundwater flow. As a matter of fact, the rate of recharge is a key aspect for sustainable exploitation and management of these groundwater resources, as they represent {{one of the most}} important fresh-water supplies for human life and economic activities. This paper presents the results of the inverse hydrogeological water budget method application in the karst aquifer feeding Pertuso Spring, Central Italy, to evaluate the average annual groundwater recharge (i. e. the effective infiltration), supported by an open source GIS. This carbonate aquifer is {{one of the most important}} of Central Italy and Pertuso Spring is the main outlet of this karst system with an average rate of about 1. 7 m 3 /s. The study area lies in the Upper Valley of the Aniene River, in the south-east part of Latium Region, and is spread for about 50 km 2. Calculation of the effective infiltration was based on mean annual rainfall data, collected over 20 years (1992 - 2012), evapotranspiration and on hydrogeological settings of outcropping rocks, used for setting up potential <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The inverse hydrogeological water balance has been applied to the study area, discretized in grid cells (EFQ), 6. 25 Ha each one. The results of the inverse hydrogeological water balance method applied to the karst aquifer feeding Pertuso Spring show an annual recharge of about 45 Mm 3 /year. The effective infiltration map shows that the highest values are related to the presence of karstified Cretaceous limestone, mainly outcropping in the north-east part of the basin. On the contrary, lower values of effective infiltration are generally due to the lower permeability, which characterizes the rest of the area (Triassic crystal dolomites, pudding stones and conglomerates). Results show that the annual active recharge of this karst aquifer (45 Mm 3 /year) is greater than the depletion volume of water coming from Pertuso Spring (25 Mm 3 /year).

40|$|A hydrogeological {{study was}} carried out on {{important}} fractured/karst aquifer systems located in the Versilia River basin (Tuscany, Italy), in order to optimize the groundwater resources management. The main aim was the individuation of the feeding areas {{of the most important}} springs by means of a multidisciplinary approach using geological, hydrogeological and geochemical-isotopic tools. Some hydrogeological sections were elaborated in order to define the geometry of the main hydrostructures and to individuate possible groundwater divides. The elaboration of geochemical data allowed at identifying 3 main chemical facies: Ca-HCO 3, Ca-SO 4 and Na-Cl. The first two highlight the interaction of water with limestone/dolostone and carbonate-evaporite rocks for a time sufficient to acquire these chemical compositions and to achieve saturation/supersaturation in calcite and dolomite. The Na-Cl groundwater shows low salinity and a composition similar to rainwater, indicating a circulation in rocks containing minerals not very reactive and/or short interaction time with carbonate rocks. These two main types of water-rock interaction are confirmed by the isotopic ratio δ 13 C: for the Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-SO 4 types, δ 13 C value requires a significant contribution of carbon derived from dissolution of calcite, while for Na-Cl water, δ 13 C values are consistent with the addition of biogenic CO 2 in rainwater. Stable water isotopes (δ 18 O and δ 2 H) confirm that groundwaters have a meteoric origin and that the wide range of values essentially depends on the different average altitude of feeding zone. Comparing the geological and hydrogeological features with the results of the geochemical processing, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that: the Na-Cl springs are representative of the superficial circuits, with small feeding zones and very low residence times in aquifer; whereas the Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-SO 4 springs are representative of relatively deep circuits developed in extensive aquifers with high permeability. The first type of springs was used to obtain the relationship between the δ 18 O ratio and the altitude of rainwater infiltration. Taking into account that they drain a small basin and considering the regulator effect of the aquifers, the isotopic composition of these springs are very similar to the annual average isotopic values of the local meteoric water. This relationship was used to evaluate the average altitude of the feeding area of the second type of springs. All these elements, and some tracer test results available in literature, allowed us to delimit the hydrogeological basins likely drained by the most important springs under study. In addition, for each hydrogeological system, a simplified water balance using meteorological data and the effective <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficients</b> reported in the literature was performed, verifying that the delimited catchment areas are entirely consistent with the flow rate data of the springs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWater {{flow in the}} {{unsaturated}} zone is predominantly vertical, and can generally be simulated as one-dimensional flow. Five sites (boreholes) under different landuse were selected to conduct the soil water flow modelling. The selection of the sites {{was based on the}} presence and representativeness of the dominant natural vegetation covers and the availability of long record groundwater level measurements. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} take into account the spatial variation of vegetation and by doing so to assess the influence of each vegetation type on the groundwater recharge of the area. EARTH model were applied at the five sites and the calculations with EARTH model were carried out on a daily basis. The annual vertical groundwater recharges of 105. 374 (forest), 95. 2230 (heather), 95. 1919 (homestead), 104. 1995 (grain), and 96. 1977 (grass) are 299 mm/a, 287 mm/a, 367 mm/a, 284 mm/a, and 312 mm/a, which accounts for 21. 2 %, 19. 9 %, 15. 7 %, 18. 1 %, and 16. 4 % of the total of the precipitation respectively. EARTH model simulation of the five representative zones shows that the <b>infiltration</b> recharge <b>coefficient</b> of homestead is higher (37. 07 % on average) than that of grass (32. 06 % on average), heather(29. 4 % on average), forest(30. 7 % on average),grain(29. 1 % on average) ...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} {{are subject}} to extensive research, due to their effect on air quality, human health and ecosystems, and hold {{a pivotal role in}} the Earth s climate. The first focus {{of this study is to}} improve the modelling of aerosol emissions and its dispersion in the atmosphere in both spatial and temporal scales and secondly, to integrate the dispersion modelling with population activity data that leads to exposure metrics. The mathematical models used in this study are fully or partially developed by the Finnish Meteorological Institute: a global-to -mesoscale chemical transport model, SILAM; a local-scale point/line-source dispersion model, UDM/CAR-FMI; and a human exposure and intake fraction assessment model, EXPAND. One of the outcomes of this work was the refinement of the emissions modelling for global-to-mesoscale dispersion model. Firstly, a new parameterisation for bubble-mediated sea salt emissions has been developed by combining and re-assessing widely used formulations and datasets. This parameterisation takes into account the effects of wind speed and seawater salinity and temperature, and can be applicable to particles with dry diameters raging between 0. 01 and 10 µm. The parameterization is valid for low-to-moderate wind speed, seawater salinity ranging between 0 and 33 and seawater temperature ranging between - 2 and 25 °C. Secondly, the near-real time fire estimation system, IS 4 FIRES, based on Fire Radiative Power (FRP) data from MODIS, was refined to reduce the overestimation of particulate matter (PM) emissions by including more vegetation types, improving the diurnal variation, removing highly-energetic sources and recalibrating the emission factors. Applying dynamic emission modelling brought more insight to the spatial distribution of these emissions, their contribution to the atmospheric budget, and possible impact on air quality and climate. The modelling shows that sea salt aerosol (SSA) can be transported far over land and contribute up to 6 µg m- 3 to PM 10 (at annual level), and indicate that the Mediterranean has sharp gradients of concentrations, becoming an interesting area to analyse for climate considerations. For fire, the simulations show the importance of meteorology and vegetation type for the intensity of the emissions. The simulations also show that MODIS FRP is accounting for highly energetic sources as a wildland fire, bringing up to an 80 % overestimation in AOD, close to the misattributed sources. The second outcome is related to urban-scale modelling. The emissions for Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA) were revised to bring up-to-date the emissions for traffic and energy sectors in use for urban-scale modelling. The EXPAND model was revised to combine concentrations and activity data in order to compute parameters such as population exposure or intake fraction. EXPAND includes improvements of the associated urban emission and dispersion modelling system, time use of population, and <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficients</b> from outdoor to indoor air. This refinement showed that PM 2. 5 in HMA is mainly originated from long-range transport, with the largest local contributors being vehicular emissions and shipping (at harbours and its vicinity). At annual level, the population living mostly indoors (home and work) is mainly exposed to PM 2. 5 with an acutely increased exposure while commuting. Abstract available only in Englis...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{systems of}} the {{north-western}} Sicily were sampled in the period January 2002 -May 2003 for geochemical and isotopic characterization (fig. 1. 1). All major constituent and stable isotopic composition values were determined. ICP-Mass analysis of two field surveys were also performed to estimate divalent metals abundances (Ba, Sr, Cd and Fe). In order to evaluate the meteoric recharge of the aquifer a rain gauges grid was installed in January 2002 (Fig. 1. 2). The rain gauges, made to prevent evaporation phenomena and hence to preserve the isotopic composition of the rainwater, was sampled monthly. High <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> values, due to fractured rocks and poor vegetation coverage, {{made it possible to}} relate isotopic composition of precipitation to isotopic composition of groundwater. An isotopic model of precipitation was developed using weighted average isotopic composition of rain waters. The Local meteroric Water Line (LMWL) was drawn. The main geochemical processes governing groundwater composition were described and a geochemical background for evaluation of seawater intrusion and submarine discharges was defined. Geochemical features of groundwater mainly come from mixing processes between a carbonatic endmember and a seawater one. Moreover, thermal water contribution was also found in a few samples. Partial pressure of CO 2 has been computed. Generally PCO 2 values are close to 10 - 2 atm but anomalous areas have been recognized along some faults. High PCO 2 values favourite rocks dissolution. Minor elements mobility was also studied and a positive correlation between Sr, Ba and TDS was found...|$|E

Illustration of the water balance was made under the influence of land use and other economic activities. Modelling of water balance was constructed by the method of dynamic modeling systems using Powersim software. The water availability was analyzed using FJ. Mock method with variables derived from the analysis of the ecological condition of the catchment area of Lake Toba. The simulations ofwater balance and water level was performed for the condition without intervention variables and with intervention variables. The intervention variables was performed in pessimistic, moderat and optimistic scenario to provide an overview of conservation policy. The simulation of the water balance and lake water level indicate that either in the year of 2017 - 2057, the best scenario is between moderate and optimistic scenarios in the condition of the population growth between 0. 8 % - 1. 0 % per year, <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> values between 0. 40 to 0. 45, the value of land cover factor between 0. 25 to 0. 3, while the flow ofwater released into the Asahan River of 91. 69 m 3 /sec in average.

40|$|Fractured {{sandstone}} by tectonic {{and gravity}} actions could {{be classified as}} aquitard or aquifer according to the number and aperture of the fractures inside the rock mass. This kind of rock mass outcrops not frequently and sparsely in the Apennine and Alps chains. In the Emilian Apennines, which is mainly composed by sedimentary rocks (rich in clay), this type of rock is part of the Epiligurian Succession that outcrops for a 20 percent of the chain. The paper aims to highlight the first results of the semi-continuous water flow monitoring (discharge, electrical conductivity and temperature) and stable isotopic monitoring (delta 18 O and delta 2 H) of the spring that represents the drainage point of a vertical fractures system. This network joint characterizes the vertical scarp of a sandstone slab with thickness of 100 meters. The results show that the spring flow rate, the water electrical conductivity, temperature and isotopic values are influenced by the rainfall distribution pattern. Consequently during every rainfall event the spring discharge and water electrical conductivity increase, while the water temperature decreases and isotopic values become more negative. The new infiltrate water reachs the spring with a delay of 10 - 60 hours. The discharge variability index is around 270 percent. The fractured system is characterized by replacement effect of the preexistent groundwater. During the infiltration event, dissolution phenomena are observed along the wall of the fractures. A preliminary groundwater budget calculation highlights that only a potential <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> higher that 75 percent is admitted to justify the total annual volume discharge from the fractures...|$|E

40|$|Page(s) : 12 (2), 155 - 172, 21 Ref. A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of tractor ballasting weights on compaction of a sandy loam soil. Three levels of tractor ballast weights were used with a 4 -wheel drive tractor. The soil compaction variables measured in the rear tyre track were soil bulk density, cone penetration resistance, infiltration rate and tyre sinkage. The results indicated that increasing tractor tyre weight by using ballasting weights caused a significant increase in both soil bulk density and cone index through the soil layer. Among the different compaction treatments, the highest compaction treatment (full ballast) resulted in 22 % increase in soil bulk density at depths of 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm. The cone index was increased up to 102 % over the depth of 0 - 25 cm compared to untrafficked (control) treatment. All compaction treatments significantly reduced the initial infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration of the soil. However, the reduction in cumulative infiltration of soil under high compaction treatment reached up to 80 % compared to the control. Measurement of tyre sinkage differentiated between treatments. The greatest sinkage was observed under high compaction treatment providing 73 mm, whereas this value is equal to 1. 7 times sinkage of zero ballast treatment. The regression analysis done between the measured compaction variables showed high correlation between soil bulk density and each of cone index, initial infiltration rate and cumulative <b>infiltration</b> giving <b>coefficients</b> of determination (R 2) of 0. 98, 0. 91 and 0. 92, respectively.
