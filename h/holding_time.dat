Like Zaslow and Tinbergen, Welch recommended holding therapy {{as a treatment for}} autism. Like Tinbergen, Welch believed autism was caused by the failure of the attachment relationship between mother and child.

25|$|In {{the absence}} of interference, there are two factors at play when recalling a list of items: the recency and the primacy effects. The recency effect occurs when the {{short-term}} memory is used to remember the most recent items, and the primacy effect occurs when the long-term memory has encoded the earlier items. The recency effect can be eliminated {{if there is a}} period of interference between the input and the output of information extending longer than the <b>holding</b> <b>time</b> of short-term memory (15–30 seconds). This occurs when a person is given subsequent information to recall preceding the recall of the initial information. The primacy effect, however, is not affected by the interference of recall. The elimination of the last few items from memory is due to the displacement of these items from short term memory, by the distracting task. As they have not been recited and rehearsed, they are not moved into long-term memory and are thus lost. A task as simple as counting backwards can change memory recall; however an empty delay interval has no effect. This is because the person can continue to rehearse the items in their working memory to be remembered without interference. Cohen (1989) found that there is better recall for an action in the presence of interference if that action is physically performed during the encoding phase. It has also been found that recalling some items can interfere and inhibit the recall of other items. Another stream of thought and evidence suggests that the effects of interference on recency and primacy are relative, determined by the ratio rule (retention interval to inter item presentation distractor rate) and they exhibit time-scale invariance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{crack growth}} {{behavior}} in a 304 stainless steel has been investigated at 538 °C in air environment. Compact tension specimens were subjected to fatigue, creep and creep-fatigue loading. The combined effects on crack growth rates of load level and <b>hold</b> <b>time</b> have been examined. Stress intensity factors are found to correlate crack growth rates reasonably well for fatigue crack growth. Creep crack growth rates are found to correlate with stress intensity factor and C*(t). Crack growth rates under <b>hold</b> <b>time</b> cycles are successfully correlated with C*(t) avg under various load levels and <b>hold</b> <b>times.</b> Crack growth under creep-fatigue loading has been simulated by elastic-plastic-steady state creep finite element analyses. The results of analysis show that fatigue loading interrupts stress relaxation around the crack tip during <b>hold</b> <b>time</b> and causes stress reinstatement, thereby giving rise to accelerated crack growth compared with crack growth under static loading. Analysis of <b>hold</b> <b>time</b> crack growth based on the cyclic stress-strain response yields crack closure during unloading, and creep deformation during <b>hold</b> <b>time</b> tends to lower the closure load...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding and {{modeling}} <b>hold</b> <b>time</b> effects on fatigue {{crack growth rate}} (FCGR) above 500 °C in Inco 718 DA is a great challenge. Fatigue tests with a trapezoidal wave shape signal including <b>hold</b> <b>times</b> from 90 s to 3600 s were carried out on Inco 718 DA with a small grain size (5 - 15 μm) {{over a wide range}} of temperatures (500 °C- 650 °C). FCGRs were measured using potential drop technique. SEM observations were carried out to correlate the measured FCGRs with the trans- or inter-granular aspect of the fatigue fracture surfaces. Two regimes must be distinguished. The first regime associated with relatively short <b>hold</b> <b>times</b> can be represented by a power law, where da/dN is proportional to tα, α ~ 0. 25. This first regime corresponds to the situation where the fatigue crack does not propagate during the <b>hold</b> <b>time</b> but its propagation takes place during the cyclic part of the loading over a damaged zone ahead of the crack tip.
