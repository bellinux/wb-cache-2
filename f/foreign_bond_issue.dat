40|$|The {{domestic}} bond markets of the Asia and Pacific region have grown considerably since the Asian financial crisis of 1997, although they remain undeveloped {{relative to the}} region's weight in the world economy. This paper proposes {{that in order to}} encourage further development of these markets, regulators should make them more accessible to foreign borrowers. To that end we offer insights into the nature and mechanics of <b>foreign</b> <b>bond</b> issuance by investigating the key characteristics of 3, 132 <b>foreign</b> <b>bonds</b> <b>issued</b> in 14 countries (other than the United States) between July 1928 and June 2009. We found that the foreign borrowers that tap domestic markets are overwhelmingly of high credit quality and comprise sovereigns, supranationals, and major financial institutions. There is a preference for simple fixed-rate payment structures, which can then be swapped into the currency and coupon type of choice using currency and interest rate derivatives. On the whole, the long-term viability of <b>foreign</b> <b>bond</b> markets appears linked to the presence of highly liquid foreign exchange and derivatives markets that facilitate risk management and transformation, enabling regulation that facilitates cooperation with market participants, the presence of benchmark issues, and competitive pricing between alternate market segments. bond markets; financial market development; <b>foreign</b> <b>bonds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Following the Asian {{financial}} crisis, {{the development}} of local currency bond markets {{in each of the}} APEC economies as well as regional bond markets has received the highest priority among financial market policy-makers.

This includes both Norwegian firms and <b>foreign</b> firms <b>issuing</b> <b>bonds</b> in the Norwegian market, restricted to <b>bonds</b> <b>issued</b> or matured in the seven year period between January 1 st 2005 and December 31 st 2011. Our findings indicate that firms resolving financial distress only by postponing obligations have better financial performance, are larger measured in total assets and sales, and have significantly lower interest expenses to sales than all other firms involved in a credit event. Further, liquidated firms are financed by significantly more public debt, and more of their debt is senior secured than firms succeeding to restructure. They also have significantly less intangible assets than debt restructuring firms. Fewer of the liquidated firms have access to bank financing, but given that a firm has access to such financing we found no substantial difference either in levels or the importance of determinants compared to firms without bank debt. Somewhat surprisingly, firms restructuring by selling assets have significantly more convertible debt. As opposed to previous research on U.

It argues that standard determinants such as monetary performance and financial openness are at best imperfect indicators of a currency’s stability prospects, because the issuer’s promise of stability is not exogenously enforceable. The paper advocates an enforcement approach to international currencies that make explicit the underlying incentive incompatibilities. Additional enforcement determinants of currency internationalization are identified. The model is estimated using time-series cross-sectional analysis for three data sets. Monetary performance-related standard determinants fail to exhibit explanatory power, whereas the enforcement determinants are strongly significant and robust.

For these countries, capital market access meant a de facto acknowledgement of their policy successes and improvements in their creditworthiness that enabled them to graduate from the group of official financing recipients into a more advanced group of emerging market economies. The paper looks at the determinants of sovereign bond issuances and derives the relationship between internal and external factors and market access using a simple macro model. The market access condition is then translated into a simple rule that requires an excess demand for the sovereign bonds in question.

40|$|The {{potential}} for economic agents to minimize risk through diversification {{is central to}} the study of finance. This dissertation analyzes the ability to diversify risks in an international context by studying risk sharing opportunities on two dimensions, consumption growth and portfolio wealth. The first part of this dissertation examines the ability for US based investors to diversify their portfolio risks by incorporating international corporate bonds. Based on a mean variance framework, I study the potential portfolio gains to US investors of holding <b>foreign</b> corporate <b>bonds.</b> Further, I ask if the current observed portfolio holdings match the computed optimal holdings. Using statistical analysis both with and without estimation risk, I find that comparable to the well documented phenomenon in equity markets, a similar home bias can also be found in corporate bond markets. I also investigate the hypothesis that investors can substitute direct investment in <b>foreign</b> corporate <b>bond</b> markets by holding US corporate <b>bonds</b> <b>issued</b> by <b>foreign</b> firms. Contrary to emerging market equity markets, I find that corporate <b>bonds</b> <b>issued</b> by <b>foreign</b> firms that trade in the US are insufficient to capture the gains of directly investment in the <b>foreign</b> corporate <b>bond</b> markets. The second part of this dissertation shifts focus and studies the potential welfare gains for countries to share consumption risks, when there is a small but persistent shock in the consumption growth rate. I find that a long run risk to their consumption growth has the ability to generate large welfare gains from international diversification. Further, when I estimate the model parameters using simulate method of moments, I find a large disparity in model parameter estimates across my sample of countries, which would lead to large departures in welfare gains away from a equal consumption share. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the Asian crisis, ASEAN 5 {{countries}} have expended considerable effort {{in trying to}} develop their domestic bond markets. Yet today these markets are not much larger, relative to GDP, {{than they were a}} decade before. How can we explain this? And does this mean that domestic markets have not, in fact, developed? The paper argues that bond market growth has been held back by a sharp fall in investment rates, which has left firms with little need for bond borrowing. Even so, markets have developed in other ways, {{to such an extent that}} substantial amounts of foreign portfolio investment have begun to flow into ASEAN 5 bonds. These developments have important ramifications. With the investor base growing and infrastructure investment likely to rise, ASEAN 5 bond markets could expand rapidly over the next decade, holding out the prospect that the region could finally achieve "twin engine" financial systems.
