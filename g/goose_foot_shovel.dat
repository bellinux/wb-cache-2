40|$|Preliminary {{results show}} that there is room for {{improvement}} within existing control methods of couch grass (Elymus repens (L.) Gould). It may be possible {{to reduce the number of}} stubble cultivations during autumn by timing the treatment, and to reduce the cultivation depth by using a <b>goose</b> <b>foot</b> cultivator (5 cm) instead of a disc cultivator (10 cm), without sacrificing couch grass control efficiency. The first year of the experiment, the use of a <b>goose</b> <b>foot</b> cultivator resulted in less nitrogen leaching than cultivation by disc. A reduced number of stubble cultivations potentially reduces nutrient loss, fuel consumption and the workload of the farmer. Our experiments with cover crops to control couch grass in cereals has yet to prove significant effects on couch grass control, but cover crops combined with <b>goose</b> <b>foot</b> hoeing did reduce nitrogen leaching by more than a third compared to cultivation by disc. Further data is necessary to see if the system can be used to effectively control couch grass without significant yield losses. Regardless, it can reduce nitrogen leaching and potentially provide other ecosystem services, e. g. control weeds other than couch grass. ...|$|R

5000|$|Although umlaut {{was not a}} {{grammatical}} process, umlauted vowels often {{serve to}} distinguish grammatical forms (and thus show similarities to ablaut when viewed synchronically), {{as can be seen}} in the English word man. In ancient Germanic, it and some other words had the plural suffix -iz, with the same vowel as the singular. As it contained an i, this suffix caused fronting of the vowel, and when the suffix later disappeared, the mutated vowel remained as the only plural marker: men. In English, such plurals are rare: man, woman, tooth, <b>goose,</b> <b>foot,</b> mouse, louse, brother (archaic or specialized plural in brethren), and cow (poetic and dialectal plural in kine). It also can be found in a few fossilized diminutive forms, such as kitten from cat and kernel from corn, and the feminine vixen from fox. Umlaut is conspicuous when it occurs in one of such a pair of forms, but there are many mutated words without an unmutated parallel form. Germanic actively derived causative weak verbs from ordinary strong verbs by applying a suffix, which later caused umlaut, to a past tense form. Some of these survived into modern English as doublets of verbs, including fell and set vs. fall (older past *fefall) and sit. Umlaut could occur in borrowings as well if stressed vowel was coloured by a subsequent front vowel, such as German Köln, [...] "Cologne", from Latin Colonia, or Käse, [...] "cheese", from Latin caseus.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{provides}} a detailed acoustic {{description of the}} phonetic variation and changes evident in the monophthongal vowel system of Coloured South African English in Cape Town. The changes are largely a result of South Africa's post-apartheid socio-educational reform. A detailed acoustic description highlights the most salient changes (compared with earlier reports of the variety), indicating {{the extent of the}} change amongst working-class and middle-class speakers. The fieldwork conducted for this study consists of sociolinguistic interviews, conducted with a total of 40 Coloured speakers (half male, half female) from both working-class and middle-class backgrounds. All speakers were young adults, born between 1983 and 1993, thus raised and schooled in a period of transition from apartheid to democracy. Each of the middle-class speakers had some experience of attending formerly exclusively White schools, giving them significant contact with White peers and teachers, while the educational careers of the working-class speakers exposed them almost solely to Coloured peers and educators. The acoustic data were processed using methods of Forced Alignment and automatic formant extraction – methods applied {{for the first time to}} any variety of South African English. The results of the analysis were found generally to support the findings of scholars who have documented this variety previously, with some notable exceptions amongst middle-class speakers. The changes are attributable to socio-educational change in the post-apartheid setting and the directionality of the changes approximate trends amongst White South African English speakers. The TRAP, <b>GOOSE</b> and <b>FOOT</b> lexical sets show most change: TRAP is lowering, while <b>GOOSE</b> and <b>FOOT</b> are fronting. Although the changes approximate the vowel quality used by White speakers, middle-class Coloured speakers use an intermediate value between White speakers and working-class Coloured speakers i. e. they have not fully adopted White norms for any of the vowel classes. Working-class speakers were found to have maintained the monophthongal vowel system traditionally used by Coloured speakers...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{spreading}} of slurry {{leads to}} the inevitable emission of ammonia into the environment. Injection of slurry on grassland reduces these emissions. However, injection of slurry by deep working injector tines with <b>goose</b> <b>foot</b> chisels (wings) requires high draught forces. This type of injection has {{the risk of the}} crop dying back under dry soil conditions and is not possible on all soil types. In recent years, new slurry application techniques for grassland have been developed that achieve a large reduction in emissions of ammonia, but require less draught force. These techniques include cutting a shallow slit in the sward, into which slurry is applied, and application of the slurry in bands on the soil surface using a trailing foot implement. In a series of experiments on sandy loam, day and peat soils, the draught force requirement of single elements of five new slurry application techniques was investigated. The application techniques were a trailed sliding foot element and four shallow injection elements: angled-disc coulters (double-disc opener), thick-disc coulter, flat disc coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter and knife coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter. The application technique, working depth and soil conditions had a significant influence on the draught force. For a working depth of 5 cm, the required draught forces per shallow injector element, measured in this experiment, were in the range of 202 - 706 N for a double-disc opener, 284 - 991 N for a thick-disc coulter, 361 - 1260 N for a flat-disc coulter plus injector and 389 - 1358 N for a knife coulter plus injector. The lowest draught forces occurred on peat soil and the highest forces on dry clay. The trailing foot required an average draught force of 39 N. The draught force of the trailing foot did not relate to the soil conditions but an effect of the grass sward condition was suggested. (C) 1998 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|R

40|$|The {{language}} {{policies in}} Malaysia, having been {{controlled by the}} ethnic Malays ever since Independence Day in 1957, have hence dictated which language influences each major ethnic group is exposed to. With the official language {{as well as the}} language of instruction in public schools being Malay, ethnic Malays who speak it as a first language (L 1) are typically monolingual speakers of Malay. The ethnic Chinese and Indians who usually speak Mandarin or Tamil as an L 1 respectively are typically bilingual or trilingual. These different language influences might play a role in how speakers of each ethnic group produce Malaysian English (MalE) monophthongs and diphthongs, and this study investigated what those influences might be in the form of vowel variations. This study extracted formant values in the Bark scale from recordings made of the participants reading 12 of Wells’ (1982) lexical sets: FLEECE, KIT, DRESS, TRAP, <b>GOOSE,</b> <b>FOOT,</b> THOUGHT, LOT, STRUT, NURSE, FACE, and GOAT. The formant values were used to plot vowel charts to facilitate comparisons among Malay-, Chinese-, and Indian-influenced MalE. It was found that Indian-influenced MalE (InMalE) varied the most from Malay-influenced MalE (MaMalE) and Chinese-influenced MalE (ChMalE) in their productions of the monophthongs KIT, DRESS, FOOT, LOT, and NURSE. MaMalE varied in FLEECE, and ChMalE varied in GOOSE. TRAP, THOUGHT, and STRUT exhibited no significant across-group variation. As for diphthongs, MaMalE did not diphthongize FACE. ChMalE’s FACE, on the other hand, moved higher and more backed, and InMalE’s moved higher and more fronted. For the diphthong GOAT, only InMalE varied their production by realizing GOAT as a monophthong. These variations in vowel production may involve the role of language policy in Malaysia as well as the power imbalance among ethnic groups. If more Indian Malaysians are now Dominant Users of English, they speak English as an L 1 and either Malay or an Indian language as their second language, in contrast to Malay Malaysians’ L 1 of Malay and Chinese Malaysians’ L 1 of a Chinese language. This difference, in combination with the power imbalance in Malaysia where the Malays hold the strongest political influence, with the Chinese not far behind, and the Indians largely ignored, might explain why InMalE varies the most from MaMalE and ChMalE. It might also explain why MaMalE and ChMalE exhibit fewer variations between each other. The study’s limitations are discussed and suggestions are provided for further research...|$|R

Playback of naturally recorded alarm and alert calls of the species was coupled with multiple harassment techniques to determine if this strategy would prove effective at removal of long-term resident geese from a 24 -ha business park in Dayton, Ohio. The study began 26 February 2002, following territorial establishment by the geese, and continued until the last few geese had abandoned the property as of 14 May 2002. Most geese present were reusing nest territories from previous years, and thus strong nest-site fidelity made these perhaps {{the most difficult of}} all geese to remove in a nonlethal manner.
