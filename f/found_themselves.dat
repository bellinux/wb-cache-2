5|$|Continuing their attack, the squadrons on {{the left}} of the Household Brigade then {{destroyed}} Aulard's brigade. Despite attempts to recall them, they continued past La Haye Sainte and <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> {{at the bottom of the}} hill on blown horses facing Schmitz's brigade formed in squares.|$|E
5|$|However, {{events in}} the world {{appeared}} to play into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War (1787–92) and the Austro-Turkish War (1787–91)); the Russians also <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War (1788–90)).|$|E
5|$|In the First Council of Dvin (506), the Armenian Church {{broke off}} from the rest of Christianity by rejecting the dual nature of Christ, which was agreed upon in the Council of Chalcedon of 451. Thus the Armenians <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> in direct {{confrontation}} with the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Justinian I persecuted the Monophysite Armenians, forcing them to leave Jerusalem.|$|E
50|$|Convers Avia is {{an airline}} based in Tver, Russia. It {{operates}} charter flights, mainly within Russia {{but also as}} far afield as ice breakers in Afghanistan and Norway. Its main base is Zmeevo Airport which the company <b>founded</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The family made {{grants to}} abbeys, notably to those they had <b>founded</b> <b>{{themselves}}</b> (the Saint-Pierre de Castillon monastery c.1035). After 1066, as Lucien Musset remarks, the Tosnys showed themselves especially liberal to their English fiefdoms but avoided diminishing their Norman lands.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 10 February, Japanese forces {{suffered}} their heaviest losses during the Battle of Singapore. While moving up the Kranji River, advance landing parties from the 4th Regiment of the Imperial Guard Division <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> under heavy fire from Australian machine gunners and mortar teams. They also <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> surrounded by oil slicks, which had been created by Allied personnel emptying the nearby Woodlands oil depot, to prevent its capture. A scenario feared by Yamashita came to pass by accident; the oil was set alight by Allied small arms fire, causing many Japanese soldiers to be burnt alive. Sustaining heavy losses, Nishimura requested permission to abandon the operation. However, Yamashita denied the request.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the members of the Ministerium {{intended}} for this to be a permanent break, or a temporary protest. Regardless, it became permanent when the officials at the next Gathering of the General Synod refused to admit the delegates from the Ministerium. Thus, the Ministerium <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> on their own.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 1944 Massachusetts and {{the other}} ships of TF 38 {{unexpectedly}} <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> in a fight for their lives when Typhoon Cobra overtook the force. At {{the time of the}} typhoon Massachusetts was sailing with the Third Fleet's Task Group 38.1 and reported one injured sailor and two planes lost {{as a result of the}} typhoon.|$|E
40|$|Religious {{movements}} {{are playing a}} new role of social consolidation in many African countries. In these contexts of “insecure modernization” 1 religious groups and images provide followers new bases for social solidarity, as well as identity and moral references. Similarly, new expressions of African Islam which, while <b>founding</b> <b>themselves</b> on the old tariqas, carry out modernizing transformations {{in an attempt to}} respond to contemporary situations and expectations. This is the case for the “eleven bead” variant of the Tidjani Sufi Order, whose spiritual centre is the “city” of Ramatoulaye in western Burkina Faso...|$|R
60|$|We {{will not}} pretend {{to decide the}} question. Alas! either {{construction}} was now equally unsuited to the family fortunes. Such changes {{had taken place in}} England since the Greshams had <b>founded</b> <b>themselves</b> that no savage could any longer in any way protect them; they must protect themselves like common folk, or live unprotected. Nor now was it necessary that any neighbour should shake in his shoes when the Gresham frowned. It would have been to be wished that the present Gresham himself could have been as indifferent to the frowns of some of his neighbours.|$|R
5000|$|As Rand's {{fiction and}} non-academic {{philosophical}} works became popular {{especially in the}} 1980s, her fans would often claim that attributes of these heroes could be <b>found</b> in <b>themselves,</b> or should be.|$|R
5|$|President Mugabe and the Zanu-PF party {{leadership}} <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> beset {{by a wide}} range of international sanctions. In 2002, the nation was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations due to the reckless farm seizures and blatant election tampering. The following year, Zimbabwean officials voluntarily terminated its Commonwealth membership.|$|E
5|$|The Dakota were {{hunters and}} gatherers and soon <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> in debt to fur traders. Pressed by a {{whooping}} cough outbreak, loss of buffalo, deer, and bear, {{and loss of}} forests to logging, in 1851 in the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, the Mdewakanton sold the remaining land west of the river, allowing settlement in 1852.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{effectively}} {{ended the}} dreadnought race, as all three countries suddenly <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> unable to acquire additional warships. After the conflict, the race never resumed, but many plans for post-war naval expansions and improvements were postulated by the Argentine, Brazilian, and Chilean governments.|$|E
50|$|Recommender {{systems are}} a useful {{alternative}} to search algorithms since they help users discover items {{they might not}} have <b>found</b> by <b>themselves.</b> Interestingly enough, recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non-traditional data.|$|R
50|$|The {{first thing}} they did was to form towns that were {{self-sufficient}} in the areas inhabited by the natives and {{a study of the}} Guaraní language they spoke to make a writing structure (because the Guaraní people did not write their language). The missioners not only imparted knowledge about religion, but also determined the rules of public order, culture, education and society, which had great influence in the later development of Paraguay. The natives, who were nomads and were not used to a structured life, <b>founded</b> <b>themselves</b> gathered in small communities in the forest. Near the Jesuit Missions were formed groups of 2000 or 3000 per town.|$|R

5|$|Zelda {{continued}} writing, selling several {{short stories}} and articles. She helped Scott write the play The Vegetable, but when it flopped the Fitzgeralds <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> in debt. Scott wrote short stories furiously to pay the bills, but became burned out and depressed. In April 1924, they left for Paris.|$|E
5|$|A year later, the Red Sox {{entered the}} final {{series of the}} season at Yankee Stadium needing only one win over the Yankees {{to advance to the}} World Series. The Red Sox <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> up by one game with two games left against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. The Sox lost 5–3 {{on the last day of}} the season after falling 5–4 the {{previous}} day, resulting in the Yankees winning their 16th American League pennant. The Yankees went on to defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1949 World Series for their 12th World Championship.|$|E
5|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.|$|E

50|$|Later, {{as part of}} the UNIKOM force {{deployed}} to Kuwait following the Gulf War the Bangladesh Army sent a mechanized infantry brigade (approximately 2,193 personnel). In 1994 1200 Bangladeshi peacekeepers <b>founded</b> <b>themselves</b> under siege by Bosnian Serbs in the Bosnia after replacing a French contingent during UNPROFOR operations. The Bangladeshi commander asked for NATO air cover which was not provided. This was in contrast to when the French UN peacekeepers were attacked and NATO responded by providing cover. Over a hundred peacekeepers died in the region including Bangladeshi soldiers. The Bangladeshi soldiers were under equipped. During the Rwandan Civil war it was alleged by the commander of UN forces in Rwanda General Roméo Dallaire that Bangladeshi peacekeepers sabotaged their own vehicles in order to avoid going on patrols.|$|R
60|$|Just then John Short came up. He {{had been}} to speak to his brother. Augusta being a novelist, and {{therefore}} a professional student of human physiognomy, was engaged in studying the legal types before her, which she <b>found</b> resolved <b>themselves</b> into two classes--the sharp, keen-faced class and the solid, heavy-jawed class.|$|R
5|$|Arsenal {{defeated}} Chelsea {{at home in}} {{the first}} weekend of October. The team <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> two goals down after 20 minutes, but a converted Dixon penalty and goals from Wright and Campbell turned the score around in their favour. Arsenal came away from Old Trafford with a point against league leaders Manchester United on 19 October 1991. After a midweek European football match, Arsenal beat Notts County by two goals, a result which moved them fourth in the table.|$|E
5|$|As for Edward II himself, his {{dependence}} on the Despensers grew only deeper, and their transgressions more severe. Lancaster's supporters (including Roger Mortimer, William Trussell and Robert de Holland) <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> systematically accused of false charges, being imprisoned and having their lands {{taken over by the}} Despensers. Mortimer and Trussell eventually fled to Paris where they were to be joined by Edward's estranged wife Isabella who was to become Mortimer's lover.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found {{it very difficult to}} rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} Union Brigade <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
5000|$|Irrawaddy {{dolphins}} eat {{fish and}} crustaceans and are rarely <b>found</b> by <b>themselves.</b> They are usually found in groups of around ten dolphins. [...] These dolphins swim rather slowly while scouting for areas. They will raise their heads above the water and continue to swim around to familiarize themselves with their surroundings.|$|R
50|$|Snobs can {{through time}} be <b>found</b> ingratiating <b>themselves</b> {{with a range}} of {{prominent}} groups - soldiers (Sparta, 400 BC), bishops (Rome, 1500), poets (Weimar, 1815), farmers (China, 1967) - for the primary interests of snobs is distinction, and as its definition changes, so, naturally and immediately, will the objects of the snob's admiration.|$|R
60|$|The bishop {{was anxious}} to be very clear. Things that had been shapelessly present in his mind now took form and <b>found</b> words for <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1974, the Cambodian army inventory included 241,630 rifles, 7,079 machine guns, 2,726 mortars, 20,481 grenade launchers, 304 recoilless rifles, 289 howitzers, 202 APCs, and 4,316 trucks. The Khmer Navy had 171 vessels; the Khmer Air Force had 211 aircraft, including 64 North American T-28s, 14 Douglas AC-47 gunships and 44 helicopters. American Embassy military personnel – who were only supposed to coordinate the arms aid program – sometimes <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> involved in prohibited advisory and combat tasks.|$|E
5|$|At {{various times}} during the program, NASA {{managers}} and personnel <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> limited in terms of resources and manpower, particularly as Phase Two geared up, and {{had a hard time}} getting anywhere with NASA administration. One particular area of contention was with crew assignments to missions. Many astronauts allege that the method of selection prevented the most skilled people from performing roles they were best-suited for.|$|E
5|$|By resubmitting the discredited treaty {{through a}} House-sponsored bill, the Tyler {{administration}} reignited sectional hostilities over Texas admission. Both northern Democratic and southern Whig Congressmen had been bewildered by local political agitation {{in their home}} states during the 1844 presidential campaigns. Now, northern Democrats <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> vulnerable to charges of appeasement of their southern wing if they capitulated to Tyler's slavery expansion provisions. On the other hand, Manifest Destiny enthusiasm in the north placed politicians under pressure to admit Texas immediately to the Union.|$|E
50|$|Igneous pyroxenites {{are closely}} allied to gabbros and norites, {{from which they}} differ {{by the absence of}} feldspar, and to peridotites, which are {{distinguished}} from them by containing more than 40% olivine. This connection is indicated also by their mode of occurrence, for they usually accompany masses of gabbro and peridotite and seldom are <b>found</b> by <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like {{much of the}} {{surrounding}} bodies of water, Fishers Brook is home to many species of frog, toad, and salamander, as well as newts and mudpuppies.

Many birds and mammals also live along the brook.|$|R
50|$|They are {{primarily}} nocturnal, {{especially during the}} summer months when it is too hot for them to be active, but they will sometimes be <b>found</b> out sunning <b>themselves.</b>|$|R
