25|$|In 1996, Shackley {{announced}} work {{based on}} a study of Ishi's projectile points {{and those of the}} northern tribes. He had found that points made by Ishi were not typical of those recovered from historical Yahi sites. Because Ishi's production was more typical of points of the Nomlaki or Wintu tribes and markedly dissimilar to those of Yahi, Shackley suggested that Ishi may have been only half Yahi and of mixed ancestry, related to another of the tribes. He based his conclusion on a study of the points that Ishi had made compared to others held by the museum from the Yahi, Nomlaki and Wintu cultures. Among Ishi's techniques was the use of what is now known in flintknapping circles as an Ishi stick, used to run long pressure flakes. As it was a traditional technique of the Nomlaki and Wintu tribes, the finding suggests Ishi may have learned the skill directly from a male relative <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> tribes. Also small groups, they lived close to the Yahi lands and were traditional competitors and enemies of the Yahi.|$|E
25|$|The first Australian Club Lacrosse Championships was contested in Adelaide on 7 June 2008. The women's {{championship}} was {{won by the}} Newport Ladies' Lacrosse Club of Victoria, {{while the}} men's championship was won by the Woodville Lacrosse Club of South Australia. The success of the inaugural event {{has led to the}} club national championships returning in 2009 with an expanded format, involving the premiers of the three major lacrosse playing states, plus a wildcard entry <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> states to create a final four format. Due to the moving of the Nationals to the June long weekend, the 2013 Championships were held on 5 and 6 October 2013. Despite being held {{after the end of the}} 2013 season, it featured the respective state premiers of the 2012 season. Wembley declined the invitation to send its women's team, while Williamstown's men's team were a last minute withdrawal from the men's tournament. The women's event was a two-team affair with a single championship match, Brighton (SA) claiming its fourth successive Australian Club Championship with a victory over Newport (Vic). SA's Glenelg Lacrosse Club filled the vacancy left by Williamstown (Vic), competing with local rivals Brighton and WA's Bayswater and Wembley Lacrosse Clubs for the men's title. Bayswater became the first team from Western Australia to win the Australian Club Championship in defeating Brighton.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the second}} half of the century, Brasenose {{remained}} around the fourth largest college of the University behind Christ Church and Exeter; the proportion of students and Fellows from lower income groups was much higher than most other colleges, having improved during {{the second half}} of the century. Entrants were also heavily biased towards those from Cheshire and Lancashire: two-thirds of Oxford entrants from those counties went to Brasenose in the first half of the century; three-quarters by its end. Indeed, by that time, the majority of Brasenose student hailed <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> two north-western counties, assisted by the localised scholarships. In 1679, the college received an endowment from Sarah Seymour, Duchess of Somerset to fund four [...] "Somerset" [...] scholars, to be drawn from a free school of Manchester. She also donated further money for additional scholarships (drawn alternately from Manchester, Marlborough, and Hereford) upon her death in 1686.|$|E

A number of scenes in the episode were removed before broadcast and one, the reappearance of Ernie the Giant Chicken, had originally been set to broadcast in [...] "The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire". The scene was moved to this episode because [...] "The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire" [...] already contained a lengthy fight sequence and overran its time allowance. Several of the removed scenes focused on gags showing Peter and his friends attempting to rehabilitate Quagmire, one of which saw Brian Griffin transporting a fork-lift truck load of porn magazines away from Quagmire's house. Since the episode aired, a selection of action figures have been created of Peter acting as Gary, The No Trash Cougar.|$|E

2500|$|... "Superheterodyne" [...] is a {{contraction}} of [...] "supersonic heterodyne", where [...] "supersonic" [...] indicates frequencies above {{the range of}} human hearing. The word heterodyne {{is derived from the}} Greek roots hetero- [...] "different", and -dyne [...] "power". In radio applications the term derives from the [...] "heterodyne detector" [...] pioneered by Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden in 1905, describing his proposed method of producing an audible signal from the Morse code transmissions of the new continuous wave transmitters. With the older spark gap transmitters then in use, the Morse code signal consisted of short bursts of a heavily modulated carrier wave, which could be clearly heard as a series of short chirps or buzzes in the receiver's headphones. However, the signal from a continuous wave transmitter did not have any such inherent modulation and Morse Code <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> would only be heard as a series of clicks or thumps. Fessenden's idea was to run two Alexanderson alternators, one producing a carrier frequency 3kHz higher than the other. In the receiver's detector the two carriers would beat together to produce a 3kHz tone thus in the headphones the Morse signals would then be heard as a series of 3kHz beeps. For this he coined the term [...] "heterodyne" [...] meaning [...] "generated by a difference" [...] (in frequency).|$|E
