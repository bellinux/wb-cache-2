The only notable incident for the college in this period, {{during the reign of}} George <b>I,</b> <b>happened</b> in 1727 when an impostor called Robert Harman pretended to be a herald. The knave was prosecuted by the College in the county of Suffolk, and was sentenced to be pilloried in several market towns on public market days and afterwards to be imprisoned and pay a fine. This hefty sentence was executed, proving that the rights of the College were still respected. In 1737, during the reign of George II the College petitioned for another charter, to reaffirm their rights and remuneration; this effort proved unsuccessful. Apart from these events the influence of the College was greatly diminished.|$|E

500|$|According to McDougall, another {{director}} was originally hired {{to work on}} the episode but quit after learning casting would be a group decision. Filming took place over thirteen days in March 2004. During filming, McDougall suggested removing references to pop culture from the script to ensure the pilot had [...] "more of a timeless feel." [...] ABC picked up the series for 13 episodes on May 18, 2004. In June, ABC called for three starring cast members to be recast. Jesse Metcalfe replaced Searles as John Rowland, as producers wanted to add more sexual appeal to the role [...] "to justify why (Gabrielle) was having an affair." [...] Metcalfe had previously read for the role during the initial casting process. The role of Rex Van de Kamp was given to Steven Culp, who was Cherry's first choice for the part but was unavailable when the original pilot was filmed. Brenda Strong took over the role of Mary Alice, as producers thought that Lee was not right for the part. Strong commented on the casting change for her character, explaining, [...] "I think it was a conceptual shift... There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be chocolate." [...] Scenes featuring the original actors were refilmed with their replacements, however Burke and Searles are present in the background of some scenes in the final cut of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1907, Cobb reached {{first and}} then stole second, third and home. He {{accomplished}} the feat four more times during his career. He finished the 1907 season with a league-leading [...]350 batting average, 212 hits, 49 steals and 119 runs batted in (RBI). At age 20, he was the youngest player to win a batting championship and held this record until 1955, when fellow Detroit Tiger Al Kaline won the batting title twelve days younger than Cobb when he did it. Reflecting on his career in 1930, two years after retiring, he told Grantland Rice, [...] "The biggest thrill I ever got came {{in a game against}} the Athletics in 1907 ... The Athletics had us beaten, with Rube Waddell pitching. [...] They were two runs ahead in the 9th inning, when <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to hit a home run that tied the score. This game went 17 innings to a tie, and a few days later, we clinched our first pennant.

2500|$|When the Peripatetic philosopher Eudemus {{became ill}} with quartan fever, Galen {{felt obliged to}} treat him [...] "since he was my teacher and <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to live nearby." [...] Galen wrote: [...] "I return {{to the case of}} Eudemus. He was {{thoroughly}} attacked by the three attacks of quartan ague, and the doctors had given him up, as it was now mid-winter." [...] Some Roman physicians criticized Galen for his use of the prognosis in his treatment of Eudemus. This practice conflicted with the then-current standard of care, which relied upon divination and mysticism. Galen retaliated against his detractors by defending his own methods. Garcia-Ballester quotes Galen as saying: [...] "In order to diagnose, one must observe and reason. This was the basis of his criticism of the doctors who proceeded alogos and askeptos." [...] However, Eudemus warned Galen that engaging in conflict with these physicians could lead to his assassination. [...] "Eudemus said this, and more to the same effect; he added that if they were not able to harm me by unscrupulous conduct they would proceed to attempts at poisoning. Among other things he told me that, some ten years before, a young man had come to the city and had given, like me practical demonstrations of the resources of our art; this young man was put to death by poison, together with two servants who accompanied him." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{work was}} set aside until 1815 when Coleridge {{compiled}} manuscripts of his poems for a collection titled Sibylline Leaves. The poem remained buried in obscurity until a 10 April 1816 meeting between Coleridge and Lord Byron, who persuaded Coleridge to publish Christabel and [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] as fragments. Leigh Hunt, the poet and essayist, witnessed {{the event and}} wrote, [...] "He recited his 'Kubla Khan' one morning to Lord Byron, in his Lordship's house in Piccadilly, when <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be in another room. I remember the other's coming away from him, highly struck with his poem, and saying how wonderfully he talked. This was the impression of everyone who heard him." [...] Byron arranged for John Murray to publish the poem with Christabel and [...] "The Pains of Sleep" [...] along with prefaces to the works. A contract was drawn up on 12 April 1816 for 80 pounds. Charles Lamb, poet and friend of Coleridge, witnessed Coleridge's work towards publishing the poem and wrote to Wordsworth: [...] "Coleridge is printing Xtabel by Lord Byron's recommendation to Murray, with {{what he calls a}} vision of Kubla Khan – which said vision he repeats so enchantingly that it irradiates & brings Heaven & Elysian bowers into my parlour while he sings or says it". Coleridge stayed in London to work on the poem and also to try and break his opium addiction. However, not everyone was happy with the idea of the poem's being published, as Coleridge's wife, who was not with him, wrote to Thomas Poole, [...] "Oh! when will he ever give his friends anything but pain? he has been so unwise as to publish his fragments of 'Christabel' & 'Kubla-Khan' ... we were all sadly vexed when we read the advertisement of these things." ...|$|E

Proponents of polygenism opposed unity, but the gradual transition from one race to another confused them {{when they tried to}} decide how many human races should count as species: Louis Agassiz said eight, but Morton said twenty-two. Darwin commented that the [...] "question whether mankind consists of one or several species has of late years been much agitated by anthropologists, who are divided into two schools of monogenists and polygenists." [...] The latter had to [...] "look at species either as separate creations or as in some manner distinct entities". but those accepting evolution [...] "will feel no doubt that all the races of man are descended from a single primitive stock". Although races differed considerably, they also shared so many features [...] "that it is extremely improbable that they should have been independently acquired by aboriginally distinct species or races." [...] He drew on his memories of Jemmy Button and John Edmonstone to emphasise [...] "the numerous points of mental similarity between the most distinct races of man. The American aborigines, Negroes and Europeans differ as much from each other in mind as any three races that can be named; yet I was incessantly struck, whilst living with the Fuegians on board the Beagle, with the many little traits of character, shewing how similar their minds were to ours; and so it was with a full-blooded negro with whom <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> once to be intimate."

If <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered.

2500|$|From 1999 onwards, {{a renewed}} process was set into motion by the Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Pashtun Abdul Haq to unite all the ethnicities of Afghanistan. While Massoud united the Tajiks, Hazara and Uzbeks {{as well as}} some Pashtun {{commander}}s under his United Front command, the famed Pashtun commander Abdul Haq received increasing numbers of defecting Pashtun Taliban as [...] "Taliban popularity trended downward". Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king Zahir Shah. International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which Pulitzer Prize winner Steve Coll referred to as the [...] "grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance", said, [...] "It's crazy that you have this today ... Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara ... They were all ready to buy in to the process ... to work under the king's banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan." [...] Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert Peter Tomsen wrote: [...] "The ‘Lion of Kabul’ [...] and the ‘Lion of Panjshir’ ... Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan’s three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun—non-Pashtun, north-south divide." [...] The most senior Hazara and Uzbek leader were also part of the process. In late 2000, Massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in Northern Afghanistan to discuss, among other things, [...] "a Loya Jirga, or a traditional council of elders, to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan". [...] That part of the Pashtun-Tajik-Hazara-Uzbek peace plan did eventually materialize. An account of the meeting by author and journalist Sebastian Junger says: [...] "In 2000, when I was there ... <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to be there in a very interesting time. ... Massoud brought together Afghan leaders from all ethnic groups. They flew from London, Paris, the USA, all parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India. He brought them all into the northern area where he was.

2500|$|He aroused much {{controversy}} by his {{series of three}} pictures: firstly, of a Roman execution (the Crucifixion by the Romans (1887)); secondly, [...] "Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English" [...] depicting sepoys being blown from cannons; and, thirdly, of the execution of Nihilists in St Petersburg. His picture Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English depicted executions carried out by tying victims to the barrels of guns. Vereshchagin's detractors argued that such executions had only occurred in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but the painting depicted modern soldiers of the 1880s, implying that the practice was then current. Because of its photographic style, the painting appeared to present itself as an impartial record of a real event. In the Magazine of Art in December 1887, Vereshchagin defended himself by saying {{that if there were}} another rebellion then the British would use this method again.By the late 19th century, Vereshchagin had gained popularity, not only in Russia, but also abroad and his name never left the pages of the European and American press. From his earliest works, unlike most contemporary battle pieces depicting war as a kind of parade, Vereshchagin graphically depicted the horrors of war. [...] "I loved the sun all my life, and wanted to paint sunshine. When <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to see warfare and say what I thought about it, I rejoiced that I would be able to devote myself to the sun once again. But the fury of war continued to pursue me," [...] Vereshchagin wrote. One day, in 1882, Vereshchagin’s exhibition in Berlin was visited by German Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. Vereshchagin brought Moltke to his painting The Apotheosis of War. The picture evoked a sort of confusion in the Field Marshal. After his visit to the exhibition, Moltke issued an order forbidding German soldiers to visit it. The Austrian war minister did the same. He also declined the artist's offer to let Austrian officers see his pictures free of charge at the 1881 exhibition in Vienna.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2009, Chakraverti {{collaborated with}} filmmaker Anjan Dutt and Sarika {{to make a}} film called The Loving Doll, with the story taken from Sacred Evil again. It will be filmed in Hindi with bits of English. Sarika plays the central {{character}} of a middle-aged woman obsessed about losing her looks. The story revolves around a married couple beset with personal problems, triggered by a doll owned by the wife. Charaverti said: [...] "After the film Sacred Evil, I have been approached by several directors for another film but the inspiration was not there. This time around there was a synchronicity— Sarika phoned me to ask if I was thinking of another film. She has long wanted to play the woman in The Loving Doll [...] Then <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> to see Madly Bangalee, and liked Anjan’s work very much. I think he has the touch {{to be able to handle}} the subject of The Loving Doll. So I contacted him and he was very interested in the project. Though he works in a very different genre from mine, I think there is empathy between his work and mine." [...] Chakraverti also said that she may play the part of a healer in the film, [...] "It’s the director’s prerogative. We will do what is best for the film." [...] In April 2010, ETV Bangla created a serial called Dibaratrir Galpo, which was based on Beloved Witch. The plot of Dibaratrir Galpo, directed by Tathagata Banerjee, centres around a dispute between two aristocratic Bengali families, but the lead character (played by Sudipta Chakraborty) was shown as a follower of Wicca who learns to develop her psychic power and uses it to counter the machinations of her enemies. Chakraverti appeared on the commercials for the serial because she felt that her deglamorised presence helped audiences in the suburbs see elderly women, who are often branded as witches, in a positive light. [...] "I felt that the story of Dibaratrir Galpo would take to esoteric ideas very well. It has a women-oriented theme and it will show how the negative aspects of the esoteric can be countered." ...|$|E
