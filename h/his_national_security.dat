5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to <b>his</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E

25|$|In {{retaliation}} for the attacks, France launched an airstrike in the Beqaa Valley against alleged Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) positions. President Reagan assembled <b>his</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> team and planned to target the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek, Lebanon, which housed Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) believed to be training Hezbollah militants. A joint American–French air assault on the camp where the bombing was planned was also approved by Reagan and Mitterrand. U.S. Defense Secretary Weinberger lobbied successfully against the mission, {{because at the time}} it was not certain that Iran was behind the attack.|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{to place}} more {{diplomatic}} {{pressure on the}} Soviet Union, American president Richard Nixon sent <b>his</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> advisor Henry Kissinger on two trips to the People's Republic of China in July and October 1971 (the first of which was made in secret via Pakistan) to confer with Premier Zhou Enlai, then in charge of Chinese foreign policy. His trips {{paved the way for}} the groundbreaking 1972 summit between Nixon, Zhou, and Communist Party of China Chairman Mao Zedong, as well as the formalization of relations between the two countries, ending 23 years of diplomatic isolation and mutual hostility in favor of a tacit strategic anti-Soviet alliance between China and the United States.|$|E

Ramos, along with the Philippines' 20th Battalion Combat Team and the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea (PEFTOK), fought in the Korean War. He was an Infantry Reconnaissance Platoon Leader. Ramos {{was one of the}} heroes of the Battle of Hill Eerie, where he led his platoon to sabotage the enemy in Hill Eerie. He was also present in the Vietnam War as a non-combat civil military engineer and Chief of Staff of the Philippine Civil Action Group (PHILCAG).

25|$|The US {{government}} {{stood by}} its old ally Pakistan both politically and materially. US President Richard Nixon and <b>his</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Advisor Henry Kissinger feared Soviet expansion into South and Southeast Asia. Pakistan {{was a close}} ally of the People's Republic of China, with whom Nixon had been negotiating a rapprochement and which he intended to visit in February 1972. Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would mean total Soviet domination of the region, {{and that it would}} seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China. To demonstrate to China the bona fides of the United States as an ally, and in direct violation of the US Congress-imposed sanctions on Pakistan, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan and routed them through Jordan and Iran, while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan. The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the genocidal activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan, most notably the Blood telegram.|$|E
25|$|This {{attack was}} {{unusual in the}} ongoing Mexican Drug War (2006–present) because large scale single-attacks against Mexico's {{security}} forces were uncommon. Attacks against security forces usually took place because organized crime members were being pursued and wanted to escape. The planned nature of this attack highlighted that organized crime military tactics were advanced and reaching new levels. In addition, though shootings between criminal groups and law enforcement were common, it was rare for criminal groups to come off victorious in gunfights. This attack was the largest death toll on law enforcement's side since 2009. Because of the one-sided death toll on the police's side, the ambush garnered international attention. Jalisco {{was one of the}} four states in Mexico that President Enrique Peña Nieto (2012–2018) considered a priority for <b>his</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> initiative. Between March 2013 and April 2015, at least 70 government officials were killed in Jalisco. According to official reports from the Mexican government, there were 1,025 homicides linked to organized crime in Jalisco in 2014. This was lower than the year before, which totaled 1,485. These numbers are considerably higher than 2009, when Jalisco reported 679 homicides.|$|E

500|$|Parts of the Soviet {{military}} establishment {{were opposed to}} any sort of active Soviet military presence in Afghanistan, believing that the Soviet Union should leave Afghan politics alone. President Carter, following the advice of <b>his</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, denounced the intervention, describing it as the [...] "most serious danger to peace since 1945". The U.S. stopped all grain exports to the Soviet Union and boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. The Soviet Union responded by boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|President Reagan professed that he {{was unaware}} of the plot's existence. He opened his own {{investigation}} and appointed two Republicans and one Democrat (John Tower, Brent Scowcroft and Edmund Muskie, known as the [...] "Tower Commission") to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible. A separate report by Congress concluded that [...] "If the president did not know what <b>his</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> advisers were doing, he should have." [...] Reagan's popularity declined from 67% to 46% in less than a week, the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president. The scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within Reagan's staff, and eleven convictions.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{laid the}} groundwork for his {{overture}} to China even before he became president, writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election: [...] "There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation."

[...] With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir—border clashes between the two took place during Nixon's first year in office—Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations. [...] A breakthrough came in early 1971, when Chairman Mao invited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players.

500|$|In January 1987, Congress {{announced}} it was opening {{an investigation into the}} Iran–Contra affair. Depending upon one's political perspective, the Congressional investigation into the Iran–Contra affair was either an attempt by the legislative arm to gain control over an out-of-control executive arm, a partisan [...] "witch hunt" [...] by the Democrats against a Republican administration or a feeble effort by Congress that did far too little to rein in the [...] "imperial presidency" [...] that had run amok by breaking numerous laws. The Democratic-controlled United States Congress issued its own report on November 18, 1987, stating that [...] "If the president did not know what <b>his</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> advisers were doing, he should have". The congressional report wrote that the president bore [...] "ultimate responsibility" [...] for wrongdoing by his aides, and his administration exhibited [...] "secrecy, deception and disdain for the law". It also read that [...] "the central remaining question {{is the role of the}} President in the Iran–Contra affair. On this critical point, the shredding of documents by Poindexter, North and others, and the death of Casey, leave the record incomplete".|$|E
500|$|In particular, Soviet–First World {{relations}} deteriorated {{when the}} US President Jimmy Carter, following {{the advice of}} <b>his</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, denounced the 1979 Soviet intervention in Afghanistan (see Soviet–Afghan relations) and described it as the [...] "most serious danger to peace since 1945". The United States stopped all grain export to the Soviet Union and persuaded US athletes not to enter the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. The Soviet Union responded by boycotting the next Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles. The détente policy collapsed. When Ronald Reagan succeeded Carter as US president in 1981, he promised {{a sharp increase in}} US defense spending and a more aggressively anti-Soviet foreign policy. This caused alarm in Moscow, with the Soviet media accusing him of [...] "warmongering" [...] and [...] "mistakenly believing that stepping up the arms race will bring peace to the world". General Nikolai Ogarkov also commented that too many Soviet citizens had begun believing that any war was bad and peace at any price was good, and that better political education was necessary to inculcate a [...] "class" [...] point of view in world affairs.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{laid the}} groundwork for his {{overture}} to China before he became president, writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election: [...] "There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation." [...] Assisting him in this venture was <b>his</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Advisor and future Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, with whom the President worked closely, bypassing Cabinet officials. With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir—border clashes between the two took place during Nixon's first year in office—Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations. A breakthrough came in early 1971, when Chairman Mao invited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players. Nixon followed up by sending Kissinger to China for clandestine meetings with Chinese officials. On July 15, 1971, it was simultaneously announced by Beijing and by Nixon (on television and radio) that the President would visit China the following February. The announcements astounded the world. The secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact.|$|E

500|$|Starting with {{information}} received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence {{over the next}} several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area [...] from Islamabad. CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011. Meeting with <b>his</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a [...] "surgical raid" [...] to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs. The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound. DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse, which was buried at sea several hours later. Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square. Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and from many countries around the world.|$|E
500|$|In March 1971, {{the resentment}} against Gorton {{came to a}} head when a {{confidence}} vote in the Liberal caucus resulted in a tie. [...] Declaring that this was a sign he no longer had the confidence of the party, Gorton resigned, and William McMahon was elected his successor. With the Liberals in turmoil, Whitlam and the ALP sought to gain public trust as a credible government-in-waiting. The party's actions, such as its abandonment of the White Australia policy, gained favourable media attention. The Labor leader flew to Papua New Guinea and pledged himself to the independence of what was then an Australian possession. In 1971, Whitlam flew to Beijing and met with Chinese officials, including Zhou Enlai. McMahon attacked Whitlam for the visit and claimed that the Chinese had manipulated him. This attack backfired when US President Richard Nixon announced that he would visit China the following year. <b>His</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Advisor, Henry Kissinger, visited Beijing between 9–11 July (less than a week after Whitlam's visit of 4–6 July), and (unknown to Whitlam) some of Kissinger's staff had actually been in Beijing preparing for Kissinger's visit {{at the same time as}} the Labor delegation. According to Whitlam biographer Jenny Hocking, the incident transformed Whitlam into an international statesman, while McMahon was seen as reacting defensively to Whitlam's foreign policy ventures. Other errors by McMahon, such as a confused ad-lib speech while visiting Washington, and a statement to Indonesia's President Suharto that Australia was a [...] "west European nation", also damaged the government.|$|E
