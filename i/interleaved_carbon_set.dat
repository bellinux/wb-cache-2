40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} attributes of proton therapy and carbon ion therapy {{is the ability of}} these charged particles to spare tissue distal to the targeted tumor. This significantly reduces normal tissue toxicity and has the potential to translate to a wider therapeutic index. Although, in general, particle therapy also reduces dose to the proximal tissues, particularly {{in the vicinity of the}} target, dose to the skin and to other very superficial tissues tends to be higher than that of megavoltage x-rays. The methods presented here, namely <b>Interleaved</b> <b>carbon</b> minibeams and Radiosurgery with arrays of proton and light ion minibeams, both utilize beams segmented into arrays of parallel minibeams of about 0. 3 mm incident beam size. These minibeam arrays spare tissues, as demonstrated by synchrotron x-ray experiments. An additional feature of particle minibeams is their gradual broadening due to multiple Coulomb scattering as they penetrate tissues. In the case of <b>interleaved</b> <b>carbon</b> minibeams, which do not broaden much, two arrays of planar carbon minibeams that remain parallel at target depth, are aimed at the target from 90 º angles and made to interleave at the target to produce a solid radiation field within the target. As a result the surrounding tissues are exposed only to individual carbon minibeam arrays and are therefore spared. The method was used in four-directional geometry at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory to ablate a 6. 5 -mm target in a rabbit brain at a single exposure with 40 Gy physical absorbed dose. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and histology six month later showed very focal target necrosis with nearly no damage to the surrounding brain. As for minibeams of protons and light ions, for which the minibeam broadening is substantial, measurements at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and Monte Carlo simulations showed that the broadening minibeams will merge with their neighbors at a certain tissue depth to produce a solid beam to treat the target. The resulting sparing of proximal normal tissue allows radiosurgical ablative treatments with smaller impact on the skin and shallow tissues. This report describes these two methods and discusses their potential clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (CFRP) composites possess {{many advantages}} for aircraft structures over conventional aluminum alloys: light weight, higher strength- and stiffness-to-weight ratio, and low life-cycle maintenance costs. However, {{the relatively low}} thermal and electrical conductivities of CFRP composites are deficient in providing structural safety under certain operational conditions such as lightning strikes. One possible solution to these issues is to <b>interleave</b> <b>carbon</b> nanotube (CNT) sheets between conventional carbon fiber (CF) composite layers. However, the thermal and electrical properties of the orthotropic hybrid CNT/CF composites have not been fully understood. In this study, hybrid CNT/CF polymer composites were fabricated by interleaving layers of CNT sheets with Hexcel (Registered Trademark) IM 7 / 8852 prepreg. The CNT sheets were infused with a 5 % solution of a compatible epoxy resin prior to composite fabrication. Orthotropic thermal and electrical conductivities of the hybrid polymer composites were evaluated.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the transition radiation detector (TRD) of the PAMELA telescope has been studied using beam test data and simulation tools. PAMELA is a satellite-borne magnetic spectrometer designed to measure particles and antiparticles spectra in cosmic rays.

The TRD is composed of 9 planes of straw tubes, <b>interleaved</b> with <b>carbon</b> fiber radiators. A prototype of the detector has been exposed to particle beams of electrons, pions and muons of various momenta at the CERN-PS and SPS accelerator facilities.

In future research, the manufacturing process of the composites will be investigated to improve the breakdown strength in order to obtain high energy density in addition to preserving the outstanding mechanical properties. This new multifunctional material will open a door to the development of advanced structures that distribute energy storage throughout the composite thus eliminating their current ad hoc implementation...|$|R

This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a systematic literature review of publications in the area of carbon management in the logistics and transportation sector between the years 2000 and 2015. The review provides insight into the critical themes and challenges of carbon management in the logistics and transportation sector according to five identified key topics: carbon strategy, carbon risk assessments, <b>carbon</b> target <b>setting,</b> <b>carbon</b> reduction initiatives, and carbon performance and reporting.
