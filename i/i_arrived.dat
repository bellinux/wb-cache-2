5|$|After {{several hundred}} years of no {{permanent}} habitation, the second wave of migration arrived from Canada, bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland. The first wave of immigrants, known as Dorset <b>I,</b> <b>arrived</b> around 500 BCE, inhabiting the region for the next 700 years. The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people, although no artifacts have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut, and few artifacts from the era of Dorset I have been uncovered in archaeological sites, with the finds often limited to harpoon heads and numerous animal bones. The largest number of Dorset culture artifacts can be found further north in the Disko Bay region, while the further to the south, the poorer the finds, disappearing completely {{on the coast of}} Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland.|$|E

25|$|After having {{achieved}} this victory, Elisabeth did not stay to enjoy it, but instead {{embarked on a}} life of travel, and saw little of her children. “If <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> at a place and knew that I could never leave it again, the whole stay would become hell despite being paradise”. After her son's death, she commissioned the building of a palace in Corfu which she named the Achilleion, after Homer's hero Achilles in The Iliad. After her death, the building was purchased by German Emperor Wilhelm II. Later it was acquired by the nation of Greece and converted to a museum.|$|E
25|$|As Mk. <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> in the field, {{a number}} of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the transmitter and receiver, the small antenna used to trigger the time base would see too small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as cable locking. Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved signal-to-noise ratio, a voltage regulator was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex grounding system for the potentiometer with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|E

25|$|Between 7 and 12 June 1713, {{the fleet}} was visited by Peter I, who brought 8 ships and a {{battalion}} of Preobrazhensky Regiment. Peter stayed on Poltava and inspected the fleet. On 2 July 1713, a Swedish squadron of Vice Admiral Lile (9 ships and two frigates) arrived to Helsinki, which was besieged by Russian troops. On 5 July, 3 more Swedish ships of the line blockaded Revel (now Tallinn) which then hosted five Russian warships recently purchased abroad. After receiving the news, on 4 July Peter <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> in Kronstadt and raised his flag on Poltava. On 7 July, he ordered Cruys with his squadron to relieve the siege of Revel. On 9 July, together with 12 other ships Poltava left Kronstadt heading for the Revel. In the evening of 10 July {{the vanguard of the}} squadron spotted the three Swedish ships at the island of Gogland and began chasing them. However, the next morning the three Russian front ships, Vyborg, Riga and frigate Esperanza run aground and the Swedish ships managed to join the squadron of Lile at Helsinki. Poltava was part of the vanguard, but avoided being stranded. On 16 July, it reached Revel, joined the Russian ships there, and together they returned to Kronstadt on 25 July.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. <b>I</b> <b>arrived,</b> however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E
500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand {{what they were talking}} about. And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini was the first one who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E

500|$|... c: Ibrahim Pasha presided the Regency Council {{that was}} formed on 15 April 1848 to run Egypt due to Muhammad Ali Pasha's declining {{physical}} and mental health. Legal documents were still written in the latter's name; however, Ibrahim Pasha became the de facto ruler of the country from this moment on. On 20 July of the same year, an extraordinary envoy of Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> in Alexandria with the firman by which the Porte recognized Ibrahim Pasha as Egypt's new wāli. The latter then travelled to Istanbul, where his investiture took place on 25 August {{in the presence of}} the Ottoman Sultan. However, his reign was very brief, and his death occurred shortly after his return to Cairo. He died on 10 November 1848 due to ill health, thus predeceasing his father.|$|E
500|$|Pick {{introduced}} a common advertising policy, improving {{the appearance of}} stations by standardising poster sizes, limiting the number used and controlling their positioning. Before he took control of advertising, posters had been stuck up on any available surface on station buildings and platform walls in a crowded jumble of shapes and sizes that led to complaints from passengers {{that it was difficult}} to find the station name. Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen. The Underground's own promotional posters were smaller, using single or paired double royal sheets, and were arranged separately from the commercial advertising. Pick described the process: [...] "after many fumbling experiments <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> at some notion of how poster advertising ought to be. Everyone seemed quite pleased and I got a reputation that really sprang out of nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|After World War II ended, {{his father}} {{stayed in the}} Navy, {{sometimes}} working political liaison posts. [...] The family settled in Northern Virginia, and McCain attended the educationally stronger St. Stephen's School in Alexandria from 1946 to 1949. [...] To his family, McCain had long been quiet, dependable, and courteous, while at St. Stephen's he began to develop an unruly, defiant streak. Another two years were then spent following his father to naval stations; altogether he attended about twenty schools during his youth. He was frequently disciplined in school for fighting. He later wrote, [...] "The repeated farewells to friends rank among the saddest regrets of a childhood constantly disrupted by the demands of my father's career... At each new school <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> eager to make, by means of my insolent attitude, new friends {{to compensate for the}} loss of others. At each new school I grew more determined to assert my crude individualism. At each new school I became a more unrepentant pain in the neck." ...|$|E

500|$|The second {{investigations}} performed between 1981 and 1984 by the legislature, the U.S. Justice Department, and {{the local}} press uncovered a plot to assassinate the activists and a possible, though not conclusive, conspiracy to cover-up these actions. During interviews of the Senate Investigations Committee in 1983, officer Miguel Cartagena Flores, a detective in the Intelligence Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department, testified: “When <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> at the scene I saw 4 police officers aiming their guns at the two activists who were kneeling before them. I turned my eyes away and heard 5 gunshots." [...] Cartagena, who was offered immunity for his testimony, added that several hours before the shooting, he and other officers were told by Col. Angel Perez Casillas, commander of the Intelligence Division, that “these terrorists should not come down (from the mountain) alive.” His testimony was corroborated by officer Carmelo Cruz who, {{although he did not}} witness the fatal shooting, confirmed many details provided by Cartagena when also granted immunity.|$|E

500|$|Mercedes-Benz withdrew {{entirely from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of 1932 {{in the face of the}} {{economic}} crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, [...] "I can still see the expression on [...] Campari's face when <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> back at the factory. He smiled to himself as if to say, Well, didn't I tell you that one wasn't going to make it?" ...|$|E

[...] Following his contract announcement, Rosický scored an injury time equaliser in a 2–2 draw at Emirates Stadium against Everton. His third goal of the season came against Bolton, Rosický scoring Arsenal's first goal {{at the end of the}} first half after Bolton had taken an early two-goal lead. Arsenal went on to score three goals in the second half, winning the match 4–2. On 10 February, Rosický provided a cross for teammate Abou Diaby, who resultantly scored the solitary goal of their league match against Liverpool. Rosický finished the season with a total of three goals in 33 appearances in all club competitions.|$|E

Her older sisters objected to including Maria in their games and once referred to Maria as their [...] "stepsister" [...] because she was so good and never got into trouble, recalled Margaretta Eagar in her own memoirs. However, on occasion the sweet-natured Maria could be mischievous. Once, as a little girl, she stole some biscuits from her mother's tea table. As a punishment for her surprising behavior, the governess and Alexandra suggested she be sent to bed; however Nicholas objected, stating, [...] "I was always afraid of the wings growing. I am glad to see she is only a human child." [...] Eagar noted that Maria's love for her father was [...] "marked" [...] and she often tried to escape from the nursery to [...] "go to Papa."
