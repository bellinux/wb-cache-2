50|$|Lily plants may {{first show}} {{evidence}} of holes chewed {{in the leaves}} from consumption, and if left unchecked rapidly progress to blackening, and total loss of the leaves, leaving only the stem. Beetles and their larvae may also inhabit and devour the developing flower buds. Invasion may occur shortly after the new plants emerge from the soil, particularly if there are nearby Fritillaria which emerge earlier than Lilium. While Lilium and Fritillaria are affected, Hemerocallis is not. All Lily types may be affected, but while Asiatic lilies are the most vulnerable, some Oriental lilies may be more resistant. Resistant types include Lilium henryi 'Madame Butterfly', Lilium speciosum 'Uchida', and Lilium 'Black Beauty'.

40|$|The callus of Nicotiana rustica cv Gansu yellow {{flower and}} N. tabacum cv willow leaf were cultured on {{ordinary}} subculture medium (M- 1) and on regeneration medium (M- 2), respectively. No differentiation {{was observed in}} Gansu yellow <b>flower</b> <b>tobacco</b> callus cultures grown on both M- 1 and M- 2 medium. The respiration of both cultures was partially resistant to cyanide and markedly inhibited by m-chlorobenzhydroxamic acid. The relative contributions of alternative and cytochrome pathway were 31 % and 47 % of the total respiration, respectively, in M- 1 callus cultures. The relative O 2 uptake of the two pathways was not changed significantly in M- 2 callus cultures. In subcultured M- 1 callus cultures of Willow leaf tobacco, the respiration mediated via alternative pathway was about 29 to 38 % of the total respiration, and the cytochrome pathway still was the major respiratory pathway. In M- 2 callus cultures in which differentiation occurred, the relative contribution of alternative pathway increased to 41 to 47 % of the total respiration, and the cytochrome pathway decreased considerably.

40|$|Soybean vein {{necrosis}} virus (SVNV) is {{an emerging}} viral disease affecting soybean, first discovered in Tennessee in 2008. SVNV {{has been identified}} as being a new virus in the genus Tospovirus, which are typically vectored by thrips. So far, only soybean thrips have been confirmed to transmit SVNV. However, other thrips species are found in soybean fields, including eastern <b>flower</b> thrips and <b>tobacco</b> thrips. The objectives of this study were to 1) Determine vector competence in three thrips species including soybean, eastern <b>flower</b> and <b>tobacco</b> thrips, and 2) Determine the effect of SVNV on host plant preference and life history of the thrips vector. Vector competence assays showed that eastern <b>flower</b> thrips and <b>tobacco</b> thrips were able to acquire the virus after being exposed to SVNV-infected leaf tissues for 48 hours. Both species were also able to successfully transmit SVNV to healthy plants, but at a lower efficiency (less than 10 % of the plants were infected by eastern flower thrips and 36 % by tobacco thrips) than soybean thrips (71 % infection). SVNV infection did not influence host preference of soybean thrips that is both SVNV-infected and SVNV-uninfected soybean thrips aggregated on healthy plants compared to SVNV-infected plants. SVNV-infected soybean thrips had significantly higher fecundity compared to uninfected thrips. Taken together, these results contribute {{to a better understanding of}} virus-vector interaction, which is crucial for control of SVNV, as well as control of soybean thrips. [URL]...|$|R

Sectioned <b>flowers</b> from <b>tobacco</b> plants transgenic for a complete copy of the parsley (Petroselinum crispum) 4 CL- 1 gene were hybridized to probes that distinguished between 4 CL- 1 transcripts and endogenous tobacco 4 CL transcripts. Both probes hybridized with similar cell type-specific patterns to carpels, anthers, petals, and sepals, and the sites of hybridization varied during flower development. The sites of hybridization generally coincided temporally and spatially with sites of 4 CL-GUS expression, suggesting that most of the expression patterns are regulated by 4 CL- 1 promoter sequences, but lack of correlation between sites of 4 CL mRNA accumulation and GUS activity in portions of the petal suggest that downstream sequences may mediate some aspects of developmentally regulated 4 CL- 1 expression. These results indicate that the introduced 4 CL- 1 gene correctly responds to endogenous tobacco developmental signals and demonstrate complex temporal and spatial patterns of expression during floral organ differentiation...|$|R

The trial was conducted during September 2004 -January 2005. The test materials consisted of two commercial cultivars of cowpea namely Fahari and Tumaini; 8 botanical protectants and their combinations and two controls viz., no protectant and standard actellic super dust, making a total of 13 treatments. A split plot experiment in which the two commercial cultivars were the main plots while the 13 protectant treatments comprised the subplots was used as a Randomized Complete Design with four replications. Cultured pest weevils were placed in vials containing cowpea seeds and the respective sub-plot treatments including the two controls; ashes of rice husks, kitchen and cow dung; powders of dried leaves of Tephrosia vogelii, neem, pyrethrum <b>flowers,</b> <b>tobacco</b> snuff, black pepper fruit and their various combinations. Data were recorded after 10 weeks of storage on number of bruchids after treatment, number of holes per seed, numbers of damaged and undamaged seeds. Protectants had varying degrees of effectiveness in controlling the cowpea weevil. Leaf powders of Tephrosia vogelii, tobacco snuff, actellic super dust and combination of leaf powders of neem and Tephrosia vogelii significantly excelled the control of no protectant in controlling the cowpea weevil. Black pepper powder gave significantly better results than the control in suppressing bruchid survival, higher numbers of undamaged seeds and fewer holes per seed. The cowpea cultivars did not differ significantly on the studied traits. Leaf powders of Tephrosia vogelii, tobacco snuff and combination of neem and Tephrosia are effective in controlling stored grain of cowpeas.

40|$|Floral {{induction}} {{in plants}} is a paradigm for signal perception, transduction, and physiological response. The introduction of root-inducing, left-hand transferred DNA (Ri T-DNA) into the genomes of several plants results in modifications of flowering (D Tepfer [1984] Cell 47 : 959 - 967), including {{a delay in}} <b>flowering</b> in <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana tabacum). Conjugated polyamines are markers for flowering in numerous species of plants. In tobacco their accumulation is correlated {{with the onset of}} flowering (F Cabanne et al.
