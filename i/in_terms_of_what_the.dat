As well as moving the show's focus back to character-based storylines and reintroducing compelling guest stories, Hossington also revealed that there were [...] "certain aspects" [...] of the show which she felt were [...] "out of date <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> show looked like". Hossington told Digital Spy that she looked at everything: from the cameras the show were shooting on, to the format the show was shooting in, as well as changing the light bulbs in the studio.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} film in Atlanta {{because of its}} proximity to Cynthiana, Kentucky, Kirkman's hometown and the setting of his comic's first issue. [...] "At the beginning they talk about how {{some of the people}} in neighboring states would have gone to larger cities so they could fortify them and protect the population." [...] Kirkman had considered other cities, particularly New York City, Miami, and Chicago. Hurd had previously filmed in the city for Lifetime. Darabont felt that Atlanta offered the essentials; [...] "Atlanta and Georgia all-told is proving to be brilliant for us in terms of what it has to offer, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> story needed, in terms of the variety of locations—it really is a fantastic place to shoot." [...] Prior to filming, Kirkman toured with Darabont around the central business district. He stated, [...] "I tagged along on a location-scouting expedition, and that was pretty fun—watching Frank Darabont walking through the streets of Atlanta as if he owned the entire city, daring cars to hit him. That was a lot of fun." [...] Darabont ventured onto the middle of a street to grasp a perfect shot, oblivious to oncoming traffic.|$|E
500|$|Like Powderfinger's {{previous}} album Internationalist, Odyssey Number Five {{commented on}} social and political issues heavily, with the primary point of focus being Aboriginal affairs. The lyrics of [...] "Like a Dog" [...] attacked former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard's Liberal government for its treatment of Indigenous Australians, and for breaking the [...] "relaxed and comfortable" [...] promise he made in the Australian federal election, 1996. Lead singer Bernard Fanning related this to the band's other ethical stances—refusing to appear on Hey Hey it's Saturday, for its anti-gay commentary, or not allowing Powderfinger songs {{to be used in}} jingles, amongst others—stating, [...] "We're not here to set an example. We just want to be happy with ourselves and not end up with a guilty conscience." [...] Fanning said that despite [...] "Like a Dog" [...] being about a political issue, it was not a political song, rather just Powderfinger [...] "voicing our opinions". The band worked with boxer Anthony Mundine on the song's music video, whom Fanning praised as [...] "the perfect lead, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> song is about and the fact that he’s prepared to speak up for what he believes in." ...|$|E

500|$|While many of {{the changes}} were down to the {{logistics}} of filming in Venice, some were for creative reasons, the most prominent being {{the inclusion of the}} famous love scene. [...] The scene was in fact an unscripted last minute improvisation by Roeg, who felt that without it there would be too many scenes of the couple arguing. The scene set in the church where Laura lights a candle for Christine was mostly improvised too. Originally intended to show the gulf between John's and Laura's mental states—John's denial and Laura's inability to let go—the script included two pages of dialogue to illustrate John's unease at Laura's marked display of grief. After a break in filming to allow the crew to set up the equipment, Donald Sutherland returned to the set and commented that he did not like the church, to which Julie Christie retorted that he was being [...] "silly", and the church was [...] "beautiful". Roeg felt that the exchange was more true to life <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> characters would actually say to each other, and that the scripted version was [...] "overwritten", so opted to ditch the scripted dialogue and included the real-life exchange instead.|$|E
500|$|According to the directors, [...] " [...] patronizing quality" [...] {{was vital}} to Scar's {{role in the}} film. Minkoff told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "When Scar puts the guilt trip on Simba, that's an intense idea... {{probably}} {{something that is not}} typical of the other Disney pictures, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> villain does." [...] Additionally, Scar serves as a departure from previous Disney villains because they [...] "came off at least as buffoonish as they were sinister". Because Scar is the film's main antagonist, supervising animator Andreas Deja believed that [...] "villains work really well when they're subtle", explaining, [...] "to see them think and scheme and plot is much more interesting than showing them beating somebody up." [...] By blaming Mufasa's death on an innocent Simba, Scar ultimately triggers [...] "a cycle of guilt, flight, denial and redemption, as the hero goes into self-imposed exile before finally reconciling with his father's memory, returning to face his wicked uncle and generally coming of age." [...] The character's first line in The Lion King essentially summarizes the entire film, providing foreshadowing. It reads, [...] "Life's not fair is it? You see I-well, I... shall never be King. And you... shall never see light of another day," [...] subtly revealing the plot as well as [...] "the reason why [...] decides to murder his own brother." ...|$|E

[...] "To go {{like that and}} remove part of a government and members of parliament is incompatible with international law."

The first range of neglect, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "egocentric" [...] neglect, is found in patients who neglect their own body or personal space. These patients tend to neglect the opposite side of their lesion, based on the midline of the body, head, or retina. For example, in a gap detection test, subjects with egocentric hemispatial neglect on the right side often make errors on the far right side of the page, as they are neglecting the space in their right visual field.|$|E

In contrast, under the reasonable suspicion test, the question is whether a member of the public would reasonably suspect that bias was afoot, even if the court itself was satisfied that there was no possible bias. The standard of proof for this test is the [...] "balance of probabilities".|$|E
2500|$|In {{applications}} to linear algebra, the exterior product provides an abstract algebraic manner for describing the determinant and the minors of a matrix. [...] For instance, {{it is well}} known that the magnitude of the determinant of a square matrix is equal to the volume of the parallelotope whose sides are the columns of the matrix. [...] This suggests that the determinant can be defined in terms of the exterior product of the column vectors. [...] Likewise, the [...] minors of a matrix can be defined by looking at the exterior products of column vectors chosen k at a time. [...] These ideas can be extended not just to matrices but to linear transformations as well: the magnitude of the determinant of a linear transformation is the factor by which it scales the volume of any given reference parallelotope. [...] So the determinant of a linear transformation can be defined <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> transformation does to the top exterior power. [...] The action of a transformation on the lesser exterior powers gives a basis-independent way to talk about the minors of the transformation.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{important}} for the actor to understand [...] "not too quickly". He must reflect and interrogate himself about the possibilities; he should surprise himself.

[...] In 2005 he featured in beatboxer Joel Turner's single [...] "Knock U Out".

The film clip created controversy for the burning of the Union Jack and a photo of then Prime Minister of Australia John Howard. Mundine also {{appeared in}} the Brothablack music video, Are You With Me Out There, along with league player Joe Williams. In 2008 Mundine featured in the video of a GetUp Mob version of the song From Little Things Big Things Grow. In 2009 Mundine also appeared alongside Shannon Noll in the Street Warriors debut album, Unstoppable Force.
