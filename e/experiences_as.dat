40|$|I conduct {{experiments}} to investigate how episodic knowledge obtained from prior <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> an auditor or a manager affects audit committee members' judgment {{in supporting the}} auditor in a disagreement with management. This paper sheds light on the advantage of first-hand accounting-related experience in the important oversight task. It also brings to bear the potential benefit from direct manager <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> claimed by researchers and regulators. I find that the episodic knowledge obtained from prior <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> an auditor, especially the experience of having been a diligent auditor, strengthens the degree of auditor support {{of participants in the}} role of an audit committee member. By contrast, the effect of episodic knowledge from first-hand <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a manager on the likelihood of auditor support varies with the manager type. While the episodic knowledge acquired from direct <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> an aggressive manager augments the level of auditor support, such knowledge attained by prior <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a conservative manager has no significant effect.

40|$|This article revisits {{the issue}} of male {{experience}} and its possible relationship to gender politics. Traditionally, feminism has viewed male <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> representing a bar {{to the development of}} feminist knowledge and consciousness. This conceptualization of male experience continues to inform the contemporary debate on male feminism. The article argues that this experiential bar emerges from a theorization of male <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> sin-gular, fixed, and organic. Challenging this conceptualization, the article retheorizes male <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a diverse, shifting, and contested category that produces different political outcomes. Through an analysis of men’s group discourse, the article illustrates how particular interpretations of male experience produce both feminist and antifeminist effects. It concludes that feminism needs to examine male <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a multifaceted category that can act as the material upon which male feminist resistance operates...|$|R
