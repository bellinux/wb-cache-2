5000|$|<b>Emery</b> <b>cloth</b> {{is a type}} of coated {{abrasive}} that has emery glued to a cloth backing. It is used for hand metalworking. It may be sold in sheets or in narrow rolls, typically 25 or 50 mm wide, often described as [...] "emery tape". The cloth backing makes <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> stronger in tension than sandpaper, but still allows a sheet to be conveniently torn to size.|$|E

30|$|Specimen {{preparation}} {{is an important}} aspect for microstructural examinations of any metal, alloy or composite. The first step of specimen {{preparation is}} metallographic polishing, using <b>emery</b> <b>cloths,</b> ranging from coarse to very fine grades, and then by using diamond paste to get a mirror finish on the surface. For a detailed study of the microstructures and grain boundaries of the matrix or reinforcement, the polished sample is to be etched using some suitable etching agent. Kellor's reagent is used {{by most of the}} researchers (Cocen and Onel 2002, Rao et al. 2010 and many more) for etching; however, equal proportions of HNO 3 and HCl were used as etching agent by Alaneme et al. (2013).|$|R
50|$|The {{final stage}} of the carving process is {{polishing}}. Sandpaper {{can be used as}} a first step in the polishing process, or sand <b>cloth.</b> <b>Emery,</b> a stone that is harder and rougher than the sculpture media, is also used in the finishing process. This abrading, or wearing away, brings out the color of the stone, reveals patterns in the surface and adds a sheen. Tin and iron oxides are often used to give the stone a highly reflective exterior.|$|R

This abrading, or wearing away, brings out the color of the stone, reveals patterns in the surface and adds a sheen. Tin and iron oxides are often used to give the stone a highly reflective exterior. Today, modern stone sculptors use diamond abrasives to sand in the final finishing processes. This can be achieved by hand pads in rough to fine abrasives ranging from 36 grit to 3000 grit. Also diamond pads mounted on water cooled rotary air or electric sanders speed the finishing process.|$|R
5000|$|Sandpaper and <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> are coated {{abrasives}} for hand use, usually non-precision. These {{two terms}} {{are used by}} general public in place of [...] "coated abrasives".|$|E
5000|$|Crushed or {{naturally}} eroded emery (known {{as black}} sand) {{is used as}} an abrasive [...] - [...] for example, on an emery board and <b>emery</b> <b>cloth,</b> as a traction enhancer in asphalt and tarmac mixtures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Emery</b> <b>cloth</b> {{and paper}} were widely used, but the need has diminished with the {{increased}} use of machine grinding to precision size removing the need for hand-fitting on assembly, and the availability of powered hand tools, such as flapwheels, for finishing; however, they remain widely available.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} solder joints, all parts {{to be joined}} must be clean and oxide free. Internal and {{external}} wire brushes are available for the common pipe and fitting sizes; <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> and wire-wool are frequently used as well, although metal wool products are discouraged, as they can contain oil, which would contaminate the joint.|$|E
50|$|Then the {{technician}} micro-polishes {{each of the}} rebuilt crankshafts by hand. To further refine the crankshaft grinding process the machinist makes the most precise fit by micro-polishing the component with a 600 grit <b>emery</b> <b>cloth.</b> Through micro-polishing and industrial crankshaft grinding, the machine shop achieves the recommended Rockwell hardness and Ra finish (Roughness Parameter).|$|E
50|$|Crocus cloth is an {{abrasive}} sheet {{similar to}} sand paper or <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> but {{covered with a}} layer of very fine loose iron oxide particles rather than with bound grains of abrasive.

50|$|Colin Goldsworthy Heywood (1888-1971) {{was born}} in 1888 in Sale Cheshire. He {{was the son of}} Frank Heywood who was a wealthy {{merchant}} in Manchester. Colin joined the firm of Thomas Goldsworthy and Sons which was an <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> and paper manufacturing company in his mother’s family. An advertisement for the company is shown. He became a Director and eventually the Chairman and amassed a large fortune. He did not marry and remained a bachelor all of his life. He lived for about forty years at Pennyhill Park and during that time terraced the formal gardens, the inspiration of which was derived from Chateau de Villandry in Tours.|$|E
50|$|Scary sharp is {{a method}} of {{sharpening}} woodworking tools with sandpaper instead of conventional methods of oilstone or waterstone sharpening. The sandpaper referred to here can be any abrasive impregnated sheet used in the various industries to smooth surfaces and examples include glass paper, silicon carbide, <b>emery</b> <b>cloth,</b> etc. The sandpaper is affixed to another hard, flat substrate to create the sharpening surface. Sheet-glass is commonly used, but a machinist's granite surfacing block, marble baking slabs, plywood, medium-density fibreboard (MDF) or even jointer out-feed tables will produce satisfactory results. The method of fixation is usually {{a matter of the}} user's preference, and can include plain water (by means of surface tension), sprayed-on adhesive, or by simply using adhesive-backed abrasive paper. This is exactly the same method as that used by materials scientists in preparing polished samples for metallography.|$|E
50|$|The clicker's knife {{regularly}} needed sharpening, {{which was}} done with an implement called a rap stick.To use a rap stick, a right-handed operator would hold it in the left hand, resting the stick on the workbench for support, stroking the blade rapidly but gently {{back and forth on}} the abrasive surface to maintain a sharp edge whilst hand-cutting, in a similar fashion to a butcher's knife and sharpening steel. The knife blade shown is a lighter medical item but approximates the shape of a clicker's knife blade, fitting into a comfortable wooden handle with screw-activated jaws. The main surface is <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> wrapped over the edge to form a round section where the curved blade can nestle and be sharpened; the top edge is sharper and square in cross-section, with a fine-grain aluminium oxide abrasive strip used for tip-sharpening. On the reverse side is a heavy-leather smooth strop, to address any metal burrs left by the abrasive process.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} the present work {{is the study of}} the wake of an axisymmetrical body in a three {{dimensional}} flow with the use of experimental results. The final goal is to determine which are the parameters that link the boundary layer characteristics with the wake structure. Three different configurations have been analysed: the first one of the model with smooth surface, the second one with the presence of a strip of <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> in the forward part of the body and the third with the use of two strips of <b>emery</b> <b>cloth,</b> in order to obtain different boundary layers {{at the end of the}} body. For each configuration, a series of experimental data were achieved in order to characterize the variations of both the base pressure values and of the wake characteristics. In the different configurations a frequency pick was detected both in the HWA and in the pressure signals and a following Wavelet-Hilbert analysis was carried out to link this frequency with its fluid-dynamical structure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} {{studying}} {{the relationships among}} the chemical composition, microstructure and properties (hardness, micro-hardness, wear resistance) of powder additives based on NiCrBSi after their deposition. Tested materials reached a relatively wide range of hardness after deposition, which corresponds to their chemical composition and microstructure. The abrasive wear resistance of materials was tested on an <b>emery</b> <b>cloth.</b> The results indicate that both the hardness and abrasive wear resistance of tested materials depend especially {{on the content of}} carbon and chromium. Microstructural analysis indicates that the structure of tested materials is formed by the γ-Ni solid solution and intermediate phases based on boron, silicon and carbon. Those mostly form eutectics (three types), or are excluded by precipitation. There was also found a significant effect of chromium, but especially carbon content on the ratio between the solid solution and eutectics in the microstructure of tested materials. These different ratios of solid solution and eutectics were markedly reflected in micro-hardness behaviours in deposited layers. Micro-hardness values confirmed also the presence of carbidic particles in the layers with carbon content higher than 0. 7 wt%...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the infl uence of pre-germinative treatments on the prevention of tento seed dormancy (water impermeability of the seed coat). Accordingly an experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Seed Analysis and Greenhouse of the Department of Fhytotechics of CCA-UFPB, in Areia-PB, in a completely randomized design with 4 replications of 25 seeds for the two environments. The treatments were: mechanical scarifi cation with <b>emery</b> <b>cloth,</b> immersion in concentrated sulfuric acid (98 %) for 15 and 30 minutes, and the control (without previous treatment of the seeds). In the laboratory, the seeds were incubated at 25 °C in damp paper, and in the greenhouse they were sown in plastic trays among sand. Germination and vigor tests were used, and the following parameters were analyzed: percentage of germination, fi rst germination count, and length and day weight of the root and aerial parts of the seedlings. The {{results indicated that the}} immersion treatments in sulfuric acid for 15 and 30 minutes and the scarifi cation were the most effi cient in preventing seed dormancy...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the results are}} {{described}} of a wind tunnel investigation carried out to study {{the influence of the}} characteristics of the boundary layer developing over the lateral surface of an axisymmetric bluff body upon its base pressure and near-wake flow features. The tests were carried out at Re = Ul/ν = 5. 5 × 10 ^ 5, for which the boundary layer over the lateral surface of the smooth model becomes turbulent before reaching the base contour. Different strips of <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> were wrapped in various positions around the body circumference in order to modify the thickness and characteristics of the boundary layer. With increasing thickness of the boundary layer measured at 0. 1 d from the base contour the results show that the base suctions decrease, and thus the pressure drag of the body. This variation is found to be connected with an increase of the length of the mean recirculation region that is present behind the body, and with a corresponding reduction of the curvature of the streamlines at separation. Finally, a dominating peak at a frequency that decreases with increasing boundary layer thickness is found...|$|E
40|$|A 69 -yr-old {{journeyman}} machinist {{with over}} 30 {{years of experience}} was killed while operating an engine lathe. The victim was using the lathe to shape an eccentric shaft. When he reached over the work piece to smooth out a radiused transition with <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> and a file in hand his loose clothing (left arm sleeve) became entangled around the rotating work piece near the lathe tailstock. He was pulled into the part and suffered multiple fractures to his left arm and injuries to the neck and chest as he was struck repeatedly by the eccentric shaft. A co-worker rushed to his aid and instinctively pushed the red button on the lathe to stop the machine. However, the red button was not an emergency stop and the machine continued. The victim was lifeflighted and died enroute to the hospital. The co-worker suffered non-life threatening injuries. RECOMMENDATIONS • Employers should establish, communicate and enforce a clothing policy specific to the work environment and particularly for machine operators. • Employers should establish formal training on recognized hazards, injury prevention and emergency procedures, and to communicate expectations to adhere to safe practices and policies. • Supervision should monitor, reinforce safe behaviors, and immediately correct unsafe behaviors or conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of {{the thickness of the}} boundary layer developing over the surface of an axisymmetric bluff body upon its base pressure and near-wake flow is analysed experimentally. The model, whose diameter and length are d = 70 mm and l = 400 mm, has a forebody with an elliptical contour and a sharp-edged flat base; it is supported above a plate by means of a faired strut. The pressure distributions over the body lateral and base surfaces were obtained using numerous pressure taps, while the boundary layer profiles and wake velocity field were measured through hot-wire anemometry. The tests were carried out at Re = u∞ l/n = 5. 50 x 10 ^ 5, at which the boundary layer over the lateral surface of the body becomes turbulent before reaching the base contour. Strips of <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> were wrapped in various positions around the body circumference in order to modify the thickness and characteristics of the boundary layer.

40|$|Experimental {{research}} {{has been carried out}} to study the influence of surface roughness on transitions between the subcritical, critical supercritical and postcritical regimes around isolated circular cylinders in cross-flow. The experiments were performed in an open-jet wind tunnel, which was modified to obtain satisfactorily bidimensional conditions, with Reynolds numbers ranging from 2. 6 × 10 ^ 4 to 2. 8 × 10 ^ 5. The cylinders were covered with different types of standard commercial <b>emery</b> <b>cloth,</b> and the estimated relative roughness varied from 1. 0 × 10 ^- 3 to 12 × 10 ^- 3. The signal from a hot-wire probe placed near the cylinder was analysed in order to ascertain the presence of vortex shedding and to obtain the Strouhal number. The mean pressure distribution around most of the cylinders were also measured, and then the drag coefficients were obtained by integration. The boundaries between the various flow regimes {{as a function of the}} degree of roughness and of the Reynolds number were tentatively established, assuming the critical regime to be characterised by the absence of regular vortex shedding, and the postcritical one by Reynolds-number independence. The results confirmed the striking influence of roughness on the flow regime; in particular, the critical regime can be impressively reduced, and it may even disappear in the case of highly roughened cylinders. The boundaries between the various regimes, as well as the supercritical and postcritical drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers, seem to be a function of both the size and the type of surface roughness. This is confirmation, therefore, that it is not possible to characterise the flow regime only by means of a Reynolds number based on the size of the roughness. Finally, it was demonstrated that strong supercritical and postcritical vortex shedding can take place from highly, but uniformly, roughened circular cylinders...|$|E
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{is carried out}} in order to study {{the influence of the}} thickness of the boundary layer developing over the lateral surface of an axisymmetric blunt-body upon its base pressure and near-wake flow features. Three different boundary layer thicknesses have been obtained by wrapping strips of <b>emery</b> <b>cloth</b> on the smooth model at a Reynolds number Re= 550000, at which the boundary layer over the lateral surface becomes turbulent before reaching the base contour. Pressure measurements show that the suctions on the base - and thus the pressure drag of the model - are reduced by increasing the boundary layer thickness. This phenomenon can be connected with a reduction of the curvature of the streamlines at the separation point and with a corresponding increase of the length of the mean recirculation region behind the body. The results of the frequency analysis on the pressures acting on the model (obtained from pressure taps) and on the velocity fluctuations (measured through hot-wire anemometry) show a dominating peak, whose frequency decreases by increasing the boundary layer thickness. In non-dimensional terms, a Strouhal number based on the wake width and the velocity defect at a suitable reference cross-section is found to remain almost constant for the different cases. Moreover, a second dominating frequency, connected with the fluctuations of the mean recirculation region, is found in the spectra of the pressure signals around the base centre and in the ones of the velocity signals in the near-wake centreline. Also the Strouhal number associated with this frequency, approximately equal to one third of the previous one, decreases by increasing the boundary layer thickness. In order to better understand the dynamics of the fluid structures present {{in the wake of the}} body, statistical and time-frequency analyses (using the wavelet and Hilbert transforms) are carried out: the detected peak is related to the presence of coherent vortical structures (hairpin vortices) downstream of the main recirculation region behind the body. The hairpin vortices keep a planar symmetry, due to the presence of the faired strut that supports the model...|$|E
