40|$|A {{combination}} of spatial modelling, sediment tracing techniques and water-quality data {{were used to}} determine the major source of fine sediments in the Herbert River catchment, Queensland, Australia. Using modelling, hillslope erosion was predicted to be the dominant source of sediment, contributing 52 % of the total sediment load at the estuary. Gully and stream bank erosion contributed equal loads to the estuary (~ 24 %). The 137 Cs concentrations measured in this study support the modelled predictions for contributions from different land uses. Results from modelling and sediment tracing also predicted similar ratios of hillslope to channel erosion. The total suspended sediment loads predicted for the downstream <b>freshwater</b> <b>limit</b> of the catchment are within 10 % of longer term measured values. These results suggest that the modelling approach used in this study is useful for determining sediment budgets for large tropical catchments. No Full Tex...|$|E

Lincoln University {{has been involved with}} this leaders programme since 1979 when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. In recent years there has been increased public and media scrutiny of the performance of dairy farming in New Zealand. As a result there are mixed views about dairying in New Zealand. In response to increased community pressure the dairy sector is implementing a range of significant initiatives to enhance its environmental performance. While it is opportune for the dairy sector to reflect on the improvements that it has made in recent years, it is also timely to consider what other initiatives can be undertaken to maintain and improve its reputation. As part of my project I have canvassed the views of some of the sector’s biggest critics to consider what else the dairy sector could do to improve its environmental performance and reputation. The key recommendations arising from these discussions involve: 1. Evaluate whether the dairy sector is consistently and clearly articulating its position on <b>freshwater</b> <b>limit</b> setting. 2. Evaluate how environmental poor performance is currently managed and identify opportunities for improvement. 3. Identify opportunities to tell environmental success stories more effectively including through the involvement of farmers and the environmental sector. 4.

In addition, nitrate (NO 3), nitrite (NO 2), ammonium (NH 4), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and particulate nitrogen (PN) were determined in the freshwater Scheldt sub-basin and NO 3, NO 2 and NH 4 in the Rupel sub-basin, the Scheldt estuary and the coastal zone. The behaviour of each P species along the continuum from the <b>freshwater</b> tidal <b>limits</b> to the coastal zone is discussed. Phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) budgets were made for the Scheldt sub-basin during the productive period (May–September). The main P and N transformation processes were identified as PO 4 sorption, algal uptake and nitrification. Retention of P and N in the entire freshwater tidal area was estimated. In the brackish part of the estuary, there was no net source or sink of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Desorption of PO 4 was the most important transformation process for P along the salinity gradient. The PO 4 pool increased and the PIP pool decreased, while total P behaved conservatively.

Current research suggests egg-to-fry survival may be one of the most important <b>freshwater</b> <b>limiting</b> factors in Pacific Salmon’s northern range due to more frequent flooding events predicted to scour eggs from mobile spawning substrates. A watershed-scale hydroclimatic sensitivity index was developed to map this hypothesis with an historical stream gauge station dataset and monthly multiple regression-based discharge models.

The models showed the region’s diverse physiography and climatology resulted in a relatively predictable pattern of change: northern mainland and steeper, snow-fed mountainous watersheds exhibited the greatest increases in discharge, an earlier spring melt, and a transition into rain-fed hydrologic patterns.

In this study, we demonstrate an approach to phylogeographic analysis incorporating historical sea-level information in a nested clade phylogeographic analysis (NCPA) framework, using burrowing freshwater crayfish as the model organism. Our study area focuses on the Bass Strait region of southeastern Australia, which is marine region encompassing a shallow seabed that {{has emerged as a}} land bridge during glacial cycles connecting mainland Australia and Tasmania. Bathymetric data were analysed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to delineate a palaeodrainage model when the palaeocoastline was 150 m below present-day sea level. Such sea levels occurred at least twice in the past 500 000 years, perhaps more often or of larger magnitude within the last 10 million years, linking Victoria and Tasmania. Inter-locality distance measures confined to the palaeodrainage network were incorporated into an NCPA of crayfish (Engaeus sericatus Clark 1936) mitochondrial 16 S rDNA haplotypes. The results were then compared to NCPAs using present-day river drainages and traditional great-circle distance measures. NCPA inferences were cross-examined using frequentist and Bayesian procedures in the context of geomorphological and historical sea-level data. We found distribution of present-day genetic variation in E. sericatus to be partly explained not only by connectivity through palaeodrainages but also via present-day drainages or overland (great circle) routes. We recommend that future studies consider all three of these distance measures, especially for studies of coastally distributed species...|$|R

Surprisingly, filtration is not specified in these guidelines and sample preparation procedures range from unfiltered to 0. 45 µm filtration in these certified laboratories. It is well established that MRP includes both free orthophosphate and phosphate associated with colloidal material such as Fe and Al oxyhydroxides while organic P is only weakly included. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare analytical results among certified laboratories and to identify filtration effects on the analytical results. In a round-robin test, ten waters were collected from streams in Flanders and sent to certified laboratories. In addition, the same waters were tested in our laboratory assessing effects of filtration (paper filter, 0. 45 µm, 0. 1 µm) and dialysis (12 - 14 kDa) on MRP. The MRP concentrations in the water samples decreased gradually by filtration over progressively smaller membrane pore sizes and after dialysis. Filtration over a 0. 45 µm membrane filter reduced MRP concentrations to 74 - 84 % of MRP in unfiltered waters with low Fe (2. 5 mg Fe/L).

40|$|The estuarine {{turbidity}} maximum (ETM) {{region of}} Chesapeake Bay, {{located near the}} limit of saltwater intrusion, is characterized by high total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations, high light attenuation, and high densities of zooplankton. Due to high light attenuation, primary production is generally low in ETMs, yet the Chesapeake Bay ETM region is often considered a 'hot spot' of zooplankton abundance within the Bay. The omnivorous copepod Eurytemora affinis is especially prevalent in the ETMs of Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and in ETM regions worldwide. In {{order to determine the}} factors influencing 1) zooplankton distribution and abundance in the Chesapeake Bay ETM, 2) E. affinis reproduction in the Chesapeake Bay and Choptank River ETMs, and 3) zooplankton position maintenance, cruises in the Chesapeake Bay and Choptank River ETMs were conducted in 1996 and 2001 - 2003. Laboratory experiments examining the egg production cycle of E. affinis were also performed. The cruise results show that zooplankton taxa within the Chesapeake Bay ETM region tend to be distributed along a salinity gradient from up-estuary to down-estuary, with cladocerans being most common in low salinity/freshwater regions, E. affinis found in slightly higher salinities than cladocerans, and mysids and the copepod Acartia tonsa found in more mesohaline conditions. Eurytemora affinis appears to be contained in the ETM by <b>freshwater</b> <b>limiting</b> its up-estuary extent and biological interactions with A. tonsa and salinity tolerances limiting its down-estuary abundance.

The purpose was to: a) assess the changes in water quality throughout the planted forestry cycle from afforestation through to harvesting; b) compare water quality from planted forests with other land uses in New Zealand; and c) identify knowledge gaps and opportunities for future research. Afforestation of pasture land significantly improved {{a wide range of}} water quality attributes such as stream temperature, nutrient and sediment concentrations and microbial contamination within 4 - 6 years of planting. Water quality in mid-rotation to mature forests, {{a large proportion of the}} forestry cycle, was highly variable but characterised by cool water temperatures, low concentrations of sediment and nutrients, with aquatic invertebrate communities indicative of high water quality. Impacts of timber harvesting on water quality attributes were greatest when clear-cut harvesting up to the stream edge. Harvest impacts were mediated by the retention of intact riparian buffers and to a lesser extent by retention of moderate quantities of logging slash across small stream channels. Temporal and spatial factors influenced the magnitude of response to harvesting activities and duration of the recovery period. Land-use comparisons generally showed improving water quality from pasture to planted forest to indigenous forest. Continued research to identify management systems that mitigate impacts on water quality, particularly during harvesting, remains a priority. Consistent approaches to water quality monitoring will improve the ability to report on water quality in planted forests. Future water quality research in New Zealand’s planted forests needs to encompass emerging contaminants of national and international concern such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals. As New Zealand moves toward increasing productivity from planted forests, use of potential interventions such as intensified herbicide and fertiliser use, will need to be within sustainable <b>freshwater</b> <b>limits.</b> A future challenge is to quantify the economic value of freshwater ecosystems services provided by New Zealand’s planted forests. This review showed that with continued prudent stewardship and ongoing improvements in management practices, particularly during harvesting, New Zealand’s planted forests can provide a sustainable source of well-maintained and high quality water resources.|$|R
