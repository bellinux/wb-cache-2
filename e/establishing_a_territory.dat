500|$|California {{sea lions}} breed gregariously between May and August, {{when they arrive}} at their {{breeding}} rookeries. When <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>territory,</b> the males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on the rookery {{for as long as}} possible. During this time, they will fast, relying on a thick layer of fat called blubber for energy. Size and patience allow a male to defend his territory more effectively; the bigger the male, the more blubber he can store and the longer he can wait. A male sea lion usually keeps his territory for around 27 days. Females have long parturition intervals, and thus the males do not establish their territories until after the females give birth. Most fights occur during this time. After this, the males rely on ritualized displays (vocalizations, head-shaking, stares, bluff lunges, and so on) to maintain their territorial boundaries. Since temperatures can reach over [...] during this time, males must include water within their territories. Some territories are mostly underwater, particularly those near steep cliffs. Sea lions that fail to establish a territory are driven out to sea or gather at a nearby beach.|$|E

Large badge size leads an increase in male to male competition because they divert their parental investment towards showing off their badge during mating. (Anna Qvarnstrõm).|$|E

Radio-telemetry revealed that such floaters concentrate along boundaries of established territories.

At least four dead great horned owls in Kluane were apparently killed by others of their own species in territorial conflicts. Owls killed by other horned owls are sometimes cannibalized, although the origin of the killing may have been territorial aggression. Northern populations occasionally erupt south during times of food shortage, but there is no annual migration even at the northern limits of the great horned owl's range.|$|E

50|$|Males are promiscuous; they {{disperse}} and advertise {{a territory}} that is visited by females for mating. Females are {{solely responsible for}} the rest of the reproductive effort though males have been known to stay with young chicks and seem to aid in keeping the brood together. For a nest, they scratch a depression in the ground in a bush or under a low-lying coniferous branch or fallen tree, away from other females and from the males' territories. The nest is lined with grasses, leaves, and a few feathers. Nesting season is from early May to early July. Up to 10 eggs may be laid, the usual number being 4-7. Laying rate is 1 egg every 1.4 days. Eggs are about 40 mm in length (1.5 inches) and are tawny olive or buff, marked with blotches of brown. Incubation begins with the last egg laid and lasts about 24 days. Young are about 15 g at hatching (0.5 ounces) and they are precocial; they walk out of the nest as soon as they are dry (about 8 h after hatching). They are capable of fluttering up from the ground at 1 week of age. The brood stays together and is accompanied by the hen, who broods them all night and frequently during the day until the young are 3-5 weeks old. Brooding behaviour of the female seems to be initiated by specific calls from the chicks when they are cold. At 70-100 days of age, chicks tend to leave the group and become independent.Females breed only once a year. Most females first breed at 1 year of age, but about half the males delay <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>territory</b> until 2 years. The species' lifespan appears to be about 5-6 years in the wild, though one study in Southwestern Alberta has found two males and one female that lived to be at least 13 years old.|$|E

The females in these groups will mount each other as well as the males. These groups begin to disintegrate as the females begin to mate. The territorial and mating system of the California sea lion has been described as similar to a lek system, as females appear to choose their mates while moving though different territories. They avoid males that are too aggressive or energetic. Males are usually unable to prevent females from leaving their territories, particularly in water. Mating may occur outside the rookeries, between non-territorial males and females, as the latter move to and from the mating site. In some rookeries, copulation may be monopolized by a few males, while at others, a single male may sire no more than four pups.|$|E
40|$|The {{songs and}} calls of many bird species, like human speech, form {{distinct}} regional dialects. We {{suggest that the}} process of dialect formation is analogous to the physical process of magnetic domain formation. We take the coastal breeding grounds of the Puget Sound white crowned sparrow as an example. Previous field studies suggest that birds of this species learn multiple songs early in life, and when <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>territory</b> for the first time, retain one of these dialects in order to match the majority of their neighbours. We introduce a simple lattice model of the process, showing that this matching behaviour can produce single dialect domains provided the death rate of adult birds is sufficiently low. We relate death rate to thermodynamic temperature in magnetic materials, and calculate the critical death rate by analogy with the Ising model. Using parameters consistent with the known behavior of these birds we show that coastal dialect domain shapes may be explained by viewing them as low temperature "stripe states"...|$|E
40|$|In many {{territorial}} species, {{a fraction}} of all mature individuals are classified as floaters, and {{little is known about}} how these animals eventually acquire a breeding territory of their own. We observed intrusion behavior of floaters, subsequently removed breeding birds, and then observed floaters as they were filling these vacancies in an oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus, population. Birds familiar with the area and its inhabitants filled 80 % of the experimentally created vacancies. These could be either neighbors or floaters with a former breeding history nearby, but they were mainly floaters with an intrusion record nearby. Floaters obtaining experimentally vacated territories intruded significantly nearer to this territory before removal compared with floaters not obtaining the vacancy. In general, vacancies that were not occupied by intruding floaters tended to be located in areas where less intruding floaters were seen prior to removal. We show quantitatively that only birds familiar with a site succeed in <b>establishing</b> <b>a</b> <b>territory</b> at that site, suggesting that local information is essential for territory acquisition. We propose that the main aim of intrusion behavior may be the collection of such information.
