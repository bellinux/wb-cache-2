5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a <b>filing</b> <b>fee,</b> file a financial disclosure, and create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E

50|$|A funding {{campaign}} {{to cover the}} legal costs of the various recounts began on November 23, with an initial goal of $2.2 million to cover <b>filing</b> <b>fees</b> in Wisconsin. Donors quickly reached and surpassed that goal, which was subsequently raised to $4.5 million to cover <b>filing</b> <b>fees</b> in Pennsylvania. That was met on November 25, and the goal was raised a second time to $7 million for Michigan's <b>filing</b> <b>fees.</b> The goal was raised a third time to $9.5 million on November 28 after Wisconsin increased its <b>filing</b> <b>fees.</b> The total funds raised by the Stein campaign for the recounts eventually reached $7.33 million, with nearly 161,300 individual donors contributing in all.|$|R

25|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} story, Gray's caveat {{was taken to the}} US Patent Office a few hours before Bell's application. Gray's caveat was taken to the Patent Office in the morning of February 14, 1876, shortly after the Patent Office opened and {{remained}} {{near the bottom of the}} in-basket until that afternoon. Bell's application was filed shortly before noon on February 14 by Bell's lawyer who requested that the <b>filing</b> <b>fee</b> be entered immediately onto the cash receipts blotter and Bell's application was taken to the Examiner immediately. Late in the afternoon, Gray's caveat was entered on the cash blotter and was not taken to the Examiner until the following day. The fact that Bell's <b>filing</b> <b>fee</b> was recorded earlier than Gray's led to the myth that Bell had arrived at the Patent Office earlier. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not know this happened until later. Gray later abandoned his caveat and did not contest Bell's priority. That opened the door to Bell being granted US patent 174465 for the telephone on March 7, 1876.|$|E
25|$|Webster briefly {{ran for the}} United States Senate in 2004 when he {{attempted}} to collect the 93,000 signatures necessary to place {{his name on the}} ballot without paying the <b>filing</b> <b>fee.</b> Webster claimed that he sought to be the first Senate candidate to ever qualify using this method as both a symbolic gesture and a way to build an early network of voters. Webster eventually qualified by paying the fee instead, and later dropped out of the race.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Bankruptcy Court also charges fees. The {{amounts of}} these fees vary {{depending}} on the Chapter of bankruptcy being filed. As of 2016, the <b>filing</b> <b>fee</b> for Chapter 7 was $335 and $310 for Chapter 13. It is possible to apply for an installment payment plan in cases of financial hardship. Additional fees are charged for adding creditors after filing ($31), converting the case from one chapter to another ($10-$45), and reopening the case ($245 for Chapter 7 and $235 in Chapter 13).|$|E
50|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the recount efforts, the Stein campaign claimed that costs for the recounts totaled $7.43 million, exceeding the amount that was raised. A published breakdown of expenditures showed that $212,500 was spent on staff payroll; $364,000 on consultants; $353,618 on administrative expenses such as travel costs; $3,499,689 on the <b>filing</b> <b>fees</b> in Wisconsin; $16,000 on the <b>filing</b> <b>fees</b> in Pennsylvania; $973,250 on the <b>filing</b> <b>fees</b> in Michigan; $1,630,200 on associated legal expenses; $150,000 on ongoing litigation as of December 13; and a final $150,000 on compliance costs.|$|R

25|$|Though his Minden {{newspapers}} had endorsed Charlton Lyons {{for governor}} in 1964, Colten approached city government from a nonpartisan basis. This discouraged Republicans who wanted to expand their party into a viable political force {{in the city and}} state. He did little to encourage other Republicans to run for office and once opposed a Republican candidate for sheriff by convincing the Webster Parish Republican Executive Committee to set the <b>filing</b> <b>fee</b> so high that it would discourage the candidate from running—it did not, however, in that case. Colten hence favored offering only serious candidates, not obscure place names to fill a ballot.|$|E
25|$|Art Woodley {{had been}} advised {{that he would}} have to change the Woodley Airways name to {{something}} other than his own name in order to be considered a serious contender for new routes by the CAB regulators. Woodley sent his attorney to Juneau to file papers that would change the name to Alaska Airlines. The attorney filed the documents, but neglected to pay the $15 <b>filing</b> <b>fee.</b> Alaska Star Airlines quickly filed the legal documents to rename their company, becoming Alaska Airlines on September 16, 1943, and the company was incorporated under its new name on May 2, 1944.|$|E
25|$|The {{petition}} must be timely filed {{within the}} allowable time. The Court cannot extend {{the time for}} filing which is set by statute. A $60 <b>filing</b> <b>fee</b> must be paid when the petition is filed. Once the petition is filed, payment of the underlying tax ordinarily is postponed until the case has been decided. In certain tax disputes involving $50,000 or less, taxpayers may elect to have the case conducted under the Court's simplified small tax case procedure. Trials in small tax cases generally are less formal and result in a speedier disposition. However, decisions entered pursuant to small tax case procedures are not appealable and are not precedential.|$|E

25|$|Filing a claim {{with the}} Court of Federal Claims {{requires}} a $250 <b>filing</b> <b>fee,</b> {{which can be}} waived for those unable to pay. Medical records such as prenatal, birth, pre-vaccination, vaccination, and post-vaccination records are strongly suggested, as medical review and claim processing may be delayed without them. Because this is a legal process most people use a lawyer, though this is not required. By 1999 the average claim took two years to resolve, and 42% of resolved claims were awarded compensation, as compared with 23% for medical malpractice claims through the tort system. There is a three-year statute of limitations for filing a claim, timed from the first manifestation of the medical problem.|$|E
25|$|Gutknecht {{had always}} chosen to submit filing {{petitions}} when running for Congress {{instead of paying}} the $300 election <b>filing</b> <b>fee,</b> calling this a more fiscally conservative approach. Gutknecht was the only major party candidate in Minnesota to submit filing petitions in 2006. In August 2006, Louis Reiter of Elgin, Minnesota filed papers with the Minnesota Supreme Court seeking to disqualify Gutknecht from having his name appear on the September 12, 2006 primary ballot. The filing was prepared by DFL election attorney Alan Weinblatt, and argued that all candidates are subject to a time limit for petitions, and {{that most of the}} petition signatures were gathered before the July 4–18, 2006 period which the lawsuit claimed was applicable. Gutknecht filed the petitions on July 5, 2006, the first day possible for such filings. He had never previously been challenged on this point. The state Supreme Court heard the case on August 22, 2006 and denied the attempt to disqualify Gutknecht the same day.|$|E
25|$|In March 2000 Altmann filed a {{civil claim}} against the Austrian {{government}} {{for the return of}} the paintings. She was informed that the cost of filing (consisting of 1.2% of the amount in question, plus a <b>filing</b> <b>fee),</b> would have meant a fee of €1.75 million. To avoid the prohibitively high costs, Altmann and Schoenberg sued the Austrian government and the Galerie Belvedere in the US courts. The Austrian government filed for dismissal, based on arguments around the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (1976). The Act granted immunity to sovereign nations except under certain conditions. Schoenberg showed that three of the conditions pertinent to the case were that Altmann's property had been taken in violation of international law; the property was owned by the state in question, or one of its agencies; and that the property had been used on a commercial basis in the US. Over four years of litigation followed as to whether the case could be brought against a sovereign state before it was brought before the Supreme Court in Republic of Austria v. Altmann. In June 2004 the Supreme Court determined that the paintings had been stolen and that Austria was not immune from a claim from Altmann; the court made no comment on the current ownership of the paintings.|$|E

Distrustful of her ability to manage her finances, Wyatt made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. Wyatt put oil leases he owned in Henrietta's name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Sadie after his death.

2500|$|Many {{settlers}} came to {{the area}} for the promise of riches from mining. The availability {{of water from the}} Owens River made farming and raising livestock attractive.

40|$|In {{many states}} {{candidates}} must meet certain requirements {{in order to}} be listed on the ballot. Such requirements include <b>filing</b> <b>fees</b> and minimum number of collected signatures. Incumbents have incentives to use these requirements to shield themselves from competition and to reduce entry of challengers. To date, there is very little evidence regarding whether such requirements have negative consequences for candidate competition in elections and challenger entry into electoral races. This paper examines the impact of <b>filing</b> <b>fees</b> and signature requirements on the number of candidates in state races by analyzing state lower house elections in 1998 and 2000. The findings show that higher <b>filing</b> <b>fees</b> reduce the number of major party candidates and the number of minor party candidates. Filing fees more easily dissuade minor party candidates to run for office than major party candidates. More stringent signature requirements reduce the number of major party candidates in elections.
