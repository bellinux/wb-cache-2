40|$|Structuring {{education}} so {{that students}} can discover connections between schoolwork and their everyday lives is a crucial task for a teacher. This {{is especially true in}} today’s school system that seeks to foster a spirit of lifelong learning, since educational motivation depends on being able to connect to the tasks at hand. In a system where these connections are not present, students will be motivated only by institutional mechanisms such as test results and grades. This leads to them using a number of techniques for “optimizing the system” by getting maximal results for minimal effort. This essay looks at two pedagogical movements that aim to decrease the gap between schoolwork and students’ reality. Freinet pedagogy, named after Célestin Freinet (1896 - 1966) is a “pedagogy of labour” that concentrates on equating the “labour of the hand” and the “labour of the mind”. Entrepreneurial pedagogy, which has been gaining ground during the last few years, is centred on project-based learning that stimulates the skills commonly found among successful entrepreneurs. These movements have several important differences, most notably the idealistic political visions of the <b>Freinet</b> <b>movement</b> that are absent in the more modern, pragmatic entrepreneurial pedagogy. In spite of this, they are united by the principle of school being as close to the students’ reality as possible – a fact that gives hope for the school of tomorrow...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: O presente trabalho tem como tema a escrita docente e sua contribuição para a formação profissional de professores. Para tanto, a pesquisa apresenta a pedagogia Freinet e o Movimento de Professores iniciado por Freinet no início do século XX. Este Movimento está presente em mais 47 países por todo mundo e faz da escrita de seus integrantes a sua base de sustentação e permanência por tantos anos. O primeiro capítulo apresenta o Memorial de Formação da autora, que percorrerá todo o texto, tendo como fio condutor a escrita e a forma como a autora se relacionou com a escrita, desde a infância até a fase adulta e profissional. Outros episódios da minha relação com a escrita vão surgindo ao longo do trabalho. O segundo capítulo trata da vida e obra de Célestin Freinet e a criação do Movimento da Escola Moderna na França e no Brasil. É feita também a contextualização histórica e filosófica do pensamento de Freinet, bem como uma pequena investigação de como a escrita docente foi se desenvolvendo ao longo do século XX no Brasil republicano. No terceiro capítulo são apresentados os estágios feitos pela pesquisadora nas edições de duas revistas organizadas por professores do Movimento Freinet da França. Ainda neste capítulo é feita uma breve análise de uma publicação francesa e uma brasileira. O último capítulo traz a conclusão que evidencia, através da {{bibliografia}} atual, a relevância da escrita como instrumento de reflexão e legitimação da profissionalidade docente. Abstract: This work {{features the}} teachers' writing and {{its contribution to}} teacher training. For this, the research introduces the Freinet pedagogy and movement of teachers initiated by Freinet {{at the beginning of}} the twentieth century. This movement is present in over 47 countries around the world and makes the writing of its members the base for support and endurance for many years. The first chapter presents the author's Memorial Training, excerpt of the text will go throughout the research, with the writing as a guiding principle. The way the author had been related to writing from childhood to adulthood and professional life. The second chapter broaches the life and work of Celestin Freinet and the creation of the Modern School Movement in France and Brazil. Additionally, a historical and philosophical context of Freinet's thought, as well as a little investigation on how teachers' writing developed over the twentieth century in Republican Brazil are carried through this chapter. The third chapter presents the stages made by the researcher on issues of two magazines organized by French <b>Freinet</b> <b>Movement</b> teachers. Moreover, a brief analysis of a Brazilian and a French publication is conducted in this chapter. The final chapter brings the conclusion that verifies the importance of writing as a tool for reflection and legitimation of professional teaching...|$|E

40|$|Analyzing {{classroom}} practices {{applied in}} the 1970 s requires the researcher to combine the use of oral and written sources. However, {{it is not always}} possible to examine in a systematic way the contribution of each one of them to the investigation. Taking advantage of the existence of both types of sources related to the educative work of the militants of <b>Freinet’s</b> <b>movement,</b> in this article I will try to compare the historical reconstruction based on memories with conclusions founded on the analysis of documents. This comparison is carried out in a very constricted and controllable social context – a couple of rural schools – that allows one to observe in a very clear way how both the memories and the documents can distort or illuminate the phenomenon which interests us: the consequences of the usage of Freint’s pedagogy in the rural school in Salamanca. </p...|$|R

40|$|The postulates on {{education}} from Celestín Freinet, and {{his determination to}} provide to the Cooperative of Lay Education (CLE) of an international character, came out soon the French borders. Spain was not foreign to such influence and, very soon, the Freinet’s educational offer had a good reception, even though, in the first moment, it had scanty diffusion and minor application. The winds of pedagogic renovation, propitiated by the Spanish Second Republic, gave impulse and encouraged {{the application of the}} new educational technologies from France. Thus, the incipient <b>Freinet’s</b> Spanish <b>movement</b> was taking shape and, in a little time, this had a «battalion» of «sniper» teachers, who wanted to apply those ideas, a solid organization and a promising future truncated {{by the beginning of the}} civil war. This research is about the Spanish receipt from the Modern School, the advertising and diffusion of those ideas, the itinerary followed by the Spanish’s Freynet move- ment during it expansion and Franco’s government. Likewise, this paper presents a profile of the Freynet’s teachers movement in Spain, and a census of school notebooks realized through the school press, with expression of the locality of edition and of the teachers who stimulated the publication.

40|$|La figura de Jesús Sanz Poch apareix citada en {{diverses}} publicacions com a resultat de la petjada que va deixar en la trajectòria docent a la Normal de Lleida i la Normal de la Generalitat a Barcelona i, també, com a conseqüència de l?aportació realitzada en els inicis del moviment Freinet a Catalunya. Ens manquen, però, estudis més amplis i aprofundits de la trajectòria d?aquest mestre i pedagog nascut al Penedès i format a Girona, Madrid i Ginebra que, malauradament, va morir molt jove i de forma inesperada, pocs mesos {{abans de}} l?esclat de la guerra civil espanyola. L?article pretén reconstruir l?itinerari formatiu i professional de Jesús Sanz i presentar les línies mestres del seu pensament educatiu a partir de l?estudi de les fonts documentals existents en les institucions on va estudiar o exercir la docència, de la revisió de la documentació de l?arxiu familiar i de la lectura i anàlisi dels textos escrits i publicats. Jesús Sanz és un clar exponent del vincle entre renovació pedagògica i compromís polític que constitueix el motor de l?avenç social i cultural al nostre país durant les primeres dècades del segle XX. La trajectòria formativa és un exemple de la inquietud intel·lectual que, insatisfeta amb la realitat propera, va furgar en les expectatives que s?obrien des de l?exterior. La preocupació envers els temes nuclears de l?univers educatiu de l?època apunta les línies d?un pensament educatiu propi en procés de construcció desenvolupat en una curta, però intensa, activitat professional. The figure of Jesús Sanz Poch is mentioned in several monographic publications or periodicals {{as a result}} of the mark left on the path to the Normal Teaching of Lleida, the Summer School and the Normal of the Generalitat in Barcelona, and also, {{as a result of}} the personal role and contribution made at the beginning of the <b>movement</b> <b>Freinet</b> in Catalonia. We are but larger studies and depth of the career of this master and educator who was born in the Penedes and format in Girona, Madrid and Geneva who, unfortunately, died very young and unexpectedly, a few months before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. That premature death stopped a brilliant career and upward within the field of education and, certainly, it is the source of the ignorance that we have a short but interesting work, deep and clear progression. The article attempts to reconstruct the trail of professional training of Jesús Sanz in the context of their time teaching. It also to tries submit and systematize the thrust of his educational thought from the study of documentary sources in the institutions where he studied or worked as a teacher, a review of the documentation of the family archive and reading and analysis of texts written and published in newspapers and literary journals, cultural and educational at the time. Jesús Sanz is a clear example of this link between teaching and educational renewal and political commitment which is the engine of social progress and cultural development to Catalonia during the early decades of the twentieth century. The training career is marked by figures such as Cassià Costal, Domingo Barnés, Luis de Zulueta and Manuel Bartolomé Cossío. The intellectual property concerns, unsatisfied with reality next, led him to scratch on expectations that opened from the outside. In this respect, his stay in the Rousseau Institute in Geneva, in the shadow of Claparède, Bovet, Piaget and Ferrière, is one of the keys to understand its evolution. The result was an intense life dedicated to the action and reflection in three main fields: political, cultural and literary and educational. The written production of professor Sanz is quite remarkable and can be systematized into three main sections: the political reporting, the results of the studies as a literary critic and educational work. These papers of education can be outlined in the pages of the Boletín de la Institución Libre de Enseñanza, Revista de Escuelas Normales and Revista de Psicologia i Pedagogia, among other publications. As a whole reflect the concern towards the nuclear issues of the universe education of the time and point the lines of an own thinking on education that it is in process of building. The areas of interest and study are contemporary pedagogy, the relationship between education and social justice, the Unique School, the teacher and his training, the teaching of language and literature and, finally, the children?s intellectual understanding and the selection of children «gifted», an issue that concerned him at the beginning of his stay in Geneva and that it is one of the main arguments of his articles. La figura de Jesús Sanz Poch aparece citada en distintas publicaciones a consecuencia del recuerdo que dejó en su paso y trayectoria docente en la Escuela Normal de Lleida y en la Escuela Normal de la Generalitat en Barcelona, y como resultado de su aportación personal en los inicios del movimiento Freinet en Catalunya. Sin embargo no existe ningún estudio amplio y profundo sobre la trayectoria de este maestro y pedagogo nacido en la comarca del Penedès y formado en Girona, Madrid y Ginebra que, lamentablemente, murió muy joven y de forma inesperada pocos meses antes del estallido de la guerra civil española. El artículo pretende reconstruir el itinerario formativo y profesional de Jesús Sanz y presentar las líneas de su pensamiento educativo a partir del estudio de las fuentes documentales existentes en las instituciones dónde estudió o ejercició la docencia, de la revisión de la documentación del archivo familiar y de la lectura y análisis de los textos escritos y publicados. Jesús Sanz es un claro exponente del vínculo entre renovación pedagógica y compromiso político que constituye el motor del progreso social y cultural de nuestro país durante las primeras décadas del siglo XX. Su trayectoria formativa es un ejemplo de la inquietud intelectual que, insatisfecha con la realidad próxima, hurgó en las expectativas abiertas desde el exterior. La preocupación hacia los temas nucleares del universo educativo de su época esboza las líneas de un pensamiento educativo propio, en proceso de construcción y desarrollado en una corta pero intensa actividad profesional...|$|R
