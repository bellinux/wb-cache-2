5|$|In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based {{department}} store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo {{was struck by}} a dump truck while trying to get to her <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to have easy access to the mall. In settling a wrongful death claim against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today. Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996 as part of the chain's restructuring, with Old Navy soon opening in the store's former upper level. By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well, with the lower level becoming the area's first Bed Bath & Beyond store in 1997. Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer Finish Line opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous.|$|E

500|$|... "Cynical" [...] was {{proposed}} by Feldmann as a faster song, {{reminiscent of the}} band's past work. Hoppus wrote the song about [...] "thinking {{the world is in}} a cynical place," [...] but also as a mission statement as a new version of Blink-182. [...] "Bored to Death" [...] was the first song the band recorded with Feldmann on the group's <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> with him. [...] "She's Out of Her Mind" [...] namedrops the post-punk band Bauhaus in the words. It was the result of multiple rewrites, with each draft attempting to perfect the chorus preceding it. Hoppus called it a [...] "simple love song." [...] "Los Angeles" [...] was meant to show a heavier, more [...] "experimental" [...] version of the band. The song is centered on the band's adopted hometown; its lyrics reference the demolition of the Sixth Street Bridge in LA. Hoppus described [...] "Sober" [...] as [...] "about rebuilding [...] finding yourself, and knowing that you're in a troubled place but striving to get to somewhere better." [...] Its subject matter is based around two experiences: one when Skiba was a bicycle messenger in Chicago and was struck by a car, and another a fictional story of a [...] "drunken night with a girlfriend". Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy collaborated with the band, his initial idea being [...] "what could Blink be on modern rock radio in 2016?" [...] "Built This Pool" [...] is a short joke song with homoerotic lyrics. The audible [...] "is that really it?" [...] heard {{at the end of the}} song was a genuine reaction from Barker.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas {{was born}} in New Iberia, Louisiana, the son of Mary (Eaton) and William Marco Thomas. The {{grandson}} of a slave, he attended Pearl High School in Nashville in the 1920s. Thomas had hoped to attend college and become a doctor, but the Great Depression derailed his plans. He worked at Vanderbilt University {{in the summer of}} 1929 doing carpentry but was laid off in the fall. In that same year, Thomas enrolled in the Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial College as a premedical student. [...] In the wake of the stock market crash in October, Thomas put his educational plans on hold, and, through a friend, in February 1930 secured a job as surgical research technician with Dr. Alfred Blalock at Vanderbilt University. On his <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> Thomas assisted Blalock with a surgical experiment on a dog. At the end of Thomas's first day, Blalock told Thomas they would do another experiment the next morning. Blalock told Thomas to [...] "come in and put the animal to sleep and get it set up". Within a few weeks, Thomas was starting surgery on his own. Thomas was classified and paid as a janitor, despite the fact that by the mid-1930s, he was doing the work of a Postdoctoral researcher in the lab.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} popular songs in Western culture feature Monday, {{often as a}} <b>day</b> <b>of</b> depression, anxiety, hysteria, or melancholy (probably because of its {{association}} with the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> the <b>work</b> week).

50|$|In June 1965 a Polish archaeological {{mission of}} the University of Warsaw headed by Professor Michałowski started {{excavation}} works in Nea Paphos in Cyprus. New Paphos was founded {{at the end of}} the 4th century BC as a port intended for Greek pilgrims arriving to pay tribute to Aphrodite. Already the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> in the south-west part of Paphos led to a discovery of marble sculptures of Asclepius and Artemis worshipped in the city. Coins presenting Alexander the Great were discovered, which confirmed the city foundation date. City development of the Hellinistic period was revealed with well-preserved paintings in the so-called first Pompeian style as well as a proconsul’s palace with private baths. A mosaic presenting Theseus wrestling Minotaur in a labyrinth was discovered in this building. Ariadne and a woman symbolising Crete are watching the fight. This mosaic is regarded as the most beautiful decoration of this type in the Mediterranean area. Polish excavations proved that Nea Paphos was a political centre of the island. The works initiated by Professor Michałowski are continued by the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology in honour of Professor Kazimierz Michałowski.|$|R

2500|$|Rachael Blampied had auditioned 5 {{times for}} Shortland Street, with her last being {{for the role}} of Zlata Waldheim. However Blampied was turned down every time as she looked too similar to one of the core actresses, Beth Allen (who portrayed Brooke Freeman). After she auditioned {{for the role of}} Zlata, {{producers}} decided to utilise their similarities and create the role of Bree – a sister for Brooke, specifically for her. Blampied received a call in mid-2011 asking if she was eager to accept the role. She was extremely pleased with the call, saying; [...] "It's the best phone call an actor can wish for – that they're writing a part for you on a show {{you really want to be}} on. It was a complete surprise and totally out of the blue." [...] The character was originally planned to appear nicer but end up being [...] "badder" [...] than Brooke. Blampied started filming her scenes in October 2011. Blampied found her <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> similar to walking [...] "into a beast" [...] and although she was nervous, she found it was like [...] "a family". In November TVNZ announced that a new addition would be arriving to Brooke's dysfunctional family, with Bree arriving on 9 December. Blampied enjoyed working alongside her screen sister, Allen and Pua Magasiva (who portrayed Brooke's boyfriend Vinnie), saying; [...] "I've had some great scenes with Beth and Pua, which have been enormous fun as they're such generous actors and are heaps of fun to hang out with!" [...] The character was originally envisioned to be killed off at the end of her stint, but producers were so impressed with Blampied that they rewrote the characters ending by sending her to a psychiatric hospital. Blampied was not aware as to what Bree was to endure throughout her stint but was informed that she was always going to leave after her initial storyline came to an end. She was sad to leave the soap but pleased with her exit, [...] "I was sad to have to leave the show, but it's not a closed exit. One of the writers said to me on my last day, 'Well it's always good to have a crazy in the cupboard.'" [...] Bree made her last appearance on 25 September 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi came to Beijing on 9 December 1959 {{with special}} {{permission}} from Mao Zedong and lived {{for the next}} six months in an ordinary Beijing residence with his sister before being transferred to a government-sponsored hotel. Puyi had the job of sweeping the streets, and got lost on his <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> which led him to tell astonished passers-by: [...] "I'm Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing dynasty. I'm staying with relatives and can't find my way home". One of Puyi's first acts upon returning to Beijing was to visit the Forbidden City as a tourist, where he pointed out to other tourists that many of the exhibits were the things he had used in his youth. He voiced his support for the Communists and worked at the Beijing Botanical Gardens. Working as a simple gardener gave Puyi a degree of happiness that he had never known as an emperor, though he was notably clumsy. Behr noted that in Europe people who played roles analogous to the role Puyi played in Manchukuo were generally executed; for example, the British hanged William Joyce ("Lord Haw-haw") only for being the announcer on the English-language broadcasts of Radio Berlin, Italian Communist guerrillas shot Benito Mussolini, and the French executed Pierre Laval, so many Westerners are surprised that Puyi was released from prison after only nine years to start a new life. Behr wrote that the Communist ideology explained this difference, writing: [...] "In a society where all landlord and 'capitalist-roaders' were evil incarnate, it did not matter so much that Puyi was also a traitor to his country: he was, in the eyes of the Communist ideologues, only behaving true to type. If all capitalists and landlords were, by their very nature, traitors, it was only logical that Puyi, the biggest landlord, should also be the biggest traitor. And, in the last resort, Puyi was far more valuable alive than dead". In early 1960, Puyi met Premier Zhou Enlai, who told him: [...] "You weren't responsible for becoming Emperor at the age of three or the 1917 attempted restoration coup. But you were fully to blame for what happened later. You knew perfectly well what you were doing when you took refuge in the Legation Quarter, when you traveled under Japanese protection to Tianjin, and when you agreed to become Manchukuo Chief Executive." [...] Puyi responded by merely saying that though he did not choose to be an emperor, he had behaved with savage cruelty as boy-emperor and wished he could apologize to all of the eunuchs he had flogged during his youth.|$|E
6000|$|Father's <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in the leather-goods {{department}} {{was the most}} difficult he had ever known.

He had to appear placidly official, almost pontifical, when vague ladies appeared, poked clippings from holiday magazines at him, and demanded, [...] "I want something like that." [...] "That" [...] usually depicted articles of whose use he had the most indefinite notions. Other ladies, ponderous ladies, who wanted vast quantities of free advice before purchasing Christmas presents, desired encyclopedic information about sewing-cases, picnic-sets, traveling pillow-cases, telephone-pads, guest-books, and [...] "a cover for my Social Register, and I want you to be sure it's the very latest thing." ...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the opportunities {{of creating a}} relevant addition to already existing risk assessment models, specific for military personnel, three subjects were examined. The first research focuses on useful components from the EmZoo report (2010) and the report of Krause (2008). The chapter written by Havelaar et al. (2010) “Emerging Zoonoses Information an Priority-setting system. ” contains 7 prioritizing criteria of which 5 where usable (Transmission between animals; Transmission from animals to humans; Transmission between humans; Morbidity and Mortality). Preventability and treatability are two health gain opportunity criteria selected from the report of Krause (2008), supplemented by the EmZoo (2010) criteria there is a start for a new model. To conserve fighting strength, deployment {{is the most important}} during a mission, so the operational readiness should be further examined. The second research attempted to quantify operational readiness, by questioning health and safety offices. In the questionnaire information on work related absence was collected, unfortunately there was little information collected about infectious diseases. In order to gather information on the <b>first</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> related absence, sick military personnel should be questioned. In the last research an example of a disease symptom questionnaire was created. Every soldier visiting a doctor should fill up this questionnaire in order to gather information on disease symptoms they suffer from. However, creating a valid questionnaire will take more effort than possible in this project. In conclusion an addition to already existing models can be made by a combination of criteria from the EmZoo report (2010) and Krause (2008) completed by “operational readiness”. However, further research and elaboration is needed to create a valid model for military use...|$|R
