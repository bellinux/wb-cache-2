5|$|Bird {{collections}} {{have been}} useful for retrospective studies. Bird collections offer {{the potential for}} current and <b>future</b> <b>researchers</b> to make in-depth morphological and molecular study of past avian diversity. One of the earliest and most famous examples of this {{was the use of}} egg collections from the 19th and early 20th centuries in determining that the pesticide DDT was producing eggshell-thinning in raptors. The ornithologists who collected the eggs could never have known that their work would one day help establish causes for declines and help in making conservation strategies to save bird such as peregrine falcons from possible extinction.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, {{fabricated}} {{samples of}} the Ahom script delayed translation of legitimate Ahom texts.

It was discovered years later, by Professor Prasert na Nagara, that the translation was unreliable. Despite these difficulties, along with the lack of native speakers and specific text, studies in Ahom have prevailed, and certain available scripts have been translated and transliterated, using known words, characters and context.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the information available {{on the subject of}} SGCs comes from research which was focused on the sensory neurons that the SGCs surround rather than the SGCs themselves. In the <b>future,</b> <b>researchers</b> plan to give more time and attention to the SGCs, which have many supportive and protective functions essential for life. Neurotransmitter and hormone receptors on SGCs in situ rather than in culture will likely be explored and definitively characterized. Changes in the receptors caused by various mutations and diseases will also be explored {{in order to determine the}} effect of these conditions. Additionally, the mechanisms behind neuronal-SGC communication is essentially unidentified, though it is likely that the various receptors both the neurons and SGCs have are used for chemical signaling, perhaps with P2Y. Ca2+ and NO and their effects must also be observed to gain further understanding of interactions between the two types of cells. Finally, the possibility of an influence of SGCs on synaptic transmission within autonomic ganglia provides another direction for future research.|$|E
30|$|Emerging technologies, {{with their}} {{promises}} {{as well as}} uncertainties about eventual performance and embedding in society, pose specific challenges to futures research. Standard methods of technological forecasting and technology assessment cannot be applied, or only partially.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is about the}} development of system event monitoring and their information will be displayed on Liquid Cristal Display (LCD). Monitoring of computing systems in an organization is required to ensure proper functioning of system services by detecting inconsistencies in system configuration. Monitoring the system also will enable system administrator to predict and prevent problems that might make the system or its peripherals unavailable to users. This project mainly focuses on developing a prototype that can display system monitoring information on LCD display in a real time environment. The LCD panel is connected to the computer via parallel port. The function of LCD panel is to display the information that can be gathered by using software that have been develop called ‘LCD Panel Utilities’ to communicate with the LCD. The application has been developed by using Pascal programming language. The development process follows the six phases in systematic design are preliminary study, gathering and analyzing requirements, LCD front panel design, software design and coding, testing and maintenance. At the end of the development, the prototype of the application is come out and readily to be tested. For <b>future</b> <b>researcher,</b> some extra features can be added at an application. Some features such as the local system information can be added into the application. <b>Future</b> <b>researcher</b> also can make this application at another platform operating system such as Linux and MacOs. The LCD application on this project is working on local computer only, so that hope that the <b>future</b> <b>researcher</b> can make it as a server client application where the real time information of client computer can be gathered by remotely. In this project, we only use 2 x 16 LCD size, for <b>future</b> <b>researcher,</b> they can use bigger LCD size for displaying purposes...|$|R

25|$|On 22 June 1922, in {{an attempt}} to {{dislodge}} Anti-Treaty forces holed up in the Four Courts, salvos were launched by Free State troops into the area housing Anti-Treaty munitions, which led to an enormous out-of-control fire. The massive conflagration spread rapidly, destroying the buildings and resulting in the almost total destruction of the mass of Irish historical records archived in the Public Records Office of Ireland (and {{in other parts of the}} Four Courts). As this closely followed the 1921 destruction of centuries of other important Irish records kept in the Custom House, Dublin, the cumulative effect was the annihilation of a huge swath of Ireland's historical resources, to the despair of <b>future</b> <b>researchers</b> seeking to document many aspects of Irish history. Subsequent efforts by archivists and other interested parties have played an extremely important role in attempting to replace what was lost but, though an impressive inventory of material has been amassed, continues to accumulate and is now housed in the National Archives of Ireland, much of what was lost in the 1922 fire was irreplaceable. Which side bore the burden of the blame for the fire led to recriminations in the fire's aftermath, but the question of which side was ultimately responsible remains unresolved.|$|E
500|$|From then on Reines {{dedicated}} {{the major}} part of his career {{to the study of}} the neutrino’s properties and interactions, which work would influence study of the neutrino for <b>future</b> <b>researchers</b> to come. Cowan left Los Alamos [...] in 1957 to teach at George Washington University, ending their collaboration. On the basis of his work in first detecting the neutrino, Reines [...] became the head of the physics department of Case Western Reserve University from 1959 to 1966. [...] At Case, he led a group that was the first to detect neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. Reines had a booming voice, and had been a singer since childhood. During this time, besides performing his duties as a research supervisor and chairman of the physics department, Reines sang in the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus under the direction of Robert Shaw in performances with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra.|$|E
500|$|According to Brook, [...] "in every age, {{a heroic}} sage struggles to rescue Benjamin from obscurity—and {{invariably}} fails." [...] Benjamin left no memoir and destroyed his personal papers, by which [...] "the task of <b>future</b> <b>researchers</b> and historians was made exceedingly difficult and laborious". [...] After his death, Benjamin was rarely written about, {{in contrast to}} Davis and other Confederate leaders. [...] Part of {{this was due to}} Benjamin depriving his potential biographers of source material, but even Davis, in his two-volume war memoir, mentions him only twice. Evans suggests that as Davis wrote the books in part to defend and memorialize his place in history, {{it would not have been}} characteristic of him to give much credit to Benjamin. Davis, in the midst of postwar business struggles, may have resented Benjamin's success as a barrister, or may have feared that allegations of involvement in Lincoln's assassination would again be made against the two men. Brook concurs that Benjamin's postwar success, that began as Davis lay in prison and other Confederates struggled for survival, may have soured Southerners towards the former secretary, but that anti-Semitism was also likely a factor. [...] "For the guardians of Confederate memory after Reconstruction, Benjamin became a kind of pet Jew, generally ignored, but then trotted out at opportune moments to defend the segregated South against charges of bigotry." ...|$|E

500|$|Foreman {{comments}} {{that in the}} years after Bax's death his reputation was kept alive by a single work – Tintagel. Kennedy estimates that it took [...] "twenty painful years" [...] before the music of the British romantics including Bax made headway against the dominance of modernism. Foreman dates the revival of Bax's music to Handley's performances of the Fourth Symphony and other works with the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1960s, and the pioneering recordings by Lyrita Recorded Edition of five of the symphonies. Scholarly consideration of Bax's life and music came with studies by Colin Scott-Sutherland (1973) and Foreman (1983). Bax's centenary in 1983 was marked by twenty programmes on BBC Radio 3, covering a wide range of the composer's music. In 1985 the Sir Arnold Bax Trust was established to promote the composer's work including the sponsoring of live performances and recording and publication of his music and writings. Since then a large number of Bax's works, major and minor, have been recorded (see below). The proliferation of Bax recordings has not been matched by a revival in his fortunes in the concert hall; the critic Stephen Moss observed in The Guardian in 2007, [...] "Bax is considered the promotional kiss of death." [...] In 1999 the Oxford University Press published a complete catalogue of Bax's works compiled and annotated by Graham Parlett; Music & Letters called it [...] "a benchmark for any <b>future</b> <b>researchers</b> seeking to compile a catalogue of a composer's works".|$|E
