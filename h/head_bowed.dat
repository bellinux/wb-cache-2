25|$|A {{full-length}} portrait {{sculpture of}} Junípero Serra {{is on the}} property of the mission. The cast stone sculpture, by Arthur Putnam, was completed in 1909, cast between 1916–1917 and installed in 1918 when the mission was remodeled. Funding for the piece came from D.J. McQuarry and it cost $500 to cast. It is approximately H. 6ft. 6 in. The sculpture depicts Serra wearing a monk's robe belted at the waist with a knotted rope and a rosary around his neck. He looks down, with his <b>head</b> <b>bowed</b> and eyes downward. The sculpture is on a concrete base. It is {{one of a series of}} allegorical figures commissioned by the estate of E. W. Scripps to depict California history. In 1993 it was examined by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. The program determined that the sculpture was well maintained.|$|E
500|$|At half-time, the {{trainers}} found on Schulz [...] "a mass {{of black and}} blue spots". [...] His [...] "face was distorted with bumps", and there were [...] "welts {{on his back and}} groin". [...] As the second half started, Schulz insisted he felt better and went back into the game. [...] But the attack continued. [...] "Another scrimmage and two more Penn men were after him again. [...] He went into the play and for an instant, his strength came back, but it couldn't last, and it didn't.” [...] Yost finally sent in a substitute, and Schulz limped to the sideline and walked slowly away [...] "with <b>head</b> <b>bowed</b> and hands to his stomach". [...] And when the [...] "rubbers" [...] removed his togs and examined him, [...] "they marveled {{that he was able to}} walk". [...] In the end, Schulz [...] "didn't say a wordbig tears rolled down as he lay there; Schultz was thoroughly beaten, but it took the entire Pennsylvania eleven to do it".|$|E
500|$|The {{figure of}} a cloaked young woman stands on top and at {{the centre of the}} front wall and overlooks the Douai Plains. She has her <b>head</b> <b>bowed,</b> her eyes cast down, and her chin resting in one hand. Below her at ground level is a sarcophagus, bearing a Brodie helmet and a sword, and draped in laurel branches. The saddened figure of Canada Bereft, also known as Mother Canada, is a {{national}} personification of the young nation of Canada, mourning her dead. The statue, a reference to traditional images of the [...] and presented in a similar style to that of Michelangelo's Pietà, faces eastward looking out to the dawn of the new day. Unlike the other statues on the monument, stonemasons carved Canada Bereft from a single 30tonne block of stone. The statue is the largest single piece in the monument and serves as a focal point. The area in front of the memorial was turned into a grassed space, which Allward referred to as the amphitheatre, that fanned out from the monument's front wall for a distance of [...] while the battle-damaged landscape around the sides and back of the monument were left untouched.|$|E

2500|$|Prayer {{in front}} of a crucifix, which is seen as a sacramental, is often part of devotion for Christians, {{especially}} those worshipping in a church, and also privately. The person may sit, stand, or kneel {{in front of}} the crucifix, sometimes looking at it in contemplation, or merely in front of it with <b>head</b> <b>bowed</b> or eyes closed. During the Middle Ages small crucifixes, generally hung on a wall, became normal in the personal cells or living quarters first of monks, then all clergy, followed by the homes of the laity, spreading down from the top of society as these became cheap enough for the average person to afford. Most towns had a large crucifix erected as a monument, or some other shrine at the crossroads of the town. [...] By the 19th century displaying a crucifix somewhere in the general reception areas of a house became typical of Catholic homes. Richer Catholics could afford a room set aside for a chapel.|$|E

2500|$|Tebowing is a {{neologism}} for {{the act of}} {{kneeling on}} one knee in prayer specifically with one's <b>head</b> <b>bowed</b> and an arm resting on the one bent knee, when kneeling, a form of genuflecting. It is derived from Tebow's propensity for kneeling and praying. The origin of the phrase is credited to fan Jared Kleinstein, who posted a picture with friends on Facebook, in which they mimicked a pose of Tebow following the Broncos' comeback overtime victory over the Dolphins on October 23, 2011. The popularity of the picture led Kleinstein {{to set up a}} website showing pictures submitted by people depicting various interpretations of Tebowing all over the world. After two-and-a-half months, the site received 20,000 photograph submissions and 20 million page views from 2 million unique visitors. The New York Times wrote [...] "it can be hard to tell whether [...] are celebrating or mocking [...] for his virtuous ways." [...] Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl tebowed as part of a bet with the mayor of Denver following the Broncos playoff victory over the Steelers in 2012. On October 9, 2012, Tebow was awarded the trademark to Tebowing after winning a legal battle with two fans who had expressed interest in trademarking the name.|$|E
