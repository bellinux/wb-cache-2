In 1987, Reubens provided the voice of REX, the main robot in the George Lucas produced Disneyland attraction, Star Tours, and reprised the role of Pee-wee Herman in cameo appearances in the <b>film</b> <b>Back</b> to the Beach and TV show Sesame Street, the latter of which made a cameo in Playhouse.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to cover versions, the song {{has also been}} employed in various film and television soundtracks. The 1991 film Earth Angel was named after the song. The song {{has been used in}} the television series Happy Days. It was featured prominently in the <b>film</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future (performed by Harry Waters Jr. as Marvin Berry & The Starlighters), as well as Superman III and The Karate Kid Part II. It is also used in the jukebox musical Jersey Boys, a musical about the rock band The Four Seasons. Australian group Human Nature covered the song on their 2014 album Jukebox.|$|E

5|$|Michael J. Fox was {{the first}} choice to play Marty McFly, but he was {{committed}} to the show Family Ties. Family Ties producer Gary David Goldberg felt that Fox was essential to the show's success. With co-star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, he refused to allow Fox time off {{to work on a}} <b>film.</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film. Zemeckis' next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly. Because of the difficult casting process, the start date was pushed back twice.|$|E
5|$|Six {{weeks from}} {{theatrical}} release, no dubbing {{had taken place}} and the score had not been written as Horner was unable to view the completed film. The final cue for the scene in which Ripley battles the alien queen was written overnight. Cameron completely reworked the scene, leaving Horner to rewrite the music. As Gale Hurd {{did not have much}} music production experience, she and Cameron denied Horner's request to push the <b>film</b> <b>back</b> four weeks so he could finish the score. Horner felt that, given more time, he could get the score to 100% of his satisfaction rather than the 80% he estimated {{he had been able to}} achieve. The score was recorded in roughly four days. Despite his troubles, Horner received an Academy Award nomination (his first) for Best Original Score.|$|E

25|$|DeLorean {{designed}} {{a number of}} vehicles throughout his career, including the Pontiac GTO muscle car, the Pontiac Firebird, Pontiac Grand Prix, Chevrolet Vega, and the DeLorean DMC-12 sports car, which was later featured in the 1985 <b>film</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future. While still the youngest division head in General Motors history, DeLorean broke away {{to start his own}} company, DeLorean Motor Company (DMC), in 1973. However, production delays meant DMC's first car and DeLorean's independent creative opus—the DMC-12—did not reach the consumer market until 1981 (8 years later), where a depressed buying market was compounded by unexpectedly lukewarm reviews from critics and the public. After a year, the DMC-12 had failed to recoup its $175 million in investment costs, unsold cars were accumulating and the company faced dire financial straits.|$|E
25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first <b>film,</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned that if you were going to make a time machine, you would want it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of filming, Richter had a 300-page book called The Essential Buckaroo that {{consisted}} of notes and had every incomplete script Mac Rauch wrote over the years. Principal photography began during {{the second week of}} September 1983 on locations in and around South Gate, an industrial suburb of L.A. Buckaroo's neurosurgery scene with New Jersey was shot at the Lakeview Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley. The jet car sequences were shot in October on a dry lake north of the San Bernardino Mountains. The vehicle was designed and built by Riva, art director Stephen Dane and Thrust Racing owners Jerry Segal and George Haddebeck. Segal started with a Ford F-350 truck, reinforced the frame assembly, added the front end from a Grand National stock car, borrowed air scoops from a DC-3, and a one-man cockpit modeled after a Messerschmitt fighter plane. Under the hood, Segal modified the Ford engine with an oversized carburetor and nitrous oxide injectors. The Oscillation Overthruster was created by Riva and visual effects supervisor Michael Fink out of a gyroscope to which a metal frame, wires, circuits, and tiny strobe lights were added. The design was the basis for the Flux Capacitor in the 1985 <b>film</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future. The prop itself would ultimately be reused a number of times on various Star Trek episodes.|$|E
500|$|President Ronald Reagan, {{a fan of}} the film, {{referred}} to the film in his 1986 State of the Union Address when he said, [...] "Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement. As they said in the <b>film</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future, 'Where we're going, we don't need roads'." [...] When he first saw the joke about him being president, he ordered the projectionist of the theater to stop the reel, roll it back, and run it again.|$|E
500|$|Hathaway {{believes}} that Blunt's career took {{off because of}} her role. [...] "I've never witnessed a star being born before," [...] Hathaway says. [...] "That's the first time I watched it happen." [...] Blunt agrees that it was [...] "a night and day change" [...] for her—the day after the film was released, she told Variety, {{the staff at the}} coffee shop she had been going to for breakfast every morning in Los Angeles suddenly recognized her. Even ten years later, people still quote her lines from the <b>film</b> <b>back</b> to her at least once a week, she says.|$|E

500|$|As {{the story}} {{comes to a}} close, Luke {{interrupts}} the ending sequence and raises the viewer's awareness {{to all of the}} [...] "unanswered questions" [...] that the movie leaves behind. The Western Union postal worker from the 1989 <b>film</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future Part II then appears, and hands Luke a message delivered by Doc Brown from the year 1885, with the story then ending on the words [...] "To be Concluded", in the same fashion of Back to the Future. Composer Alan Silvestri allowed the producers to use his Back to the Future theme since he's a fan of Family Guy.|$|E

500|$|Superman was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} released in June 1978, the 40th anniversary of Action Comics 1, which first introduced Superman, but the problems during filming pushed the <b>film</b> <b>back</b> by six months. Editor Stuart Baird reflected, [...] "Filming was finished in October 1978 and it is a miracle we had the film released two months later. Big-budgeted films today tend to take six to eight months." [...] Donner, for his part, wished that he had [...] "had another six months; I would have perfected a lot of things. But at some point, you've gotta turn the picture over." [...] Warner Bros. spent $7million to market and promote the film.|$|E

50|$|Film holders that adapt {{rollfilm}} to {{sheet film}} cameras are usually called <b>film</b> <b>backs.</b> <b>Film</b> <b>backs</b> for 4&times;5 inch cameras are particularly common - {{there is little}} point in taking 6&times;9 cm pictures on a 20 x 25 cm camera. Horseman, Linhof, Graflex, and other manufacturers have made roll film holders in 6&times;7, 6&times;8, 6&times;9, 6&times;12, and 6&times;17 cm formats. Some models can slip under the ground glass like a normal sheet film holder, while others require that the photographer replace the ground glass with the roll holder.|$|R
