500|$|In 2009, Kapoor {{collaborated with}} {{nutritionist}} Rujuta Diwekar on Don't Lose Your Mind, Lose Your Weight, a book {{which focused on}} the principles of healthy eating habits. Published by Random House Publications, the book was well received by critics, and sold 10,000 copies within its first twenty days. A follow-up titled, Women and The Weight Loss Tamasha, was released two years later. It addressed the weight loss concerns and eating habits of women in various parts of their life, and featured Kapoor in a voice-over for the audiobook. In February 2013, Kapoor released her autobiographical memoir: The Style Diary of a Bollywood Diva. Co-authored alongside Rochelle Pinto, it became the first book to be launched under the Shobhaa De imprint of Penguin Books—a set of series that included celebrity memoirs, guides and biographies. In a review published by Mint, Shefalee Vasudev criticised the writing style as [...] "too-breezy" [...] but further stated that it is [...] "a well-produced book, reproducing chirpy little post-it notes and diet charts, punctuated with Bebo's stunning pictures from her private albums to fashion magazine covers." [...] Later that year, she collaborated with Diwekar for the third time on The Indian Food Wisdom and The Art of <b>Eating</b> <b>Right,</b> a documentary film about nutrition.|$|E

[...] According to Rogers Hornsby, who served as a player-coach for the Giants in 1927, either McGraw or one of his coaches would knock on the players' hotel room doors at 11:30 sharp—and someone was expected to answer.
