25|$|Only one {{candidate}} was fired, {{despite the fact}} that Sir Alan had previously said that three people were going to get fired. This was because he felt that he could not separate the four finalists based on what he had seen so far, so he chose to have them face one last test to help him with his final decision. While Lucinda was not shown to be fired with regret, it was shown on Why <b>I</b> <b>Fired</b> Them that she was.|$|E
25|$|The Apprentice: Why <b>I</b> <b>Fired</b> Them is a {{documentary}} special which first aired alongside the third series, {{and focuses on}} Lord Alan Sugar looking back over the current series, and discussing the merits and shortcomings of the candidates he fired up to the time the programme is aired. Joined by his advisers, he explains in more detail about why he fired each candidate at each stage of the competition, whilst reviewing the performances of the finalists for that series. For the seventh series, the programme was not broadcast; instead it was replaced with a similar documentary special entitled How To Get Hired, which was presented by Dara Ó Briain.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the You're Fired audience {{and two of the}} panellists agreed with Sir Alan's decision. Torode, who disagreed, thought that Kevin should have been fired instead of Ian. On Why <b>I</b> <b>Fired</b> Them, despite having serious concerns with the three candidates in the final boardroom, Sir Alan noted that Ian's fate was sealed by the complete arrogance he displayed. This was due to him making the bizarre lie that Kevin had not held a motivational talk with the rest of Renaissance outside the pub {{towards the end of the}} day, which was contradicted by both Kevin and Simon, along with the fact that it had been recorded by the film crew following them.|$|E

Meessen worked alone, never taking a partner while in the Indies, and documented the land and people in the colony in his albumen prints. In his ethnographic photography of the indigenous peoples of the Indies, he often had to overcome superstitions which, the Bataviaasch Handelsblad wrote, [...] "made taking images of the people outside Java almost impossible". Others were more enthusiastic, including the villagers of Nias: [...] "Upon arrival <b>I</b> <b>fired</b> a few shots and flew the Dutch flag. Soon the villagers came and asked what I wanted.

500|$|Lieutenant Teófilo Marxuach was {{the officer}} of the day at El Morro Castle on March 21, 1915. The Odenwald, built in 1903 (not to be {{confused}} with the German World War II war ship which carried the same name), was an armed German supply ship which tried to force its way out of the San Juan Bay and deliver supplies to the German submarines waiting in the Atlantic Ocean. Lt. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on the ship from the walls of the fort. Sergeant Encarnacion Correa then manned a machine gun and fired warning shots with little effect.

The shots ordered by Lt. Marxuach were the first fired by the United States in World War I. The Odenwald was confiscated by the United States and renamed SS Newport. It was assigned to the U.S. Shipping Board, where it served until 1924 when it was retired.|$|E

It was a feeling I can't describe. I still get it every time I get into a race car." [...] Andretti's first racing experience was in a new youth racing league called Formula Junior [...] in Ancona, Italy when he was thirteen years old. However, the [...] Formula Junior story is likely apocryphal. In an interview during an , Mr. Andretti recounts the story of his early days of Dirt Track racing in Pennsylvania with his brother, Aldo, and implies that he and his brother made up the story of racing in the Formula Junior league because they looked the part after having purchased racing suits from Italy.|$|E

2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Faith 7 flight {{there were}} mission-threatening {{technical}} problems. During the 19th orbit, the capsule had a power failure. Carbon dioxide levels began rising, and the cabin temperature jumped to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38°C). Cooper turned to his understanding of star patterns, took manual control of the tiny capsule and successfully estimated the correct pitch for re-entry into the atmosphere. Some precision was needed in the calculation, since if the capsule came in too steep, g-forces would be too large, and if its trajectory were too shallow, it would shoot out of the atmosphere again, back into space. Cooper drew lines on the capsule window to help him check his orientation before firing the re-entry rockets. [...] "So I used my wrist watch for time," [...] he later recalled, [...] "my eyeballs out the window for attitude. Then <b>I</b> <b>fired</b> my retrorockets at the right time and landed right by the carrier." [...] Cooper's cool-headed performance and piloting skills led to a basic rethinking of design philosophy for later space missions.|$|E
