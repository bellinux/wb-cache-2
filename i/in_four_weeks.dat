25|$|The first {{prototype}} {{proved to}} be overweight, while the new engines gave much less power than expected, delivering only 1,970hp compared with the expected 2,700hp.

25|$|Three Buccaneer {{starters}} {{went out}} with injuries, most significantly Doug Williams, who suffered a broken jaw on a Jack Youngblood blitz. Darryl Carlton separated a shoulder, and Dewey Selmon broke his wrist. Mike Rae played in relief of Williams, completing 9 of 17 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown. The Rams double-covered both Buccaneer receivers, leaving no coverage to prevent Rae from rushing for 95 yards on four carries. Ricky Bell had his first 100-yard rushing day, with 21 carries for 104 yards. The Buccaneers set several team records in this game: 209 yards was their highest rushing total yet, Bell's 555 yards were a Buccaneer single-season rushing record, and Neil O'Donoghue's 38 points were a new season scoring record. Although the Rams were not on McKay's list of 18 teams that he felt the Buccaneers were competitive with, Tampa Bay rallied to a 23–23 fourth-quarter tie before losing on a late Frank Corral field goal. It was the Buccaneers’ third fourth-quarter collapse <b>in</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks.</b> The Buccaneers’ performance drew cheers from the Los Angeles crowd, among whom McKay was still a popular figure.|$|E
