40|$|Since {{the early}} nineties {{regionalism}} {{has been a}} key element in the relations between Europe and South America. The EU has offered to Mercosur direct support based on its own integration experience. It has become an external unifier for South American regionalism and Mercosur has considered the EU as a reference. The EU and Mercosur have planed to establish an ambitious <b>interregional</b> <b>Association</b> <b>agreement.</b> However, {{since the beginning of the}} twenty first century the interregional relationship is going through a period of uncertainties. Several factors are affecting it such as the incoherence of the EU policy and the EU-Brazil partnership as well as the loose of EU influence combined with the political radicalism and economic nationalism in South America.

40|$|The European Union (EU) and Mercosur talks {{have been}} stalled since discussions were resumed in 2000. Recurring {{protectionist}} and institutional obstacles have slowed down negotiations. The financial crisis, however, {{has resulted in}} low domestic demand in the EU. This has made the <b>interregional</b> <b>association</b> <b>agreement</b> (IAA) with Mercosur more attractive. The loss of the Generalized Scheme of Preference (GSP) status {{and the lack of}} a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU have both disadvantaged Mercosur. A further window of opportunity is opening up in Mercosur. In Brazil, there have been cries for a change in government. In Argentina, presidential elections will take place in October 2015 and will assuredly bring an end to Kirchnerismo. A change in leadership in both countries is expected to make agreement more likely. Protectionist policies are not expected to remain as high if there is change in government. This will provide the EU with an opportunity to advance the negotiations and conclude the IAA...|$|E

50|$|A European Union <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> (for short, <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> or AA) is {{a treaty}} between the European Union (EU), its Member States and a non-EU country {{that creates a}} {{framework}} for co-operation between them.

However, an <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the EU legislation implies such {{a high level of}} convergence that the effective implementation of the Europeanization process is irreversible. In addition, the <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the European Union is the real mechanism of political association and gradual economic integration. However, it should be understood that the agreement is contributing to a lot of things, many of which gives rise to liability.

2500|$|However, {{there is}} also the largely defunct term of {{associate}} member. It has occasionally been applied to states which have signed an <b>association</b> <b>agreement</b> with the EU. Associate membership is not a formal classification and does not entitle the state to any of the representation of free movement rights that full membership allows. The term is almost unheard of in the modern context and was primarily used in the earlier days of the EU with countries such as Greece and Turkey. Turkey's <b>association</b> <b>agreement</b> was the 1963 Ankara Agreement, implying that Turkey became an associate member that year. Present <b>association</b> <b>agreements</b> include the Stabilisation and <b>Association</b> <b>Agreements</b> with the western Balkans; these states are no longer termed [...] "associate members".|$|R
50|$|Stabilisation and <b>Association</b> <b>agreements</b> {{are part}} of the EU Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) and European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). At present, the {{countries}} of the Western Balkans are the focus of the SAP. Specific Stabilisation and <b>Association</b> <b>Agreements</b> (SAA) have been implemented with various Balkan countries which explicitly include provisions for future EU membership of the country involved. SAAs are similar in principle to the Europe Agreements signed with the Central and Eastern European countries in the 1990s and to the <b>Association</b> <b>Agreement</b> with Turkey.|$|R
