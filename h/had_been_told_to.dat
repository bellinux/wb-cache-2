5|$|On {{the day of}} the attack, 56 {{heads of}} state were meeting in Algiers for the 4th conference of the Non-Aligned Movement. According to Seale, the Saudi Embassy {{operation}} had been commissioned by Iraq's president, Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr, as a distraction because he was jealous that Algeria was hosting the conference. Seale writes one of the hostage-takers admitted that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> fly the hostages around until the conference was over.|$|E
5|$|Watt {{was waiting}} for the order, and in 1938 had {{arranged}} for production of the transmitters at Metrovick and receivers at A.C. Cossor. These {{turned out to be the}} wrong products: Metrovick <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> directly copy ("Chinese") the 1937 design by Percy Hibberd, but Bawdsey had delivered the wrong prototype to Metrovick, who copied it. The Cossor receivers were found to be unusable, weighing as much as the entire transmitter and receiver, and having sensitivity about half that of the EMI lash-up.|$|E
5|$|Lister {{explained}} {{that she and her}} fellow cast members filmed on many locations, including army barracks. They filmed at Tatenhill Airfield, where staff <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> remain secretive about the storyline. She also revealed that she was the only cast member out of her, Batley and Kelly who performed the aired skydiving for real. A Hollyoaks producer released two pictures of funeral wreaths, one reading 'Zoe' and the other 'Sarah', in order to confuse viewers further as to whom the victim would be. On-screen after the skydive and Sarah's subsequent death, Lydia framed Zoe for the murder she committed, leading to her arrest.|$|E

5|$|Following {{their long}} delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the Moor. They disembarked at Southampton in early March 1889, and {{travelled}} by train to London, where they {{checked into the}} Berners Hotel on Oxford Street. They were invited to Windsor Castle after two days in the capital. The audience was originally meant only for the two izinDuna and their interpreter—Maund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject—but Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him; the Colonial Secretary {{said that it would}} be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality. The emissaries duly met the Queen and delivered the letter from Lobengula, as well as an oral message they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> pass on.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{proposed}} dockless bike sharing for the Citi Bike network, {{which would}} allow bikes to be rented without being tethered to docks. This was proposed after several bike sharing companies announced their intent to operate in New York City. In early August, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> cease and desist operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share operator in New York City. By {{the end of the}} month, Citi Bike started designing a dockless prototype that could still lock its own wheels based on whether the customer had paid. Meanwhile, Spin—a viable competitor to Citi Bike with lower per-half-hour pricing—was still looking to get a permit to start operations in New York City.|$|E
5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E

25|$|Duffy {{responded to}} the ban by citing the level of {{violence}} in the plays of Shakespeare and by stating that she considered the message of the poem to be pro-learning and anti-violence. Some teachers stated that they would continue to teach the poem. The BBC reported that schools <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> destroy copies of the Anthology which contained the poem. In 2002 a school in Hull refused to teach the poem.|$|E
25|$|According to Shakespeare's first biographer Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare fled Stratford {{after he}} got in trouble for {{poaching}} deer from local squire Thomas Lucy, and that he then wrote a scurrilous ballad about Lucy. It is also reported, according to a note added by Samuel Johnson to the 1765 edition of Rowe's Life, that Shakespeare minded the horses for theatre patrons in London. Johnson adds that that story <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> Alexander Pope by Rowe.|$|E
25|$|Pope Leo XIII {{composed}} the Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus in 1899 and included {{it in his}} 1899 encyclical Annum sacrum which consecrated the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

Although there appeared to be considerable uncertainty over whether Impact's sub-team of Saira, Paul and Raj would arrive back in time, it was later revealed that they had done so comfortably ahead of the deadline, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> wait outside for a while by the production crew in order to add a degree of suspense to the final edit.|$|E
25|$|A {{meeting of}} {{the heads of the}} army—including Kawashima, Kashii and Sugiyama—had been held from the early morning onward (Araki and Mazaki had {{attempted}} to attend but <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> leave, as the SMC had no authority). Kawashima and Kashii attempted to convince the group to avoid violence, but when 10:00 passed without any word of movement by the rebel officers, they approved the use of force. However, when Hori and Kofuji came to see Kashii at 10:40, the three agreed that it was too early to enact the imperial command. It has also been suggested that a lack of preparedness on the part of government forces was another factor. Either way, the action was delayed.|$|E

He claimed that at an Inuit camp, a man had stolen a rifle {{from one of the}} priests and gotten into a fight with Le Roux. Although the Inuit who had stolen the weapon wanted to kill Le Roux, the priests managed to escape. Sinnisiak and Uloqsaq began to follow the priests, and caught up with them at Bloody Falls, where Sinnisiak stabbed and shot the two men. Although Uloqsaq assisted on Sinnisiak's urging, he said {{that he did not want}} to kill the priest and only did so because he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> by Sinnisiak.|$|E
25|$|It emerges {{that this}} {{messenger}} was formerly a shepherd on Mount Cithaeron, {{and that he}} was given a baby, which the childless Polybus then adopted. The baby, he says, was given to him by another shepherd from the Laius household, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> get rid of the child. Oedipus asks the chorus if anyone knows who this man was, or where he might be now. They respond that he is the same shepherd who was witness to the murder of Laius, and whom Oedipus had already sent for. Jocasta, who has by now realized the truth, desperately begs Oedipus to stop asking questions, but he refuses and Jocasta runs into the palace.|$|E
25|$|According to {{an account}} given by four survivors, {{who managed to}} swim to nearby Sibuyan Island, Princess of the Stars had not malfunctioned (as had been {{previously}} reported), but ran into rough seas {{off the coast of}} Romblon. At 11:30am, passengers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> put on life jackets, and fifteen minutes later, the captain gave the order to abandon ship. The ship began to tilt at around midday. The survivors witnessed many people jumping into the water, while some made it onto life rafts.

The ferry finally capsized at 1 pm noontime.|$|E
