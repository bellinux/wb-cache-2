25|$|Arthur Berry... was a {{good teacher}} and focus for art {{activity}} at the Burslem & Stoke Art School. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> that he is for many the finest 20th century artist from Stoke - there are other candidates also. Mr Berry's work lies somewhere between painting and drawing - for me paint and its properties hold most attraction. Mr Berry's talent was spread over several areas - drawing, painting, writing, plays, poems and teaching. I do not think I am good enough myself to do several things well, so concentrate on one (painting). Mr Berry said he admired Lowry and once encountered him in a Manchester Gallery - said he was built and made for a particular task - as an artist recording the vanishing industrial scene of Manchester....Mr Berry was, I feel, a humorist whose interest was {{the people of the}} old working class of Stoke - a type of person who no longer exists. I mostly liked his landscapes. They seemed to convey that strange Stoke light which appeals to me and the old buildings and streets which were very much part of my own childhood and youth.|$|E
500|$|Fischer won the Interzonal (held in Palma de Mallorca in November and December 1970) with 18½/23 (+15−1=7), {{far ahead}} of Larsen, Efim Geller, and Robert Hübner, with 15/23. Fischer {{finished}} the tournament with seven consecutive wins. Setting aside the Sousse Interzonal (which Fischer withdrew from while leading), Fischer's victory gave him a string of eight consecutive first prizes in tournaments. Former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik was not, however, impressed by Fischer's results, stating: [...] "Fischer has been declared a genius. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with this... In order to rightly be declared a genius in chess, you have to defeat equal opponents by a big margin. As yet he has not done this". Despite Botvinnik's remarks, [...] "Fischer began a miraculous year {{in the history of}} chess".|$|E
2500|$|The other {{threat to}} the {{security}} of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I think they should be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights {{of the rest of us}} are hardly safe … ...|$|E

60|$|He {{then asked}} me if I would swear to be secret, and that, if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> to what he proposed, I would {{nevertheless}} never betray him. I readily bound myself to that, upon the most solemn imprecations and curses that the devil and both of us could invent.|$|R
2500|$|Octavian Bot, {{a member}} of {{parliament}} and member of Liberal Democratic Party (Romania) stated for a press interview that [...] "As a liberal, having a liberal mindset agree with sexual relations regarding same-sex, it is probably the way nature {{wanted them to be}} but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> in legalizing marriage. Same-sex marriage is not in my opinion a human rights issue. If we are going this path we'll end up legalizing marriages between a woman and a stallion. I'm joking of course but marriage seems forced, it's too much" ...|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin {{repeatedly}} interrupted a major {{speech by}} U.S. President Barack Obama regarding United States {{policy in the}} War on Terror at the National Defense University on May 23, 2013. After Benjamin was removed for her actions, Mr. Obama then went off script. [...] "The voice of that woman is worth paying attention to," [...] he said. [...] "Obviously <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with much of what she said. And obviously she wasn't listening to me and much of what I said. But these are tough issues. And the suggestion that we can gloss over them is wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 14 August 2013, {{following}} a violent crackdown by security forces on supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi, in {{which at least}} 525 people were killed, ElBaradei resigned as vice president. In his resignation letter, ElBaradei stated: [...] "...I always saw peaceful alternatives for resolving this societal wrangling. Certain solutions were proposed, which could have led to national conciliation, but things have come this far ... It has become {{difficult for me to}} continue bearing the responsibility for decisions with which <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> and the consequences of which I fear. I cannot bear the responsibility for a single drop of blood before God, before my own conscience or the citizens..." [...] He then left the country for Vienna, where he was previously based in his UN capacity.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a big Marlin and you've got him foul-hooked," [...] he asserted. This {{statement}} {{was made at}} the end of three hours and more. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree.</b> Dan and <b>I</b> often had arguments. He always tackled me when I was in some such situation as this--for then, of course, he had the best of it. My brother Rome was in the boat that day, an intensely interested observer. He had not as yet hooked a swordfish.|$|R
50|$|With all {{the supply}} lines being cut off, the encircled Turks were {{threatened}} by hunger and disease. Kutuzov proposed supplying the Turks {{with food and}} provisions {{to allow them to}} survive. Tsar Alexander <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with Kutuzov's idea, but Kutuzov explained that by keeping the Turks alive, he actually was holding a larger number of hostages and that would force the Sultan to negotiate. The plan was successful and on 28 May 1812 the Treaty of Bucharest was signed.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2017, when Theresa May {{pledged to}} repeal the Hunting Act 2004 which would allow fox hunting to be legalised, Harper stood by his belief that the Act should be repealed. He said: [...] "If we were faced with the same pledge as last time I would vote {{to repeal the}} Act, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with it being banned and I am not opposed to hunting. I don't see any problem with it. That is {{consistent}} with the position I have taken at each election." ...|$|R
2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje. The president of the republic, Branko Crvenkovski, announced: [...] "If during the ongoing talks we can reach a rational compromise, which from the one side will defend our ethnic identity, and from the other will enable us to receive the NATO invitation, {{while at the same time}} canceling our further EU accession obstacles, then I think that this is something that must be supported, and I personally side with the supporters. Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree,</b> because we are not in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations. The one who will tell me that the price is high, is obliged to address the public opinion and announce an alternative scenario on how Macedonia will develop in the next ten to fifteen years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, Morley {{wrote to}} Auberon Herbert, an extreme {{opponent}} of state intervention, that [...] "I {{am afraid that}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with you as to paternal government. I am no partisan of a policy of incessant meddling with individual freedom, but I do strongly believe that in so populous a society as ours now is, you may well have a certain protection thrown over classes {{of men and women}} who are unable to protect themselves". In 1885 Morley spoke out against those Liberals who believed that all state intervention was wrong and proclaimed: [...] "I am not prepared to allow that the Liberty and the Property Defence League are the only people with a real grasp of Liberal principles, that Lord Bramwell and the Earl of Wemyss are the only Abdiels of the Liberal Party". Later that year Morley defined his politics: [...] "I am a cautious Whig by temperament, I am a Liberal by training, and I am a thorough Radical by observation and experience".|$|E
60|$|If {{there be}} those who would not save the Union unless they could {{at the same time}} destroy slavery, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with them.|$|E
5000|$|During Rajkumar's funeral, {{he could}} not hide his {{emotions}} and said [...] "I have spoken to him only thrice in my life. My mother wanted me {{to speak to him}} once before we went to Tirupati, to which <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree.</b> Now, if <b>I</b> want to speak to him for the fourth time, I have to be born as his son in my next life also," [...] said Vinod, rendering a song - ‘Elligo E Payana...’ from the Raj-starrer ‘Sipayi Ramu’ and throwing mud as a symbol of interring. The mother and son had tonsured their head one day before Rajkumar's death.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>not</b> said <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with them," [...] he replied, {{taking up}} his own defence; [...] "the point is not that men are more inconstant than women, but that women have more excuse for inconstancy. If I {{remember}} correctly, Desmond, {{in a letter to}} Rosamond, says: 'Inconstancy in a woman, because of the present social conditions, is often pardonable. In a man, nothing is more despicable.' I think that is so. I believe that a man should stick by the woman to whom he has given his word as closely as he sticks by his friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{very much}} {{interested}} and gratified by your letter concerning [...] "A Tale of Two Cities." [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> quite <b>agree</b> {{with you on}} two points, but that is no deduction from my pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is this, mamma. Dolly and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> {{about these}} things, and I don't intend {{to let her}} manage me just {{in the way she}} thinks right." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I will {{do nothing}} of the kind. I do not at all {{think that it is}} a fitting habit for young ladies. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with Mrs. Westmacott upon the point." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will think}} of it, since you wish it. And now, what general idea have you of the plan to adopt? <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> {{positively}} <b>agree</b> to your suggestion as yet, so I may perhaps ask the question.' ...|$|R
2500|$|At Swim-Two-Birds {{presents}} {{itself as a}} first-person story by an unnamed Irish student of literature. [...] The student believes that [...] "one beginning and one ending for a book was a thing <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with", and he accordingly sets three apparently quite separate stories in motion. [...] The first concerns the Pooka MacPhellimey, [...] "a member of the devil class". [...] The second is about {{a young man named}} John Furriskey, who {{turns out to be a}} fictional character created by another of the student's creations, Dermot Trellis, a cynical writer of Westerns. [...] The third consists of the student's adaptations of Irish legends, mostly concerning Finn Mac Cool and Mad King Sweeney.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, dear, {{he simply}} {{said that as}} he had had the misfortune to displease you--I think those were his very words--he {{thought it would be}} better to stay away. I could <b>not</b> say that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with him and so the matter dropped. Of course I am sorry, for I have always liked the lad. Naturally the {{interest}} he has shown in us in this trouble and the pains he has taken about it have quite renewed the old feeling. I have turned to him for advice and talked matters over with him almost as if he had been a son, and, of course, I shall miss him a good deal now--but it cannot be helped.' ...|$|R
6000|$|CONFUCIUS. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree.</b> The Englishman is {{not fitted}} by nature to {{understand}} politics. Ever since the public services have been manned by Chinese, {{the country has}} been well and honestly governed. What more is needed? ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> {{with you}} on the League {{question}}, nor on the woman question connected with it, only we will not quarrel to-day, and I have written enough already without an argument at the end.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} should have a talk," [...] the wub said. [...] "I'd like to discuss this with you, Captain, if I might. I can see that you and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> on some basic issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike D'Antonio owns {{a graphic}} design company called Darkicon Designs {{and has made}} album covers and various other pieces of art (T-shirts, posters, logos, etc.) for bands such as Shadows Fall, All That Remains, Crowbar among others. Killswitch Engage made sure to have written in their {{contract}} with Roadrunner that D'Antonio would produce all of the band's artwork. D'Antonio stated about the cover of Alive or Just Breathing, [...] "I wanted something that looked 'old school cut-and-paste' for the cover. Something with texture that appeared like it was just laid down and photographed. I remember Roadrunner hating the cover, saying {{there was too much}} going on and nothing to focus on. I told them <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree,</b> and that some day they would get it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "As I {{look back}} to last year, I realize again and again how much we {{appreciated}} having you with us. Your stimulating ideas proved very valuable even if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> always <b>agree</b> with you fully. However, if we all agreed {{it would be very}} unfortunate for experimental science, for there would not then be anything for us to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so. That {{is exactly}} my idea," [...] said Mr. Gibson. [...] "On all such {{subjects}} as that I {{should be so}} sorry if you and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree.</b> <b>I</b> really should." [...] Then he paused, and Dorothy was so confounded by what she conceived to be {{the dangers of the}} coming moment that she was unable even to think what she ought to say. She heard Mrs. MacHugh's clear, sharp, merry voice, and she heard her aunt's tone of pretended anger, and she heard Sir Peter's continued laughter, and Brooke Burgess as he continued the telling of some story; but her own trouble was too great to allow of her attending {{to what was going on}} at the other end of the room. [...] "There is nothing as to which I am so anxious as that you and I should agree about serious things," [...] said Mr. Gibson.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{why could}} you not tell him {{yourself}} {{what you had to}} say? He and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> about certain things, and I do not like to carry messages to him. And you have seen him here on this sacre sea-coast?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The Guardian was bitter, satirical, and personal; {{but it was}} earnest, and it {{published}} facts. It attracted wide attention among colored people; it circulated {{among them}} all over the country; it was quoted and discussed. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> wholly <b>agree</b> with the Guardian, and indeed only a few Negroes did, but nearly all read it and were influenced by it. [...] - W.E.B. Du Bois ...|$|R

25|$|In the Second Test Ray Illingworth {{was put in}} to bat, but Rowan refused {{his request}} for the roller to be used on the wicket before play began. Rowan later {{realised}} his mistake and apologised in the lunch break. Even John Snow applauded when he and Tom Brooks refused to start play at Melbourne in the abandoned Third Test. Ian Johnson and the Melbourne authorities were desperate to get the game going, but the umpires refused to be pressured as the field was quite unfit for play. Snow found Max O'Connell 'a very reasonable and fair man, even if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> with him' {{and that they could}} talk problems through. Brooks {{was the only one of}} the umpires who had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game.|$|R
