50|$|The <b>international</b> <b>search</b> <b>report</b> {{can help}} the {{applicant}} decide {{whether it would be}} worthwhile seeking national protection, and if so, in how many countries, as fees and other expenses, including translation costs, must be paid to enter the national phase in each country. Yet another advantage of filing a PCT application under the PCT is that many national patent authorities will rely on the <b>international</b> <b>search</b> <b>report</b> (although the PCT does not obligate them to do so) instead of performing a prior art search themselves, and the applicant may thus be able to save search fees.|$|E
50|$|A search or {{international}} search is then {{made by an}} authorised International Searching Authority (ISA) {{to find the most}} relevant prior art documents regarding the claimed subject matter. The search results in an <b>International</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Report</b> (ISR), together with a written opinion regarding patentability. The ISA(s) that the applicant can choose depends on the receiving Office with which the applicant filed the international application. In 2013, the most selected ISAs were the European Patent Office (EPO) (with 37.7% of all ISRs issued), followed by the Japan Patent Office (JPO) (20.7%) and the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) (14.8%).|$|E
5000|$|In {{reaction}} {{to such a}} request from the International Searching Authority (ISA), the applicant may pay all {{or some of the}} requested additional search fees, and the International Searching Authority (ISA) then establishes the international search for all or some of the inventions or groups of inventions, respectively. The applicant may also decide not to pay any of the additional search fees, and, in such case, the ISA does not carry out a search for the inventions or groups of inventions for which no search fees have been paid. The <b>international</b> <b>search</b> <b>report</b> (ISR) is then established only for the first claimed invention.|$|E
40|$|Since China acceded to the PCT in 1994, the Chinese Patent Office {{has been}} {{establishing}} examination search files {{to meet the}} requirements of the PCT minimum documentation. In order to have a basis for future work, this paper gives statistics and analysis by categories of the relevant documents cited in 159 PCT <b>international</b> <b>search</b> <b>reports</b> which the CPO finished in 1994 and 1995, including countries, number of documents and technical fields. The conclusions are as follows: 1. (1) the technical fields of the majority of Chinese patents seeking protection outside China in 1994 and 1995 claimed medical apparatus and instruments, and health care medicines; 2. (2) at present, the starting year for search files should be fixed temporarily at 1920; 3. (3) in PCT <b>international</b> <b>search</b> <b>reports</b> made in the CPO, US patents were cited most often, followed by Chinese documents, then European documents. Japanese documents were fourth and PCT documents fifth; and 4. (4) the most common languages used by the examiners carrying out these searches were English and Chinese. ...|$|R
40|$|China {{recently}} {{surpassed the}} USA {{as the greatest}} global source of patent applications. However, without internationally comparable measures of patent quality it remains questionable whether China’s patent expansion constitutes {{the rise of a}} new technological superpower. Our novel quality index is based on citations from <b>international</b> <b>search</b> <b>reports</b> and provides internationally comparable, quality-adjusted figures for applications made under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). We show that China’s patent expansion has taken place to the detriment of patent quality.

40|$|We {{develop an}} index that compares {{the quality of}} Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) {{applications}} by considering citations generated by <b>International</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Reports</b> (ISRs). In its most restrictive variation, i. e. excluding citations from the home country and self-citations, the ISR index is not biased by selectivity in filing strategies, differences in citations due to varying national examination procedures, or domestic economic policies. Against the background of strong increases in Chinese patenting between 2001 and 2009, we compare the quality of Chinese PCT applications with those from high-income countries. Chinese PCT applications achieve only 34 % of the quality level of international PCT applications. In addition, their quality is decreasing over time. We find that the patent quality of firms increases in R&D stocks but decreases {{with the introduction of}} PCT subsidies. Our results confirm that China's expansion of international filings was achieved to the detriment of quality...|$|R
50|$|South African {{criteria}} for originality of an invention are analogous {{to those of}} most of the First World, e.g. Europe, USA, Japan and Australia. However, South Africa's inventive step requirements differ from some of these countries. Consequently, the <b>International</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Report</b> and the International Preliminary Examination Report should be consulted when examining a South African application. This will indicate whether the PCT International Specification as filed and as published should be amended when filing a South African application. Importantly, such a step lessens the possibility that a South African patent, which may be granted on the application, will be deemed invalid on the grounds of lack of inventive step.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the compulsory <b>international</b> <b>search,</b> at least one optional supplementary <b>international</b> <b>search</b> may also {{be carried out by}} participating <b>International</b> <b>Searching</b> Authorities, upon request by the applicant and payment of corresponding fees. The purpose is to reduce the likelihood of seeing new prior art being cited in the subsequent national phases. A supplementary <b>international</b> <b>search</b> is said to allow applicants to obtain an additional <b>search</b> <b>report</b> [...] "taking into account the growing linguistic diversity of the prior art being found".
