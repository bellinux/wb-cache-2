500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of <b>electronic</b> <b>material</b> {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, I think, was the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E

The Division has rendered valuable service to the scientific effort by carrying out maintenance of scientific equipment and development of electronic instruments for use in research and development projects. In 1989, the ED was involved in the upgradation program of PARR-I Reactor led by PAEC chairman Munir Ahmad Khan. The ED had supplied and developed <b>electronic</b> <b>material</b> and system for the PARR-I Reactor, and had successfully converted PARR-I to utilize HEU fuel into LEU fuel. An outstanding achievement ED was the design and engineering of nuclear instrumentation of research reactor ( [...] PARR-1) which required a very high degree of sophistication and reliability.|$|E
