50|$|National governments deal in both {{intelligence}} and military special operations functions that either should be completely secret (i.e., clandestine: {{the existence of}} which is not known outside the relevant government circles), or simply cannot {{be linked to the}} sponsor (i.e., covert: it is known that sabotage is taking place, but its sponsor is unknown). It is a continuing and unsolved question for governments whether clandestine intelligence collection and covert action should be under the same agency. The arguments for doing so include having centralized functions for monitoring covert action and clandestine HUMINT and making sure they do not conflict, as well as avoiding duplication in common services such as cover <b>identity</b> <b>support,</b> counterespionage, and secret communications. The arguments against doing so suggest that the management of the two activities takes a quite different mindset and skills, in part because clandestine collection almost always is on a slower timeline than covert action.|$|E
50|$|For {{isolated}} children, East and Rook's {{results do}} confirm {{the hypothesis that}} sibling relationships compensate to some extent for unsupportive school friendships. This was particularly true {{in the areas of}} companionship, enhancement of worth, instrumental help, and intimacy support, and in the reduction of adjustment problems such as immaturity and anxiety. However, the study also showed that even high sibling support did not come with a full reduction of maladjustment. In fact, the authors even suggest that high support bonds could increase an adolescent's peer rejection, by decreasing motivation to associate with other adolescents. In any case, {{it is difficult to see}} how any family relationship, while providing intimacy and companionship, could entirely replace peer relations. Peer groups appear to play a unique role in developing an identity, through mechanisms such as shared activities and feedback. The problems of withdrawn adolescents—who correspond roughly to the isolated subjects in this study—seemed in Rubin et al.'s research to involve weak self-image, suggesting that these individuals are in particular need of <b>identity</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E

40|$|OpenID and InfoCard are two {{mainstream}} Web single signon (SSO) solutions {{intended for}} Internet-scale adoption. While they are technically sound, the business model of these solutions {{does not provide}} content-hosting and service providers (CSPs) with sufficient incentives to become relying parties (RPs).

As a result, there are currently over one billion OpenID-enabled user accounts provided by major CSPs, but only a few relying parties. In this paper, we discuss the problem of Web SSO adoption for RPs and argue that solutions in this space must offer RPs sufficient business incentives and trustworthy identity services in order to succeed. We suggest future Web SSO development should investigate and fulfill RPs ’ business needs, identify IdP business models, and build trust frameworks. Moreover, we propose that Web SSO technology should build <b>identity</b> <b>support</b> into browsers in order to facilitate RPs ’ adoption...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 28 - 32). Subsequent to {{the birth}} of a child, over half of all mothers are adversely affected by feelings of depression, stress, exhaustion, and anxiety that often result in a more serious mental disorder known as postpartum mental illness. Especially in regard to distressed individuals, social support is not always beneficial and positive; it not only represents a method of ameliorating postpartum mental illness, but also a process that can complicate or exacerbate such illness. Social support, when incompetently expressed and managed, can have deleterious impacts on an already distressed mother, and has the ability to catalyze a range of dysfunctional internal perceptions. This study investigated how the perceived social support processes are associated with outcome valence, and who mothers prefer to be supported by in the time of their distress (i. e., up to one year after giving birth). An online survey was completed by 146 females via snowball sampling. Findings yielded a promising set of initial results. In general, mothers preferred support most from their husband/partner and parents/siblings/immediate family. In the case of informational support, however, mothers preferred support from medical professionals and peers. For all four categories of social support (i. e., tangible, companionship, emotional, informational), mothers strongly disliked support from in-laws. In the way of major findings, results indicated that informational support provided by medical professionals is satisfactory only when the information is framed with emotional tactics. Additionally, medical professionals were proven {{to be a source of}} additional support when mothers lacked support in general. However, when mothers did no lack support, they did not feel the need to be supported by their healthcare providers. Other major findings were present for emotional-identity support. Moreover, appropriate <b>identity</b> <b>support</b> contributed to overall satisfaction, while support that did not make mothers feel like a "good mom" was the least satisfying overall. This proposes <b>identity</b> <b>support</b> to be a powerful contributor of overall satisfaction. Last, results suggested that appropriate social support may be more influential than inappropriate support. Following results and discussion, limitations and directions for future research are reviewed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} current {{changes in}} the highly diverse European landscape, and the way these transitions are being treated in policy and landscape management in the fragmented, heterogeneous and dynamic context of today’s Europe. It appears that intersecting driving forces are increasing the complexity of European landscapes and causing polarising developments in agricultural land use, biodiversity conservation and cultural landscape management. On the one hand, multifunctional rural landscapes, especially in peri-urban regions, provide services and functions that serve the citizens in their demand for <b>identity,</b> <b>support</b> their sense of belonging and offer opportunities for recreation and involvement in practical landscape management. On the other hand industrial agricultural production on increasingly large farms produce food, feed, fibre and energy to serve expanding international markets with rural liveability and accessibility as a minor issue. The intermediate areas of traditionally dominant small and family farms in Europe seem to be gradually declining in profitability. The paper discusses the potential of a governance approach that can cope with the requirement of optimising land sharing conditions and community-based landscape development, while adapting to global market conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} ways in which {{attachment}} disruptions might increase the risk of adult religious psychopathology by drawing parallels between the possible symbolisms lying behind religious violence and the concept of attachment. It is first argued that the relationship between a religious believer and a religious figure can be explained as an attachment experience. Secondly, it is proposed that when a religious attachment figure becomes a target of slander, or an action is perpetrated to disrupt the bond with such a figure, the religious believer may be predisposed to defensive, adaptive reactions, in the form of protest, despair, or detachment, to protect their attachment bond and resolve the disruptions that threaten their religious attachment <b>identity.</b> <b>Support</b> for this theoretical proposition was obtained through discourse analyses of three case examples (Charlie Hebdo vs al-Qaeda, Boko Haram vs the Nigerian government, and Pastor Terry Jones vs Islamic radicalisation), which position attachment theory as an alternative explanatory framework for conceptualising religious violence as a form of religious attachment-psychopathology—aimed at safeguarding the affectional bond with a religious figure from whom one may have developed a sense of identity and safe haven...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{thinking}} about policy on cancer {{services in the}} UK has highlighted the importance of recognising the needs of carers, but is unclear {{about the ways in}} which this might be done. Our recent study on the psychosocial needs of cancer patients and their main informal carers was unusual in its combined focus on patients and carers experiencing the ‘cancer journey’ together. One of our aims was to contribute to an understanding of what it means to be the main carer of someone with cancer. Using the qualitative data from the 79 carers and patients we interviewed, we ask how carers negotiate their place in the cancer situation, and particularly how do carers identify their role in relation to the patient and the medical setting? We posit carers as taking part in a shifting process of ‘carerhood’ in which competing needs vie for space. Our evidence suggests carers actively negotiate the challenges of their position in dealing with issues of <b>identity,</b> <b>support,</b> and sharing. We suggest that when the carer's involvement in the cancer scenario is recognised and legitimised by others it is easier for them to attend to their own needs alongside those of the patient...|$|E
