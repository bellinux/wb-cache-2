2500|$|The World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) is {{a private}} company that {{sanctions}} and organizes the Ironman and Ironman 70.3 races each year. These races serve as qualifying events for their own annual World Championships. The Ironman World Championship is held annually in Kailua-Kona, Hawai'i in October while the Ironman 70.3 World Championship is held in September and changes location each year.

The Challenge <b>Family</b> <b>brand</b> produces long-distance events around the world, and includes events like Challenge Roth.|$|E

She could not tell her lover that her brother was a thief; besides, this was a secret that must be carefully hidden from everybody outside the <b>family.</b> <b>Brand,</b> she reflected with a shudder of repugnance, would soon belong to it. There was no help anywhere.|$|E
