[...] Loeb also noted that [...] "the sky's not going to open up and aliens aren't going to come flying out of it. That's the Avengers' job, that's what they're supposed to do. The street level heroes always come from a very real place." [...] Regarding the antagonist, Ramirez said having the Defenders face an alien threat like the Avengers, for example, was [...] "never an option", as the crossover was {{always going to be a}} street level New York story. This did prove challenging in choosing an antagonist though, as the four Defenders are shown to be [...] "really powerful people" [...] in their individual series, and the miniseries' villain had to prove a challenge for the four of them together. To form the team-up, Ramirez stated that each Defender begins to investigate a mystery separately, with the four all converging on the same location after [...] "following their own trail of bread crumbs". Ramirez added, [...] "We wanted them all caught off guard seeing one another at the same location. Once they're in that room together, it's kind of like, 'Oh, shit, who are ?'" ...|$|E

40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that {{significant}} opportunity for performance improvements exists in energy intensive operations. Often, efforts to improve efficiency focus on vendor-led initiatives to improve operations of particular equipment. This approach assumes the overall efficiency {{of the system is}} simply a function of the individual units. However, many more factors contribute to overall performance improvement. These external factors contribute greater weight to poor performance than do equipment efficiency issues. It is common to have a very efficient process that runs very ineffectively. Despite efforts to improve efficiency of specific processes, subtly complex operations defy lasting improvement due to increased reliance on the judgment of human operators. Below the surface, process operators and managers have very different goals for when operating the process. These differences cause significant barriers to sustained performance improvements. The magnitude of performance losses can be orders larger than simple equipment efficiency losses. Rule-based Energy Management and Reporting Systems (EMRS) have proven themselves capable of overcoming the human factors that limit overall system performance. The EMRS is capable of applying the process managers judgment at all times, capturing transient opportunities as they arise.
