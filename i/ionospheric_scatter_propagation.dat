A statistical analysis of backscatter data spanning 20 years from 1996 to 2015 in the total field {{of view of the}} two HF radars was carried out {{in order to determine the}} solar cycle, the annual and the diurnal variations of backscatter (<b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> and ground scatter) in both Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars over a longer time period. Increase in <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> during solar maximum previously anticipated by Milan et al., (1997 b) and higher occurrence of ground <b>scatter</b> than <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> were observed in the analysis. The study in this thesis also includes investigation on the propagation mode responsible for the occurrence of ionospheric and ground backscatter. Similar to the data used in the first analysis, 20 years of data from three selected beams were employed. In this study, it was found that occurrence of ionospheric backscatter is prominent at far ranges at local day during solar cycle 23 than solar cycle 24. The analysis shows that occurrence of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> is seen at mid-range gates during summer in contrast to similar study carried out by Milan et al.

In addition, a study to identify the parameter or parameters that can be used for adequate prediction and forecast of occurrence of ionospheric backscatter for both short and long term durations was carried out.

In the communication system considered, information is conveyed from source to user by encoding it into electrical symbols at the transmitter and decoding it at the re-ceiver. Statistical theory, including information theory, is used throughout the paper. Gross aspects of multiple-mode <b>propagation</b> and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scattering</b> are discussed, and previous efforts to improve systems affected by these disturbances are reviewed. System capacities are computed for the transmission of band-limited white Gaussian signals through fixed multiple-mode dis-turbances, and the optimum spectral distribution of transmitter power is found. In general, presence of additional paths does not upset the message-handling capabilities of the channel if suitable wide-band signals are used. Quasi-stationary path fluctuations are considered, and a technique for measurement of the multipath characteristic by the receiver is suggested. Capacities arefound for slow path delay fluctuations. Single-mode <b>scatter</b> <b>propagation</b> is considered as a complex multiplicative Gaussian process. The probability computing receiver is found analytically, and a physical realization is developed for small signal-to-noise ratios.

A thin phase screen, parabolic equation based, Trans-Ionospheric Radio Propagation Simulator (TIRPS) is described. Modeled channel scattering functions (CSFs) are compared to experimental VHF and UHF data derived from the Advanced Research Projects Agency Long-range Tracking and Instrumentation Radar on Kwajalein Island (9. 4 °N, 166. 8 °E). TIRPS quantitatively reproduces the experimental results, including the quasi-parabolic profile observed in the measured CSFs under strong turbulence conditions. Variations in the simulated CSF with ionospheric phase screen parameters are also presented. Under conditions of high integrated strength of turbulence (CkL), a low phase spectral index (p = 1), indicating relatively dense small-scale irregularities, produces pronounced range spreading.

To {{establish the}} origin of the density irregularities responsible for low‒velocity SAIS, it is necessary to distinguish between the effects of high frequency (HF) propagation and irregularity occurrence itself on the observed backscatter distribution. We compare range, azimuth, and elevation data from the Blackstone SuperDARN radar with modeling results from ray tracing coupled with the International Reference Ionosphere assuming a uniform irregularity distribution. The observed and modeled distributions are shown to be very similar. The spatial distribution of backscattering is consistent with the requirement that HF rays propagate nearly perpendicular to the geomagnetic field lines (aspect angle ≤ 1 °). For the first time, the irregularities responsible for low‒velocity SAIS are determined to extend between 200 and 300 km altitude, validating previous assumptions that low‒velocity SAIS is an F‒region phenomenon. We find that the limited spatial extent of this category of ionospheric backscatter within SuperDARN radars' fields‒of‒view is a consequence of HF propagation effects and the finite vertical extent of the scattering irregularities. We conclude that the density irregularities responsible for low‒velocity SAIS are widely distributed horizontally within the midlatitude ionosphere but are confined to the bottom‒side F‒region...|$|R
