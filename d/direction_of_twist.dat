The SiO4 tetrahedrons form parallel helices; the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> of the helix determines the left- or right-hand orientation.

Imperfections were also found to be minimum with normal spinning condition and increased with increase in spindle air pressure. The yarn tenacity and elongation at break found to be lower at normal spinning condition. When the spindle air pressure increased yarn tenacity and elongation at break also increased with increase in spindle air pressure.

50|$|The helix in {{the antenna}} can twist in two {{possible}} directions: right-handed or left-handed, {{as defined by}} the right-hand rule. In an axial-mode helical antenna the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> of the helix determines the polarisation of the radio waves. Two mutually incompatible conventions are in use for describing waves with circular polarisation, so the relationship between the handedness (left or right) of a helical antenna, and the type of circularly-polarised radiation it emits cannot be stated without ambiguity. Helical antennas can receive signals with any type of linear polarisation, such as horizontal or vertical polarisation, but when receiving circularly polarised signals the handedness of the receiving antenna must be the same as the transmitting antenna; left-hand polarised antennas suffer a severe loss of gain when receiving right-circularly-polarised signals, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|The grooves are {{the spaces}} that are cut out, and the {{resulting}} ridges are called lands. These lands and grooves can vary in number, depth, shape, <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> (right or left), and twist rate. The spin imparted by rifling significantly improves {{the stability of the}} projectile, improving both range and accuracy. Typically rifling is a constant rate down the barrel, usually measured by the length of travel required to produce a single turn. Occasionally firearms are encountered with a gain twist, where the rate of spin increases from chamber to muzzle. While intentional gain twists are rare, due to manufacturing variance, a slight gain twist is in fact fairly common. Since a reduction in twist rate is very detrimental to accuracy, gunsmiths who are machining a new barrel from a rifled blank will often measure the twist carefully so they may put the faster rate, no matter how minute the difference is, at the muzzle end.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of traditional safety wire {{is the time}} it requires to install properly when securing fasteners, although technicians who use it often can implement it fairly quickly. It also leaves behind waste products when ends are clipped off or when it is cut off of secured fasteners {{that need to be}} removed during maintenance, resulting in sharp metal bits that can easily damage soft materials or injure skin. However, the amount of waste product is relatively small, it is non-toxic, and the hazard can be mitigated altogether if technicians properly dispose of any waste product. When clipping off ends, the ends can go flying off which makes their recovery difficult and can cause injury to anyone in the immediate vicinity, such as the technician or an assistant; however, this can also be easily mitigated by using extra care or by using safety wire pliers that have a special insert that is designed to catch clipped off ends. Another disadvantage is that since the manual skill required to implement traditional safety wire is easily learned, the techniques required to maximize the retentive force of safety wire (e.g., in which direction the retentive force should be exerted, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist,</b> proper angles for securing multiple fasteners, proper twists per inch, which type of wire to use, etc.) are often ignored by non-formally trained technicians (e.g., hobbyists) who use safety wire for their projects.|$|E
40|$|Patterns <b>of</b> scissile bond <b>twisting</b> {{have been}} found in crystal {{structures}} of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) that are complexed with substrates and inhibitors. To estimate the increased potential energy in the substrates that results from this twisting, we have plotted torsion angles for the scissile bonds on hybrid Quantum Mechanics::Molecular Mechanics energy surfaces. Eight such maps were constructed, including one for α-maltose and three for different forms of methyl α-acarviosinide to provide energies for <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> α-(1, 4) glycosidic bonds. Maps were also made for β-thiocellobiose and for three β-cellobiose conformers having different glycon ring shapes to model distortions of β-(1, 4) glycosidic bonds. Different GH families twist scissile glycosidic bonds differently, increasing their potential energies from 0. 5 to 9. 5 kcal/mol. In general, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> the glycosidic bond away from the conformation of lowest intramolecular energy correlates with the position (syn or anti) of the proton donor with respect to the glycon’s ring oxygen atom. This correlation suggests that glycosidic bond distortion is important for the optimal orientation of one of the glycosidic oxygen lone pairs toward the enzyme’s proton donor...|$|R

30|$|The {{height of}} the track above the wing support {{bearings}} (due to the {{height of the}} wing girders, the FPS bearings, bearer bars, and rail fasteners) modifies the kinematics of the idealized system described previously. The twist of the wing girders leads to an additional vertical displacement of the yoke curves caused by the rigid body rotation of the wing girder, and the yoke curves translate toward or away from one another, depending on the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist.</b> A similar coupling of rotation and vertical movement occurs at the FPS bearings, due to their curved sliding interfaces.

40|$|In-fiber polarimeters or {{polarization}} mode interferometers (PMIs) are fabricated by cascading two CO 2 -laser-induced in-fiber polarizers along a {{piece of}} hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber. Since the two interfering beams are the orthogonal polarizations of the fundamental mode, which are tightly confined to the core and have much lower loss than higher order modes, the PMIs can have either short (e. g., a few millimeters) or long (tens of meters or longer) device length without significantly changing the fringe contrast and hence provide design flexibility for applications required different device lengths. As examples of potential applications, the PMIs have been experimentally demonstrated for wavelength-dependent group birefringence measurement; and for strain, temperature and torsion sensors.

40|$|We give an {{overview}} of a novel lattice-based avalanche model that reproduces well a number of observed statistical properties of solar flares. The anisotropic lattice {{is defined as a}} network of vertically-connected nodes subjected to horizontal random displacements mimicking the kinks introduced by random motions of the photospheric footpoints of magnetic fieldlines forming a coronal loop. We focus here on asymmetrical driving displacements, which under our geometrical interpretation of the lattice correspond to a net <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> of the magnetic fieldlines about the loop axis. We show that a net vertical electrical current density does build up in our lattice, as one would expect from systematic twisting of a loop-like magnetic structure, and that the presence of this net current has a profound impact on avalanche dynamics. The presence of an additional energy reservoir tends to increase the mean energy released by avalanches, and yield a probability distribution of released energy in better agreement with observational inferences than in its absence. Symmetrical driving displacements are in better conceptual agreement with a random shuffling of photospheric footpoint, and yield a power-law distribution of energy release with exponent larger than 2, as required in Parker's nanoflare model of coronal heating. On the other hand, moderate asymmetrical driving generate energy distribution exponents that are similar to those obtained from SOHO EUV observations...|$|E

The static model is numerically simulated within Matlab for point loads at the free {{end of a}} twist drill. The bending curves are plotted and the bending stiffness of a twist drill is estimated. Effect of orientation of the spirally fluted cross-section at the fixed end on end deflection is studied. Characteristic bending curves for one pitch length of drill are plotted and region of minimum deflection is identified. Dynamic model is numerically simulated in Matlab over a range of rotating speeds and the first two natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes are identified for the twist drill. New formulation for estimation of work stiffness is proposed considering the interaction of drill with the hole-wall. A new lumped mass model for studying lateral vibration behavior of the twist drill is developed using this work stiffness. The bending stiffness and fundamental natural frequency estimated using continuous models above and work stiffness calculated using proposed formulation are used in this new model. This model is numerically simulated in Matlab for different set of parameters and drill orbital motions are obtained. Results are analyzed to study the influence of various parameters on dynamics of drill and an explanation is given for generation of lobed holes and drill wandering phenomenon and surface roughness. Torsional stiffness of set of twist drills in clockwise and counter clockwise directions are measured experimentally in order to verify the stiffness symmetry. Appearance of cutting resistance when <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> coincides with the direction of cutting leads to periodic change in torsional stiffness of the twist drill during actual drilling.

40|$|Previous studies {{reported}} a unique <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> lamellar <b>twist</b> in banded spherulites of polymers with main-chain chirality, {{which lead to}} the suggestion that a correlation exists between the handedness of the helical chain and the twist direction. However, these proposals were presented without identifying underlying reasons for such a correlation. Hence, {{the goal of this}} thesis was to identify morphological features that could be ascribed to main-chain chirality, which, in turn, would provide insight concerning the transmission of chirality to asymmetries in various levels of crystalline morphology. Studies at the molecular level, based on chain-packing simulations showed that main-chain chirality leads to the formation of helices of a given handedness but indicated that the helix handedness does not have the ability to generate asymmetric habits at the next higher dimensional level, which is the chain-folded lamella. This was confirmed by the TEM studies of solution-grown single crystals of the R and S polyenantiomers of poly(epichlorohydrin) (PECH), poly(propylene oxide) (PPrO) and poly(3 -hydroxyvalerate) (PHV). Electron diffraction studies established that chain tilting (considered a root cause <b>of</b> lamellar <b>twisting)</b> is absent in these single crystals. However, this does not eliminate the possibility of an induced chain tilting in stems at growth fronts during fast crystallization from the melt. Indeed, optical microscopy studies of the behavior of spherulites grown from the melt established that the lamellae (fibrils) twist, uniquely in either a right- or left-handed fashion, depending on the chiral identity (R or S) of the polyenantiomer. Although the handedness <b>of</b> the lamellar <b>twist</b> <b>of</b> the R and S polyenantiomers of PECH and PPrO both showed a direct correlation with the handedness of the helical chain, this correlation is not universal. While poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and PHV both form left-handed helices, the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> lamellar <b>twist</b> are left- and right-handed, respectively. It was also demonstrated that the handedness of spiral patterns developed in banded spherulites of chiral polymers is not rigorously related to the molecular chirality. The overall conclusion is that determination of the ultimate origin(s) <b>of</b> lamellar <b>twisting</b> in banding <b>of</b> polyenantiomers requires further investigations...|$|R
