40|$|AbstractThe {{stress relief}} {{mechanism}} and {{the limitation of}} a borehole drilling are pointed out by theoretical and numerical analysis. The stress is relieved around the borehole wall, and the gas can be drained out easily, but {{the periphery of the}} stress relief area generates annularity stress concentration to embay around the boreholes, and forms the “Bottle Neck Effect” (BNE) which restricts the gas drainage ability. Jetting high pressure water in the boreholes to form several slots can break the BNE, which makes the stress above and below the slots relieve sufficiently. The stress relief area is nearly 200 times larger than the stress concentration area under the same condition. The slots around a borehole improve the borehole’s stress relief ability, drain out more gas, and enlarge the <b>drainage</b> <b>range,</b> which can reduce the number of the boreholes to achieve the same aim...|$|E
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Chylous leakage (CL) {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy (LLDN). It may lead to malnutrition and immunological deficits because of protein and lymphocyte depletion. METHODS: Data from 208 consecutive LLDN performed at two institutions, between April 2000 and September 2010, were reviewed to identify the anatomical basis behind CL along with its diagnostic and therapeutic options. RESULTS: CL developed in eight donors (3. 8 %), as determined by high-volume <b>drainage</b> (<b>range</b> 540 - 800 mL/ 24 hr) of triglyceride-rich fluid. All donors were managed conservatively. Seven were put on total parenteral nutrition plus octreotide. One received low-fat diet, medium-chain triglyceride supplementation, and octreotide. Chylous fistulas resolved in 5 to 16 days (mean time 12. 3 days). Drains were removed before hospital discharge, and no donor was readmitted and/or needed outpatient care. CONCLUSIONS: CL is a potentially insidious and perhaps misdiagnosed complication after LLDN. It occurs in nearly 4 % of LLDN {{and it seems to}} be uniquely associated to left-sided kidney recovery because of distinctive lymphatics distribution around the periaortic area of dissection. Conservative therapy is effective in most donors and should be initially attempted. Surgical ligatures or fibrin sealants may be indicated in case of refractory CL before the arising of malnutrition and/or relevant immunodeficiency...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the effect of spatial variability of the surface soil saturated hydraulic conductivity(Ks) on water drainage. A conditional simulation (CS) method was used to get a random field of the surface soil Ks based on 117 observed values in the field. Then, a soil water movement model (HYDRUS- 1 D) was coupled with the random field of the surface soil Ks. During the period from March 10 to June 10, 1999, water drainage was stochastically simulated with the total water income being 353. 8 mm(including 270 mm irrigation rate). The accumulated quantities of the water drainage ranged from 23. 73 mm to 64. 73 mm in the soil profile 2 m in depth, accounting for about 8. 8 % and 24. 0 % of the irrigation rate during this period. The accumulated quantities of the water drainage were calculated by measured method, ordinary Kriging(OK) method and CS method, respectively. Their results were compared. It was found that the accumulated quantities of the water drainage obtained by CS method agreed well with that by the measured method, while the water <b>drainage</b> <b>range</b> was shortened by the OK method because of its obviously 'smoothing effect'. The effect of spatial variability of the surface soil Ks on water drainage could be reflected by the three methods and their results were all better than the traditional method, which does not consider the spatial variability of the surface soil Ks. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{current trends}} towards {{increased}} coal production from seams at greater depth {{has led to}} increased demands being placed on the methane drainage and mine ventilation systems. This study has been directed towards the development of computer models to simulate and analyse the gas flows in methane drainage ranges and the airflow and pressure distribution in mine ventilation networks. The {{first part of this}} thesis describes the conventional techniques of methane drainage currently employed and the mathematical approach used to model gas flow in the methane <b>drainage</b> <b>range.</b> It also discusses how, when combined with measured underground data, predicted results can be used to assess the performance of the range. Subsequent analysis techniques will suggest measures that can be undertaken to optimise this performance and assess the effect of selective network reconfiguration. The second part of the thesis includes a discussion of the increasing application of booster fans in U. K. underground coal mines and a critical analysis of the mathematical methods used to model airflow and pressure distribution in mine ventilation networks. One particular method was adopted in a simulation model used to analyse networks with booster fans and specified face airflows. Both simulation models developed have been used to analyse representative underground methane drainage ranges and mine ventilation networks. The thesis concludes that the accuracy of the methane drainage models can only be guaranteed when developed in conjunction with suitable measured data. The mine ventilation model requires user guidance through the solution and analysis procedure. Results are presented in a simple graphical manner and this approach, rather than the 'black box' non interactive approach, is to be favoured in the analysis of mine ventilation networks...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} outcome of {{patients}} with acute necrotizing pancreatitis treated by percutaneous drainage with special focus {{on the influence of}} drainage size and number. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 80 patients with acute pancreatitis requiring percutaneous drainage therapy for infected necroses. Endpoints were mortality and length of hospital stay. The influence of drainage characteristics such as the median drainage size, the largest drainage size per patient and the total drainage plane per patient on patient outcome was evaluated. RESULTS: Total hospital survival was 66 %. Thirty-four patients out of all 80 patients (43 %) survived acute necrotizing pancreatitis with percutaneous drainage therapy only. Eighteen patients out of all 80 patients needed additional percutaneous necrosectomy (23 %). Ten out of these patients required surgical necrosectomy in addition, 6 patients received open necrosectomy without prior percutaneous necrosectomy. Elective surgery was performed in 3 patients receiving cholecystectomy and one patient receiving resection of the parathyroid gland. The number of <b>drainages</b> <b>ranged</b> from one to fourteen per patient. The <b>drainage</b> diameter <b>ranged</b> from 8 French catheters to 24 French catheters. The median drainage size as well as the largest drainage size used per patient and the total drainage area used per patient did not show statistically significant influence on mortality. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous drainage therapy is an effective tool for treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis.

50|$|Historically, the shorthead redhorse is {{native to}} North America. Its native range {{includes}} the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, Mississippi River, and Saint Lawrence River basins. They ranged across from Quebec to Alberta and {{as far south as}} northern Alabama and Oklahoma. Shorthead redhorse also originally occupied the Atlantic Slope <b>drainages,</b> <b>ranging</b> from the Hudson River in New York to the Santee River in South Carolina. When the Tennessee Valley Authority started building dams in the 1930s in an attempt to create power, the dams blocked different fish such as striped bass, from moving upstream to their spawning ranges. While some fish ranges have decreased since the construction of the dams, the shorthead redhorse’s range has expanded. The shorthead redhorse is a “habitat generalist near the core of its range,” so it can tolerate disturbance better than other related redhorse species such as the river redhorse, M. carinatum. Shorthead redhorse can now be found in the tidal zones of the Hudson River. They are believed to have invaded the Hudson by way of the Mohawk River and have established themselves in the Hudson estuary. Other areas they have been found in include the Embarras River system in Illinois and the Red River below Lake Texoma dam in Grayson County, Texas.|$|R

Seventeen patients had recurrent ipsilateral pneumonthorax, 3 patients bilateral pneumothorax and 26 patients persistent air leak. The must common method of management was “stapling" of an identified bleb in the lung wich was undertaken in 30 (65 %.) patients. A pleurodesis was performed in every operated patient; 10 patients had mechanical abrasion while the instillation of tale was used in. 36 patients. There was no operative mortality. One patient (2, 1 %) had to be reoperated for bleeding and another one (2, 1 %) for persistent air leak.
