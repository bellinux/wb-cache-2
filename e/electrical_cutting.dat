50|$|The {{electrical}} {{part was}} - in its arrangement - taken {{over from the}} Be 5/7 of the BLS. It consisted of a diamond-shaped pantograph, an <b>electrical</b> <b>cutting</b> knife for cutting off the respective pantograph, lightning protection inductor and one more <b>electrical</b> <b>cutting</b> knife for disconnection of {{one half of the}} locomotive. All those components were mounted on the roof. The oil propulsed main switch was located in the locomotive body. The locomotive driver operated the switch over electric valves located in both cabs. It was also possible to handle the switch mechanically over a rod system. Finally it was possible to manipulate the main switch directly by using a wrench.|$|E
50|$|Two {{diamond-shaped}} pantographs - controllable with a valve in each cab - {{lead the}} current from the catenary {{to the two}} <b>electrical</b> <b>cutting</b> knives {{on the roof of}} the locomotive body. These cutting knives could be controlled manually from the engine room. From these cutting knives, the current was transferred to the oil-cooled transformer over a lightning protection inductor and the oil-propelled main switch. The transformer was located in the center of the locomotive body. On the high voltage side, the transformer was switchable for either 15,000 V or 7500 V. This arrangement was necessary since the SBB decided to supply the Gotthard railway line at start only with 7500 V because the main operation was still steam. The SBB was considering that the carbon black on the insulators of the catenary could lead to shortcuts when very high voltage was used. The low-voltage side of the transformer was bifid and equipped with 11 taps. The two camshaft switches were mounted in longitudinal direction on both sides of the transformer. It was possible - as at the Be 3/5 12201 - to select 23 steps. For handling the step switches, the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle once for each step. It was possible to shut off power by running down both step switches with a special handle. If one step switch failed it could be separated. With the remaining one it was possible to continue the trip with the 12 steps of the other one. The four pneumatic controlled reverse switches were placed on the motors. They were connected in parallel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{improved}} quantum {{neural network}} model and its learning algorithm are proposed for fault diagnosis of the coal electrical haulage shearer in order to on line monitor working states of the large mining rotating machines.

According to the information processing mode of the biology neuron and the quantum computing theory, the improved quantum {{neural network model}} has the ability of identifying uncertainty in fault data classifications and approximating the nonlinear function for different fault types to monitor the electrical motor voltage, current, temperature, shearer location, boom inclination, haulage speed and direction in the coal <b>electrical</b> <b>cutting</b> machines.

40|$|Because of mask cost reduction, {{electron}} beam direct write (EBDW) is implemented for special {{applications such as}} rapid prototyping or small volume production in semiconductor industry. One {{of the most promising}} applications for EBDW is design verification by means of metal fix. Due to write time constrains, Mix & Match solutions have to be developed at smaller nodes. This study reports on several Mix and Match processes for the integration of E-Beam lithography into the optical litho process flow of Qimonda's 70 nm and 58 nm DRAM nodes. Different metal layers have been patterned in part with DUV litho followed by E-Beam litho using a 50 kV Vistec SB 3050 shaped {{electron beam}} direct writer. All hardmask patterns were then simultaneously transferred into the DRAM stack. After full chip processing a yield study comprising electrical device characterization and defect investigation was performed.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} and graphene are low-dimensional allotropes {{of carbon}} which exhibit novel mechanical and electrical properties. The methods for producing these materials and fabricating electronic devices from {{them are still}} under development. This thesis uses the fabrication and electronic analysis of field-effect transistors made from carbon nanotubes and graphene to gain insights into the growth process of these materials, to understand complications of the fabrication process, and to assess {{the quality of the}} materials through their electronic properties. The numbers of semoconducting and metallic nanotubes produced by growth using two different catalysts are counted by the process of <b>electrical</b> <b>cutting.</b> Various highcurrent phenomena are observed and explained through use of multi-nanotube and charge leakage models. The high-current annealing method discovered for nanotubes is found to also be useful for improving the quality of graphene devices. The graphene used for device fabrication is produced by thermal chemical vapor deposition on thin film nickel. The large area and weak adhesion of this material leads to the alteration of device designs and fabrication procedures, including substrate exposure and high-temperature annealing. A new nanofluidic device is introduced to study the enhanced lateral wet etching rate of materials in contact with graphene. Two sets of graphene field-effect transistors are analyzed, a first for this type of material. Improved material quality results in improved electrical mobility. Two independent models are derived which relate the thickness of a graphene film to its gate-voltage dependent behaviour, and are justified by experiment. Temperature dependence, quantum capacitance, and multiterminal measurements are discussed. by Daniel Andrew Nezich. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Abstract. The great {{challenge}} in handling {{the security and}} resilience in emergency situations is that threats will typically affect more than one infrastructure. A fire {{is not only a}} direct hazard for people but it will also short the <b>electrical</b> system, <b>cutting</b> off the lights and possibly the communications and sensor infrastructure and even create more fires. The Tsunami in Japan in 2011 flooded the nuclear reactors but also cut of the pumps that were designed to respond to any flooding situations. This paper is part of a project that addresses these cascaded failures and studies them via simulation. To provide some quantitative estimates of the effect of such cascaded threats, we use the Distributed Building Evacuation Simulator (DBES) to represent the effect of a hazard (in this case a fire) which destroys the sensor system which is used to compute the best advice given to people that are evacuated during the fire. Our simulations compare the situation when the sensor system is intact, and also when it is compromised. As expected, some results highlight the poor overall system performance when the underlying infrastructures are damaged. However, in some scenarios, the degraded system appears to perform as well as the intact one. An analysis into the fault-tolerance of the system leads to some design guidelines which can be applied to design systems fault-tolerant systems...|$|R
