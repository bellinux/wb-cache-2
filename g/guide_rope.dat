500|$|He {{left school}} at 14 and became {{telegraph}} messenger boy at Wells Post Office. He {{remained at the}} post office for his entire working life, working his way up to postmaster. Whilst working as a messenger, {{he spent a lot of}} time at the village of Wookey Hole. He began caving with other teenagers from the village in the mid-1880s. After attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins, he took an interest in cave archeology and especially in stratigraphy. In the 1890s, Balch was introduced to the caves of the Mendip Hills by Thomas Willcox, manager of the Priddy lead mines. While caving with Willcox at Lamb Leer in 1897, one of Balch's ropes snapped. He saved himself by catching a <b>guide</b> <b>rope,</b> but the [...] fall rendered him unconscious, suffering serious friction burns and back injuries.|$|E
50|$|A solar Montgolfiere will sink at night, {{and will}} have a <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> {{attached}} {{to the bottom of}} the gondola that will curl up on the ground and anchor the balloon during the darkness hours. The <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> will be made of low friction materials to keep it from catching or tangling on ground features.|$|E

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the Funifor system is its stability in high wind conditions owingto the horizontal distance between the two <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> comprising each track.|$|R
50|$|In January 1868 an {{extraction}} cage detached {{and damaged}} the <b>guide</b> <b>ropes,</b> {{which led to}} a two-week layoff for the miners. On 24 January 1868, the mine suffered a firedamp explosion that left eight dead and damaged 250 m of its structural timbers.|$|R
50|$|Some shafts {{do not use}} guide beams {{but instead}} utilize steel wire <b>rope</b> (called <b>Guide</b> <b>ropes)</b> kept in tension by massive weights at shaft bottom called cheese weights (because of their {{resemblance}} to a truckle or wheel of cheese) as these are easier to maintain and replace.|$|R
5000|$|Tim & Anh Đức {{were further}} assed an {{additional}} 30-minute penalty because Tim held onto the <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> during the Roadblock, which was explicitly prohibited in the clue. Their 45-minute penalty {{caused them to}} fell to last place; however, they were notified the Leg was non-elimination, and their 45-minute penalty would instead be assessed {{at the start of}} the next Leg.|$|E
50|$|As Rob helps Doug descend, a {{blizzard}} strikes {{the mountain and}} Doug's oxygen bottle runs out, causing him to suffer hypoxia. No extra bottles are stored on the route where Rob asked and he radios Helen to send someone up with oxygen. Doug, left alone briefly by Rob, semi-consciously unclips himself from the <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> and walks unsteadily along the narrow path. He silently topples to his death a moment later.|$|E
50|$|Chariots: Each warrior {{sits in a}} chariot {{that they}} must move forward by pulling on a <b>guide</b> <b>rope,</b> and tug {{themselves}} over the bumps that block an otherwise speedy path. They must collect the pieces of tube along the way that, when constructed, allows them to unhook a jewel bag strung high overhead. Failure to do retrieve a jewel and {{make it back to}} the start within the time limit will end the warrior's quest.|$|E
50|$|A {{rescue team}} entered {{the main shaft}} but damage meant the winding gear could only reach 295 yards down. John Harris climbed down <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> and rescued several men. After several hours in the pit the rescue team was {{withdrawn}} over concerns of further explosions. In all, some 90 colliers were saved.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of bridges, tidal ferries provided the only means to cross the river. Tides propelled the ferries along <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> anchored on both sides. However, the ferries were unable to operate during bad weather, and travelers could be stranded on each side. Replacing the ferries with bridges would be a major advance in transportation.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, Cousteau and Dumas {{dove into}} the Fountain of Vaucluse, a mysterious spring {{in the village of}} Vaucluse, hoping to {{discover}} the secret of its yearly flooding. Maurice Fargues was the operation's surface commander, in charge of the <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> which allowed Cousteau and Dumas to communicate with the surface. When Cousteau and Dumas became affected by carbon monoxide in their air cylinders, Fargues saved their lives by pulling them back up to the surface.|$|E

O'Conner transfers to the US Naval Air Service and is assigned to the rigid airship [...] When the Macon tries to dock, Martin is accidentally caught on a <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> and is hoisted into the air. [...] Despite orders, O'Conner climbs down the rope and saves Martin's life by parachuting both of them to the ground.|$|E
50|$|The ferry {{pontoons}} {{for carrying}} rail wagons {{were not able}} to navigate freely on the river, but instead were attached to two cables that were stretched across the river upstream of the ferry. Successful operation of the train ferry was only achieved when the original chains were replaced with stronger cables. The ferry was attached by a cable to another cable that ran over the river to resist the current and to serve as a <b>guide</b> <b>rope.</b> A thinner cable ran through the water on to two wheels on the ferry that were powered by a steam engine; the ferry hauled itself across the river by pulling on the cable.|$|E
50|$|Another {{commercial}} bungee jump {{currently in}} operation is just 13m smaller, at 220 m. This jump, made without <b>guide</b> <b>ropes,</b> {{is from the}} top of the Verzasca Dam near Locarno, Switzerland. It appears in the opening scene of the James Bond film GoldenEye. The Bloukrans Bridge Bungy in South Africa and the Verzasca Dam jumps are pure freefall swinging bungee from a single cord.|$|R
50|$|They {{are made}} of silk, are {{rectangular}} and hang from a cross member, from which <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> are held by those carrying it. Traditionally banners were draped in black cloth when {{there had been a}} death in the pit during the previous year. More recently following the closure of pits across the county they are draped with black cloth on significant anniversaries of disasters at the colliery they represent.|$|R
50|$|A {{similar but}} even more {{dangerous}} tradition of non-violent bull-leaping, recortes, is practiced {{in some parts of}} Spain. Athletes, known as recortadores, compete at dodging and leaping over bulls without the use of the cape or sword. Some recortadores use a long pole to literally pole-vault over the charging animal, which is both larger than the type used in the French sport, and unrestrained by any <b>guiding</b> <b>rope</b> or similar safety device.|$|R
50|$|In this leg's Roadblock, teams {{entered the}} Scents and Sensitivity Garden within Kingsbrae Horticultural Garden, where the {{participating}} team member would be blindfolded {{for the duration}} of the task. They would first be led to one side of the garden by their partner, who would read them the English names of 15 plants they had to memorize, each distinguishable by a unique scent or texture. They then had to follow a <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> on their own to the other side of the garden and correctly identify all 15 plants by touch and smell to receive their next clue. If any were incorrect, they were led back to their partner to try again.|$|E
50|$|On August 27, 1946, the GRS {{dove into}} the Fountain of Vaucluse, a mysterious spring {{in the village of}} Vaucluse, hoping to {{discover}} the secret of its yearly flooding. Maurice Fargues was the operation's surface commander, in charge of the <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> which allowed divers to communicate with the surface. Tailliez and Morandière dove together first, but they were rapidly affected by a narcosis that almost compromised their return to the surface. When Cousteau and Dumas dove together, they suffered the same symptoms, and Tailliez and Fargues probably saved their lives by pulling them back up to the surface. It was later determined that carbon monoxide had unexpectedly contaminated the air in their cylinders.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of May 24, Ian Woodall (UK), Cathy O'Dowd (South Africa), and several more Uzbeks {{encountered}} Francys Arsentiev while {{on their way to}} the summit. She was found where she had been left the evening before. Sergei Arsentiev's ice axe and rope were identified nearby, but he was nowhere to be found. Both Woodall and O'Dowd called off their own summit attempts and tried to help Francys for more than an hour, but because of her poor condition, the perilous location, and freezing weather, they were forced to abandon her and descend to camp. She died as they found her, lying on her side, still clipped onto the <b>guide</b> <b>rope.</b> She was aged 40, with one son. Her corpse had the nickname [...] "Sleeping Beauty".|$|E
50|$|A funifor {{is a type}} of {{aerial lift}} or aerial tramway {{patented}} by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group which consists of two <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> and a haul rope loop per cabin.The drives of the two cabins are not interconnected with two reversible cabins running on parallel tracks. At the top of each track, the haul rope for that track loops back to the bottom instead of looping over to serve the other track as occurs with a normal aerial tramway. In other words, a funifor's propulsion is not returned to the opposite direction for use by the other vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Worried about climber crowding, Rob persuades Scott to {{cooperate}} to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Rob's group departs Camp IV before dawn, planning {{to complete the}} ascent and turn around by 2 pm, the latest safe time for return before nightfall. The group is delayed over an hour after discovering <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> are not installed on {{upper reaches of the}} climb. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return if his condition does not improve in a half-hour. Scott hurries back down to camp to help another climber, but plans to re-ascend. Rob warns him about over-exertion.|$|R
60|$|Bickley nodded, and {{suggested}} that we should go on deck {{to see what was}} happening. So we went. Not a breath of wind was stirring, and even the sea seemed to be settling down a little. At least, so we judged from the motion, for we could not see either it or the sky; everything was as black as pitch. We heard the sailors, however, engaged in rigging <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> fore and aft, and battening down the hatches with extra tarpaulins by the light of lanterns. Also they were putting ropes round the boats and doing something to the spars and topmasts.|$|R

5000|$|On 12 December 1884, {{five men}} descended the No.2 South shaft in a bowk to replace some byats. Just after the winding engine commenced, the [...] wide braided steel flat rope broke, sending four {{to their deaths}} {{at the bottom of}} the shaft [...] below. Thomas John Dobbs, who had been guiding the bowk down a <b>guide</b> <b>rope,</b> managed to slowly lowered himself to within hailing {{distance}} of pit bottom, and was rescued with nothing more than cuts and bruises. Following an accident investigation by HM Inspectorate of Mines, it was found that the rope had corroded, where it had been in contact with the Headframe sheave wheel. But as the rope was covered with a protective coating of tar, the corrosion had gone undetected. The sheave wheels on both the No.1 and No.2 shafts at Deep Navigation were unusual, in that they were constructed of different parts that had been riveted together, not a singular wheel that had been cast. The sheaves were not replaced at Deep Navigation until 1961 (No.2 South), and 1963 (No.1 North).|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a damping and positioning device for the active damping of the swinging motion of loads suspended from cranes, said device comprising guide ropes running between the crane and the load to dampen the swinging motion of the load. The proposal according to the invention is to provide at least two guide ropes (6 a, 6 h) for each swinging motion plane, and to arrange <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> drums (5) on the crane attached to a frame (3, 14) suspended from the latter. The guide ropes (6 a, 6 h) are loaded by a tensile force which acts constantly against the swinging motion of the load. The tensile force is produced by a drive unit whose driving force is controlled independently {{of the speed of}} the <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> drum. The length of the guide ropes (6 a, 6 h) is independent of each other and is variable while the crane is in operation...|$|E

This slope is liable to slip, and {{requires}} careful walking, so the <b>guides</b> began <b>roping</b> them together. 'The stout monsieur in front, next after me,' said the chief <b>guide,</b> knotting the <b>rope</b> soundly round Herbert Le Breton: 'then Kaspar; then you, monsieur,' to Harry Oswald, 'and finally Paolo, {{to bring up the}} rear. The thin monsieur is nervous, I think; it's best to place him most in the middle.' ...|$|R
50|$|A Funifor {{is a type}} of {{aerial lift}} or aerial tramway with two <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> and a haul rope loop per cabin.The Funifor design is {{patented}} by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.Two reversible cabins run on parallel tracks. The drives of the two cabins are not interconnected.At the top of each track, the haul rope forthat track loops back to the bottom instead of looping over to serve the other track as occurs with a normalaerial tramway. This feature allows for single cabin operation when traffic warrants. The independent drive alsoallows for evacuations to occur by means of a bridge connected between the two adjacent cabins.|$|R
5000|$|Insulating links {{are needed}} on cranes and tag lines, (<b>guide</b> <b>ropes),</b> {{to protect against}} {{electric}} current passing from the power line through the wire rope of the crane and into the personnel working {{on or near the}} crane, figure 4. Figure 5 shows the Federal requirements for working close to a power line. The list includes layers of prevention but the only meaningful protection is the insulating link and tag line insulators. Incidents of power line contact are common because of the difficulty the driver of the crane has in distinguishing the thin cable of the power line against the background of the sky.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{compared the}} accuracy of spatial updating of targets in front with that of targets behind. The participant viewed a target on the ground several meters away and then, without vision, sidestepped along a <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> while trying to mentally update {{the location of the}} target. On some trials, the target location was in front as the person sidestepped and, on other trials, the target location was behind. Participants responded by facing the updated target location with eyes closed. The results indicate that people are able to update target locations behind them very nearly as well as target locations in front...|$|E
40|$|Writing {{a thesis}} in English is a {{mountain}} to climb. We go up. The aluminum stick in our left hand {{is the master}} research question; the <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> in our right hand, the specific research questions; and in our backpack, bibliographic research, a. k. a. the big-o literature review. We’re far above the deductive and hypothesis-oriented thesis, and we’re now pursuing a thesis format with a decentralized, minimal yet potent use of bibliographic research, our format of choice, one that eliminates the literature review, and now the nylon rope whistling, the sticks snapping the rock, trying to hold a tune, bidi-bidi-bom-bom, and all those note cards and paper sheets loose and rattling like ceramic shards in our backpacks, as we go up.

40|$|This study proposes {{establishing}} a methodology for generating algal biomass from spores and gametes of Macrocystis pyrifera (Phaeophyta, Laminariales) on nylon ropes that are 100 m long and 3 mm in diameter, {{installed on the}} sea surface. The algae are initially farmed in tanks with seawater of 11 °- 13 °C, pH 8. 2, salinity 28 - 33, radiation 75 - 100 &# 956;m- 2 s- 1, aeration every 20 min, the addition of nutrients (NaNO 3 and Na 3 PO 4), and a 12 : 12 photoperiod. Twenty days after beginning the cultivation, male gametophytes were 17 &# 956;m long by 2. 5 &# 956;m in diameter, and female gametophytes were 10. 5 &# 956;m by 7. 5 &# 956;m. After 60 days of cultivation, the elongated laminar sporophytes were 412 &# 956;m by 103 &# 956;m. After 195 days, ropes with 2500 &# 956;m long sporophytes were installed in the sea at 1 m depth (intermediate cultivation phase), obtaining specimens 36 cm in length after 30 days. Of these specimens, 46 individuals between 30 and 40 cm in size were selected and tied to a 15 m long <b>guide</b> <b>rope</b> that was installed on the surface by means of buoys and anchored to the bottom. After three months, these specimens reached sizes of more than 3 m in length, with abundant laminate biomass surface, reaching an average of 7 kg per specimen, lacking stipes, and with holdfasts of a few centimeters. The surface technique used avoids the herbivory by crustaceans and sea urchins that occurs when the initial developmental stages are done on the seafloor...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The snake Boiga irregularis, {{an exotic}} on Guam, has {{eliminated}} {{the majority of}} the native vertebrates there. We tested traps designed to control this arboreal snake during three periods of 20 - 41 days in 1988 and 1989. The relative trapping successes with different baits and trap configurations indicated that this snake will not readily push through a visually obstructed entrance. However, under some conditions, 80 % of the snakes escaped from traps lacking a physical blockage at the entrance. Live bait was more suc-cessful than odoriferous bait alone, and odoriferous <b>guide</b> <b>ropes</b> that led to trap entrances did not enhance capture rates. These findings corroborate laboratory experiments indicating an unusually strong dependence on visual cues in this highly successful nocturnal predator...|$|R
60|$|Close at hand, now, was {{a chance}} for a blood-curdling Alpine adventure. Close at hand was the snowy mass of the Great Altels cooling its topknot in the sky and daring us to an ascent. I was fired with the idea, and {{immediately}} made up my mind to procure the necessary <b>guides,</b> <b>ropes,</b> etc., and undertake it. I instructed Harris to go to the landlord of the inn and set him about our preparations. Meantime, I went diligently to work to read up and find out what this much-talked-of mountain-climbing was like, and how one should go about it--for in these matters I was ignorant. I opened Mr. Hinchliff's SUMMER MONTHS AMONG THE ALPS (published 1857), and selected his account of his ascent of Monte Rosa.|$|R
