50|$|Those {{are only}} the {{rudimentary}} costs of the game however. The calendar also shows {{the costs of the}} next city improvement {{in each of the three}} categories — as a city is improved in a category, that segment has its card flipped down calendar style to reveal the newly built improvement, any advantages gained by the improvement, and the updated cost of upgrading to the next level in that category. Each segment, as it is flipped down, also shows the updated <b>dice</b> <b>pattern</b> needed to earn the player a progress card in that category.|$|E
50|$|Dice Master Mode is {{the newest}} feature in the PlayStation Dance Dance Revolution X2 game. The mode {{requires}} you to roll dice and land on a specific space where a mission is placed. The mission will have a sealed envelope if not completed, and an open envelope if it is completed. You {{start out with a}} normal 1-6 sided dice, and a second dice which chooses which character will have to move that amount. Starting out with six characters, will you have to move in a <b>dice</b> <b>pattern</b> to unlock more missions, more characters, and more songs.|$|E
50|$|He {{is further}} {{credited}} {{with the introduction of}} the Sillitoe Tartan which is more commonly recognized as the black and white <b>diced</b> <b>pattern</b> on police cap bands, originally based on that used by several Scottish regiments on the Glengarry.|$|R
40|$|Synaesthesia {{is often}} {{triggered}} by numbers, {{although it is}} conceivable that different aspects of numerical representation are responsible for different variants of synaesthesia. For individuals with "higher synaesthesia" it is assumed that number meaning (or numerosity) is responsible for the elicitation of synaesthetic experiences. This study documents a case study of a synaesthete, TD, who broadly fits this profile. TD reports that the same colours are elicited from physically different representations of number (digits, <b>dice</b> <b>patterns</b> and finger counting) provided that they share the same numerosity. The authenticity of his synaesthesia is established using Stroop-like priming and interference paradigms. Not only does synaesthetic colour interfere with veridical colour judgements, but also veridical colours can interfere with numerosity judgments. This suggests a close bi-directional coupling between numerosity and colour. Together, these findings constrain theories concerning the neural basis of synaesthesia...|$|R
5000|$|Kilt hose {{are long}} {{stockings}} normally worn knee-high with {{the upper part}} of the hose folded back down to create a thicker cuff just below the knee. They are made of wool or Acrylic or some combination thereof and are available in a variety of solid colors so as to match any tartan colour. They can also be found in <b>diced</b> <b>patterns,</b> which are required wear for Highland dancers. The most common colour of hose however, is the cream, or 'off-white' hose, the colour of unbleached wool. Pipers often wear brilliant white 'pipers hose' made of entirely synthetic fibre. Piper hose differs also in that the top of the hose has a 'built-in' cuff with a raised texture. The [...] "Lassie" [...] and [...] "Laddie" [...] characters from WeeSing's Grandpa's Magical Toys wear white hose as part of their fictionalized Scottish costumes.|$|R
50|$|Preliminary {{excavations}} at {{the beginning}} of January 1961 began near a remote valley named Taruga near the village of Takushara. The trial excavations took place during a period of eight days. The finds included objects of wrought iron, a quantity of iron slag, fragments of tuyere, pottery, figurine fragments, red ocher, quartz hammer-stones, and small concentrations of charcoal. The most famous finds at the site were the pottery graters which were shallow, flat-bottomed dishes which were deeply scored inside with <b>diced</b> <b>patterns</b> to produce a sharp abrasive surface. These pottery graters were probably used for food preparation. In the preliminary excavation a proton magnetometer survey was used to try and locate furnaces. The survey revealed a total of 61 magnetic anomalies which were mostly located in a flat, central area which probably indicated the limits of actual occupation. Twenty of the anomalies revealed concentrations of slag and nine of them contained in situ structures of furnace walls and bases. The most common type of artefact found was domestic pottery which can be divided into two different types. One type are bowls or shallow basins without lips and the other are globular pots which have averted lips. Because of this preliminary excavation, the Nok Culture would start being regarded as belonging to the Iron Age.|$|R
50|$|Dice {{stacking}} is {{a performance}} art, akin to juggling or sleight-of-hand, {{in which the}} performer scoops dice off a flat surface with a dice cup and then sets the cup down while moving it in a pattern that stacks the dice into a vertical column via centripetal force and inertia. Various dice arrangements, colors of <b>dice,</b> scooping <b>patterns</b> and props allow for many degrees of complexity and difficulty. Dice stacking is usually performed with canceled casino dice, as their square edges and heavy weight give them an advantage when being stacked.|$|R
5000|$|The pips on dice are {{arranged}} in specific patterns as shown. Asian style <b>dice</b> bear similar <b>patterns</b> to Western ones, but the pips are closer {{to the center of}} the face; in addition, the pips are differently sized on Asian style dice, and the pips are colored red on the 1 and 4 sides. One possible explanation is that red fours are of Indian origin. In some older sets, the [...] "one" [...] pip is a colorless depression.|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are crucial}} {{regulatory}} RNAs, originated from hairpin precursors. For the past decade, {{researchers have been}} focusing extensively on miRNA profiles in various plants. However, {{there have been few}} studies on the global profiling of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), even in model plants. Here, {{for the first time in}} a non-model plant—Abelmoschus esculentus with negligible genome information—we are reporting the global profiling to characterize the miRNAs and their associated pre-miRNAs by applying a next generation sequencing approach. Preliminarily, we performed small RNA (sRNA) sequencing with five biological replicates of leaf samples to attain 207, 285, 863 reads; data analysis using miRPlant revealed 128 known and 845 novel miRNA candidates. With the objective of seizing their associated hairpin precursors, we accomplished pre-miRNA sequencing to attain 83, 269, 844 reads. The paired end reads are merged and adaptor trimmed, and the resulting 40 – 241 nt (nucleotide) sequences were picked out for analysis by using perl scripts from the miRGrep tool and an in-house built shell script for Minimum Fold Energy Index (MFEI) calculation. Applying the stringent criteria of the <b>Dicer</b> cleavage <b>pattern</b> and the perfect stem loop structure, precursors for 57 known miRNAs of 15 families and 18 novel miRNAs were revealed. Quantitative Real Time (qRT) PCR was performed to determine the expression of selected miRNAs...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} non-coding RNAs that {{regulate}} {{a variety of}} biological processes. The latest version of the miRBase database (Release 18) includes 1, 157 mouse and 680 rat mature miRNAs. Only one new rat mature miRNA {{was added to the}} rat miRNA database from version 16 to version 18 of miRBase, suggesting that many rat miRNAs remain to be discovered. Given the importance of rat as a model organism, discovery of the completed set of rat miRNAs is necessary for understanding rat miRNA regulation. In this study, next generation sequencing (NGS), microarray analysis and bioinformatics technologies were applied to discover novel miRNAs in rat kidneys. MiRanalyzer was utilized to analyze the sequences of the small RNAs generated from NGS analysis of rat kidney samples. Hundreds of novel miRNA candidates were examined according to the mappings of their reads to the rat genome, presence of sequences that can form a miRNA hairpin structure around the mapped locations, <b>Dicer</b> cleavage <b>patterns,</b> and the levels of their expression determined by both NGS and microarray analyses. Nine novel rat hairpin precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNA) were discovered with high confidence. Five of the novel pre-miRNAs are also reported in other species while four of them are rat specific. In summary, 9 novel pre-miRNAs (14 novel mature miRNAs) were identified via combination of NGS, microarray and bioinformatics highthroughput technologies...|$|R
40|$|The RNaseIII-containing enzyme Dicer is {{believed}} to be required for the processing of most, if not all, microRNAs (miRNAs) and for processing long dsRNA into small interfering RNAs. Because the complete loss of Dicer in both zebrafish and mice results in early embryonic lethality, it has been impossible to determine what role, if any, <b>Dicer</b> has in <b>patterning</b> later tissues in the developing vertebrate embryo. To bypass the early requirement of Dicer in development, we have created a conditional allele of this gene in mice. Using transgenes to drive Cre expression in discrete regions of the limb mesoderm, we find that removal of Dicer results in the loss of processed miRNAs. Phenotypically, developmental delays, in part due to massive cell death as well as disregulation of specific gene expression, lead to the formation of a much smaller limb. Thus, Dicer is required for the formation of normal mouse limbs. Strikingly, however, we did not detect defects in basic patterning or in tissue-specific differentiation of Dicer-deficient limb buds...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of selection for body weight on the genetic variability and diversity in broiler lines. Two paternal broiler lines (LL and LLc) were used. LL line was selected for 12 generations for growth and carcass and reproduction characteristics. The LLc line was established from LL line in 1985 and mated at random. Blood samples from six chickens per line were collected and used for molecular analysis. Also, a DNA pool was made for each line to compare effects between lines. Data were analyzed considering the collected information on the presence or absence of DNA bands. Band sharing scores were calculated using the <b>DICE</b> coefficient. The <b>pattern</b> of the 21 most representative bands was used. DNA fingerprinting (DFP) showed 90. 48 % of polymorphism bands for both lines. Difference between lines was not due to the presence or absence of bands, but to the frequency of such bands in each genotype. Considering that both lines had the same genetic background, changes on band frequency were probably due to selection. Selection for body weight had an effect on the band frequency as evaluated by DFP, and for this reason this technique could be used as a tool in the selection process. Results also suggest that bands 4, 5 and 19 were linked to body weight traits, and bands 9, 10, 12, 13 and 21 were linked to reproductive traits such as egg production...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional {{regulators}} that tune gene expression. Despite {{the modest}} 2 -fold repression that miRNA activity generally confers on a target, miRNAs {{are critical for}} many biological processes including development and differentiation. Due to this mild repression directly conferred by miRNA activity, miRNAs coordinate with other regulators such as transcription factors to shape the gene expression landscape and phenotypes of a cell. To understand the function of global miRNA activity in regulating the specification of the somatic state, we deleted Dicer in a murine mesenchymal stem cell model. Upon exploring the consequences of Dicer deletion, we identify a specific let- 7 regulated mid-embryonic program within the global de-repression of miRNA targets accompanying Dicer loss. We further observe within the landscape of let- 7 regulated targets, an activation of greater than 50 -fold of known oncofetal (Igf 2 bp 1 / 2 / 3) genes, an effect much greater than that typically reported for miRNA-mRNA interactions. This suggests a requirement of let- 7 for the continual suppression of mid-embryonic programs in adult cells. To investigate the regulation of these oncofetal genes, we restored miRNAs through re-expression of Dicer. Despite complete reconstitution of the posttranscriptional activity of miRNAs, the activated oncofetal genes are incompletely suppressed. Igf 2 bp 1 - 3 are components of a larger set of irreversible oncogenes whose chromatin signature indicate that they are transcriptionally activated upon Dicer deletion. This transcriptional activation is maintained, despite miRNA restoration in Dicer rescued cells. Consistent with this expression <b>pattern,</b> <b>Dicer</b> rescued cells are able to form tumors in mice, a phenotype absent in the parental wild-type and Dicer knockout cells. Moreover, the irreversible gene set is amplified in human cancers and is predictive of patient survival indicating that our observations are relevant to human disease. Finally, we develop a computational method to decipher the indirect, transcription factor mediated effects of miRNAs on gene expression. Through comprehensive analysis of ChIP-Seq, CLIP-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets, we quantitatively assess the relative contributions of direct posttranscriptional miRNA activity and transcriptional activity on gene expression changes resulting from Dicer deletion. We find that transcriptional changes contribute significantly to perturbations in gene expression resulting from global miRNA loss upon Dicer deletion. In summary, our work expands the current knowledge of fundamental roles for miRNAs in differentiated mammalian cells. As further work builds on our observations, the increased understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation will inform therapeutic strategies for human disease. by Courtney K. JnBaptiste. Thesis: Ph.
