3000|$|As {{found during}} the {{literature}} review, {{the benefit of}} standardised KPI definitions is unquestioned. We proposed a standardised KPI <b>definition</b> <b>sheet</b> for all the included metrics to ensure alignment with the interpretation of metrics among all parties. Objectives of the <b>definition</b> <b>sheet</b> for each metric are to ensure the same application of the (K)PIs throughout the company and supply chain, {{as well as the}} transparency of data sources, the calculation and the interaction to other metrics. Thanks to this effort in metrics definition, we hope to address the current hurdle encountered in many companies that cross-site comparisons and identification of best practices are hindered by the non-standardised use of (K)PIs [57]. We provided an example of a KPI <b>definition</b> <b>sheet</b> for the flow metric of inbound logistics transport function in the appendix (see Fig.  17).

2500|$|Drawing is a {{metalworking}} {{process which}} uses tensile forces to stretch metal or glass. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire, bar, and tube drawing. The specific <b>definition</b> for <b>sheet</b> metal drawing {{is that it}} involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For wire, bar, and tube drawing the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a cold working process, however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or hollow sections {{in order to reduce}} forces.|$|R

For example, a [...] "table" [...] element could be defined in a new namespace with new semantics different from the HTML [...] "table" [...] element and the browser {{will be able to}} differentiate between the two. In providing namespaces, XHTML combined with CSS allow authoring communities to easily extend the semantic vocabulary of documents.

It also utilizes TEDS (transducer electronic data <b>sheet)</b> <b>definition</b> and configuration technique and virtual TEDS parsing algorithm to achieve smart sensor self-recognition. Then, an IEEE 1451 smart weighing sensor system is constructed using this mechanism and its self-recognition properties are tested.

40|$|Flanders Marine Institute and its {{consortium}} of experts on non-indigenous species conduct an ongoing effort {{to collect and}} maintain a list of alien species with documented established populations in the Belgian part of the North Sea and its adjacent estuaries. The list strives to include all currently known non-indigenous and cryptogenic species registered in salt and brackish environments in the Belgian part of the North Sea, the Belgian coastal zone and adjacent estuaries (Yser, Scheldt, Ostend Sluicedock). The discovery of America (1492) marked by a strong increase in trans-Atlantic shipping is set as the historical baseline of this assessment. This effort scrutinizes intentional and unintentional introductions by man or other vectors. Alien species {{for which there is}} no evidence of resident populations are not included in the list, nor are species that are limited to the fresh water environment. Newly registered species as a consequence of (expected) naturally induced migrations are also excluded. This initiative aims at providing a freely available online source of information on non-indigenous species and its associated network of experts for this study area. This includes <b>definitions,</b> information <b>sheets</b> and background literature, by species, and further links to European and international initiatives. Each information sheet describes the life cycle and ecology of the species, the introduction pathways and distribution, the possible effects or impacts of the species on its environment and potential mitigation measures.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} comparison of plasma sheet properties from Geotail measurements {{and from the}} Lyon–Fedder–Mobarry (LFM) global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. We compare {{more than three years}} of Geotail data with 10 consecutive days of simulation results driven by real solar wind data. Both studies have statistically similar solar wind inputs and a plasma <b>sheet</b> <b>definition</b> that follows from criteria that are widely used in the literature. We map the average plasma pressures, fields, and flows as functions ofXY(GSM) position within the equatorial plasma sheet. The comparisons show a persistent dawn–dusk asymmetry in the statistical patterns of plasma flows and electric fields in both the Geotail and the simulation results. Geotail observes a less rapid fall-off of thermal pressure with downtail distance than is seen in the simulation. The Geotail dataset suffers from an orbital bias, but we show the dawn–dusk asymmetry persists after accounting for the bias. Overall, our study finds similar statistical plasma pressures, magnetic pressures, and perpendicular flows in Geotail measurements, and the LFM MHD regions of the plasma sheet...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{continuous}} weight reduction {{effort in the}} automotive sector, formability enhancement of aluminum alloys in forming and hydroforming processes is gathering much attention from research institutes and industries. During sheet forming processes, large deformations are desired to obtain complex shapes but these are limited {{by the appearance of}} defects such as wrinkling and cracks. To avoid these issues, intermediate annealing heat treatments are often applied as a possible solution. Nevertheless in large components where small details have to be created, local heat treatment through lasers can be cost effective over the furnace treatment of the whole part and it would limit possible geometrical distortion in large components. The following article presents fiber laser process parameters <b>definition</b> on deformed <b>sheets</b> made of Al 6060 alloy. Grain structure variation and hardness decrease were studied to correctly select process parameters (laser power, feeding speed and overlapping among subsequent passes) to increase material formability. In addition, a systematic comparison between fiber laser and furnace heat treatment was assessed proving the equivalence of the two methods in terms of achieved mechanical proprieties...|$|R
40|$|The new Basel II Capital Accord {{has been}} one of the {{financial}} sector’s most fiercely discussed topics in the recent past. After many years’ debate, the regulations formally took effect on January 1, 2007, and the advanced measurement approaches are scheduled to become fully operational on January 1, 2008. The new regulations will cause a number of changes in the area of credit risk. The calculation of risk-weighted assets, and thus of regulatory capital, will henceforth be based on borrowers’ credit ratings to a much greater extent than according to the old regulations (Basel I). The concept of capital (i. e. the definition of own funds) itself will remain largely unchanged, although it was subject to repeated changes in recent decades. This paper examines the definition of capital in the new Austrian Banking Act and shows that the capital concept will need to be modified in the future. In addition, it defines regulatory capital in relation to other capital concepts, revealing inter alia that capital has a broader <b>definition</b> than balance <b>sheet</b> equity. An analysis of the capital adequacy of Austrian credit institutions demonstrates that their capital ratio clearly exceeds minimum capital requirements and that the composition of banks’ capital shows a favorably high share of core capital.

Design/methodology/approach – The CPACS fuselage structure description includes the <b>definition</b> of arbitrary <b>sheets</b> and structural profiles which can be combined {{with a variety of}} material definitions to so-called structural elements. Besides the definition of these structural elements, the definitions of structural members, such as stringers, frames, floor structures and pressure bulkheads as well as the definitions of the complex load introduction regions that transfer loads from the wings and the empennage into the fuselage shell are introduced. Finally, exemplary models generated with different mesh generation tools developed at DLR Institute of Structures and Design are presented. These models are suitable for subsequent static or dynamic structural analyses. Findings – The CPACS fuselage structure description is suitable for defining standard fuselage configurations including complex load introduction regions suitable for different types of structural analysis. Practical implications – The work shows exemplary fuselage models generated from the introduced CPACS fuselage description suitable for subsequent static and dynamic structural analyses. As the CPACS standard is available for download the described definitions may be used by universities, research organizations or industry. Originality/value – The work presents the definitions of the fuselage structure within the CPACS schema that were mainly developed by the authors employed at the DLR Institute of Structures and Design.

40|$|International audienceLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{has been}} {{recently}} intensively used {{to quantify the}} environmental impacts of metal production, in particular considering copper. In this context, this study aims at coupling simulation of mineral processing with LCA to assess the environmental performance of metal production in a life cycle perspective. Process simulation builds on reported experimental data measured from a complete sampling campaign, so that process flowrates and composition for all the water and material circuit streams are assessed. However, standard process simulation usually primarily focuses at resource efficiency (how much metal is recovered?). The coupling with LCA is implemented to additionally account for the process " eco-efficiency " in the assessment of its performance (what are the environmental impacts that the process induces?). Coupling process simulation and LCA could have several benefits: it would allow providing a consistent view of the whole process chain, in particular by covering the upscaling step and filling the data gaps. The coupling of both methods is applied to the case of a process chain for copper production from a black shale rich ore. This process chain includes standard concentration operations (comminution, classification and flotation) and further operations in hydrometallurgy (bioleaching and metal recovery). Experimental work has namely been performed with a view to optimizing the recovery of metals in some flotation steps. In this study, the mass balance is calculated, operation by operation. A process simulation is performed by using the process simulation software USIM PAC™, including complete flow <b>sheet</b> <b>definition,</b> choice of models for the unit operations and adjustment of the simulator to the operation mass balances. For the simulation outputs to be complete for the derivation of the process chain Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), the models already implemented in USIM PAC™ are complemented by additional models that link emissions to the environment and consumptions of reagents to the processed ore all along the process chain. The inputs/outputs relative to each operation are accordingly calculated through mineral processing simulation. These data are further used as inputs to LCI modeling and subsequent Life Cycle Impact Assessment, by using standard LCA database software (i. e. ecoinvent & SimaPro). The calculated environmental impact indicators enable to determine the key environmental issues related to the developed process chain, in particular through a hotspot analysis (highlighting which operations and which emissions are the highest contributors to {{the environmental impacts of}} the analyzed system). Finally, the potentialities for applying simulation of mineral processing coupled with LCA in support to the environmental assessment of mineral processing chains is demonstrated by modeling the effect of ore changes and technological innovations through sensitivity analysis, by taking into account their related specific parameters when performing their environmental assessment...|$|R

From the conception of three timber structures, it is discussed how such geometrical principles are further explored spatially, structurally and materially. Finally, a series of subsequent physical experiments are put forward in search of new topologies, generated from the description of a line moving in space. An initial investigation on timber formwork research is presented through the realization of three timber structures; The Pinch, Sweep and Warp. Sequences of changing wooden trusses capture the movement of a line to support ruled decks performing as new active grounds. In doing so, the trusses are organized transversally for the Pinch, tangentially for the Sweep and longitudinally for the Warp. The results are a series of three small scale social programs: a library, a play area and a roadside marketplace. Located in remote mountainous landscapes (Yunnan, China), each project was designed with a strategy of maximizing the use and experience of the surrounding landscape. They were each built with students {{and with the help of}} a local timber workshop, developing construction methods for adapting highly articulated geometries to simple traditional techniques. Situated at the intersection of teaching and research, experimentation and on-site construction, complex geometry and local craftsmanship, these design-build projects engage with full scale construction in difficult sites through experiential learning. A live prototyping exercise further speculates on the line as vehicle to describe geometries of revolution. With the support of a 5 -axis custom-made automated hot wire, serving as the main research tool, specific protocols for synchronized motions (4 translations and 1 rotation) are inputted. As a result, new slab topologies defined by movement and time emerge, that would be difficult to preconceive through other means of (digital) fabrication. These protocols of motions are then put to use to section blocks of EPS foam into part-formworks for thin shell concrete casting. By virtue of being described by successions of straight lines, these intricate slabs retain effective structural properties and a direct link to timber formwork and to full scale construction. As much prominence in (digital) fabrication has been placed on surface <b>definition</b> machined from <b>sheet</b> materials, the presented prototyping procedure seek to reinstate the merits of working with volumetric materials. To this effect, a parallel is drawn with stereotomy. The effective method of stone carving invented by Philippe De L’Orme also made use of 2 d geometries to guide the stone cutter in the carving of a block. Although this time, by operating internally in the slicing of a block from the automation of a line moving in space, new spatial articulations in Architecture may emerge again from active geometries solely defined by time and movement...|$|R
