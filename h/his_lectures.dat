5|$|Like John of Tynemouth, {{a number}} of the glosses on a late-twelfth-century copy of Gratian's Decretum are {{ascribed}} to Simon. These take the form of notes from <b>his</b> <b>lectures</b> that were later added to the margins of copies of the Decretum. This combined work is now at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge University, catalogued as manuscript (MS) 283/676. Another set of student notes from <b>his</b> <b>lectures,</b> this time entitled Quaestiones, survives as part of British Library MS Royal E.VII. This work includes lecture notes not only from Simon's classes, but from John and Nicholas' as well.|$|E

5|$|Some of John's writings, {{dealing with}} canon law, still survive. They show {{him to have}} been steeped in canon law and quite knowledgeable. In his writings, he often cited earlier canonists or theologians as well as {{contemporary}} writers.

These {{take the form of}} notes from <b>his</b> <b>lectures</b> that were later added to the margins of copies of the Decretum.

5|$|But {{he became}} {{increasingly}} possessed by religious mysticism {{as he fell}} {{under the influence of}} the Polish philosopher Andrzej Towiański, whom he met in 1841. <b>His</b> <b>lectures</b> became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.|$|E
5|$|Dorothy soon fell in {{love with}} Pound. In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy {{attended}} <b>his</b> <b>lectures</b> at the London Polytechnic Institution; in June 1910 they joined him in Sirmione, Italy. For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from writing to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11.

5|$|Peter Martyr Vermigli (8 September 1499 – 12 November 1562) was a Reformed theologian of the Reformation period. Born in Florence, he fled Italy {{to avoid}} the Roman Inquisition in 1542.

5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, it continued {{for almost a year}} due to the commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of <b>his</b> <b>lectures</b> was on interior design.|$|E

In October, he matriculated as an undergraduate at Christ Church, Oxford. Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying for the first time and performed satisfactorily in examinations. In 1861, he transferred to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was tutored in history by Charles Kingsley, Regius Professor of Modern History. Kingsley's efforts brought forth the best academic performances of Edward's life, and Edward actually looked forward to <b>his</b> <b>lectures.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around 1843, Kogălniceanu's {{enthusiasm for}} change was {{making him a}} suspect to the Moldavian authorities, and <b>his</b> <b>lectures</b> on History were {{suspended}} in 1844. His passport was revoked while he was traveling to Vienna as the secret representative of the Moldavian political opposition (attempting to approach Metternich and discuss Sturdza's ouster). Briefly imprisoned after returning to Iași, he soon after became involved in political agitation in Wallachia, assisting his friend Ion Ghica: in February, during a Romantic nationalist celebration, he traveled to Bucharest, where he met members of the secretive Frăția organization and of its legal front, Soțietatea Literară (including Ghica, Nicolae Bălcescu, August Treboniu Laurian, Alexandru G. Golescu, and C. A. Rosetti).|$|E
5|$|Despite declining health, Vivekananda {{left for}} the West {{for a second time}} in June 1899 {{accompanied}} by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat) in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. <b>His</b> <b>lectures</b> in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita.
