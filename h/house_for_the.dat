5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of her life, never moving out of the nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later hanged herself from a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the {{characteristics}} of <b>house</b> designs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elderly and disabled. We devised a method <b>for</b> characterizing <b>the</b> plans of new houses and compared examples of new <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled and ordinary non-adapted houses in the Hokkaido region of Japan. We examined 65 <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled and 70 ordinary non-adapted houses. The results showed that the proportion of corridor type designs, in which there are two lines of flow in the bedroom, was significantly more in <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled. In addition, more classifications were needed to categorize <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disabled, some of which contained a toilet and/or bathroom for exclusive use by the disabled member of the household. 本研究の目的は，高齢者・障害者同居住宅の平面構成の特性を明らかにすることである。そのために，住宅平面の類型化を用いた手法を新たに考案し，北海道内の新築事例から障害者住宅と一般住宅とを比較検討した。得られたサンプル数は障害者住宅が 65 ，一般住宅が 70 だった。その結果，障害者住宅は，一般住宅に比べて本人の寝室に 2 つの動線をもつ「回廊型」が有意に多いことが示された。また，障害者住宅は類型化した全てのタイプに分散され，さらにトイレ・浴室が本人専用であることから疑似型が生じた。従って，障害者住宅の平面特性として「回廊型」が多く，多様性であることが示唆される...|$|R

The station was included on the Nordmarka maps published in 1913 and 1938.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston.

The signpost at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse.

5|$|During the Second World War, the Highfield {{location}} of the College meant it was directly in the war zone itself.

5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez.

When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E

5|$|In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had {{the tree}} {{moved from the}} Ellipse to the White House grounds, where it {{remained}} until 1954 when it was returned to the Ellipse. In 1946, the lighting ceremony became a televised event, though not with widespread telecast. From 1948 to 1951, President Harry S. Truman signalled the lighting of the tree by remote control from his Independence, Missouri home, but in 1952, he stayed at the White <b>House</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lighting ceremony.

In retirement, Krueger was involved in a number of charity and community organizations, including the United Service Organization, the Red Cross, and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and he served as director of civil defense for San Antonio and Bexar County.|$|E

Simon Loisel did well enough to keep a live-in servant and to reside in an expensive <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time. Prior to John being born, Lucille Loisel had been employed as a teacher at a Catholic school in Coeur d'Alene. John Loisel was the eldest child, with six younger brothers and two sisters.|$|E
5|$|Medical issues forced Schweitzer {{to leave}} Africa many times, and {{sometimes}} Albert {{kept her from}} returning at times. When Albert {{decided to return to}} Africa in 1924, he took on Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, where Albert was building a <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> family.

Much of the abbey was rebuilt under abbots William Wyke (1489-1504) and Thomas Broke (1505-1522) with the funding being provided by the leasing of the Demesne farm.|$|E
