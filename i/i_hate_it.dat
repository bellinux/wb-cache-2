500|$|For {{months after}} its passage, Lincoln did not {{publicly}} {{comment on the}} Kansas-Nebraska Act, but he came to strongly oppose it. On October 16, 1854, in his [...] "Peoria Speech", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated {{en route to the}} presidency. Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, he said the Kansas Act had a [...] "declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world..." [...] Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas-Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, Gaga {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with}} the video {{in an interview with}} Time Out, saying: [...] "I can't even watch the Telephone video, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> so much. Beyoncé and I are great together. But there are so many ideas in that video and all I see in that video is my brain throbbing with ideas and I wish I had edited myself a little bit more." ...|$|E

500|$|Narula gave Abraham (who plays {{a fashion}} {{photographer}} who works and {{lives on the}} beach) cargo and boxer shorts, trunks for swimming scenes, and jerseys and football shorts in windcheater fabrics. He also gave him flip-flops, canvas shoes and T-shirts with slogans such as a [...] "Use A Condom", which the designer considered important. Malhotra and Narula collaborated on the colour palette: [...] "If Manish would give Priyanka yellow, then I would go for a green for John and a pink for Abhishek." [...] Narula also designed for Deol, Irani, Kher and Mukherjee. He chose brands such as Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci for Deol (the Verve editor), giving him sleek suits with short jackets and skinny pants with narrow bottoms. Kirron Kher, who played Bachchan's mother, was styled as a typical Punjabi salwar-kameez-clad woman with gota embroidery. For Sushmita Mukherjee, who played Chopra's aunt, Narula chose animal prints and diamonds, pearls, silver and gold: [...] "When we shopped for her it was like 'oh god, this is so tacky let’s buy it or oh, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it.</b> It’ll be fabulous.|$|E
500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maradona has {{declared}} {{his opposition to}} what he identifies as imperialism, notably during the 2005 Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina. There he protested George W. Bush's presence in Argentina, wearing a T-shirt labeled [...] "STOP BUSH" [...] (with the [...] "s" [...] in [...] "Bush" [...] being replaced with a swastika) and referring to Bush as [...] "human garbage". In August 2007, Maradona went further, making an appearance on Chávez's weekly television show Alo Presidente and saying, [...] "I hate everything {{that comes from the}} United States. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> with all my strength." [...] In December 2008, Maradona expressed admiration for Bush's successor, President-elect Barack Obama, and held great expectations for him.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea for}} the {{television}} show Family was born in Aaron Spelling's kitchen, where he and Leonard Goldberg {{came up with the}} idea about a show that centered on the emotional life of a family. They pitched the idea to Allen and she liked it. Allen spent two weeks at the Beverly Hills Hotel while she knocked out a script. Len and Aaron loved it; it was touching and had marvelous moments of compassion, and was exactly what they had talked about in the kitchen. The pilot was great, but ABC didn't buy it. It wasn't until two years later that ABC entered a production deal with Mike Nichols, who turned down all their ideas in favor of the script for Family that his Connecticut neighbor Jay Allen had shown him. It was Nichols who brought in Mark Rydell for the pilot which premiered at 10:00pm on March 9, 1976; the series went on to run for four years and 86 episodes. Later in life Allen would remark about television: [...] "I hate it, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> because the buck doesn't stop anywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Darlington, {{while running}} {{in the top five}} with 3 laps to go, Busch got tapped from behind by Clint Bowyer and spun out, hitting a barrier head-on. Because of energy {{absorbing}} walls, Busch was uninjured, but waved angrily towards Bowyer under caution and showed discontent with Bowyer in post-race ceremonies. In regards to the incident with Bowyer, Busch said [...] "That was a terrible way to end {{what could have been a}} decent night. We struggled at times to get the balance of the Haas Automation Chevrolet right, but we kind of found our spot just past the halfway point and made slight adjustments the rest of the way. We called for a two-tire stop at the end hoping to gain some track position, but it seemed like everyone had the same idea. We gained a little, but the guys behind us all had four tires. I tried to hold them off the best I could, but someone (Bowyer) moved me out of their way and it ruined our night. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> for the team, but we keep learning each week and we will get better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kasey Kahne {{took the}} lead on the second Green-White-Checker attempt and held off Matt Kenseth to score his first win of the season. [...] "Yeah, man, it took a lot," [...] said Kahne. [...] "We {{were all over the}} place during the race but the guys stayed with me and worked hard. On those restarts– I didn't know what would happen because I had great restarts all night and I {{struggle}} with restarts a lot. That's big, because {{that is one of the}} things you have to be good at and it worked really well tonight. Yeah, we are locked in and <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>it</b> comes down to this Atlanta or Richmond just about every year for me," [...] said Kahne. [...] "Sometimes we are in, sometimes we are out. But thankful that now at HMS I have been in all three years now." [...] "Those last two laps were really intense," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Things are looking up. I'm looking forward to the next 11." [...] "I couldn't capitalize, couldn't get the restarts and couldn't accelerate," [...] Denny Hamlin said. [...] "We just came up short.
