Behaviors include obstacle avoidance, wall following, obeying commands, and performing. The user determines the behaviors using voice recognition. Commands are issued to Omnibot, and it responds by repeating the words, and performs the specified behavior. Omnibot contains four different sensor suites, including infrared emitters and detectors, bump switches, voice recognition, and low-resolution vision. During wall following behavior, Omnibot will turn away from objects in its path. When it is doing wall following, it will follow the walls of a room, and it will also avoid bumping into obstacles. When Omnibot is in its obeying commands behavior, the user can instructs it to move the arms, <b>grippers,</b> <b>head,</b> and body. Omnibot is a slave, performing any tasks the user requests.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{simulation}} and initial experimental results for robust part handling by radially symmetric cylindrical electromagnetic <b>gripper</b> <b>heads,</b> {{that are used}} in foundry manufacturing assembly operation. Knowledge of the direct holding force is essential to determine if a given electromagnet is capable of preventing part slipping during pick and place operation. Energy based model and the magnetic circuit model have been described. The latter is developed further and compared with results from a FEA software. It was found that the magnetic circuit model, although simple in form, was limited in its ability to accurately predict the holding force over the entire range of conditions investigated. The shortcomings in the model were attributed to its inability to accurately model the leakage flux and non-uniform distribution of the magnetic flux. A finite element allowed for the ability to couple the mechanical and magnetic models. The finite element model was used to predict the magnetic field based off the solutions to the mechanical (�) and the magnetic model (B) ...|$|R
40|$|Powering and {{communication}} with micro robots to enable complex functions is a long-standing challenge as {{the size of}} robots continues to shrink. Physical connection of wires or components needed for wireless communication are complex and limited {{by the size of}} electronic and energy storage devices, making miniaturization of robots difficult. To explore an alternative solution, we designed and fabricated a micro soft swimming robot with both powering and controlling functions provided by remote light, which does not carry any electronic devices and batteries. In this approach, a polymer film containing azobenzene chromophore which is sensitive to ultra-violet (UV) light works as “motor”, and the UV light and visible light work as “power and signal lines”. Periodically flashing UV light and white light drives the robot flagellum periodically to swing to eventually push forward the robot in the glass tube filled with liquid. The <b>gripper</b> on robot <b>head</b> can be opened or closed by lights to grab and carry the load. This kind of remotely light-driven approach realizes complex driving and controlling of micro robotic structures, making it possible to design and fabricate even smaller robots. It will have great potential among applications in the micro machine and robot fields...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{development}} of new technologies, manual labour still continuous to play a large role within most modern agricultural operations, especially during harvest. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for new machines to reduce labour as a mean to limit costs, while increasing efficiency in a sustainable manner. This thesis concern itself with the design of a mechanism and control system for a robot arm that can substitute workers in logistical operations during strawberry harvest. More specifically, by lifting berry crates onto a robot platform and transporting them from the fields and to the packaging facilities. The robot arm is to be mounted on the platform composing a vehicle- manipulator system. As this thesis is connected to a general research project on agricultural robotics at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, the chosen platform is the associated field robot Thorvald II. The thesis is divided into two parts, where Part I concerns the mechanical design of the robot arm, while Part II propose a system for controlling the mechanism. The design development process has involved assessments of available solutions before selecting components on the basis of controllability, mechanical properties and costs. The process of selection in Part II is however, based on finding solutions that are compatible with the robot platform’s network (Controller Area Network) and operating system (Robotic Operating System). Part I: Design and Mechanics The design of the robot arm presented in this thesis begun with a preliminary feasibility study conducted by Bjurbeck in September 2016. Following the assessment of this study, the robot arm is designed to have two degrees of freedom operating in the xz-plane. When mounted on the platform, the arm will be free to operate in a 3 -dimensional space, as the platform moves in x and y-direction, and rotates around the z-axis. The arm is assembled from two parallel link pairs made from rectangular aluminium tubes, and a revolute and prismatic joint. Both joints are actuated by LinAk LA 36 linear electric actuators. The end effector of the arm is a <b>gripper</b> <b>head</b> designed to grasp the handles of the strawberry crate. The <b>gripper</b> <b>head</b> is self-aligning with the crate’s orientation {{in order to reduce the}} precision of control needed to envelop and grasp the crate. The frame of the <b>gripper</b> <b>head</b> is made from aluminium angle profiles and sheet metal. A worm drive DC motor actuate the gripper claws via a double link mechanism. Part II: Modeling and Control The geometry of the design presented in Part I is modelled mathematically and the inverse kinematics solved analytically. The kinematics will be used in future implementation of a position control system. Two RoboteQ SDC 2160 dual-channel controllers are chosen to control all four actuator mo- tors. The linear actuators are controlled in closed loop position tracking mode with absolute feedback. The gripper motor is controlled in open loop mode with end stop switches detecting the position of the claws. Experiments was conducted to match the controllers with the actuator motors. The experiments revealed firmware issues with the controller. The experiments also affirmed the controller need a script to operate the actuators efficiently. The thesis provides the foundations to build a prototype and write an operating script to test the mechanical design and control system...|$|E
40|$|Vision based robot {{applications}} {{have taken}} {{a great deal of}} attention, with the development of electronic and computer technology. The visual feedback loop is very effective for improving the dexterity and flexibility. In this study, application of real time visual servoing approach is presented that enables a robot to robustly execute arm grasping and manipulation tasks. This task is decomposed on four stages a) finding object b) determining object’s pose c) moving the robotic arm from an initial position towards the object d) grasping the object. The robot used in this work consists of an arm and head parts. The robotic arm has six degree of freedom, five degree of freedom are located at the arm while one degree of freedom is assigned to the <b>gripper.</b> <b>Head</b> has two degree of fredom which is pan-tilt platform. The image-based control strategy is designed using Fuzzy-PID controller. In this way, position error between target object and griper is minimized and the gripper can grasp the target object precisely. Real-time implementation of the proposed method is carried out using Matlab-Simulink. Experimental results show that, the developed design is valid to detect and grasp objects in real time...|$|E
