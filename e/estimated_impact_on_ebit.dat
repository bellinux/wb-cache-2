40|$|A tunnel for the High Speed Train (HST) was {{constructed}} in Barcelona with an Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). The tunnel crosses Barcelona and passes under some famous landmarks such as the Sagrada Familia and the Casa Mill Both monuments are UNESCO world heritage sites and a committee appointed by the UNESCO acted as external observers during the construction. Concerns about soil settlements and the hydrogeological impacts of the construction were raised. These concerns were addressed during the design stage to forestall any unexpected events. The methodology consisted of 1) characterising the geology in detail, 2) predicting the impacts caused in the aquifer, 3) predicting the soil displacements due to water table oscillations produced by the construction, and 4) monitoring the evolution of groundwater and soil settlements. The main <b>estimated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> groundwater was a moderate barrier effect. The barrier effect, the magnitude of which matched the predictions, was detected during construction. The monitoring of soil settlements revealed {{short and long term}} movements. The latter movements matched the analytical predictions of soil displacements caused by the groundwater oscillations.

30|$|The {{descriptive}} statistics in Table  3 support the narrative that households {{responded to the}} economic crisis by sending children into the workforce and that Jefas mitigated this behavior. Table  3 shows that the overall percentage of applicants’ children who reported working tripled from 0.8 % in 2001 (before the crisis) to 2.5 % in 2002 (after the crisis) but remained unchanged {{for the children of}} participants during that same time. Likewise, school attendance fell for all children after the crisis but the change was more than twice as large among the children of applicants.
