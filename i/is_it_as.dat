500|$|Upon its release, This Is It {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly, praised the album {{and gave it}} an overall rating of a B+. Vozick-Levinson described the album's track [...] "This Is It" [...] as being an [...] "uplifting ballad" [...] and felt that [...] "if you're feeling generous" [...] you can [...] "count the minimally distinguishable" [...] orchestra version of [...] "This Is It" [...] having {{thought of it as}} being a [...] "decent if slight addition to Jackson's songbook." [...] Vozick-Levinson stated that while the album's second disc only contains four tracks that were unreleased, that included a [...] "fairly unremarkable" [...] spoken-word poem, after hearing Jackson [...] "work out the vocal harmonies" [...] for [...] "Beat It," [...] he in particular, felt that This Is It was [...] "well worth the price of admission (or at least a healthy chunk of it)." [...] Brian Linder of IGN described This <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "freshly designed" [...] release of a greatest hits album, and that the album's tracks of an all-vocal arrangement of [...] "Beat It" [...] was [...] "particularly awesome" [...] and the acoustic version of [...] "She's Out of My Life" [...] allows Jackson's [...] "vocals to shine without the distraction of dated '70s musical underpinnings." [...] Linder did note that he felt that the album was both a [...] "fitting tribute" [...] to Jackson and a [...] "crass, commercial double-dip." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted similarities between [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] Beyoncé's previous singles including [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] {{and concluded that}} Beyoncé [...] "certainly knows how to dump a man in style". Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] could be [...] "Irreplaceable Part Two" [...] and noted that Beyoncé's vocal performance brings depth to the song. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point [...] "Irreplaceable", but [...] "nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> shady". He commended the optimism in the song's lyrics. Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyoncé's vocal performance [...] "as [...] wounded bird turned resilient lioness". Choosing [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] as the highlight of 4, Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as [...] "a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyoncé's ability to plow through it". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted the moderate chart performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", and wrote: [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] finds Beyoncé mining {{the same kind of}} girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think of the time I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels like the kind of crossover hit that will help 4 join the rest of Beyoncé's discography in multiplatinum land.|$|E
2500|$|Many besides Hobbes {{must have}} felt {{dissatisfied}} with the definition. It is ambiguous and obscure. In what sense is a law of nature a [...] "proposition"? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> {{the expression of a}} constant relation among facts, or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the expression of a divine commandment? A proposition is never in itself an ultimate fact although it may be the statement of such a fact. And in what sense is a law of nature an [...] "immutably true" [...] proposition? Is it so because men always and everywhere accept and act on it, or merely because they always and everywhere ought to accept and act on it? The definition, in fact, explains nothing.|$|E

2500|$|Most times, {{the early}} signs of {{osteosarcoma}} are caught on X-rays taken during routine dental check-ups. Osteosarcoma frequently develops in the mandible (lower jaw); accordingly, Dentist are trained to look for signs that may suggest osteosarcoma. Even though radiographic findings for this cancer vary greatly, one usually sees a symmetrical widening of the periodontal ligament space. If the dentist has reason to suspects osteosarcoma or another underlying disorder, {{he or she would}} refer the patient to a medical specialist. A biopsy of suspected osteosarcoma should be performed by a qualified orthopedic oncologist. The American Cancer Society states: [...] "Probably in no other cancer <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> important to perform this procedure properly. An improperly performed biopsy may make it difficult to save the affected limb from amputation." [...] It may also metastasise to the lungs, mainly appearing on the chest X-ray as solitary or multiple round nodules most common at the lower regions.|$|E
2500|$|After {{promoting}} Watermark, Enya purchased new {{recording equipment}} and started {{work on her}} next album, Shepherd Moons. She found the success of Watermark caused {{a considerable amount of}} pressure when it came to writing new songs, adding: [...] "I kept thinking [...] "Would this have gone on Watermark? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> good?" [...] Eventually I had to forget about this and start on a blank canvas and just really go with what felt right." [...] Enya wrote songs based on several ideas, including entries from her diary, The Blitz in London, and her grandparents. Shepherd Moons was released in November 1991, her first album released under Warner-led Reprise Records in the United States. It became a greater commercial success than Watermark, reaching number one at home for one week and number 17 in the United States. [...] "Caribbean Blue", its lead single, charted at number thirteen in the United Kingdom. By 1997, the album had reached multi-platinum certification for selling in excess of 1.2million copies in the United Kingdom and 5 million in the United States.|$|E
