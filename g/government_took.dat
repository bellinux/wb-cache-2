In January 2010, when accumulated losses already exceeded NT$70billion, THSRC signed a government-guaranteed refinancing deal in which eight government-dominated banks provided NT$382billion at lower interest rates and longer maturity. The government also approved the company's new variable depreciation charge.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} led to {{the white}} community also becoming increasing radicalised. Some whites planned to attempt a coup d'état if a black majority <b>government</b> <b>took</b> power. As law and order began to break down, white civilians formed militia groups known as Corps de Voluntaires Européens ("European Volunteer Corps") to police their neighbourhoods. These militias frequently attacked blacks.|$|E

At the end of the month, the partisan leadership, the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale Alta Italia (CLNAI), declared a general uprising in the main northern cities as the German forces retreated. With the CLNAI's assumption of control in Milan and the German army in northern Italy about to surrender, Mussolini fled the city on 25 April and attempted to escape north to Switzerland.|$|E

40|$|The "fairness" of {{negotiations}} between countries and resource extracting firms {{is subject to}} many accusations and counter-accusations and may be argued, in many instances, to impact the subsequent economic benefit to a host country from extraction. This paper examines the role of host country governance on the share of <b>government</b> <b>take</b> from extraction revenue. We attempt to disentangle a number of competing hypotheses regarding the relationship between governance and <b>government</b> <b>take</b> using panel data for US resource extracting multinational corporations (MNCs) operating abroad from the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the US Department of Commerce over 1982 - 1999. Using fixed effects regression, we find a statistically significant positive impact of institutional quality on <b>government</b> <b>take.</b> The nature of this relationship [...] whether this represents {{the result of a}} "corruption premium" paid by US MNCs or the exploitation of poor governance in negotiating <b>government</b> <b>take</b> [...] is not completely clear. The evidence presented does, however, indicate that potential forms of bargaining power other than institutional quality (e. g., outside options to the deal) do increase <b>government</b> <b>take,</b> indicating that bargaining power may nonetheless be an important factor. ...|$|R

The <b>government</b> <b>took</b> several measures to ensure the protection of animals and the environment. In 1933, the Nazis enacted a stringent animal-protection law that affected what was allowed for medical research. However, the law was only loosely enforced {{and in spite of}} a ban on vivisection the Ministry of the Interior readily handed out permits for experiments on animals.|$|E

They {{bought a}} semi-detached house called Mendips (named after {{the range of}} hills) at 251 Menlove Avenue (across {{the road from the}} Allerton Park golf course) in a middle-class area of Liverpool.

5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central <b>government</b> <b>took</b> an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E

In the prince's absence, Lon Nol did nothing to halt these activities. On 12th, the prime minister closed the port of Sihanoukville to the North Vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum to them. All PAVN/Viet Cong forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours (on 15 March) or face military action.|$|E
5|$|After 1906, the Canadian <b>Government</b> <b>took</b> {{over the}} Halifax Dockyard (now CFB Halifax) from the Royal Navy. This {{dockyard}} {{later became the}} command centre of the Royal Canadian Navy upon its founding in 1910. Just before the First World War, the Canadian government began to make a determined, costly effort to develop the harbour and waterfront facilities. The outbreak of the war brought Halifax back to prominence. As the Royal Canadian Navy had virtually no seaworthy ships of its own, the Royal Navy assumed responsibility for maintaining Atlantic trade routes by re-adopting Halifax as its North American base of operations. In 1915, management of the harbour fell {{under the control of}} the Royal Canadian Navy under the supervision of Captain Superintendent Edward Harrington Martin; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in Halifax, including patrol ships, tugboats, and minesweepers.|$|E

With an eye to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master town plan that called {{for the establishment of}} two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{government}} introduced {{monetary and}} fiscal policies {{to help keep}} the banks afloat during the financial crisis in 2008, and as a result the United Kingdom's national debt increased dramatically. The <b>Government</b> <b>took</b> majority shareholdings in Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland, both of which experienced financial difficulties. Large amounts of money were injected into several other banks, including newly merged HBOS-Lloyds TSB, which received £17billion. Domestic policies focusing on education, employment and health were introduced by the administration. The Labour Party was persuaded to give Gurkhas settlement rights in Britain by the campaign of actress Joanna Lumley and attracted criticism for its handling of the Scottish Government's release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahithe only person to have been convicted over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Brown was also dogged by allegations of bullying.|$|E

The <b>government</b> <b>took</b> the unusual {{decision}} to extend the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup as CDS, rather than promote one of the outgoing service chiefs. Thus all three, including Dannatt, retired, amid claims that Dannatt's potential promotion to CDS had been personally vetoed by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. His last act as CGS was to nominate Nick Houghton to become the next Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff.|$|E
