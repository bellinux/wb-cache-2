2500|$|Christina Aguilera {{approached}} {{record label}} RCA, then having financial difficulties, {{and was told}} to contact Disney. After being {{given the opportunity to}} record the theme to the 1998 film Mulan named [...] "Reflection" [...] it was reported she had gained a record deal with RCA Records with Aguilera saying [...] "I landed a record deal simultaneously as I landed the Mulan soundtrack. I had just turned seventeen years old, and during the same week, I just landed both. I recorded the Mulan soundtrack first and then a few months later <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> L.A. recording the record for about six months". When asked about the song and Aguilera, RCA executive Ron Fair commented, ...|$|E
60|$|The next moment, {{the worst}} {{bitterness}} {{of it was}} over. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the garden again. I saw her, and heard her, no more.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard no}} more. A moment later <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> God's air, fumbling with a fevered foot at the {{self-starter}} {{of the old}} car.|$|E
60|$|HENRY. How shouldst thou {{know that}} never hast loved one? Come, I {{would give her}} to thy care <b>in</b> England When <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Normandy or Anjou.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So this is {{what you}} do when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the fields! Ah! it is no wonder if the farm is ruined. Are you not ashamed, girl, to behave so?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Zaman [...] "experienced mass {{attack on}} Twitter" [...] for her {{reporting}} on the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015. Zaman stated: [...] "It's like a public lynching. It has made me frightened for my physical safety when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the streets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{a splendid}} sea-boat," [...] Godfrey said. [...] "If it wasn't {{for the boat}} in tow I should not mind what weather <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Bean {{got me to}} {{come back}} to see to things. Else <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> New Romney, where my Uncle and Aunt live. But it's a Lark coming back. In a way...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Once when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the Soudan I {{went over}} some ground {{that we had}} been {{fighting}} on for three days. There were twelve hundred dead; and we hadn't time to bury them.' ...|$|E
60|$|Upon this I retreated, {{saying that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the ship as a sailor.|$|R
6000|$|... "Foolish!" [...] muttered Grandfather Frog. [...] "Foolish, {{foolish to}} be so afraid! Now, I'm not afraid until I see {{something}} to be afraid of. Time enough then. What's the good of looking for trouble all the time? Now, here <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the Great World, and I'm not afraid. And here's Danny Meadow Mouse, who has lived here all his life, acting as if he expected something dreadful to happen any minute. Pooh! How very, very foolish!" ...|$|R
60|$|WANDA. [Sighing] I did {{not think}} they did, sir. It <b>is</b> so long <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the town; not since I had Larry.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I couldn't, sir. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the evening. Perhaps Annie {{could tell}} you, though she's a {{careless}} girl. Never cleared the coffee-cups away last night. That's {{what happens when}} I'm not here to look after things." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the village, after breakfast, on a {{domestic}} errand {{connected with the}} necessary culinary preparations for the reception of Herr Grosse--when I heard my name pronounced behind me, and, turning round, found myself {{face to face with}} Nugent.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} I washed in the ice-cold water, {{and was glad}} to set out. An icy mist was over the noisy stream, {{there were a few}} meagre, {{shredded}} pine-trees. I had breakfast and paid my bill: it was seven francs--more than I could afford; but that did not matter, once <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sense <b>I</b> <b>was</b> seven. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bound <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Michigan state until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> woman-grown. Then <b>I</b> married, and I reckon {{the work}} got harder and harder." ...|$|R
6000|$|The child nodded. [...] "I {{should like}} to see Tom Roberts and nurse, but I don't want to go away. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the barge soon." ...|$|R
50|$|When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> walking <b>in</b> {{the street}} with Fang I saw everything, felt everything. He had a great instinct. He {{taught me how to}} look, because he never missed a thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> British East Africa," [...] said Miss Hubbard, [...] "I had a {{bird that}} was the living image of Bream Mortimer. I taught him to whistle 'Annie Laurie' and to ask for his supper in three native dialects. Eventually he died of the pip, poor fellow. Well, if it isn't Bream Mortimer, who is it?" ...|$|E
60|$|I huddled on my {{cloak and}} hood, and had {{my hand on}} the bar of the back door, when a piteous mew from the bedroom {{reminded}} me of the existence of poor Pussy. I ran in, and huddled the creature up in my apron. Before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the passage again, the first shock from the beam fell on the door.|$|E
60|$|But the Florida war gave us {{the most}} occupation. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> all sorts of ways, on expeditions, and can say I never saw an Indian, except those who came to give {{themselves}} up. I was in steamboats, cutters, launches, and on shore, marching like a soldier, with a gun on my shoulder, and precious duty {{it was for a}} sailor.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir; I'm a good Church-of-England woman, very Low," [...] she answered. [...] "But I thought <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> {{safer in}} here than outside. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> never <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the evening before, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's true," [...] he said, [...] "I didn't {{finish in}} the first ten in the Open, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> knocked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the semi-final of the Amateur, but I won the French Open last year." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too well! Too well! They {{made even}} ME forget my pride, and, by the Broken Lock that freed me, I went singing through the Jungle as though <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> wooing <b>in</b> the spring! Didst thou not hear us?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> my canoe alone {{looking for}} a loon's nest, one midsummer day, when the fresh trail of a bull caribou drew me to shore. The trail led {{straight}} from the water to a broad alder belt, beyond which, on the hillside, I might find the big brute loafing his time away till evening should come, and watch him {{to see what he}} would do with himself.|$|E
60|$|The {{morning of}} my {{greatest}} day with sailfish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf Stream, seven miles offshore, {{before the other}} fishermen {{had gotten out of}} bed. We saw the sun rise ruddy and bright out of the eastern sea, and we saw sailfish leap as if to welcome the rising of the lord of day. A dark, glancing ripple wavered over the water; there was just enough swell to make seeing fish easy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} they call me Spud," [...] he said to Dick, [...] "excepting because I like {{potatoes}} so. I'd rather eat them than any other vegetable. Why, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Jersey one summer, on a farm, I ate potatoes morning, noon and night and sometimes between times. The farmer said I had better look out or I'd sprout. I guess I ate about 'steen bushels in three weeks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mesdames," [...] <b>I</b> said, and <b>was</b> gratified to {{see that}} they {{followed}} my dramatic exit with eyes of appreciation and of wonder. The proprietor himself offered me my hat, and a moment or two later M. de Firmin-Latour and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> together <b>in</b> the Rue Lepic.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{could stand}} it, uncle, for <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> wherries in some {{precious}} rough seas at Spithead; but I {{think it would}} be best for the chief to take my place this time, and then I shall see how I feel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No more did I, Arthur," [...] Jack agreed. [...] "I {{feel just}} as I have done when <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the bawley {{and a big}} thunder-storm has burst overhead. If it feels like this here, what must it be on board a ship?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{window of}} my room looked to the east. I drew up the blind, and saw the sun rising grandly in a clear sky. The temptation {{to go out and}} breathe the fresh morning air was irresistible. I put on my hat and shawl, and took the Report of the Trial under my arm. The bolts of the back door were easily drawn. In another minute <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Benjamin's pretty little garden.|$|E
6000|$|Milt sat {{farthest}} from the fire, by the dining-table. He was agonizing, [...] "This Jeff person {{is the real}} thing. He's no Percy in riding-breeches. He's used to society and nastiness. If {{he looks at me}} once more--young garage man found froze stiff, near Flathead Lake, scared look in eyes, believed to have met a grizzly, no signs of vi'lence. And I thought I could learn to mingle with Claire's own crowd! I wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the bug. I wonder if I can't escape?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{saw nothing}} {{of him at}} all. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> South Africa. I have only just got back. Not but that I'd been here long ago," [...] the young man added, with a note of {{exasperation}} in his tone, [...] "if I'd had any idea of the luck he was in. Why, I lent him a bit to come back with, though I was only earning thirty bob a week, and the brute only sent it me back in bits, and not a farthing over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> caught <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a gale {{the other}} night," [...] {{returned}} the Dragon, rubbing {{the back of}} its ear with its left front paw, as it paused {{and looked at the}} king, [...] "and the wind put out my fire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>out,</b> over there, <b>in</b> the Nor'-West," [...] began Mat, nodding {{towards the}} {{particular}} {{point of the}} compass that he mentioned.|$|R
6000|$|Leland's {{smile was}} not exactly reassuring. [...] "I don't want to trouble you too often. Besides, <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the frost since early morning, and feel a little tired and drowsy. One {{naturally}} doesn't care to appear to any more disadvantage than is necessary." ...|$|R
