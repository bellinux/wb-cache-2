5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

Burbank initially asked her to wait until he retrieved it from his field, but when she persisted, his wife gave her some. Later, {{when he went to}} get some more corn out of the field, his oxen refused to move, which he attributed to Margaret's bewitching of them.

40|$|We use a {{panel of}} {{thousands}} of good-level prices {{before and after the}} euro in order to compare the determinants and understand the evolution of goods price dispersion across Europe during these two periods. We find that tradeability and non-traded inputs play a significantly smaller role for cross-country price dispersion after the adoption of the euro, and for Eurozone (EZ) economies as compared to the broader group of European Union (EU) economies. We then compare the overall and country-level distributions of law-of-one-price (LOP) deviations at the early and late part of our sample to inform us about the degree of integration across European economies before and after the euro. Our tests reveal that the distributions after the euro are typically significantly different than those before, consistent with a greater degree of integration. Utilizing our panel to trace the location of individual goods in the distribution of LOP deviations, we ask how the price advantage or disadvantage evident in these price distributions evolves over time, and whether goods characteristics play a role for the persistence of these LOP deviations.

500|$|The new {{magazine}} was titled Venture Science Fiction, {{and the first}} issue was dated January 1957. Mills was managing editor of F throughout Ventures first run; he became editor of F shortly after Venture ceased publishing in July 1958. The editorial philosophy was laid out by Ferman in the inaugural issue: [...] "strong stories of action and adventure... There will be two prime requisites for Venture stories: In the first place, each must be a well-told story, with a beginning, middle and end; in the second place, each must be a strong story—a story with pace, power and excitement." [...] Ferman hoped {{to take advantage of}} a gap in the science fiction magazine market opened up by the demise of Planet Stories, one of the last sf pulps, which had ceased publication in late 1955. [...] Planet Stories had focused on adventure stories, as opposed to the realistic style becoming more popular in science fiction in the 1950s, and Ferman hoped to combine the virtues of the melodramatic pulp fiction style with the literary values that were key to Fs success. [...] Ventures bias towards action-oriented adventure led to stories with relatively more sex and violence than those in competing magazines, and sf historian Mike Ashley has commented that it was perhaps <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> ahead of its time.

60|$|One {{thing is}} certain. The leper in the Settlement {{is far better}} off than the leper who lies in hiding outside. Such a leper is a lonely outcast, living in {{constant}} fear of discovery and slowly and surely rotting away. The action of leprosy is not steady. It lays hold of its victim, commits a ravage, and then lies dormant for an indeterminate period. It may not commit another ravage for <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years,</b> <b>or</b> forty years, and the patient may enjoy uninterrupted good health. Rarely, however, do these first ravages cease of themselves. The skilled surgeon is required, and the skilled surgeon cannot be called in for the leper who is in hiding. For instance, the first ravage may {{take the form of}} a perforating ulcer in the sole of the foot. When the bone is reached, necrosis sets in. If the leper is in hiding, he cannot be operated upon, the necrosis will continue to eat its way up the bone of the leg, and in a brief and horrible time that leper will die of gangrene or some other terrible complication. On the other hand, if that same leper is in Molokai, the surgeon will operate upon the foot, remove the ulcer, cleanse the bone, and put a complete stop to that particular ravage of the disease. A month after the operation the leper will be out riding horseback, running foot races, swimming in the breakers, or climbing the giddy sides of the valleys for mountain apples. And as has been stated before, the disease, lying dormant, may not again attack him for <b>five,</b> <b>ten,</b> <b>or</b> forty <b>years.</b>|$|R

40|$|Sugar maple (Acer {{saccharum}} Marsh.) {{has experienced}} diebacks {{in many parts}} of its range; these declines have caused researchers to consider the many connected factors governing tree health. Altered availability of base cations due to acidic deposition and climatic extremes (drought, late winter freeze-thaw cycles) have been identified as two main causal stressors. To predict the role of climate on Ca nutrition, I investigated the relationship between the climatic factors of temperature, precipitation, water availability and windstorm on temporal changes to depth of Ca source of sugar maple. I hypothesized that the Ca uptake depth would be deeper after windstorms, or under dry or cold conditions, and shallower under warm or wet conditions. The ratio of Ca/Sr can be used to track the source of Ca. Calibration of the relationship between soil and plant Ca/Sr was done by analyzing Ca/Sr ratios in soil extracts of various strengths (H 2 O, NH 4 Cl, and ammonium EDTA) and in seedlings of sugar maple grown from natural regeneration on 37 differing sites. The relationships between soil extract Ca/Sr ratios and leaf and stem Ca/Sr ratios were linear, and the slopes of these relationships were different. These findings support the use of Ca/Sr as a tracer to Ca and they highlight the need to calibrate the technique for the plant tissue and the soil extractant used. This technique was then applied to study Ca uptake depth and its relationship with climate in the Hermine watershed, a sugar maple dominated forest in southern Quebec. The Ca/Sr was measured in soil, incremental cores of wood, and leaves. The ratio of Ca/Sr from nine soil profiles decreased with soil depth (r 2 = 0. 320, p< 0. 05), providing a signature for depth. Wood cores from ten trees were analysed in <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> increments from 1940 to 1999 to provide a long-term trend of Ca nutrition. Sugar maple leaves from 1995 - 2005 from the same 25 trees were analyzed to determine the annual dynamics of Ca uptake depth and its relationship with climate. Results suggest that the majority of tree Ca is taken from the lowest part of the rooting zone, regardless of the climatic conditions that occurred during this study, although the minor variations were related to the April temperature (r 2 = 0. 208, p = 0. 023) and the June, July and August combined total precipitation (r 2 = 0. 581, p = 0. 006). The effect of the windstorm on Ca uptake depth was only apparent {{in the area of the}} forest most visibly affected; Ca uptake was deeper...|$|R

6000|$|He hurried {{downstairs and}} left poor Maggie to that bitter {{sense of the}} {{irrevocable}} which was almost an every-day experience of her small soul. She could see clearly enough, now the thing was done, {{that it was very}} foolish, and that she should have to hear and think more about her hair than ever; for Maggie rushed to her deeds with passionate impulse, and then saw not only their consequences, but {{what would have happened if}} they had not been done, with all the detail and exaggerated circumstance of an active imagination. Tom never did the same sort of foolish things as Maggie, having a wonderful instinctive discernment of what would turn to his advantage or disadvantage; and so it happened, that though he was much more wilful and inflexible than Maggie, his mother hardly ever called him naughty. But if Tom did make a mistake of that sort, he espoused it, and stood by it: he [...] "didn't mind." [...] If he broke the lash of his father's gigwhip by lashing the gate, he couldn't help it,--the whip shouldn't have got caught in the hinge. If Tom Tulliver whipped a gate, he was convinced, not that the whipping of gates by all boys was a justifiable act, but that he, Tom Tulliver, was justifiable in whipping that particular gate, and he wasn't going to be sorry. But Maggie, as she stood crying before the glass, felt it impossible that she should go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes and severe words of her aunts, while Tom and Lucy, and Martha, who waited at table, and perhaps her father and her uncles, would laugh at her; for if Tom had laughed at her, of course every one else would; and if she had only let her hair alone, she could have sat with Tom and Lucy, and had the apricot pudding and the custard! What could she do but sob? She sat as helpless and despairing among her black locks as Ajax among the slaughtered sheep. Very trivial, perhaps, this anguish seems to weather-worn mortals who have to think of Christmas bills, dead loves, and broken friendships; but it was not less bitter to Maggie--perhaps it was even more bitter--than what we are fond of calling antithetically the real troubles of mature life. [...] "Ah, my child, you will have real troubles to fret about by and by," [...] is the consolation we have almost all of us had administered to us in our childhood, and have repeated to other children since we have been grown up. We have all of us sobbed so piteously, standing with tiny bare legs above our little socks, when we lost sight of our mother or nurse in some strange place; but we can no longer recall the poignancy of that moment and weep over it, as we do over the remembered sufferings of <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> ago. Every one of those keen moments has left its trace, and lives in us still, but such traces have blent themselves irrecoverably with the firmer texture of our youth and manhood; and so it comes that we can look on at the troubles of our children with a smiling disbelief in the reality of their pain. Is there any one who can recover the experience of his childhood, not merely with a memory of what he did and what happened to him, of what he liked and disliked when he was in frock and trousers, but with an intimate penetration, a revived consciousness of what he felt then, when it was so long from one Midsummer to another; what he felt when his school fellows shut him out of their game because he would pitch the ball wrong out of mere wilfulness; or on a rainy day in the holidays, when he didn't know how to amuse himself, and fell from idleness into mischief, from mischief into defiance, and from defiance into sulkiness; or when his mother absolutely refused to let him have a tailed coat that [...] "half," [...] although every other boy of his age had gone into tails already? Surely if we could recall that early bitterness, and the dim guesses, the strangely perspectiveless conception of life, that gave the bitterness its intensity, we should not pooh-pooh the griefs of our children.|$|E

Fischerに依るリグニン説，Bergius及びWheelerに依るセルローズ説，Marcussonに依るオキシセルローズ説等，であるが未だに論争が続けられ，本邦でも終戦後石炭化学の研究が盛んとなり，特に舟阪氏 5 等の石炭の成因，粘結性に関する秀れた研究がある。筆者等は世界的に稀な魚津埋没林を対照として石炭化行程に関する研究を行い日化第六年会に第一報を発表した。植物より石炭を生成する石炭化作用は岡氏に依ると，（イ）空気中での腐敗作用即ち生化学的作用，（ロ）水中での泥炭化作用，（ハ）地中での加圧乾溜作用に分けられる。それは植物がパクテリヤ，好気性菌，嫌気性菌等の生化学的腐敗作用に依り先ず泥炭を生成し，之が地殻の変動等の為，地下に埋没し地圧及び地熱に依り順次亜炭褐炭瀝青炭無煙炭等を得るのであるが此の石炭化初期に生成するフミン質はセルローズ，リグニン何れを根源とするかは永く論争せられている。魚津埋没林は昭和 6 年漁港修築当時間港より発掘され日本最初のもので其後富山湾岸では東方に吉原，横山海底林が見出され，西方には打出ヶ浜海底林が見出された。本埋没林の成因に就いては石井，脇水両氏等の陥没説等があるが之に依ると原始林が海中に埋没した経路は緩慢な土地沈降作用のみでなく，その沈降の或る時期に突然急激な地変に依って一挙に海中に埋没したと考えられる。徐々に海中に没したとすれば片端から腐朽し，且つ波に食われて自然に消滅して行く筈であるから，樹根及び倒木が突然の地殻の変動に依って埋没され叉土砂に蔽われて空気と絶縁され今日に到ったものであろう。此の突然の陥没が何年前に起ったかは約 5000 年乃至 10000 年位とされている。叉発掘当時は地表より 60 ～ 110 cm位下部に多くの樹根が群を成して埋没し，その中最大のものは径 4 m，周囲が 12 m位で樹齢は 2000 年のものもあるが大部分は 400 ～ 500 年位である。叉樹根と共に巨大な倒木の樹幹もある。樹種に就いては 80...|$|R

However, the Internet is changing rapidly, continuously and substantially. The Internet of today is radically different to the Internet of <b>five,</b> <b>ten</b> <b>or</b> twenty <b>years</b> ago. Indeed, today, it is getting difficult to view the Internet as borderless. So-called geo-location technologies – technologies making it possible for Internet actors to identify the geographical location of those they come into contact with – challenge the Internet‘s borderless nature. Drawing upon examples taken from the interaction between the law and geo-location technologies, this paper examines the challenges associated with the regulation of rapidly developing technologies. More specifically, focus is placed on such challenges in the context of Internet regulation...|$|R
