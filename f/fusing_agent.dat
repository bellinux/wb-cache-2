40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Context Aware Agent based Military Sensor Network (CAMSN) {{to form an}} {{improved}} infrastructure for multi-sensor image fusion. It considers contexts driven by a node and sink. The contexts such as general and critical object detection are node driven where as sensing time (such as day or night) is sink driven. The agencies used in the scheme are categorized as node and sink agency. Each agency employs a set of static and mobile agents to perform dedicated tasks. Node agency performs context sensing and context interpretation based on the sensed image and sensing time. Node agency comprises of node manager agent, context agent and node blackboard (NBB). Context agent gathers the context from the target and updates the NBB, Node manager agent interprets the context and passes the context information to sink node by using flooding mechanism. Sink agency mainly comprises of sink manager agent, <b>fusing</b> <b>agent,</b> and sink black board. A context at the sensor node triggers the fusion process at the sink. Based on the context, sink manager agent triggers the <b>fusing</b> <b>agent.</b> <b>Fusing</b> <b>agent</b> roams around the network, visits active sensor node, fuses the relevant images and sends the fused image to sink. The <b>fusing</b> <b>agent</b> uses wavelet transform for fusion. The scheme is simulated for testing its operation effectiveness in terms of fusion time, mean square error, throughput, dropping rate, bandwidth requirement, node battery usage and agent overhead...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} of DNA sequences integrated {{from a new}} flavivirus related to Cell <b>Fusing</b> <b>Agent</b> and Kamiti River Virus was identified in wild Aedes albopictus mosquito populations from the provinces of Trentino and Padova, Northern Italy. Field work was developed during August–October 2007 with BG-traps, and mosquitoes were screened for flavivirus and alphavirus. No alphavirus was detected, indicating that Chikungunya virus is not present in these mosquitoes in Trentino and Padova area. However, 21 % of the pools were positive for flavivirus, further recognised with BLAST as similar to Kamiti River Virus. Phylogenetical analysis with 708 nucleotides from the NS 5 gene identified this virus as a new member of the insect flavivirus clade, together with others like Kamiti River Virus, Cell <b>Fusing</b> <b>Agent</b> or Culex flavivirus, and {{in the group of}} those transmitted by Aedes. Furthermore, the treatment with RNAse, indicated that this flavivirus should be integrated in the genome of Ae. albopictus. These results propose that these sequences are transmitted by both sexes, and with different prevalence in the studied populations, and support the idea of a widespread distribution of integrated genomes in several mosquitoes from different areas, as first demonstrated with Cell Silent Agent.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a multi-agent system, GraniteNights, modelled on the Agentcities project “evening agent ” scenario.

The application <b>fuses</b> <b>agent</b> and Web technology, being viewed as an agent-based Web service. In particular, Semantic Web standards are used to a great extent in delivering the service. The paper argues that, in fact, the Semantic Web standards are more important for this type of application than the agent standards. A key feature of the application is component re-use: GraniteNights attempts to reuse without modification existing ontologies wherever possible; it also is comprised of a number of generic and thus wholly-reusable agents, including a user profiling agent and a constraint-based scheduler. The system is open in the sense that most of the individual agents can be invoked directly by external agent platforms, without going through the Web interface. ...|$|R

Herein we review all ‘insect-specific’ flavivirus sequences currently available and conduct phylogenetic analyses of both the ‘insect-specific’ flaviviruses and available sequences of the entire genus Flavivirus. We show that there is no statistical support for virus–mosquito co-divergence, suggesting that the ‘insect-specific’ flaviviruses may have undergone multiple introductions with frequent host switching. We discuss potential implications for the evolution of vectoring within the family Flaviviridae. We also provide preliminary evidence for potential recombination events in the history of cell <b>fusing</b> <b>agent</b> virus. Finally, we consider priorities and guidelines for future research on ‘insect-specific’ flaviviruses, including the vast potential that exists for the study of biodiversity within a range of potential hosts and vectors, and its effect on the emergence and maintenance of the flaviviruses. ...|$|E
40|$|The genus Flavivirus, which {{contains}} approximately 70 single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, represents a unique model {{for studying the}} evolution of vector-borne disease, as it includes viruses that are mosquito-borne, tick-borne or have no known vector. Both theoretical work and field studies suggest {{the existence of a}} large number of undiscovered flaviviruses. Recently, the first isolation of cell <b>fusing</b> <b>agent</b> virus (CFAV) was reported from a natural mosquito population in Puerto Rico, and sequences related to CFAV have been discovered in mosquitoes from Thailand. CFAV had previously been isolated from a mosquito cell line in 1975 and represented the only known ‘insect-only’ flavivirus, appearing to replicate in insect cells alone. A second member of the ‘insect-only’ group, Kamiti River virus (KRV), was isolated from Kenyan mosquitoes in 2003. A third tentative member of the ‘insect-only’ group, Culex flavivirus (CxFV), was first isolated in 2007 from Japan and further strains have subsequently been reported from the Americas. We report the discovery, isolation and characterization of two novel ‘insect-only’ flaviviruses from Entebbe, Uganda: a novel lineage tentatively designated Nakiwogo virus (NAKV) and a new strain of CxFV. The individual mosquitoes from which these strains were isolated, identified retrospectively by using a reference molecular phylogeny generated using voucher specimens from the region, were Mansonia africana nigerrima and Culex quinquefasciatus, respectively. This represents the first isolation, to our knowledge, of a novel insect-only flavivirus from a Mansonia species and the first isolation of a strain of CxFV from Africa.

40|$|Previously, it {{was shown}} that the 3 ' untranslated region (3 'UTR) of Kamiti River virus (KRV) is nearly {{twice as long as}} the 3 'UTR of other flaviviruses (1208 {{nucleotides}} compared with 730 nucleotides for the longest 3 'UTR of any virus in the Tick-borne encephalitis virus species). Additionally, KRV and the closely related Cell <b>fusing</b> <b>agent</b> virus (CFAV) were shown to contain two short, almost perfect repeat sequences of 67 nucleotides. However, the construction of a robust comparative nucleotide alignment has now revealed that the double-length 3 'UTR and the direct repeats resulted from the virtually complete duplication of a primordial KRV 3 'UTR. We also propose that the CFAV 3 'UTR was derived from a KRV-like precursor sequence with a large deletion that nevertheless preserved the two direct repeat sequences. These data provide new insights into the evolution of the flavivirus 3 'UTR. ...|$|E

Comparison of the phylogeny and mutational regime of the E gene with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS 5) gene shows the validity of the E gene as a phylogenetic marker and suggests that the mosquito-borne flaviviruses are evolving twice as fast as the tick-borne flaviviruses.

40|$|The genus Flavivirus {{contains}} more than 70 single-stranded, positive-sense arthropod-borne RNA viruses. Some flaviviruses are particularly medically important to humans and other vertebrates including dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus.

Mosquitoes are also infected by insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) that {{do not appear to}} be infective to vertebrates.

Interestingly, we found that CFAV infection significantly enhanced replication of DENV, and vice versa, DENV infection significantly enhanced replication of CFAV in mosquito cells. We have shown that CFAV infection leads to increase in the expression of ribonuclease kappa (RNASEK), which is known to promote infection of viruses that rely on endocytosis and pH-dependent entry. Knockdown of RNASEK by dsRNA resulted in reduced DENV replication.

Characterization of the CxFV showed that all strains {{are related to the}} cell <b>fusing</b> <b>agent</b> virus. In this manuscript we report the first identification of CxFV in South America. Material and Methods: We have collected Culex sp. mosquitoes using BG-Sentinel traps and manual aspirators. They were pooled according to genus, species, sex and location. Viral RNA was extracted and multiplex nested PCR was performed to test the presence of Flavivirus. The positive samples were isolated in C 6 / 36 cells and sequenced for phylogenetic analyses. Results: 265 female Culex mosquitoes pooled in 83 pools were tested with specific CxFV, Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) primers. Our sequence data indicated maximum sequence similarity of 97 % with CxFV. Discussion: In this study we report the circulation of CxFV in an urban setting where SLEV had previously caused an outbreak. In terms of public health, this is an important finding due to the assumption that the previous exposition of mosquitoes to CxFV might lessen the susceptibility of these mosquitoes to other flaviviruses.

The study also sought to determine the rates of infection and, subsequently, vertical transmission as a possible means of its maintenance and propagation in nature, given that it neither grows in vertebrate cells or mice. The mosquitoes were infected by the virus either as larvae or adults. Virus assay was done by re-isolation in tissue culture and indirect immunofluoresce assay methods. KRV infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, with the observed rates as high as 74 to 96 %. The virus was also transmitted vertically in these mosquitoes. Vertical transmission rates of 3. 90 % were observed for the 2 nd and 3 rd ovarian cycles combined. These results suggest that Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are likely to be infected with KRV in nature, and that vertical transmission is the natural means by which it is maintained and propagated in this host, and possibly others...|$|E
40|$|Hen {{erythrocytes}} {{that were}} fixed after treatment with lysolecithin {{in aqueous solution}} for 30 s at 37 °C showed evidence of bridge formation between adjacent lysed cells. Generally, the homokaryons that were produced using lysolecithin in this way contained large numbers of nuclei. These giant syncytia had damaged nuclear membranes and unstable plasma mem-branes; complete disintegration of the syncytia occurred within 1 min of adding lysolecithin to the erythrocytes. In order to localize the action of lysolecithin, the <b>fusing</b> <b>agent</b> was incorporated into micro-droplets of lipid. Cell fusion following the addition of lysolecithin in an aqueous glyceride-lecithin emulsion was slower than with lysolecithin in aqueous solution, taking 10 - 30 min, and it was accompanied by considerably less damage to the plasma and nuclear membranes. The fused erythrocytes, which usually contained {{only two or three}} nuclei, lysed slowly during the 45 min following fusion, and lysis could be arrested by cooling the fused cells. The plasma membranes of lysed, multinucleated cells remained intact at 37 °C for at least 90 h. Mouse fibroblast-hen erythrocyte heterokaryons formed with the aid of the emulsion were more stable than those produced with lysolecithin in solution, but the hybrid cells nevertheless had damaged subcellular organelles. Viable clones of hybrid mouse-hamster fibroblast cells were obtained using the emulsion although, possibly owing to reduced viability of the lysole-cithin-treated cells, only at twice the frequency of spontaneously produced hybrids...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} {{increase in the number of}} insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) discovered in the last decade. Historically, these viruses have generated limited interest due to their inability to infect vertebrate cells. This viewpoint has changed in recent years because some ISFs have been shown to enhance or suppress the replication of medically important flaviviruses in co-infected mosquito cells. Additionally, comparative studies between ISFs and medically important flaviviruses can provide a unique perspective as to why some flaviviruses possess the ability to infect and cause devastating disease in humans while others do not. ISFs have been isolated exclusively from mosquitoes in nature but the detection of ISF-like sequences in sandflies and chironomids indicates that they may also infect other dipterans. ISFs can be divided into two distinct phylogenetic groups. The first group currently consists of approximately 12 viruses and includes cell <b>fusing</b> <b>agent</b> virus, Kamiti River virus and Culex flavivirus. These viruses are phylogenetically distinct from all other known flaviviruses. The second group, which is apparently not monophyletic, currently consists of nine viruses and includes Chaoyang virus, Nounané virus and Lammi virus. These viruses phylogenetically affiliate with mosquito/vertebrate flaviviruses despite their apparent insect-restricted phenotype. This article provides a review of the discovery, host range, mode of transmission, superinfection exclusion ability and genomic organization of ISFs. This article also attempts to clarify the ISF nomenclature because some of these viruses have been assigned more than one name due to their simultaneous discoveries by independent research groups...|$|E
40|$|Although Roman and post-Empire glasses {{found in}} Europe are reputed {{to have a}} very {{constant}} composition and hence source of components, it appears that some 4 – 5 th century and later specimens show evidence of a different source of silica (sand) component. Zirconium and titanium are the discriminating elements. Data presented here for 278 specimens from 1 st to 4 th century German and Belgian samples indicate a strongly homogeneous Zr and Ti content; N: number of analyzed samples while 62 samples from Maastricht show low Zr–Ti contents from 1 st to 3 rd century samples while 4 – 5 th century samples show a strong trend of concomitant Ti and Zr increase. If the high values of Zr–Ti represent a new source of silica (sand) the trend from low to high content suggests that a significant amount of low Zr–Ti glass was recycled to form these glass objects. Similar high Ti content can be seen in analysis results reported for other but not all 4 – 5 th century samples found in northern Europe while earlier productions show typical low Ti contents. Although the <b>fusing</b> <b>agent</b> for these glasses seems to have always been natron (a mineral deposit in the Nile delta) from Hellenistic times to the 9 th century, a change in the silica source, indicated by variation of the Ti and Zr content, could very well reflect the results of political instability of the 4 – 5 th century exemplified by the fragmentation of the Roman Empire into two parts...|$|E
