40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a Light Emitting Diode (LED) System (BriteWhite) on tooth bleaching. Method: eeth 11 and 21 of twenty one subjects were treated in the chair with a LED light and 44 % carbamide peroxide gel, followed by an at-home treatment period of 14 days with 35 % carbamide peroxide. The color of the teeth was measured with a spectrophotometer (L*; a*; b*) before treatment (control) and after the above mentioned two stages. The subjects were also instructed to note tooth and <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Results: For the L * component a statis-tically significant difference (p 0. 05) found throughout the study (Wilcox on Signed Rank Sum Test). A major color change of 1. 8 units (Eab) was found after the LED treatment stage with only a further small 0. 2 unit improvement after the 14 day at-home treatment stage. Tooth and <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity</b> scores were low (below mild) throughout the treatment stages. Conclusion: A major tooth color increase was found after the in-office LED/gel treatment stage and only an insignificant further improvement was noted after the additional 14 day at-home treatment period. Only low tooth and <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity</b> scores were found. A slight increase in both the sensitivity and gingival scores after the LED/gel activated stage could be observed. Overall the total color increase was low...|$|E
40|$|Tooth {{bleaching}} {{has become}} a popular treatment for esthetic improvement in dentistry. There are several 10 % carbamide peroxide bleaching agents that are available in Indonesia which contained potassium nitrate-fluoride or without potassium nitrate-fluoride. However, there was no clinical report about these products in Indonesia. This {{study was conducted to}} compare the effectiveness of two bleaching and sensitivity of tooth and gingiva. Sixty-four participants were divided into 2 groups. The first group was treated with bleaching agent that contained potassium nitrate-fluoride (Opalescence PF, Ultradent). Bleaching treatment was done for 6 - 8 hours per night over a 2 week-period. Evaluations were performed at the baseline and at 3, 7, 14 day afterwards. Color change was measured using a value-ordered Vita classic shade guide; tooth and <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity</b> were examine using Electric Pulp Tester, Gingival Index and patient log. The results showed that there were no statistical differences in degree of color change between the two products. The mean color change after 2 weeks was 7 - 8 tabs lighter than baseline. Also there was no statistical difference in tooth and <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity</b> between the products. It can be concluded that 10 % carbamide peroxide containing potassium nitrate-fluoride has the same effectiveness compared to other agent without potassium nitrate-fluoride for tooth color change and tooth and <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity...</b>|$|E
30|$|The OHRQoL was {{assessed}} using the French validated GOHAI version (Tubert-Jeannin et al. 2003). GOHAI comprises 12 items grouped into three fields: (1) the functional field (eating, speaking, swallowing); (2) the psychosocial field (concerns, relational discomfort, appearance); (3) the pain or discomfort field (drugs, <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> discomfort when chewing certain foods). The cumulative method (GOHAI-Add) {{was used in this}} study and it consists in summing the scores obtained for each of the 12 GOHAI questions. Each question is scored from 1 to 5. In this study however, subjects in need of bi-maxillary complete RD rehabilitation (with or without prosthetic experience) did not reply to the item relating to dental sensitivity to heat and cold because they were edentulous. The maximum score of 5 was therefore attributed to each subject for this item. The maximum score was 60 (20  = functional field; 25  = psychosocial field; 15  = pain or discomfort field). According to Atchison and Dolan (1990), a score of 57 – 60 is regarded as high and corresponds to a satisfactory OHRQoL. A score from 51 to 56 is regarded as average, and a score of 50 or less is regarded as a low score, reflecting a poor OHRQoL.|$|E

40|$|Gingival {{recession}} in anterior teeth {{is a common}} concern due to esthetic reasons or root <b>sensitivity.</b> <b>Gingival</b> recession, especially in multiple anterior teeth, is of huge concern due to esthetic reasons. Various mucogingival surgeries are available for root coverage. This case report presents a new bridge flap technique, which allows the dentist not only to cover the previously denuded root surfaces but also to increase the zone of attached gingiva at a single step. In this case, a coronally advanced flap along with vestibular deepening technique was used as root coverage procedure {{for the treatment of}} multiple recession-type defect. Here, vestibular deepening technique is used to increase the width of the attached gingiva. The predictability of this procedure results in an esthetically healthy periodontium, along with gain in keratinized tissue and good patient′s acceptance...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To use a randomized, blinded, {{crossover}} design {{to evaluate the}} possible heterotopic effects of experimental periodontal ligament pain on adjacent <b>gingival</b> somatosensory <b>sensitivity.</b> Methods: A total of 12 healthy volunteers (8 female, 4 male; mean age standard error in means (SEM) : 28 1 years) participated in two randomized experimental quantitative sensory testing (QST) sessions, one in which capsaicin (experimental) was injected into the periodontal ligament and one in which isotonic saline (control) was injected. A total of 13 standardized QST measures were obtained on the buccal attached gingiva of a maxillary central incisor before, immediately after, and 30 minutes after injection of 30 mu L of 5 % capsaicin or isotonic saline into the periodontal ligament of the same incisor. The injection-evoked pain was evaluated on a 0 - 10 numeric rating scale (NRS). QST data were analyzed with two-way repeated measurement analysis of variance. Results: Capsaicin injected into the periodontal ligament evoked moderate levels of pain (mean peak NRS SEM: capsaicin: 5. 5. 7; control: 0. 6 0. 5 [P. 050). Conclusion: Capsaicin injected into the periodontal ligament caused gain of heterotopic somatosensory sensitivity toward warmth and painful heat stimuli as well as reduction in mechanical sensitivity of the gingiva adjacent to the injected tooth. These findings may have implications for interpretation of somatosensory functions in patients with chronic intraoral pain, where gingival somatosensory profiles similar to those detected after capsaicin injection {{in the present study}} may be interpreted as signs of nerve damage...|$|R
40|$|When used twice daily, Ranir Whitening Wraps {{were more}} {{effective}} in lightening teeth than Crest Whitestrips Premium when also used twice a day. SUMMARY This study evaluated the degree of color change of teeth and the sensitivities of teeth and gums in an in vivo study. Ranir Whitening Wraps (WW 2) and Crest Whitestrips Premium (WP 2) were used twice a day and Ranir Whitening Wraps (WW 1) were used once a day. Color evaluations occurred at baseline, after five and seven-day use of bleaching agent and 14 days post-bleaching. Color change was evaluated objectively and sub-jectively. Sensitivity evaluations were also accom-plished. Seventy-six of the 78 subjects enrolled completed the study. All three products signifi-cantly lightened teeth. WW 2 lightened more than WP 2 and WW 1 in L*, a*, b*, E and shade guide value. WP 2 lightened more than WW 1 in a*, b*, E and shade guide value. There {{was no difference in}} tooth sensitivity, but WW 1 and WP 2 caused less <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity</b> than WW 2. The mean age of smokers was seven years younger than non-smokers who qualified...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of painful tooth stimulation on gingival somatosensory sensitivity of healthy volunteers in a randomized, controlled design. Thirteen healthy volunteers (six women, seven men; 28. 4 ± 5. 0 years) were included for two experimental sessions of electrical tooth stimulation: painful tooth stimulation and tooth stimulation below the sensory threshold (control). Eight of the human subjects participated in a third session without tooth stimulation. In all sessions, the somatosensory sensitivity of the gingiva adjacent to the stimulated tooth was evaluated with a standardized battery of quantitative sensory tests (QST) before, immediately after and 30 min after tooth stimulation. Painful tooth stimulation evoked significant decreases in warmth and heat pain thresholds (P 0. 086). No QST changes were detected in the session without tooth stimulation (P > 0. 060). In conclusion, modest increased <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to warmth, painful heat and pressure stimuli as well as desensitization to non-painful mechanical stimulation were demonstrated after tooth stimulation. This suggests involvement of competing heterotopic facilitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, stimulation below the sensory threshold induced similar thermal sensitization suggesting the possibility of activation of axon-reflex-like mechanisms even at intensities below the perception threshold. These findings may have implications for interpretation of somatosensory results in patients with chronic intraoral pain...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary {{hyperplastic}} gingivitis (HHG) is {{a benign}} fibrous {{enlargement of the}} gingival tissue to dental encapsulation in ranched silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes). It is an autosonal recessive condition displaying male sex-biased penetrance HHG demonstrates a pleiotropic association with superior fur quality. In 2004, after {{the introduction of a}} Finnish fox line, HHG emerged in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. While the underlying HHG aetiology is unknown, an analogous condition called hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) occurs in humans, providing a platform for investigation into the molecular mechanisms of HHG. A mutation in the son of sevenless homolog 1 gene causes one form of HGF. Candidate gene sequencing of this and related genes including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), growth factor receptor bound protein 2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 did not uncover any putative coding sequence or splice-site mutations. HHG was also examined at the genomic level, integrating knowledge of the chromosomal loci associated with the analogous human condition, HGF. This exploration was divided into the known genetic causes of isolated HGF and HGF-associated sundromes characterized by both gingival and hair overgrowth. Global gene expression differences between affected adn unaffected foxes pinpoint SOS 2 and RASA 1 as candidate gene for HHG; overall, the genomic expression patterns strongly indicate the involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway. Specifically, the error could occur prior to the Rat sarcoma protein in this pathway. Future exploration of the pathway could elucidate the genetic basis of HHG and more broadly the molecular aetiology of gingival overgrowth in humans and canines. Additional information regarding the HHG phenotype was revealed, including the potential involvement of androgens in disease severity. The steroid- 5 -alpha-reductase, alpha polypeptide 2 gene was found to be up-regulated in the HHG-affected foxes, and the link between androgens and <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in dogs might help explain the perceived sex biased penetrance originally noted in HHG. Overall the molecular mechanisms underpinning the HHG phenotype and future work revolve around the MAPK signalling pathway including influences that other gene products like androgens have on it...|$|E
40|$|Objectives This {{analysis}} assessed, {{during and}} 1 year after pregnancy: a) {{the prevalence of}} and relationship between self-reported and clinically determined dental caries and oral health status, and whether self-reports are a potential proxy for professional determination; and b) factors associated {{with high levels of}} professionally determined or self-reported oral disease. Methods Data are from a randomized clinical trial of 301 pregnant, low-income Hispanic women at the California-Mexico border to compare two interventions to prevent early childhood caries. Interviews and dental examinations were conducted at enrollment (second trimester) and 1 -year postpartum (PP). Results During pregnancy and PP, 93 percent had untreated caries and most had <b>gingival</b> inflammation. <b>Sensitivity</b> and specificity of self-reported measures compared to dentists' determinations were modest (ranging from 45 - 80 percent for sensitivity and 41 - 77 percent for specificity at both time points); positive predictive values for women reporting current tooth decay or fair/poor oral health were high (> 94 percent), but negative predictive values were low (< 23 percent). In a bivariate GEE model, factors associated with fair/poor self-reported oral health during and after pregnancy included self-reported dental symptoms (current tooth decay, bleeding gums without brushing), dental behaviors (not flossing) and number of decayed tooth surfaces. In a logistic regression model, the only significant factor PP associated with less extensive untreated disease was if women ever had their teeth cleaned professionally (OR = 0. 44). Conclusions There is a great need for dental treatment in this underserved population both during pregnancy and PP. Women {{may not be able to}} accurately recognize or act on their treatment needs. At baseline and PP, few demographic or behavioral factors were associated with either self-reported or clinically determined oral disease (e. g., being less educated or acculturated and not flossing) in the bivariate analyses. Ever having a professional teeth cleaning significantly predicted less disease PP. © 2013 American Association of Public Health Dentistry...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the 2 -year clinical performance of a new bioactive dental cement (Ceramir C&B, formerly XeraCem) for permanent cementation. Materials and Methods: The cement used in this study is a new formulation class, a hybrid material comprising calcium aluminate and glass ionomer. Thirty-eight crowns and fixed partial denture (FPD) abutments were cemented in 17 patients. Thirty-one of the abutment teeth were vital, 7 nonvital. Six reconstructions were FPDs comprising 14 abutment teeth (12 vital/ 2 nonvital). A two-unit fixed splint was also included. Preparation parameters and cement characteristics (dispensing, working time, seating characteristics, ease of cement removal) were recorded. Baseline and postcementation data were recorded for marginal integrity, marginal discoloration, secondary caries, retention, and <b>gingival</b> inflammation. Tooth <b>sensitivity</b> was assessed at pre- and postcementation time points using categorical and visual analogue scale (VAS) assessment measures. Results: Mixing of the cement was reported as “easy. ” Clinical working time for this cement was deemed acceptable. Assessment of seating characteristics indicated all restorations were seated completely after cementation. Cement removal was determined to be “easy. ” Fifteen of 17 subjects were available for 1 -year recall examination; 13 patients were available for the 2 -year recall examination. Restorations at 2 -year recall examination included 17 single-unit, full-coverage crown restorations, four 3 -unit FPDs comprising 8 abutments, and one 2 -unit splint. No retentive failures or sensitivity were recorded at 2 -year recall. Marginal integrities of all restorations/abutments at 2 years were rated in the “alpha” category. Average VAS score for tooth sensitivity decreased from 7. 63 mm at baseline to 0. 44 mm at 6 -month recall, 0. 20 mm at 1 -year recall, and 0. 00 mm at 2 -year recall. The average gingival index score for gingival inflammation decreased from 0. 56 at baseline to 0. 11 at 6 -month recall, then 0. 16 at 1 -year recall, and 0. 21 at 2 -year recall. Conclusions: Two-year recall data yielded no loss of retention, no secondary caries, no marginal discolorations, and no subjective sensitivity. All restorations rated “alpha” for marginal integrity at the 2 -year recall. After periodic recalls up to 2 years, the new bioactive cement tested thus far has performed favorably as a luting agent for permanent cementation...|$|R

The efficacy and safety of peroxide-based teeth whitening has been a largely contested issue over the last two decades. Several reviews have been written on the subject, but the current literature lacks a more involved description of the key factors that influence whitening effects and the manifestation of its adverse effects. Thus, a review of these key factors should be able to more clearly define how these influence treatment outcome during peroxide-based teeth whitening treatments, and how these treatments are likely to expose individuals to additional risk factors. Based on evidence in the current literature, whitening efficacies are dependent on a series of variables associated with treatment. Of these variables, the ones more directly associated with the whitening effects produced after treatment are peroxide concentration, active bleaching time, and [...] to some extent [...] the choice between currently available delivery systems (trays, strips, application brushes). From the studies reviewed, higher concentrations of peroxide produce more pronounced whitening effects, while lower concentrations needing longer active bleaching times to produce similar color changes, as measured by either VITA shade guides, or the CIEL*a*b* system. Color relegations are likely to occur with treatments composed of lower number of treatment sessions compared to treatments with multiple sessions. In terms of adverse effects, peroxides have been found to potentially be associated with carcinogenicity and cytotoxicity not only in oral tissues but in the gastrointestinal lining of hamsters and rats during in vivo studies. However, current reviews and studies have highlighted that excessive levels of peroxide exposure are needed to promote tumor growth or induce cytotoxic effects in the oral cavity; thus, it is unlikely that teeth whitening use of peroxides exposes individuals to dangerous levels of carcinogenicity and cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, some studies have found a decrease in odontoblast viability at concentrations of 16 % carbamide peroxide, suggesting cytotoxicity may become a more significant factor at carbamide peroxide concentrations higher than 16 %. Tooth and <b>gingival</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was closely {{associated with the use of}} either higher peroxide concentrations or longer active bleaching times. However, desensitizing agents such as fluoride, potassium nitrate, and amorphous calcium-phosphate have been found to effectively reduce this sensitivity of teeth and gingival tissues in people experiencing tissue sensitivity. Structural damage to enamel and dentin were found to be statistically insignificant in the studies reviewed, with whitening products of low acidity causing the bulk of the observed demineralization in in vitro studies. In vivo studies evaluating peroxide-associated demineralization have suggested that salivary components are capable of fully remineralizing any affected teeth structures following peroxide-based teeth whitening. In conclusion, from the studies analyzed, it is advisable to use concentrations lower than 16 % carbamide peroxide during at-home treatments. However, use of higher concentrations are acceptable if provided under professional supervision. People with gingival recessions are more likely to experience sensitivity, so use of desensitizing agents at the time of treatment is advisable. In terms of whitening pastes, whitening gels of relatively neutral pH should be used (pH between 5 and 7) to reduce enamel and dentin demineralization; additives may include desensitizing agents to help with sensitivity and antioxidants which can counteract the oxidative stress of peroxides on oral tissues...|$|E
