5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl,</b> which changes for each level. When the right amount of ingredients has been put in the bowl, a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E
5|$|The 2005season marks {{only the}} eighthtime in 50years that exactly twoteams have gone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> season undefeated. This {{has been a}} major {{criticism}} of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top twoteams can generate controversy. If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.|$|E
5|$|After {{losses to}} Penn State and Syracuse, Pastrana led the underdog Maryland {{team to a}} {{surprising}} three-game winning streak over Duke, West Virginia, and South Carolina, which improbably placed the Terrapins atop the Atlantic Coast Conference and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game picture. Maryland, however, lost its final four {{games of the season}} to finish 46 and 33 in the ACC. In the penultimate game against , Pastrana broke the ACC record with his 13th and 14th touchdown passes of the season. Florida State routed Maryland in the season finale, 4521, where Pastrana's passing accounted for all three Terrapin scores in a failed second-half comeback bid. He finished the year with 102completions on 195attempts for 1,499yards and 17touchdowns. After the season, Saban left to become head coach for the Denver Broncos and he was replaced by former Maryland All-American guard Bob Ward.|$|E

25|$|The Bowl Coalition was {{restructured}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance for the 1995 season, involving five conferences (reduced to {{four for}} the 1996 season) and three bowls (Fiesta, Sugar, and Orange). The championship game rotated among these three bowls. It still did not, however, include the Pac-10 or Big Ten champions, the Rose Bowl, or any non-Bowl Alliance teams.|$|E
25|$|The steel-pan {{is created}} by {{hammering}} a 55-gallon drum to produce the full chromatic range of scale notes. After the drum is hammered {{into the shape of}} a concave bowl, individual notes are grooved out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> of the drum. The traditional steel-pan was hammered out by hand, but with the instrument gaining popularity and worldwide demand, manufacturers have experimented with more efficient methods including Spinforming, Flowforming, Aquaforming and Marforming. A typical pan contains 2½ octaves, with each note being a hammered out groove in the pan that produces a distinct note.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the skin}} was {{attached}} by wooden pegs that were driven through holes in the skin and the shell near the playing edge. Four to five people would stretch the wet skin over the drum to apply tension while the pegs were driven <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> The shrinkage of the skin while it dried then applied sufficient additional tension for the skin to resonate. A similar mounting technique is still used by the Landouma (a subgroup of the Baga people) for a djembe-like drum known as a gumbe. This mounting technique most likely goes back hundreds of years; the exact period is unknown.|$|E

25|$|On top of {{the folded}} heaps was set a fluted silver dish with drop handles, {{probably}} made in Italy, with the relief image of a female head in late Roman style worked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> This contained {{a series of small}} burr-wood cups with rim-mounts, combs of antler, small metal knives, a small silver bowl, and various other small effects (possibly toilet equipment), and including a bone gaming-piece, thought to be the 'king piece' from a set. (Traces of bone above the head position have suggested that a gaming-board was possibly set out, as at Taplow.) Above these was a silver ladle with gilt chevron ornament, also of Mediterranean origin.|$|E
25|$|In tanks using a flapper-flush valve, {{the outlet}} {{at the bottom}} of the tank is covered by a buoyant (plastic or rubber) cover, or flapper, which is held in place against a fitting (the flush valve seat) by water pressure. To flush the toilet, the user pushes a lever, which lifts the flush valve from the valve seat. The valve then floats clear of the seat, {{allowing}} the tank to empty quickly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> As the water level drops, the floating flush valve descends back to the bottom of the tank and covers the outlet pipe again. This system is common in homes in the US and in continental Europe. Recently this flush system has also become available in the UK due to a change in regulations.|$|E
25|$|This system, {{invented by}} Albert Giblin and {{common in the}} UK, uses a storage tank {{similar to that used}} in the flapper-flush-valve system above. This flush valve system is {{sometimes}} referred to as a valveless system, since no traditional type of valve is required. Some would argue, however, that any system of regulating the flow of a fluid is still technically a valve. In the siphon-flush-valve system, the user pushes a lever or button, forcing the water up into the tank siphon passageway which then empties the water in the tank <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> The advantage of a siphon over the flush valve is that it has no sealing washers that can wear out and cause leaks, so it is favoured in places where {{there is a need to}} conserve water.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
25|$|Bogor Laksa (Indonesian: Laksa Bogor) {{perhaps is}} the most famous Laksa variant in Indonesia from Bogor city, West Java. The thick {{yellowish}} coconut milk based soup {{is a mixture of}} shallot, garlic, kemiri (candlenut), kunyit (turmeric), ketumbar (coriander), sereh (lemongrass), and salt. Laksa Bogor has a distinct earthy and nutty flavour acquired from oncom (orange-colored fermented beans cake, similar to tempe but different fungi). The hot soup runs, drained, and filled several times <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> contains bihun (rice vermicelli), ketupat (glutinous rice cake), smashed oncom, tauge (bean sprout), kemangi (basil leaves), yellow tofu (colored with turmeric) and boiled egg, until all the ingredients is soft and cooked. The authentic and complete Bogor laksa would include cooked shredded chicken and ground dried prawn, the cheaper street-side version however is entirely vegetarian, without any chicken or prawn, since oncom is traditionally regarded as a meat-substitute. Usually Laksa Bogor is served with sambal cuka (ground chilli in vinegar).|$|E
25|$|Today, in the Samoa 'ava ceremony, {{the role}} of the aumaga is a {{comprehensive}} term, but in former times the 'ava makers were a much more select guild. In the preparation of the 'ava for a ceremony the services of a young woman or young man, or one or more young ladies and young men may be utilised. It is customary for the daughters of all chiefs to be taught how to prepare the 'ava. If the person mixing the 'ava is a young woman, it is customary for her to be the virgin daughter of a chief (matai). The 'ava mixer, sits behind the tanoa bowl and thoroughly mixes the 'ava as another member of the aumaga adds water from time to time. As the mixing proceeds, the 'ava mixer from time to time wrings the liquid from the strainer and folding the same into half its usual length passes it to another member of the aumaga standing outside or {{near the edge of the}} house who frees the strainer of the woody particles of the 'ava by several violent flicks. He then quickly passes the strainer back to the mixer who proceeds until all the particles of the dried root are removed. The stylised movements and serious concentration in the making of the 'ava are part of the ritual pattern in the ceremony. The water poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> as the mixing proceeds is done from either the left or right, not from in front. The action of mixing is one of contracting and expanding the fingers of the two hands as the strainer is slowly worked towards the mixer. When the mixing is completed the rim of the bowl is wiped to remove any water or woody material and the strainer is folded up and placed on the rim of the bowl. The mixer then places both hands on the bowl and sits quietly awaiting the next move in the ceremony.|$|E

500|$|The slide {{tower in}} the {{southeast}} corner of the park contains five slides designed for those who desire a mild thrill. Some of the slides on this tower interact with Dreamworld's Cyclone roller coaster. The Little Rippers are two ProSlide duelling cannon bowl slides. The slides can accommodate guests riding in either one or two person tubes. Riders begin in one of two parallel chutes before entering tunnels and splitting off in opposite directions. Each tunnel has a steep drop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> element of the ride, after which the raft drops down through the centre and into a run-out chute. The other three slides on this tower are collectively known as The Temple of Huey. Guests can ride in a single or double tube. All three slides are ProSlide Pipelines. The three slides are individually named Broken Headz, Cut Snake and Screamin Right Handers and are [...] long respectively. Broken Headz and Cut Snake are enclosed and Screamin Right Handers is an open flume.|$|E

2500|$|This {{system uses}} water main {{pressure}} to pre-pressurize a plastic tank located inside [...] what otherwise {{appears to be}} the more typical ceramic flush tank. A flush cycle begins each time a user flushes the bowl. After a user flushes and the water in the pre-pressurized tank has finished emptying <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl,</b> the outlet valve in the plastic tank shuts. Then the high pressure water from the main refills the plastic tank. Inside the tank is an air-filled balloon-like rubber diaphragm. As the higher-pressure mains water enters the tank, the rubber diaphragm is also pressurized and shrinks accordingly.|$|E
2500|$|During flushing, the {{compressed}} air inside the diaphragm pushes the water <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> at a flow rate which is {{significantly higher than}} a tank style gravity-flow toilet. This system requires less water than a gravity-flow toilet- or alternatively can be more effective for a similar amount of water. Pressure-assist toilets are sometimes found in both private (single, multiple, and lodging) bathrooms as well as light commercial installations (such as offices).
