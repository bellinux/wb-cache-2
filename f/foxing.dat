500|$|Because ukiyo-e {{prints were}} mass-produced, {{collecting}} them presents considerations {{different from the}} collecting of paintings. [...] There is wide variation in the condition, rarity, cost, and quality of extant prints. [...] Prints may have stains, <b>foxing,</b> wormholes, tears, creases, or dogmarks, the colours may have faded, or {{they may have been}} retouched. [...] Carvers may have altered the colours or composition of prints that went through multiple editions. [...] When cut after printing, the paper may have been trimmed within the margin. [...] Values of prints depend on a variety of factors, including the artist's reputation, print condition, rarity, and whether it is an original pressing—even high-quality later printings will fetch a fraction of the valuation of an original.
