The glycosphingolipids are a diverse family of {{molecules}} composed {{of one or}} more sugar residues linked via a <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bond</b> to the sphingoid base. Examples of these are the simple and complex glycosphingolipids such as cerebrosides and gangliosides.|$|E

25|$|Substituted {{derivatives}} of hydroxylamine are known. If the hydroxyl {{hydrogen is}} substituted, {{this is called}} an O-hydroxylamine, {{if one of the}} amine hydrogens is substituted, this is called an N-hydroxylamine. Similarly to ordinary amines, one can distinguish primary, secondary and tertiary hydroxylamines, the latter two referring to compounds where two or three hydrogens are substituted, respectively. Examples of compounds containing a hydroxylamine functional group are N-tert-butyl-hydroxylamine or the <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bond</b> in calicheamicin. N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine is a coupling agent, used to synthesize Weinreb amides.|$|E

5000|$|Monosaccharides can {{be linked}} {{together}} by <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bonds,</b> which can be cleaved by hydrolysis. Two, three, several or many monosaccharides thus linked form disaccharides, trisaccharides, oligosaccharides or polysaccharides, respectively. Enzymes that hydrolyse <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bonds</b> are called [...] "glycoside hydrolases" [...] or [...] "glycosidases".|$|R
30|$|Agarases are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} the hydrolysis of agar into oligosaccharides; these enzymes cleave <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bonds</b> at different positions. Thus, agarases {{can be classified}} into α-agarases (EC 3.2. 1.158), β-agarases (EC 3.2. 1.81), and β-porphyranases (EC 3.2. 1.178) according to the cleavage pattern (Chi et al. 2012). α-Agarases act on the α- 1, 3 <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bonds</b> of agarose, producing agaro-oligosaccharides with a 3, 6 -anhydro-α-l-galactose residue at the reducing end. β-agarases, on the other hand, act on the β- 1, 4 <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bonds</b> of agarose, producing neoagaro-oligosaccharides with a d-galactose residue at the reducing end (Fu and Kim 2010). β-porphyranases act on the β- 1, 4 <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bonds</b> of porphyran, producing oligosaccharides with a d-galactose residue at the reducing end.|$|R
25|$|Hydrolysis {{breaks the}} <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bond</b> {{converting}} sucrose into glucose and fructose. Hydrolysis is, however, so slow that solutions of sucrose can sit {{for years with}} negligible change. If the enzyme sucrase is added, however, the reaction will proceed rapidly. Hydrolysis can also be accelerated with acids, such as cream of tartar or lemon juice, both weak acids. Likewise, gastric acidity converts sucrose to glucose and fructose during digestion, the bond between them being an acetal bond {{which can be broken}} by an acid.|$|E
25|$|RTA has rRNA N-glycosylase {{activity}} {{that is responsible for}} the cleavage of a <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bond</b> within the large rRNA of the 60S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. RTA specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the N-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 (A4324) within the 28S rRNA, but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA intact. The ricin targets A4324 that is contained in a highly conserved sequence of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes. The sequence, 5’-AGUACGAGAGGA-3’, termed the sarcin-ricin loop, is important in binding elongation factors during protein synthesis. The depurination event rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome, resulting in toxicity from inhibited protein synthesis. A single RTA molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{molecules}} {{that are considered}} to be [...] "dietary fiber" [...] are so because humans lack the necessary enzymes to split the <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bond</b> and they reach the large intestine. Many foods contain varying types of dietary fibers, all of which contribute to health in different ways.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{chemistry}} of glycosides is explained in the article on <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bonds.</b> For example, the glycone and aglycone portions can be chemically separated by hydrolysis {{in the presence of}} acid and can be hydrolyzed by alkali. There are also numerous enzymes that can form and break <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bonds.</b> The most important cleavage enzymes are the glycoside hydrolases, and the most important synthetic enzymes in nature are glycosyltransferases. Genetically altered enzymes termed glycosynthases have been developed that can form <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bonds</b> in excellent yield.|$|R

2500|$|Another form of amylase, β-amylase (...) (alternative names: 1,4-α-D-glucan maltohydrolase; glycogenase; saccharogen amylase) is also {{synthesized}} by bacteria, fungi, and plants. [...] Working {{from the}} non-reducing end, β-amylase catalyzes the hydrolysis {{of the second}} α-1,4 <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bond,</b> cleaving off two glucose units (maltose) at a time. [...] During the ripening of fruit, β-amylase breaks starch into maltose, resulting in the sweet flavor of ripe fruit.|$|E
2500|$|Flavin adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{consists of}} two main portions: an adenine nucleotide (adenosine monophosphate) and a flavin mononucleotide bridged together through their phosphate groups. Adenine is bound to a cyclic ribose at the 1' carbon, while phosphate is bound to the ribose at the 5' carbon to form the adenine nucledotide. Riboflavin is formed by a carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bond between a isoalloxazine and a ribitol. The phosphate group is then bound to the on the terminal ribose carbon to form a FMN. Because the bond between the isoalloxazine and the ribitol is {{not considered to be}} a <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bond,</b> the flavin mononucleotide is not truly a nucleotide. This makes the dinucleotide name misleading; however, the flavin mononucleotide group is still very close to a nucleotide in its structure and chemical properties.|$|E
2500|$|In sucrose, the {{components}} glucose and fructose are linked via an ether bond between C1 on the glucosyl subunit and C2 on the fructosyl unit. The bond {{is called a}} glycosidic linkage. Glucose exists predominantly as two isomeric [...] "pyranoses" [...] (α and β), but {{only one of these}} forms links to the fructose. Fructose itself exists as a mixture of [...] "furanoses", each of which having α and β isomers, but only one particular isomer links to the glucosyl unit. What is notable about sucrose is that, unlike most disaccharides, the <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bond</b> is formed between the reducing ends of both glucose and fructose, and not between the reducing end of one and the nonreducing end of the other. This linkage inhibits further bonding to other saccharide units. Since it contains no anomeric hydroxyl groups, it is classified as a non-reducing sugar.|$|E

2500|$|DNA {{can have}} {{mutations}} that cause {{a base in}} the DNA strand to be damaged. [...] To ensure genetic integrity of the DNA, enzymes need to repair any damage. [...] There are many types of DNA repair. [...] Base excision repair utilizes base flipping to flip the damaged base out of the double helix and into the specificity pocket of a glycosylase which hydrolyzes the <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bond</b> and removes the base. [...] DNA glycosylases interact with DNA, flipping bases to determine a mismatch. [...] An example of base excision repair occurs when a cytosine base is deaminated and becomes a uracil base. [...] This causes a U:G mispair which is detected by Uracil DNA glycosylase. [...] The uracil base is flipped out into the glycosylase active pocket where it {{is removed from the}} DNA strand. [...] Base flipping is used to repair mutations such as 8-Oxoguanine (oxoG) and [...] thymine dimers created by UV radiation.|$|E
2500|$|Parameters {{taken from}} the spectrum, mainly NOESY cross-peaks and {{coupling}} constants, {{can be used to}} determine local structural features such as <b>glycosidic</b> <b>bond</b> angles, dihedral angles (using the Karplus equation), and sugar pucker conformations. [...] For large-scale structure, these local parameters must be supplemented with other structural assumptions or models, because errors add up as the double helix is traversed, and unlike with proteins, the double helix does not have a compact interior and does not fold back upon itself. [...] NMR is also useful for investigating nonstandard geometries such as bent helices, non-Watson–Crick basepairing, and coaxial stacking. [...] It has been especially useful in probing the structure of natural RNA oligonucleotides, which tend to adopt complex conformations such as stem-loops and pseudoknots. [...] NMR is also useful for probing the binding of nucleic acid molecules to other molecules, such as proteins or drugs, by seeing which resonances are shifted upon binding of the other molecule.|$|E
