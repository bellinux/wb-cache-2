5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews <b>hiding</b> in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those <b>hiding</b> were Jewish, including some who had been in <b>hiding</b> since the fall of the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in <b>hiding</b> remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities.

40|$|AbstractA <b>hidden</b> algebra is {{a special}} case of coalgebra. A <b>hidden</b> {{congruence}} on a <b>hidden</b> algebra corresponds to a bisimulation equivalence on the corresponding coalgebra. The paper generalizes the notion of <b>hidden</b> congruence to that of <b>hidden</b> bisimulation between two different <b>hidden</b> algebras. We first define <b>hidden</b> bisimulation between two <b>hidden</b> algebras having the same signature. A <b>hidden</b> bisimulation {{is in fact a}} bisimulation between the corresponding coalgebras. We then define <b>hidden</b> simulation between two <b>hidden</b> algebras having different signatures related by a vertical signature morphism. We prefer to call this relation simulation because it is unidirectional, due to the signature morphism. For the last case, the relationship between simulation and refinement is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{decoding}} any high-order <b>hidden</b> Markov model. First, the high-order <b>hidden</b> Markov model {{is transformed into}} an equivalent first-order <b>hidden</b> Markov model by Hadar’s transformation. Next, the optimal state sequence of the equivalent first-order <b>hidden</b> Markov model is recognized by the existing Viterbi algorithm of the first-order <b>hidden</b> Markov model. Finally, the optimal state sequence of the high-order <b>hidden</b> Markov model is inferred from the optimal state sequence of the equivalent first-order <b>hidden</b> Markov model. This method provides a unified algorithm framework for decoding <b>hidden</b> Markov models including the first-order <b>hidden</b> Markov model and any high-order <b>hidden</b> Markov model...|$|R

5|$|Alyssa {{is given}} no {{weaponry}} during {{the majority of}} the game, other than a limited supply of holy water, which can be used to temporarily stun pursuing Subordinates. Within each level, the Subordinate can appear in any location after a set period of time, but also randomly or if Alyssa makes noise. They also appear in certain set locations. When one appears, it immediately begins to chase Alyssa, attempting to kill her. The player must either hide from or evade it. Evasion can only be accomplished in certain places, and each evasion point can only be used once. Using an evasion point does not kill the Subordinate, but instead renders them unconscious for a set time. The primary means of eluding one, however, is by <b>hiding.</b> There are multiple <b>hiding</b> points throughout each level, and each one can be used multiple times. However, <b>hiding</b> places are ineffective if the Subordinate sees Alyssa enter them.|$|E

40|$|The <b>hidden</b> {{terminal}} {{is classified}} as the sending <b>hidden</b> terminal and receiving <b>hidden</b> terminal in this paper. The quantitive analysis of <b>hidden</b> terminal problem and simulation-based analysis of its mechanism is discussed. Through the extensive ns 2 simulations the detail comparison {{for the impact of}} sending <b>hidden</b> terminal and receiving <b>hidden</b> terminal to the performance of TCP is also given. The results show that the <b>hidden</b> terminal will produce large volume of MAC packets collisions and RET packet loss, so the TCP always goes into RTO. In the same sending rate, UDP receiving <b>hidden</b> terminal is more harmful (drop TCP to 20 %) to the TCP performance than sending <b>hidden</b> terminal (drop TCP to 80 %). However, TCP sending <b>hidden</b> terminal is more harmful to the TCP performance than receiving <b>hidden</b> terminal...|$|R
40|$|As a single-hidden-layer {{feedforward}} neural network, {{an extreme}} learning machine (ELM) randomizes the weights between the input layer and the <b>hidden</b> layer {{as well as}} the bias of <b>hidden</b> neurons, and analytically determines the weights between the <b>hidden</b> layer and the output layer using the least-squares method. This paper proposes a two-hidden-layer ELM (denoted TELM) by introducing a novel method for obtaining the parameters of the second <b>hidden</b> layer (connection weights {{between the first and second}} <b>hidden</b> layer and the bias of the second <b>hidden</b> layer), hence bringing the actual <b>hidden</b> layer output closer to the expected <b>hidden</b> layer output in the two-hidden-layer feedforward network. Simultaneously, the TELM method inherits the randomness of the ELM technique for the first <b>hidden</b> layer (connection weights between the input weights and the first <b>hidden</b> layer and the bias of the first <b>hidden</b> layer). Experiments on several regression problems and some popular classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed TELM can consistently outperform the original ELM, as well as some existing multilayer ELM variants, in terms of average accuracy and the number of <b>hidden</b> neurons...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{models and}} e#cient algorithms for detecting groups (communities) functioning in communication networks which attempt to <b>hide</b> their functionality [...] <b>hidden</b> groups. A <b>hidden</b> {{group is a}} group that is planning some activity using some public communication network. Whether intentional, or not, the <b>hidden</b> group uses the surrounding background communications in the communication network to disguise its existence. We develop a model and algorithms for detecting such <b>hidden</b> groups, in particular we exploit the non-random nature of the <b>hidden</b> group communiations with respect to the general background communications. Our results reveal the properties of the background network activity and <b>hidden</b> group communication dynamics that make detection of the <b>hidden</b> group easy, as well as those that make it di#cult. We di#erentiate between two types of <b>hidden</b> groups: in a trusting (or non-secretive) <b>hidden</b> group, members are willing to communicate messages to other members via non-hidden group members; in a non-trusting (or secretive) <b>hidden</b> group, all information that must be passed among <b>hidden</b> group members cannot be passed via non-hidden group members...|$|R
