25|$|In 1983, {{the band}} {{released}} <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unknown,</b> a keyboard-driven progressive hard rock album {{with a slightly}} slower pace. Almost all of the albums the band produced were sold out of the warehouse they were housed in without the band's knowledge, after which this album went out of print. This incident, as well as band members' increasingly divergent personal lives, led to the band's temporary dissolution shortly after the album's release.|$|E

Bad Religion made a progressive rock album with <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unknown,</b> the Beastie Boys gained fame by playing hip hop, and Bad Brains incorporated more reggae into their music, such as in their 1989 album Quickness. Social Distortion went on hiatus after its first album was released, due to Mike Ness's drug problems, and returned with a sound based more on country music, which was referred to as cowpunk.|$|E
25|$|Carother's work in linear super-polymers {{began as}} an {{unrestricted}} foray <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>unknown,</b> with no practical objective in mind.

In the course of research Carothers obtained some super-polymers that became viscous solids at high temperatures, and the observation was made that filaments could be made from this material if a rod were dipped in the molten polymer and withdrawn. At this discovery {{the focus of the}} project shifted to these filaments and `Nylon` was the result.|$|E
25|$|A {{delegation}} {{of more than}} 900 men left the tropical city of Santa Marta and went on a harsh expedition through the heartlands of Colombia in search of El Dorado and the civilisation that produced all this precious gold.

Several other soldiers were participating in the journey, who would later become encomenderos and take part in the conquest of other parts of Colombia. Other contemporaneous expeditions <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>unknown</b> interior of the Andes, all searching for the mythical land of gold, were starting from later Venezuela, led by Bavarian and other German conquistadors and from the south, starting in the previously founded Kingdom of Quito in what is now Ecuador.|$|E

25|$|During the Dutch Golden Age, the Dutch – {{using their}} {{expertise}} in doing business, cartography, shipbuilding, seafaring and navigation – {{traveled to the}} far corners of the world, leaving their language embedded {{in the names of}} many places. Dutch exploratory voyages revealed largely unknown landmasses to the civilized world and put their names on the world map. The Dutch came to dominate the map making and map printing industry by virtue of their own travels, trade ventures, and widespread commercial networks. As Dutch ships reached <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>unknown</b> corners of the globe, Dutch cartographers incorporated new geographical discoveries into their work. Instead of using the information themselves secretly, they published it, so the maps multiplied freely. For almost 200 years, the Dutch dominated world trade. Dutch ships carried goods, but they also opened up opportunities for the exchange of knowledge. The commercial networks of the Dutch transnational companies, i.e. the VOC and West India Company (WIC/GWIC), provided an infrastructure which was accessible to people with a scholarly interest in the exotic world. The VOC's bookkeeper Hendrick Hamel was the first known European/Westerner to experience first-hand and write about Joseon-era Korea. In his report (published in the Dutch Republic) in 1666 Hendrick Hamel described his adventures on the Korean Peninsula and gave the first accurate description of daily life of Koreans to the western world. The VOC trade post on Dejima, an artificial island off the coast of Nagasaki, was for more than two hundred years the only place where Europeans were permitted to trade with Japan. Rangaku (literally 'Dutch Learning', and by extension 'Western Learning') is a body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave of Dejima, which allowed Japan to keep abreast of Western technology and medicine in the period when the country was closed to foreigners, 1641–1853, because of the Tokugawa shogunate's policy of national isolation (sakoku).|$|E

Previous horror films, including When a Stranger Calls, have made use of a babysitter as a plot device, and an urban legend involves a babysitter downstairs with a threat upstairs. Both the viewer and the babysitter learn about the environment together, with both beginning in a position of ignorance. For Pemberton, the device works because the character has been moved from a safe environment <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>unknown.</b> In [...] "The Harrowing", he suggests, it is obvious that there is something in the bedroom.
