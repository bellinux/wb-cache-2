40|$|Abstract. Sequential {{time series}} {{clustering}} {{is a technique}} used to extract important features from time series data. The method can {{be shown to be}} the process of clustering in the Delay-Vector space formalism used in the Dynamical systems literature. Recently, the startling claim was made that sequential time series clustering is meaningless. This has important consequences for a significant amount of work in the literature, since such a claim invalidates these work’s contribution. In this paper, we show that sequential time series clustering is not meaningless, and that the problem highlighted in these works stem from their use of the Euclidean distance metric as the distance measure in the <b>delay</b> <b>vector</b> space. As a solution, we consider quite a general class of time series, and propose a regime based on two types of similarity that can exist between delay vectors, which give rise naturally to an alternative distance measure to Euclidean distance in the <b>delay</b> <b>vector</b> space. We show that, using this alternative distance measure, sequential time series clustering can indeed be meaningful...|$|E

Focusing on causality measures that make use of <b>delay</b> <b>vectors</b> from time series, {{the idea is to}} account for non-stationarity by considering the ranks of the components of the <b>delay</b> <b>vectors</b> rather than the components themselves. As an exemplary measure, we introduce the partial symbolic transfer entropy (PSTE), which is an extension of the bivariate symbolic transfer entropy quantifying only the direct causal effects among the variables of a multivariate system. Through Monte Carlo simulations it is shown that the PSTE is directly applicable to non-stationary in mean and variance time series and it is not affected by the existence of outliers and VAR filtering. For stationary time series, the PSTE is also compared to the linear conditional Granger causality index (CGCI). Finally, the causal effects among three financial variables are investigated. Computations of the PSTE and the CGCI on both the initial returns and the VAR filtered returns, and the PSTE on the original non-stationary time series, show consistency of the PSTE in estimating the causal effects...|$|R
