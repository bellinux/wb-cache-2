5000|$|Manhole cover theft is the {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> <b>manhole</b> covers being stolen, usually for resale as scrap. Long {{considered to be}} a childish prank or simple vandalism, this type of theft is often expensive to municipalities, and dangerous to their residents. [...] In recent years, the theft <b>of</b> <b>manhole</b> covers for financial reasons (i.e., to sell them when scrap metal prices are high) has also become more common.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{detection}} of small objects from aerial images {{is a difficult}} signal processing task. To localise small objects in an image, low-complexity geometry-based approaches can be used, but their efficiency is often low. Another option is to use appearance-based approaches that give better results but require a costly learning step. In this paper, we treat the specific case <b>of</b> <b>manhole</b> covers. Currently many manholes are not listed or are badly positioned on maps. We implement two conventional previously published methods to detect manhole covers in images. The first one searches for circular patterns in the image while the second uses machine learning to build a model <b>of</b> <b>manhole</b> covers. The results show non optimal performances for each method. The two approaches are combined to overcome this limit, thus increasing the overall performance by about forty percent...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{attempts to}} find advantageous shape and configuration <b>of</b> a <b>manhole</b> located in {{the upper part of}} a cylindrical pressure vessel. <b>Manholes</b> <b>of</b> circular and elliptical cross sections have been considered. The manhole is placed vertically and symmetrically with respect to the cylindrical vessel. Three variants <b>of</b> the <b>manhole</b> walls have been taken into account. In the first variant, the manhole wall reaches only the cylinder surface. The manhole walls in two other variants are elongated inside the cylindrical vessel to various lengths. In the case <b>of</b> elliptical <b>manholes</b> two other variants were been considered, i. e. with their major axes situated in parallel or perpendicularly to the axis of symmetry of the cylindrical vessel.

40|$|In the 2004 Niigata-ken Chuetsu Earthquake and the 2003 Tokachi-oki Earthquake,many {{underground}} structures,especially manhole,were uplifted {{caused by}} soil liquefaction of the backfill materials. The amount of maximum uplift was over one meter half and total uplift manholes were frequent. On the contrary,the amount <b>of</b> uplift <b>of</b> <b>manhole</b> {{was less than}} 20 cm in the 1995 Hyogo-ken Nanbu Earthquake. The {{difference between the two}} types of damage derives from depositional conditions of peripheral ground. From the observation of damage,the amount of uplift <b>of</b> the <b>manhole</b> buried in liquefiable ground was less than in un-liquefiable ground. The authors conducted shaking table tests in order to clarify a mechanism of uplift of underground structure due to liquefaction of backfill sand...|$|R

The latter approach more naturally incorporates the dependencies between the weather, structure properties, and structure vulnerability...|$|R

40|$|Safety and {{reliability}} of liquid ammonia storage tank is very important. The stress <b>of</b> <b>manhole</b> is high and complex, so {{it is necessary to}} analyse welding stress <b>of</b> <b>manhole</b> <b>of</b> liquid ammonia storage tank. This paper ignored the complex process in the weld pool, simulated complex thermal process in weld pool by continuous conductive welding heat source, deduced the calculation formula of maximum stress by establishing Gaussian heat source model of carbon dioxide welding, and modified stress exponent k of cylindrical pressure vessel. This new method has a positive meaning for welding stress analysis of pressure vessel. Storage Tank in the petrochemical industry is widely applied, but in recent years with the improvement of manufacturing process, its volume has a gradually increasing trend. As the volume increases, the safety {{and reliability}} of the storage tank becomes extremely important. In order to facilitate testing and maintenance, liquid ammonia storage tank need to install the pressure gauge, level gauge, safety valve, manhole or hand hole, etc., which needs openings in vessels. The stress situation of the opening region is very complex, nozzle and shell are connected together by welding. The opening may lead to structural discontinuity and form local structural discontinuous stress. Because of asymmetry welding temperature fields and local plasti...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for automatic exterior orientation of aerial images {{which is based}} on the use <b>of</b> <b>manhole</b> covers as landmarks. The approach includes two main procedures: First, a landmark extraction scheme which enables us to automatically detect and precisely localize many <b>of</b> the <b>manhole</b> covers visible in an image. Second, an automatic matching procedure which robustly and efficiently matches constellations of detected landmarks with the correct landmarks from a cadastral database. By combining both methods we are able to automatically generate a large number of landmark correspondences per image, which allows for a reliable estimation of the exterior orientation parameters. 1. INTRODUCTION The development of operational procedures for the automatic orientation of aerial images is a matter of topical interest in photogrammetric research (cf. Gulch (1995)). It requires the automation of each step in the orientation process. For absolute orientation this process includes: 1. Esti [...] ...|$|R
