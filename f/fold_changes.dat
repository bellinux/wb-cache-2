50|$|In {{the field}} of {{genomics}} (and more generally in bioinformatics), <b>fold</b> <b>changes</b> are defined directly in terms of ratios. If the initial value is A and the final value B, the fold change is defined as B/A. Note that this is different to the definition described above.|$|E
50|$|In genomics, log ratios {{are often}} used for {{analysis}} and visualization of <b>fold</b> <b>changes.</b> The log2 (log with base 2) is most commonly used. For example, on a plot axis showing log2-fold-changes, an 8-fold increase will be displayed at an axis value of 3 (since 2^3 = 8).|$|E
5000|$|SSMD is {{the ratio}} of mean to the {{standard}} deviation {{of the difference between}} two groups. When the data is preprocessed using log-transformation as we normally do in HTS experiments, SSMD is the mean of log <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> divided by the standard deviation of log <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> with respect to a negative reference. In other words, SSMD is the average <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> (on the log scale) penalized by the variability of <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> (on the log scale) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Fold</b> <b>change</b> is {{a measure}} {{describing}} how much a quantity changes going from an initial to a final value. For example, an initial value of 30 and a final value of 60 corresponds to a <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> of 1 (or equivalently, a change to 2 times), or in common terms, a one-fold increase. <b>Fold</b> <b>change</b> is calculated simply as {{the ratio of the}} difference between final value and the initial value over the original value. Thus, if the initial value is A and final value is B, the <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> is (B - A)/A or equivalently B/A - 1. As another example, a change from 80 to 20 would be a <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> of -0.75, while a change from 20 to 80 would be a <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> of 3 (a change of 3 to 4 times the original).|$|R
30|$|To {{assess the}} host {{response}} to respiratory viruses, {{a blood sample}} was taken from each patient to measure (1) serological changes and (2) biomarker IFI 27 changes. For the serological test, a positive seroconversion to influenza virus {{is defined as a}} low baseline antibody titre (<[*] 1 : 10) followed by an increase (>[*] 4 fold) in antibody titre between the two blood samples. For the IFI 27 biomarker, an increased IFI 27 gene expression in peripheral blood indicates an immune response to a specific respiratory virus with the following threshold cut-off values: influenza (>[*] 74 <b>fold</b> <b>change),</b> parainfluenza virus (>[*] 74 <b>fold</b> <b>change),</b> respiratory syncytial virus (>[*] 40 <b>fold</b> <b>change)</b> and human metapneumovirus (>[*] 40 <b>fold</b> <b>change)</b> [6].|$|R
50|$|<b>Fold</b> <b>changes</b> (t) are {{specified}} {{to guarantee}} genes called significant change {{at least a}} pre-specified amount. This means that the absolute value of the average expression levels of a gene under each of two conditions must be greater than the fold change (t) to be called positive and less than the inverse of the fold change (t) to be called negative.|$|E
50|$|The rank {{product is}} a biologically {{motivated}} {{test for the}} detection of differentially expressed genes in replicated microarray experiments.It is a simple non-parametric statistical method based on ranks of <b>fold</b> <b>changes.</b> In addition to its use in expression profiling, {{it can be used to}} combine ranked lists in various application domains, including proteomics, metabolomics, statistical meta-analysis, and general feature selection.|$|E

40|$|Background: Respiratory muscle {{contractile}} {{performance is}} impaired by diabetes, mechanisms of which included altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress {{and changes in}} membrane electrophysiology. The present study examined to what extent these cellular perturbations involve changes in gene expression. Methodology/Principal Findings: Diaphragm muscle from streptozotocin-diabetic rats was analyzed with Affymetrix gene expression arrays. Diaphragm from diabetic rats had 105 genes with at least 62 -fold significantly changed expression (55 increased, 50 decreased), and these were assigned to gene ontology groups based on over-representation analysis using DAVID software. There was increased expression of genes involved in palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity (a component of lipid metabolism) (P = 0. 037, n = 2 genes, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 4. 2 to 27. 5) and reduced expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism (P = 0. 000061, n = 8 genes, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 22. 0 to 28. 5). Other gene ontology groups among upregulated genes were protein ubiquitination (P = 0. 0053, n = 4, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 2. 2 to 3. 4), oxidoreductase activity (P = 0. 024, n = 8, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 2. 1 to 6. 0), and morphogenesis (P = 0. 012, n = 10, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 2. 1 to 4. 3). Other downregulated gene groups were extracellular region (including extracellular matrix and collagen) (P = 0. 00032, n = 13, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 22. 2 to 23. 7) and organogenesis (P = 0. 032, n = 7, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 22. 1 to 23. 7).

50|$|A volcano plot is {{constructed}} by plotting the negative log of the p {{value on the}} y axis (usually base 10). This results in data points with low p values (highly significant) appearing {{toward the top of}} the plot. The x axis is the log of the fold change between the two conditions. The log of the fold change is used so that changes in both directions appear equidistant from the center. Plotting points in this way results in two regions of interest in the plot: those points that are found toward the top of the plot that are far to either the left- or right-hand sides. These represent values that display large magnitude <b>fold</b> <b>changes</b> (hence being left or right of center) as well as high statistical significance (hence being toward the top).|$|E

The present study examined to what extent these cellular perturbations involve changes in gene expression. Diaphragm muscle from streptozotocin-diabetic rats was analyzed with Affymetrix gene expression arrays. Diaphragm from diabetic rats had 105 genes with at least +/- 2 -fold significantly changed expression (55 increased, 50 decreased), and these were assigned to gene ontology groups based on over-representation analysis using DAVID software. There was increased expression of genes involved in palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity (a component of lipid metabolism) (P = 0. 037, n = 2 genes, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 4. 2 to 27. 5) and reduced expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism (P = 0. 000061, n = 8 genes, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> - 2. 0 to - 8. 5). Other gene ontology groups among upregulated genes were protein ubiquitination (P = 0. 0053, n = 4, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 2. 2 to 3. 4), oxidoreductase activity (P = 0. 024, n = 8, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 2. 1 to 6. 0), and morphogenesis (P = 0. 012, n = 10, <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> 2. 1 to 4. 3).

Real-time PCR confirmed the directionality of changes in gene expression for 30 of 31 genes tested. These data indicate that in diaphragm muscle type 1 diabetes increases expression of genes involved in lipid energetics, oxidative stress and protein ubiquitination, decreases expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and has little effect on expression of ion channel genes. Reciprocal changes in expression of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism may change the availability of energetic substrates and thereby directly modulate fatigue resistance, an important issue for a muscle like the diaphragm which needs to contract without rest for the entire lifetime of the organism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Pre-processing {{methods for}} two-sample long {{oligonucleotide}} arrays, specifically the Agilent technology, {{have not been}} extensively studied. The goal {{of this study is}} to quantify some of the sources of error that affect measurement of expression using Agilent arrays and to compare Agilent's Feature Extraction software with pre-processing methods that have become the standard for normalization of cDNA arrays. These include log transformation followed by loess normalization with or without background subtraction and often a between array scale normalization procedure. The larger goal is to define best study design and pre-processing practices for Agilent arrays, and we offer some suggestions. Results Simple loess normalization without background subtraction produced the lowest variability. However, without background subtraction, <b>fold</b> <b>changes</b> were biased towards zero, particularly at low intensities. ROC analysis of a spike-in experiment showed that differentially expressed genes are most reliably detected when background is not subtracted. Loess normalization and no background subtraction yielded an AUC of 99. 7 % compared with 88. 8 % for Agilent processed <b>fold</b> <b>changes.</b> All methods performed well when error was taken into account by t- or z-statistics, AUCs ≥ 99. 8 %. A substantial proportion of genes showed dye effects, 43 % (99 % CI : 39 %, 47 %). However, these effects were generally small regardless of the pre-processing method. Conclusion Simple loess normalization without background subtraction resulted in low variance <b>fold</b> <b>changes</b> that more reliably ranked gene expression than the other methods. While t-statistics and other measures that take variation into account, including Agilent's z-statistic, can also be used to reliably select differentially expressed genes, <b>fold</b> <b>changes</b> are a standard measure of differential expression for exploratory work, cross platform comparison, and biological interpretation and can not be entirely replaced. Although dye effects are small for most genes, many array features are affected. Therefore, an experimental design that incorporates dye swaps or a common reference could be valuable. </p...|$|E

Here, we have applied the Nano-String platform of fluorescent barcodes and digital readout to measure RNA levels of 577 OR genes in a single reaction, with probes designed against coding sequences. In an inbred mouse strain with a targeted deletion in the P element, we find that this element regulates OR gene choice differentially across its cluster of 24 OR genes. Importantly, the <b>fold</b> <b>changes</b> of NanoString counts in ΔP or ΔH mice are in very close agreement with the <b>fold</b> <b>changes</b> of cell counts, determined by in situ hybridization.

When it comes down to choosing which method is most powerful, {{it comes down to the}} characteristics of the sample and distribution of the gene expressions. The most practiced method is usually SAM or samroc but when the data tends to be skewed, the power of these methods decrease. With the concept that the median becomes a better measure of central tendency than the mean when the data is skewed, the tests statistics of the SAM and <b>fold</b> <b>change</b> methods are modified in this thesis.
