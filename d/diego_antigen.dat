50|$|Seventeen other rare blood types (as of 2002) are {{included}} in the <b>Diego</b> <b>antigen</b> system, as they are produced by mutations on the SLC4A1 gene. These include the Waldner (Wda), Redelberger (Rba), Warrior (WARR), ELO, Wulfsberg (Wu), Bishop (Bpa), Moen (Moa), Hughes (Hua), van Vugt (Vga), Swann (Swa), Bowyer (BOW), NFLD, Nunhart (Jna), KREP, Traversu (Tra), Froese (Fra) and SW1 types.|$|E
50|$|The Dia antigen is {{very rare}} in African and European populations. One West African subject had an {{ambiguous}} possible reaction to Dia. About 0.5% of Europeans of Polish ancestry {{have been found to}} be Dia+. Probably this incidence has been attributed to gene mixture from Tatars who invaded Poland five to seven centuries ago. <b>Diego</b> <b>Antigen</b> found in 0.89% of Germans from Berlin. The Dia antigen {{is very rare}} or absent in Aboriginal Australians, Papuans, natives of New Britain, and Polynesians.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Diego</b> <b>antigen</b> (or blood group) {{system is}} {{composed}} of 21 blood factors or antigens carried on the Band 3 glycoprotein, also known as Anion Exchanger 1 (AE1). The antigens are inherited through various alleles of the gene SLC4A1 (Solute carrier family 4), located on human chromosome 17. The AE1 glycoprotein is expressed only in red blood cells and, in a shortened form, in some cells in the kidney. The Diegoa antigen is fairly common in Indigenous peoples of the Americas (in both North and South America) and East Asians, but very rare or absent in most other populations, supporting {{the theory that the}} two groups share common ancestry.|$|E
40|$|Removal of {{erythrocytes}} {{from the}} circulation is {{mediated by the}} immune system. Changes in structure and function of band 3, a major membrane protein of the erythrocyte, trigger the binding of antibodies to a band 3 -derived neoantigen, senescent cell antigen, on erythrocytes aged in vivo. This mechanism probably is also involved in determining the survival of erythrocytes after transfusion. Band 3 is the carrier of the Diego blood group system, and subtle changes in the three-dimensional conformation of the same extracellular loops of band 3 determine Diego blood group activity as well as senescent cell antigen activity. Therefore we used the Diego blood group system to probe these changes {{with a combination of}} serological and immunochemical methods. Our data indicate that changes in band 3 structure during storage under blood bank conditions, as shown by immunoblot analysis, are not detectable as changes in expression of <b>Diego</b> <b>antigens</b> in intact cells. This makes it unlikely that immunological removal of erythrocytes after transfusion is mediated by reactions involving the Diego blood group system...|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>Diego</b> <b>antigen,</b> Dia, was {{discovered}} in 1953, when a child in Venezuela died of hemolytic disease three days after birth. Rh and ABO blood type mismatches were soon ruled out, and investigators began searching for a rare blood factor. Red blood cells from the father reacted strongly to blood serum from the mother. Rare blood types known {{at the time were}} eliminated, and the new type was classified as a [...] "private" [...] or [...] "family" [...] blood type. The investigators, with the agreement of the father, named the new type after his surname, [...] "Diego". In 1955 investigators found that the Diego family included ancestry from Indigenous peoples of the Americas, and that the Diego factor (Dia) was not restricted to the Diego family, but occurred in several populations in Venezuela and elsewhere in South America. Investigators suspected that the Diego factor might be a Mongoloid trait, and tested groups of Native Americans in the United States and people of Chinese and Japanese ancestry, and found Dia in those groups. Anti-Dib was found in 1967, establishing the Diego group as a two-antigen system. In 1993 the Diego pair of antigens was found to result from a single point mutation (nucleotide 2561) on what is now called the SLC4A1 gene on chromosome 17.|$|E
40|$|Background: Diego {{blood group}} antigen, Di(a), {{is very rare}} among Caucasians and Blacks, but {{relatively}} common among the South American Indians and Asians of Mongolian origin. The antibody to Di(a) is clinically significant to cause hemolytic disease in a new-born or hemolytic transfusion reaction. Objectives: This {{study was designed to}} determine the prevalence of Di(a) antigen among the blood donors from the three major ethnic groups in Klang Valley of Malaysia as well as to find an incidence of an antibody of the <b>Diego</b> <b>antigen,</b> anti-Di(a), in a tertiary care hospital to ascertain the need to include Di(a+) red cells for an antibody screen cell panel. Materials and Methods: Serological tests were performed by column agglutination technique using commercial reagents and following instruction as per kit insert. Results: Di(a) antigen was found with a frequency of 2. 1 % among the Malaysians donors in three ethnic groups viz, Malay, Chinese and Indian. It was present among 1. 25 % of 401 Malay, 4. 01 % of Chinese and 0. 88 % of 114 Indian origin donors. None of the 1442 patients, including 703 antenatal outpatients, had anti-Di(a) in serum. Conclusion: The prevalence of Di(a) antigen was found among the donors of all the three ethnic background with varying frequency. Inclusion of Di(a+) red cells in routine antibody screening program would certainly help in detection of this clinically significant antibody and to provide safe blood transfusion in the Klang Valley, though the incidence of antibody appears to be very low in the region...|$|E
