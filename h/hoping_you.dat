2500|$|The player {{heads to}} Dowerton by train. He falls asleep, and awakens in a train tunnel, where {{he hears the}} voice of a young boy, Timothy Pike. The boy guides him to the station, telling him he has lived in the area [...] "since 41," [...] and {{mentioning}} [...] "the others are <b>hoping</b> <b>you</b> can help them. One of them knows you, your brother ain't it? He's the new one, only just arrived." [...] He also says [...] "it" [...] doesn't know they're talking yet, but soon will. The player finds Pete's PDA, in which he writes about Nigel Danvers and Polly White, the ghost hunters. As the player explores the hotel, he discovers why it originally closed; its reputation never recovered from the night of April 29, 1947, when the guests and staff vanished.|$|E
2500|$|Nilsen {{was adamant}} he was {{uncertain}} {{as to why}} he had killed, simply saying [...] "I'm <b>hoping</b> <b>you</b> will tell me that" [...] when asked his motive for the murders. He was adamant the decision to kill was not made until moments before the actual act of murder. Most victims had been killed by strangulation, although on several occasions, he had drowned the victims once they had been strangled into unconsciousness. Once the victim had been killed, he would typically bathe the victim's body, shave any hair from the torso to conform the body to his physical ideal, then apply makeup to any obvious blemishes upon the skin. The body would usually be dressed in socks and underpants, before Nilsen would drape the victims' arms around him as he talked to the corpse. With most victims, Nilsen would masturbate as he stood alongside or knelt above the body, and although Nilsen confessed to having occasionally engaged in intercrural sex with his victims' bodies, he repeatedly stressed to investigators he had never penetrated his victims — harking that his victims were [...] "too perfect and beautiful for the pathetic ritual of commonplace sex".|$|E
