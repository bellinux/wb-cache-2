5|$|Betances' {{role in the}} Cánovas {{assassination}} {{is described}} by Puerto Rican (born in France) author Luis Bonafoux in his biography about Betances (written in 1901), and partially corroborated by later historians. These sources establish that Betances' circle of friends at the time included various Italian anarchists exiled in Paris, Domenico Tosti being one of them. Tosti and his <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> hold regular social events, during one of which Angiolillo was introduced to Betances.|$|E
5|$|In June 1874, Clayton {{announced}} that {{he could no longer}} control matters in Arkansas and that he and his <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> be willing to enter into any arrangement whereby they could at least be safe from persecution and prosecution. However, the Democrats retaliated by impeaching many Minstrels, including Supreme Court Justice John McClure. Clayton finished his Senate term but was not re-elected.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E

5|$|After the {{produced}} pilot {{lived up}} to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name Friends on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30p.m. timeslot. The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, and was watched by almost 22million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and {{that at least two}} of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that <b>Friends</b> <b>would</b> return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.|$|E
25|$|When he {{traveled}} to Harlem to visit his African-American friends and colleagues, Delaney made efforts {{to ensure that they}} knew little of his other social life in Greenwich Village. He feared that many of his Harlem <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> be uncomfortable or repelled by his homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|When he {{came back}} to Nathdwara, he started a small Electrical workshop. This shop was {{essentially}} a meeting place where Sukhadia and his <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> discuss about the ubiquitous autocracies of British rule and socio-economic reforms in the region. Various education and social awareness programs were schemed and executed in the region by Sukhadia and his fellow workers.|$|E

25|$|Ahern {{regarded}} the {{money as a}} loan, but he conceded that no repayments had at that time (September 2006) been made and no interest has been paid. He {{said that he had}} attempted to repay it, but that his <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> not accept repayment. He claimed that he had broken no codes – ethical, tax, legal or otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Guerneyite <b>Friends</b> <b>would</b> {{typically}} {{see themselves}} {{as part of an}} orthodox Christian movement and work closely with other Christian groups. Friends United Meeting (the international organisation of Gurneyite yearly meetings) {{is a member of the}} National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches, which are pan-Christian organisations, which include Protestant, Orthodox, and Anglican churches.|$|E
25|$|Four of Wittgenstein's former {{students}} {{arrived at his}} bedside—Ben Richards, Elizabeth Anscombe, Yorick Smythies, and Maurice O'Connor Drury. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father Conrad Pepler, also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.|$|E

25|$|As a {{teenager}} in Sandy Hook, Whitley and his <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> pass the time drinking bootleg bourbon and racing their cars down mountain roads at dangerous speeds. Whitley was once in a car whose driver attempted to round a curve at 120mph. The car wrecked, killing his friend and almost breaking Whitley's neck. In another incident, he drove his car off a 120-foot cliff into a frozen river, escaping with only a broken collar bone.|$|E
25|$|In late March 1947, Marciano {{and several}} <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> travel to Fayetteville, North Carolina, {{to try out}} for the Fayetteville Cubs, a farm team for the Chicago Cubs {{baseball}} team. Marciano lasted three weeks before being cut. After failing to find a spot on another team, he returned to Brockton and began boxing training with longtime friend Allie Colombo. Al Weill and Chick Wergeles served as his managers and Charley Goldman as his trainer and teacher.|$|E
25|$|He {{developed}} a loyal following of fans. On many evenings, {{one or another}} of his banjo or Washtub bass ("gut bucket") playing <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> drop in to listen or to jam. He often augmented his experience and repertoire by playing with local musicians. This also included performances at other venues one of which a stint at San Francisco's Red Garter beer palace and night club that provided continuous entertainment. The Red Garter clubs were hotbeds of banjoists.|$|E

25|$|Often, Vysotsky would {{neglect to}} check the tuning of his guitar, which is {{particularly}} noticeable on earlier recordings. According to some accounts, Vysotsky would get upset when <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> attempt to tune his guitar, leading some {{to believe that he}} preferred to play slightly out of tune as a stylistic choice. Much of this is also attributable to the fact that a guitar that is tuned down more than 1 whole step (Vysotsky would sometimes tune as much as 2 and a half steps down) is prone to intonation problems.|$|E
25|$|In January 1961, Garcia {{drove down}} to East Palo Alto to see Laird Grant, an old friend from middle school. He had bought a 1950 Cadillac sedan from a cook in the army, which barely made it to Grant's {{residence}} before it broke down. Garcia spent {{the next few weeks}} sleeping where <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> allow, eventually using his car as a home. Through Grant, Garcia met Dave McQueen in February, who, after hearing Garcia perform some blues, introduced him to local people and to the Chateau, a rooming house located near Stanford University which was then a popular hangout.|$|E
25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot socialize with <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter {{what goes on in the}} surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.|$|E

25|$|The {{second section}} {{consists}} of making Battle.net into a competitive platform for players which involves a new improved matchmaking system, simplifying {{the process of}} players organizing games. The ladder system has also been revamped; the system classifies players into certain leagues according to their level of competitiveness. Players would then compete against others who have a similar skill level to their own, albeit across leagues. There is also a special practice league to practice and hone skills, where game speed is reduced and maps are designed to create a slower pace of the game. The party system works {{similar to that of}} World of Warcraft where players with <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> join together and enter games as a party.|$|E
25|$|The {{championship}} {{was conducted}} on a fairly informal basis through {{the remainder of the}} 19th century and {{in the first half of}} the 20th: if a player thought he was strong enough, he (or his <b>friends)</b> <b>would</b> find financial backing for a match purse and challenge the reigning world champion. If he won, he would become the new champion. There was no formal system of qualification. However, it is generally considered that the system did on the whole produce champions who were the strongest players of their day. The players who held the title up until World War II were Steinitz, Emanuel Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, and Max Euwe, each of them defeating the previous incumbent in a match.|$|E
25|$|In February 1868, Dunant's mother died. Later {{that year}} he was also {{expelled}} from the YMCA. In March 1867, he left his home city Geneva and would not return {{for the rest of}} his life. In the following years, Moynier likely used his influence to attempt to ensure that Dunant would not receive assistance and support from his friends. For example, the gold medal prize of Sciences Morales at the Paris World's Fair did not go to Dunant as originally planned but to Moynier, Dufour, and Dunant together so that the prize money would only go to the Committee as a whole. Napoléon III's offer to take over half of Dunant's debts if Dunant's <b>friends</b> <b>would</b> secure the other half was also thwarted by Moynier's efforts.|$|E
60|$|This {{thought had}} troubled him in secret; and my assurances that his <b>friend</b> <b>would</b> {{probably}} have died at all events, hardly assuaged {{the bitterness of}} his regretful grief.|$|R
