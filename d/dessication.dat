40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role that}} representatives of the London Missionary Society in central southern Africa {{during the nineteenth century}} may have played in the development of geographical debates concerning the long-term <b>dessication</b> of the African continent. Observations on climate included within missionary documents are used to reconstruct a chronology of intra-decadal climatic variability for the period 1815 - 1900. This reveals six drought periods and seven wet phases that affected large areas of the region, but identifies no evidence for progressive <b>dessication.</b> The chronology is then used as a framework within which to view missionary perspectives on drought and <b>dessication.</b> Major influences upon the development of <b>dessication</b> theory appear to include the prevalence of contemporary moral economic explanations of climatic variability, as well as the uptake and acceptance of indigenous understanding of climate change. Significantly, many of the key observations by eminent missionaries used as supporting evidence for progressive <b>dessication</b> are identified as having been made during periods of severe drought. This is used to suggest that the most widely propagated evidence for <b>dessication</b> may, therefore, simply be the end-product of periods of short-term drought rather than long-term climatic deterioration...|$|E

40|$|A {{strain of}} the lichen mycobiont {{isolated}} from a thallus of Parmotrema reticulatum was cultured axenically on different media. The morphology, anatomy, growth of the colonies, and metabolite production were studied. The isolated fungal colonies developed well and showed a remarkable morphogenetic capacity {{on most of the}} assayed solid media, e. g., malt extract 2 %-yeast extract 0. 2 % (MEYE), malt extract 1 %-yeast extract 0. 4 %-sucrose 10 % (MY 10), and the original Lilly & Barnett medium (LB). The identity of the isolated fungus was confirmed by its ITS rDNA-sequence. Atranorin, the major cortical lichen depside, was produced when the colonies were grown over 5 and 10 months on solid LB medium, combined with a <b>dessication</b> treatment. Atranorin was identified by matching of UV spectra obtained from HPLC running and a reference substance in a spectrum library. Colonies grown on MEYE and MY 10 with a <b>dessication</b> treatment did not produce any lichen secondary metabolite. Mycobionts grown for 5 months on solid MEYE without a <b>dessication</b> treatment produced triacylglycerides as the major metabolites, and the fatty acids were characterized as their methyl esters. Analysis by TLC and HPLC-DAD of extracts of colonies grown on LB and MY 10 without <b>dessication</b> revealed that the typical secondary compounds of the natural lichen were not produced.

These ecosystems are often ephemeral and changes in the hydrological regime is a typical characterisic of this habitat type. <b>Dessication</b> is a significant stress factor that affects water organisms. Different species differ in their extent of tolerance to <b>dessication</b> stress and it can affect their community structure and also their phylogenetic diversity. Two sites, the nature reserve Borkovická Blata and the nature locality Na Plachtě, were selected for this work. Ephemeral (seasonally dessicating) and permanent pools differed in the structure of desmid communities but the difference was signifacant only for Borkovická blata. At both localities, the samples from the dessicating pools showed in average lower species richness and Shannon's diversity index than samples from non-dessicating pools, but the differences between these groups of samples were not statistically significant. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the desmids community were phylogenetically overdispersed; closely related species tended to not appear together on the same sites at both localities. The difference in the phylogenetic structure between ephemeral and permanent was detected only in the Borkovická blata site, where the ephemeral pools exhibited weaker [...] ...|$|E
