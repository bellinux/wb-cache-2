40|$|Aims: The main {{objectives}} were {{to determine the}} influence of secondary plant metabolites and antinutritives in lupin seeds on the fermentation performance of lactic acid bacteria and to study their ability to degrade these substances. The suitability of lupin raw materials as <b>fermentation</b> <b>substrates</b> was examined. Methods and Results: To evaluate the fermentation performance, microbial growth, metabolite formation and substrate uptake in three different lupin substrates was monitored. On the one hand, a lupin protein isolate, which contained only trace amounts of phytochemicals was used in the study. On the other hand, the flour of Lupinus angustifolius cv. Boregine and the flour of the alkaloid rich lupin Lupinus angustifolius cv. Azuro were inoculated with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. The micro-organisms showed no significant differences in the fermentation performance on the different lupin flours. Similarly, the growth of most strains on lupin protein isolate was comparable to that on the lupin flours. The fermentation with Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis led to a significant decrease in flatulence causing oligosaccharides. During fermentation with Lactobacillus plantarum the phytic acid content was partially degraded. Conclusions: Neither the secondary plant metabolites nor the antinutritives of lupin flour inhibited the growth or metabolic activity of the tested micro-organisms.

The properties of this enzyme, produced on inexpensive <b>fermentation</b> <b>substrates,</b> were interesting and suggested several biotechnological applications...|$|R
