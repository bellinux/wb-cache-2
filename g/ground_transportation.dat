5|$|At some U.S. {{international}} airports, such as O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, some {{seating and}} waiting areas are {{located away from}} the terminal building, with passengers being shuttled to terminals. These areas may {{be referred to as}} <b>ground</b> <b>transportation</b> centers or intermodal centers. Amenities at <b>ground</b> <b>transportation</b> centers typically include restrooms and seating, and may also provide ticket counters, food and beverage sales and retail goods such as magazines. Some <b>ground</b> <b>transportation</b> centers have heating and air conditioning and covered boarding areas (to protect passengers from the elements).|$|E
5|$|By August 2012, {{implementation}} of 4G WiMAX on-board trains {{is expected to}} provide smooth wireless broadband services, making THSR the first high-speed <b>ground</b> <b>transportation</b> system equipped with this service.|$|E
5|$|Between 1998 and 2000, {{numerous}} airport {{expansion and}} renovation projects were completed, including a $25 million terminal renovation in 1998 that included additional retail shops, new flight information displays, enhanced lighting, upgraded flooring, {{and a new}} food court. Also, new hangars and office spaces were completed for NetJets in 1999, {{as well as a}} $92 million parking garage including an underground terminal entrance, new rental car facilities, dedicated <b>ground</b> <b>transportation</b> area, improved eight-lane terminal access on two levels, and a new atrium and entrances in 2000, which were designed by URS Corporation.|$|E
50|$|During the exposition, Westpark was fenced and {{accessible}} with an entrance fee. A six-kilometer miniature railway with five stations transported visitors around the <b>grounds.</b> <b>Transportation</b> {{was linked to}} the exhibition by a newly build subway branch with three stations along the full length of the park. Three parking lots to the east, north and west were built, including a large one for tour busses.|$|R
50|$|In September the 81st Bombardment Squadron {{went into}} action with the RAF's Desert Air Force {{in support of}} the British Eighth Army. One of the unit's {{earliest}} missions was a night raid on Sidi Haneish, in which it lost three bombers. During the weeks which followed the squadron struck Axis landing <b>grounds,</b> <b>transportation</b> facilities, and troop concentrations. After the Battle of El Alamein the squadron conducted a brief training program consisting principally of aerial gunnery, navigational flights, and night landings. The squadron resumed combat operations in December after rebasing further west. It participated in the pursuit of Field Marshal Rommel's Afrika Korps to Tripoli, which fell late in January 1943.|$|R
50|$|The {{foundation}} {{has been consistently}} opposed to the New Mexico Rail Runner Express on fiscal <b>grounds.</b> <b>Transportation</b> policy expert and frequent critic of light rail Randal O'Toole spoke {{on the subject of}} public transit at a 2010 event sponsored by the Rio Grande Foundation. In a 2011 report, the Foundation noted that early projected costs were far below its actual costs and suggesting that the subsidies it receives could produce many more passenger-miles if spent on other transportation projects; for these and other reasons including low daily ridership (an estimated 3,700 as of the second quarter of 2013), the report advocated the termination of the Rail Runner line.|$|R
5|$|The Robert C. H. Mathews Jr. Terminal is the airport's main {{commercial}} terminal. It {{consists of}} three floors with <b>ground</b> <b>transportation</b> on the first, baggage claim services on the second; and ticketing, passenger drop off, and concourse access on the third. There are 47 gates in the three concourses in use. These concourses are connected by a large hub that contains a unified security checkpoint located in the main section of the terminal.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{prompted}} the closures {{of public and}} private schools, businesses, offices, and factories throughout the Northeast. In some areasmdash&such as the city of Boston and parts of New Jerseymdash&classes were canceled for the entire week following the snowstorm. In New York City, student attendance remained extremely low in the days after schools reopened. The New York Public Library was forced to close its main location and all of its 80 branches. Non-essential government offices in Washington, D.C. were also closed because of the storm. Air and <b>ground</b> <b>transportation</b> came to a halt, with multiple major airports closed and rail service suspended. At La Guardia and Idlewild (now John F. Kennedy International) airports alone, over 100 flights were canceled. Railroads reported {{tens of millions of dollars}} in lost revenue and storm-related expenses.|$|E

40|$|Today, the {{perception}} of layered transportation infrastructure has to be merged with the architecture and urban design. Especially the underground transportation modes affect {{the grounds of the}} city. This study focuses on investigating the relations of <b>grounds</b> and the <b>transportation</b> infrastructure. Exploring the interaction level of urban spaces with the transportation systems in terms of their expansions below and above the ground is the problem itself. Moreover finding a relation between urban spaces, transportation hubs and their typologies and how these typologies shaping urban <b>grounds</b> in the <b>transportation</b> context. After that, İstanbul is the case area of analyzing the urban land with respect to ground and underground relations and typologies that have examined. The selected zones of İstanbul for showing the relation between <b>ground</b> and <b>transportation</b> have the major quality of being in the networks of city transportation system and these are supported by the map called ‘typology mapping’...|$|R
50|$|The {{forerunner of}} the railway in Germany, as in England, {{was to be}} found mainly in {{association}} with the mining industry. Mine carts were used below <b>ground</b> for <b>transportation,</b> initially using wooden rails, and were steered either by a guide pin between the rails or by flanges on the wheels.|$|R
40|$|Sakurajima volcano {{has been}} active since February 2009. The total number of {{explosive}} eruptions was 966 in 2011, which was the highest number in recorded history. Corresponding to volcano activities, the ash accumulation in Kagoshima city increased and total ash amount of 3, 500 g m- 2 was recorded at Kagoshima local meteorological observatory. Because the volume of volcanic ash in rural area paralyze public <b>ground</b> <b>transportations</b> such as rail road and highway, fast recovery efforts are required to the railroad company and city government. However, no quantitative volcanic ash fall estimation has been established. The present study focuses on utilization of weather radars for quantitative ash estimation (QAE), quantitative ash forecasting (QAF), and utilization of crustal movement information for providing ash volume. The knowledge on volcanic ash and algorithm developed by the present study {{can be applied to}} any other volcano which is located in operational weather radar observation area...|$|R

50|$|The Keighley and Kendal Turnpike Trust {{operated}} from 1752 to 1878. It {{was promoted}} mostly by textile manufacturers of Settle on the <b>grounds</b> that <b>transportation</b> costs to be greatly reduced since waggons on good roads need {{half the number}} of horses required for carrying packs. It was built to a standard width of 7 yards of which 5 were metaled.|$|R
30|$|For plan 2 or plan 3, it can {{encourage}} passengers {{transfer to the}} <b>ground</b> public <b>transportation.</b> At the same time, it can speed up facilities speed in the station, thus reduce passenger transfer time. Especially for plan 3, it can induce general vehicles make a detour, which can ensure general vehicles driving smoothly. If the measure could be executed, we can consider choosing plan 3.|$|R

50|$|In 1979, the Minister of Transport, Denis de Belleval, {{proposed}} {{to complete the}} subway extension to Du Collège and to extend {{the rest of the}} line above <b>ground.</b> This <b>transportation</b> plan was rejected by the mayors of the Montreal Urban Community. The moratorium was lifted in February 1981, with a new agreement that approved the construction of one additional station, Côte-Vertu. Du Collège was considered inappropriate {{to play the role of}} a terminus.|$|R
