However, radical morphing {{of the aircraft}} leads to increased structural complexities, resulting in occurrence of dynamic instabilities such as flutter, {{which can lead to}} catastrophic events. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to investigate and understand the changes in flutter characteristics of morphing wings, to ensure uncompromised safety and maximum reliability. In this paper, a study on the flutter characteristics of the folding wing type morphing concept is conducted, to examine the effect of changes in folding angles on the flutter speed and flutter frequency.

40|$|In this paper, we {{will show}} methods to {{interpret}} some rigid origami with higher degree vertices as the limit case of structures with degree- 4 supplementary angle vertices. The interpretation is based on separating each crease into two parallel creases, or double lines, connected by additional structures at the vertex. We show that double-lined versions of degree- 4 flat-foldable vertices possess a rigid folding motion, as do symmetric degree- 2 n vertices. The latter gives us a symbolic analysis of the original vertex, showing that the tangent of the quarter <b>fold</b> <b>angles</b> are proportional to each other. The double line method is also a potentially useful in giving thickness to rigid origami mechanisms.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Given the {{heterogeneous}} {{nature of}} cultures, tumors, and tissues, {{the ability to}} capture, contain, and analyze single cells is important for genomics, proteomics, diagnostics, therapeutics, and surgery.

We describe the fabrication of arrayed or untethered single cell grippers composed of biocompatible and bioresorbable silicon monoxide and silicon dioxide.

40|$|The {{conformational}} {{complexity of}} linear polymers far exceeds that of point-like atoms and molecules. Polymers can bend, twist, even become knotted. Thus {{they may also}} display a much richer phase structure than point particles. But it is not very easy to characterize the phase of a polymer. Essentially, the only attribute is the radius of gyration. The way how it changes when the degree of polymerization becomes different, and how it evolves when the ambient temperature and solvent properties change, discloses the phase of the polymer. Moreover, in any finite length chain there are corrections to scaling, that complicate the {{detailed analysis of the}} phase structure. Here we introduce a quantity that we call the <b>folding</b> <b>angle,</b> a novel tool to identify and scrutinize the phases of polymers. We argue for a mean-field relationship between its values and those of the scaling exponent in the radius of gyration.

40|$|Periodic lattices, {{when used}} as {{assembly}} scaffolds, can augment pre-existing 2 D manufacturing techniques to fabricate 3 D structures with heterogeneous materials, components and architecture such as human organs for transplant patients, and micro batteries. Periodic lattices are first preformed and then folded using externally actuating walls that properly constrain the lattice edges. Angular errors of the actuation walls cause the lattice to distort, misaligning components on the lattice panels. Research into {{the response of}} a lattice to geometric errors imposed on the lattice edges {{does not account for}} how much strain energy is put into the lattice during folding {{and its impact on the}} lattice distortion response and magnitude. This thesis shows how design parameters of the lattice can change the magnitude and shape of the twist response of the lattice when external geometric errors are applied to the lattice during folding. A Buckingham Pi analysis was used to show how the twist response of the lattice due to an external angular wall error depends on the torsional stiffnesses of the panels, the initial <b>fold</b> <b>angle</b> of the preformed accordion unit in the lattice and the angular wall error. A FEA simulation study quantified the Buckingham Pi results by varying the torsional stiffness ratio of the panels, the initial <b>fold</b> <b>angle</b> and the final lattice length after folding. The results showed that increasing the ratio of the torsional stiffnesses by two orders of magnitude decreases the magnitude of the response by as much as an order of magnitude and increases the asymmetry by 0. 5 to 1. 5 orders of magnitude.
