50|$|Today, batch {{prescreen}} is {{ubiquitous in}} the financial industry. The most common method for distributing batch prescreen offers is <b>direct</b> <b>mail.</b> During {{the first quarter of}} 2010, U.S consumers received 481 million <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> prescreen credit offers which represents a 29 percent increase on the 372.4 million mailed {{in the first quarter of}} 2009. However, as the volume of <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> prescreen offers increases, the acceptance rate of those offers tends to decrease. The reason for this inverse correlation is that the number of U.S consumers interested in responding to <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> prescreen offers tends to remain relatively static. <b>Direct</b> <b>Mail</b> prescreen, while compelling to some consumers, just doesn't appeal to everyone.

40|$|The {{following}} project {{attempts to}} connect {{one type of}} campaigning, direct contact, to voter turnout. Direct contact is defined as any type of campaign communication that is directed from the campaign at an individual voter. Most direct contacts are either telephone calls or <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>pieces.</b> The working assumption is that campaign activities matter in determining voter turnout apart from the demographic, political, and psychological characteristics of individual voters. Four congressional districts, two from 1994 and two from 1996, are chosen for analysis. Data is collected on the direct contact efforts of the eight campaigns taking place within the four congressional districts. The direct contact information is then coded onto voter files containing the actual turnout information, age, and party registration of each voter. Using logistic regression, the effects of direct contact are analyzed while controlling for past voter history, age, and party affiliation. ...|$|R

It was concluded that the Peel-and-Taste method, while favorably linked to FTP and LTP, was not so strong as to be a significant stimulus to purchase the product. At the individual product level, it was the relatively unknown juice product that scored the strongest FTP, and had the best statistical fit for models of both FTP and LTP. But it was the popular vodka brand that had the strongest LTP of the three, suggesting that feelings toward a product and likelihood of buying it are two entirely different aspects. Only the vodka product produced LTP results that indicate the Peel-and-Taste method proved its worth as a surrogate for traditional product sampling...|$|R

40|$|In a {{world where}} people see, process and {{remember}} information differently, the question arises: Is technology being used {{in a manner that}} acknowledges and addresses user differences to the fullest extent? Currently, new print technologies like Variable Data Printing (VDP) are only being used to create customized <b>direct</b> <b>mailing</b> <b>pieces</b> and personalized products for the purpose of marketing, sales and promotion. However, VDP introduces the ability to change data and design elements in printed documents on an individual basis, making it possible to address differences in visual and cognitive abilities, language and culture, and situational considerations. Applying this concept of customization to educational or informational documents would allow a small amount of input from a user to influence unique output (different sequences or layouts, typographic decisions and appropriate content choices) that are more relevant, usable and engaging. While using VDP as a means to explore and achieve this customization, the focus of this thesis study is not the technology, but the development of a graphic design strategy that also accommodates this customization goal to make information more accessible and usable on an individual basis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Implementation of new {{guidelines}} into clinical practice is often incomplete. <b>Direct</b> <b>mail</b> {{is a simple}} way of providing information to physicians and may improve implementation of {{new guidelines}} on basic life support (BLS). The {{aim of this study}} was to describe knowledge of the most recent European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Guidelines for BLS among general practitioners (GPs) and investigate whether <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> improves theoretical knowledge of these guidelines. Methods All general practice clinics (n= 351) in Central Denmark Region were randomised to receive either <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> (intervention) or no <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> (control). The <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> consisted of the official ERC BLS/AED poster and a cover letter outlining changes in compression depth and frequency in the new guidelines. In general practice clinics randomised to intervention, every GP received a <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> addressed personally to him/her. Two weeks later, a multiple-choice questionnaire on demographics and BLS guidelines were mailed to GPs in both groups. Results In total, 830 GPs were included in this study (<b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> n= 408; control, n= 422). The response rate was 58 %. The majority (91 %) of GPs receiving <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> were familiar with BLS Guidelines 2010 compared to 72 % in the control group (P Conclusion <b>Direct</b> <b>mail</b> improved knowledge of changes in BLS guidelines and thus facilitated the implementation of this knowledge into clinical practice.
