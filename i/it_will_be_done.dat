With suffixes of variable forms depending on vowel harmony, the version {{in accordance with the}} actual pronunciation should be used. If a certain suffix requires lengthening of the word-final vowels a, e, o, ö, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> as usual, e.g. Oslo but Oslóban, oslói. In addition, suffixes will follow the pronunciation of the word in terms of the ending consonant and the front or back vowels (e.g. Bachhal ‘with Bach’, Greenwichcsel ‘with Greenwich’).|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, Mason {{stated that}} a romantic {{interest}} for Chris could be {{introduced in the}} future. He {{said that it was}} not confirmed, but there was a chance that Chris would find someone. Mason admitted that he would find it [...] "awkward" [...] if he had to perform a male kissing scene. The following year, Mason revealed that the writers had plans for a romance for Chris on their radar and a few weeks later it was announced that Bobby Morley had joined the cast as Aidan Foster, a love interest for Chris. Aidan and Chris formed the serial's first gay couple. Bower called the storyline [...] "a natural progression" [...] for Chris, noting that he needed to meet someone at some stage. Bower told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Chris's romance will be handled in a sensitive way and will be treated within the character. She explained [...] "Chris is a naturally shy person – he is not a person who either flaunts his sexuality or his heart. So <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> according to that character. And {{it may not be a}} full-on relationship. The character that Bob is playing is older and further down the track with his relationship testing, so it will be a relationship story rather than a gay male romance." [...] Mason said that Chris and Aidan's relationship would have a slow build up.|$|E

He defines [...] "Aztec" [...] as including all the Nahuatl speaking peoples of central Mexico, that is in opposition to a definition restricting the term [...] "Aztec" [...] to cover the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan or the parties in the Aztec Triple Alliance.

2500|$|Up to 600 pro-Tibet {{protesters were}} {{expected}} to attend the relay, along with between 2,000 and 10,000 Chinese supporters. Taking note of {{the high number of}} Chinese supporters, Ted Quinlan, head of the Canberra torch relay committee, said: [...] "We didn't expect this reaction from the Chinese community. It is obviously a well-coordinated plan to take the day by weight of numbers. But we have assurances that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> peacefully.". Also, Australia's ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope confirmed that the Chinese embassy was closely involve to ensure that [...] "pro-China demonstrators vastly outnumbered Tibetan activists." [...] Australian freestyle swimmer and five-time Olympic gold medalist Ian Thorpe ended the Australian leg of the torch relay April 24, 2008, touching the flame to light a cauldron after a run that was only marginally marked by protests. People demonstrated both for China and for Tibet. At least five people were arrested during the torch relay. Police said [...] "the five were arrested for interfering with the event under special powers enacted in the wake of massive protests against Chinese policy toward Tibet." [...] At one point, groups of Chinese students surrounded and intimidated pro-Tibet protesters. One person had to be pulled aboard a police launch when a group of pro-Chinese students looked like they might force him into the lake.|$|E

The present {{thesis is}} about the {{generation}} of new alternatives {{in the use of}} construction materials; specifically about the feasibility to use artificial sand, rich in siliceous dioxide, for improve the mechanics properties of the hydraulic mortars. This sand has the special characteristic for be the final results of a crush lab process of a solid-remaining material, which is product of the state change plasma in solid; {{as a consequence of the}} process of garbage treatment, with the American system PEMTM (Plasma Enhanced MelterTM). The artificial sand <b>will</b> <b>be</b> combined with natural sand in different addition percentages, and finally tested the mechanic characteristics of the hydraulic mortars with those combinations. Besides, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> different previous tests to the mortars, with the finally of determinate the physics characteristics and compatibility for both materials (artificial and natural sand) to be used as a whole. Finally, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> a practical field test in a civil work with that combination of artificial-natural sand which reports the best results.

It does not follow that because a thing has been done oftener <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> better. That depends on the intelligence of the workman, and on the degree in which his mind works along with his hands. But <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> more easily. This is as true of mental operations as of bodily. Even a child, after much practice, sums up a column of figures with a rapidity which resembles intuition. The act of speaking any language, of reading fluently, of playing music at sight, are cases as remarkable as they are familiar. Among bodily acts, dancing, gymnastic exercises, ease and brilliancy of execution on a musical instrument, are examples of the rapidity and facility acquired by repetition. In simpler manual operations the effect is, of course, still sooner produced.|$|E
