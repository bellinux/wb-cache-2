25|$|Neuroactive steroids, e.g., {{progesterone}} and its active metabolite allopregnanolone, {{are positive}} modulators of the GABAA receptor and are cross tolerant with benzodiazepines. The active metabolite of progesterone {{has been found}} to enhance the binding of benzodiazepines to the benzodiazepine binding sites on the GABAA receptor. The cross-tolerance between GABAA receptor positive modulators occurs because of the similar mechanism of action and the subunit changes that occur from chronic use from {{one or more of these}} compounds in expressed receptor isoforms. Abrupt withdrawal from any of these compounds, e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, corticosteroids, neuroactive steroids, and nonbenzodiazepines, precipitate similar withdrawal effects characterized by central nervous system hyper-excitability, resulting in symptoms such as increased seizure susceptibility and anxiety. While many of the neuroactive steroids do not produce full tolerance to their therapeutic effects, cross-tolerance to benzodiazepines still occurs as had been demonstrated between the neuroactive steroid <b>ganaxolone</b> and diazepam. Alterations of levels of neuroactive steroids in the body during the menstrual cycle, menopause, pregnancy, and stressful circumstances can lead to a reduction in the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and a reduced therapeutic effect. During withdrawal of neuroactive steroids, benzodiazepines become less effective.|$|E

It is specifically a modification of progesterone in which the C3 ketone {{has been reduced to}} a hydroxyl group, the double bond between the C4 and C5 positions has been reduced and is now a single bond, and a ketone has been substituted at the C11 position. Alfaxalone is also a derivative of allopregnanolone (5α-pregnane-3α-ol-20-one), differing from it only by the addition of the C11 ketone. Other closely related steroids include <b>ganaxolone</b> (3β-methyl-5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one), hydroxydione (21-hydroxy-5β-pregnane-3,20-dione), minaxolone (11α-(dimethylamino)-2β-ethoxy-5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one), pregnanolone (3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one), and renanolone (5β-pregnan-3α-ol-11,20-dione).|$|E
50|$|Allopregnanolone and {{the other}} {{endogenous}} inhibitory neurosteroids have short terminal half-lives and poor oral bioavailability, and for these reason, have not been pursued for clinical use themselves. Instead, synthetic analogs with improved pharmacokinetic profiles, such as <b>ganaxolone,</b> have been synthesized and are being investigated. However, exogenous progesterone, such as oral micronized progesterone (OMP), elevates allopregnanolone levels in the body with good dose-to-serum level correlations. Due to this, {{it has been suggested}} that OMP could be described as a prodrug of sorts for allopregnanolone. As a result, there has been some interest in using OMP to treat catamenial epilepsy, as well as other menstrual cycle-related and neurosteroid-associated conditions.

The 21-hydroxylated derivative of this compound, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), is an endogenous inhibitory neurosteroid with similar properties to those of allopregnanolone, and the 3β-methyl analogue of allopregnanolone, <b>ganaxolone,</b> is under development to treat epilepsy and other conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).|$|E
50|$|Neuroactive steroids, {{also known}} as neurosteroids, are {{endogenous}} or exogenous steroids that rapidly alter neuronal excitability through interaction with ligand-gated ion channels and other cell surface receptors.

The term, neuroactive steroid refers to steroids that can be synthesized in brain or are synthesized by an endocrine gland that then reach the brain through the bloodstream and have effects on brain function. The term neuroactive steroids was first coined in 1992 by Steven Paul and Robert Purdy. In addition to their actions on neuronal membrane receptors, some of these steroids may also exert effects on gene expression via nuclear steroid hormone receptors.

40|$|Pharmacological {{treatment}} of epilepsy is often unsatisfactory due to {{side effects and}} the lack of drugs that control the progressive epileptogenic process. Modulation of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -ergic neurotransmission by synthetic agonists of the neuroactive steroid binding site on the GABAA receptor complex is one approach toward the identification of improved antiepileptic agents. In this study, antiepileptogenic and anticonvulsive effects of the novel synthetic neuroactive steroid, <b>ganaxolone</b> (3 alpha-hydroxy- 3 beta-methyl- 5 alpha-piegnan- 20 -one) were evaluated in comparison with diazepam and valproate against pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) -induced kindled seizures in mice. Kindled seizures provide a model of the progressive epileptogenic process. Successive administration of 45 mg/kg PTZ on days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 resulted in the rapid development of kindled seizures and significant reductions in thresholds for clonic convulsions, tonic convulsions, and lethality induced by PTZ on day 10. <b>Ganaxolone,</b> diazepam, and valproate dose-dependently protected against clonic convulsions induced by acute submaximal dose of PTZ (70 mg/kg). The compounds also dose-dependently suppressed fully kindled seizures and blocked the expression of kindled seizures over successive treatments with PTZ (45 mg/kg). Relative to acute anticonvulsive potencies against 70 mg/kg PTZ, however, <b>ganaxolone</b> was more potent than valproate or diazepam against fully kindled seizures and in blocking the expression of kindled seizures over successive treatments with PTZ.

40|$|Allopregnanolone and its equipotent stereoisomer, pregnanolone (together termed ALLO), are neuroactive steroids that {{positively}} and allosterically modulate {{the action of}} gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) at GABAA receptors. Levels of ALLO are reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid of female premenopausal patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a severe, neuropsychiatric condition that affects millions, yet is without a consistently effective therapy. This suggests that restoring downregulated brain ALLO levels in PTSD may be beneficial. ALLO biosynthesis is also decreased {{in association with the}} emergence of PTSD-like behaviors in socially isolated (SI) mice. Similar to PTSD patients, SI mice also exhibit changes in the frontocortical and hippocampal expression of GABAA receptor subunits, resulting in resistance to benzodiazepine-mediated sedation and anxiolysis. ALLO acts at a larger spectrum of GABAA receptor subunits than benzodiazepines, and increasing corticolimbic ALLO levels in SI mice by injecting ALLO or stimulating ALLO biosynthesis with a selective brain steroidogenic stimulant, such as S-norfluoxetine, at doses far below those that block serotonin reuptake, reduces PTSD-like behavior in these mice. This suggests that synthetic analogs of ALLO, such as <b>ganaxolone,</b> may also improve anxiety, aggression, and other PTSD-like behaviors in the SI mouse model.

40|$|Angelman {{syndrome}} (AS) {{is a rare}} {{genetic and}} neurological disorder presenting with severe developmental delay, ataxia, epilepsy, and lack of speech. AS {{is associated with a}} neuron-specific loss of function of the maternal UBE 3 A allele, a gene encoding an E 3 ubiquitin ligase. Currently, no cure exists for this disorder; however, recent research using an AS mouse model suggests that pharmacological intervention is plausible, and can alleviate some of the detrimental phenotypes reported in AS patients. Although there is no curative treatment for AS, seizure medication and behavioral therapies are most commonly prescribed in order to minimize symptoms. However, these options only moderately improve quality of life and can cause adverse side effects, such as alterations in mood and cognition following seizure treatment. Unfortunately, epilepsy is a common cause of death in AS and affects greater than 80 % of AS patients, with 77 % of those patients remaining refractory. The severity of seizures and lack of consistently effective anti-epileptic medications for AS patients demonstrates a considerable need for other therapeutic options. The goal of this work was to evaluate the effects of seizure therapies that have proven beneficial for treating refractory epilepsy in seizure-related disorders. These studies focused specifically on advances in both a pharmacological and dietary therapy evaluated in the AS mouse model. Previous work in our lab has demonstrated the importance of interneurons and GABAergic tone in hippocampal network regulation and cognition. GABA is an important modulator of synaptic plasticity, and learning increases both inhibitory synaptogenesis and GABA release from hippocampal inhibitory neurons. A neuronal excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, coupled with decreased GABAergic tone, altered synaptic plasticity, and impaired cognition {{have been reported in the}} AS mouse model. Therefore, we proposed to examine two therapeutic strategies used in seizure treatment – a ketone ester (KE) supplement, which is thought to increase the [GABA]/[glutamate] ratio via alterations in brain metabolism, and <b>ganaxolone,</b> a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. We evaluated the effects of each therapeutic on learning and cognitive enhancement, alterations in synaptic function, and anticonvulsant activity. We hypothesized that both the KE and <b>ganaxolone</b> would demonstrate anticonvulsant efficacy in both behavioral and chemiconvulsant seizure models. Additionally, as chronic epilepsy has been linked to progressive cognitive and memory impairment which may be related to GABA deficiencies, we hypothesized that both therapeutics would improve cognition and modulate synaptic plasticity (i. e., synaptic function). KE administration produced sustained ketosis and improved motor coordination, learning and memory, and synaptic plasticity in AS mice. The KE was also anticonvulsant and altered brain amino acid metabolism in AS treated animals. <b>Ganaxolone</b> was anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and improved motor deficits in AS mice. Four weeks of treatment also led to recovery of spatial working memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits.

A variety of neuroprotection approaches such as statins, progesterone (P), cyclosporine A and anti-inflammatory agents have been tested that either target neurons or non-neuronal cells in animal models of TBI. Herein we evaluated the neuroprotective potential of the neurosteroid <b>Ganaxolone</b> (GX) in a mouse TBI model. GX is a synthetic neurosteroid related to allopregnanolone that has sedative, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant effects. To our knowledge GX has not been used as a neuroprotective agent for TBI. We utilized a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model, which simulates aspects of concussions, brain contusions, and hemorrhages seen in human TBI. Our pilot studies showed the feasibility of TBI-induced chronic epilepsy model in mice. <b>Ganaxolone</b> treatment had positive outcomes on motor function and additional promising disease-modifying or protective potential to reduce epileptic seizures. This pilot study will be advanced further in a larger cohort to confirm Ganaxolone?s ability to reduce or prevent PTE...|$|E
40|$|Important gender {{differences}} exist regarding affective disorders, and depression affects women two {{times more than}} men. Accumulating evidence suggests a functional interrelationship between ovarian steroids, the serotonergic (5 -HT) system and depression. The objective of this thesis was thus to study the modulation of the 5 -HT neuronal firing activity by neuroactive steroids and compare it between genders. It was achieved by means of in vivo extracellular unitary recordings of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5 -HT neurons in anesthetized rats. The basal firing rate of DRN 5 -HT neurons was significantly higher in males (M) and pregnant females (P 17) as compared to freely cycling females (F). During pregnancy, 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors were partially desensitized, which is consistent with the higher 5 -HT neuronal firing activity. The GABAergic tonic inhibition of 5 -HT neurons was lower in both M and P 17 as compared to F, which is also in agreement with their greater 5 -HT neuronal firing rate. In F, 5 beta-pregnane- 3, 20 -dione (5 beta-DHP), 5 alpha-pregnane- 3 alpha-ol, 20 -one (3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), its sulfated form DHEAS, testosterone (T), 17 beta-estradiol (17 beta-E) and <b>ganaxolone</b> (a synthetic analog to 3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP) significantly increased the firing activity of 5 -HT neurons. Of those, only DHEAS, T and 17 beta-E were also effective in M. The effect of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP and <b>ganaxolone</b> in F, as well as of DHEAS in both M and F, could be seen as early as after a 3 -day treatment. Furthermore, 3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP and <b>ganaxolone</b> prevented the initial decrease in firing activity caused by citalopram (a selective 5 -HT reuptake inhibitor), which is responsible for its delay of therapeutic action. However, DHEAS could prevent it only partially in both genders. These results constitute strong evidence of {{gender differences}} in both the basal firing activity of 5 -HT neurons and in their modulation by neuroactive steroids. They also present some mechanisms of action by which gender and hormonal fluctuations influence the 5 -HT neuronal function. Finally, the results of this thesis offer a cellular basis for the putative antidepressant effects of neurosteroids, which may prove important particularly for affective disorders in women...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that the GABA(A) ergic system {{is involved in the}} pathophysiology of the fragile X syndrome, a frequent form of inherited intellectual disability and associated with autism spectrum disorder. However, the molecular mechanism underlying GABA(A) ergic deficits has remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate reduced mRNA expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits in the cortex and cerebellum of young Fmr 1 knockout mice. In addition, we show that the previously reported underexpression of specific subunits of the GABA(A) receptor can be corrected in YAC transgenic rescue mice, containing the full-length human FMR 1 gene in an Fmr 1 knockout background. Moreover, we demonstrate that FMRP directly binds several GABA(A) receptor mRNAs. Finally, positive allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptors with the neurosteroid <b>ganaxolone</b> can modulate specific behaviors in Fmr 1 knockout mice, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of the receptor...|$|E
40|$|The {{pilocarpine}} {{model is}} based on status epilepticus (SE) induction in rodents to mimictemporal lobe epilepsy as observed in humans. Depending on SE duration, widespreaddamage is observed in hippocampal or extrahippocampal regions leading to gliosis andreorganization of neuronal circuits [1]. Glial cells {{can play a role}} in modulating the lesionoutcome through the release of neurotrophic factors or mediators of the inflammatoryresponse. Moreover, glial cells are able to synthesize neurosteroids that can interact withGABAA receptors. In a previous study [2], we have reported an increased expression of therate-limiting enzyme cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P 450 (P 450 scc), after SEin the hippocampal formation. P 450 scc converts cholesterol into pregnenolone. In addition,we found that the upregulation of P 450 scc was more pronounced in rats exposed to longerintervals of SE, and that these animals had a delayed onset of spontaneous recurrentseizures (SRSs). Finally, we have shown that when treated with the 5 α-reductase inhibitorfinasteride, a drug that blocks the synthesis of allopregnanolone, the appearance of SRSswas anticipated. We have recently identified a highly predictable lesion in the CA 3 stratumlacunosum-moleculare of pilocarpine-treated adult rats [3]. This lesion enlarged withlonger SE intervals and was partially reduced or, in some cases, prevented by treatinganimals with diazepam. In addition, the CA 3 lesion was uncommon in young (3 -weekold) rats. A characteristic of the CA 3 lesion was its association with an increasedpropensity to develop SRSs. Here, we investigated whether the higher expression of P 450 scc associated with glialreactivity could influence the development of the CA 3 lesion as well as the frequency ofoccurrence of SRSs in both young and adult rats. To this aim, we exposed 8 and 3 -weekoldrats to 1 h of SE, characterizing both the consequent brain damage and epileptogenesis. Adult animals presented a well defined lesion in CA 3, consisting of loss of glial cells (Fig. 1), nerve fibers and neurons. Brains in young rats, instead, presented a pronounced, longlastingglial reaction in the same area in which the CA 3 lesion was localized in adultanimals. As expected, young rats presented with P 450 scc induction that was larger than inadults. In addition, spontaneous seizures were significantly delayed (p< 0. 01) in younganimals exposed to 1 h SE compared with adults. To further evaluate the role ofneurosteroids on the onset of the CA 3 lesion we treated the adult group (which presentsthis type of damage) with <b>ganaxolone</b> (60 mg/kg p. o.), a synthetic analogue ofallopregnanolone. <b>Ganaxolone</b> was able to significantly prevent the CA 3 lesion in 3 / 13,whereas all untreated rats (n= 10) were damaged. However, no differences were found inthe onset of SRSs in both groups of treatment (Fig. 2). Taken together, these resultssuggest that high levels of neurosteroids protect the CA 3 hippocampal region from damageoccurring during SE. However, this effect was particularly evident in young rats. Theallopregnanolone analogue <b>ganaxolone</b> only modestly prevented the lesion in adult rats;such a lesion is known to be prevented by diazepam administration (3). These findingssuggest that endogenous neurosteroids are more effective than those administered exogenously. We propose that the development of more effective neurosteroid mimeticdrugs could provide promising tools for the treatment of temporal lobeepilepsy...|$|E

It is caused by mutations on the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR 1) and lack of fragile X mental retardation protein, which in turn, leads to decreased inhibition of translation of many synaptic proteins. The metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) hypothesis states that the neurological deficits in individuals with FXS are due mainly to downstream consequences of overstimulation of the mGluR pathway. The main efforts have focused on mGluR 5 targeted treatments; however, investigation on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system and its potential as a targeted treatment is less emphasized. The fragile X mouse models (Fmr 1 -knock out) show decreased GABA subunit receptors, decreased synthesis of GABA, increased catabolism of GABA, and overall decreased GABAergic input in many regions of the brain. Consequences of the reduced GABAergic input in FXS include oversensitivity to sensory stimuli, seizures, and anxiety. Deficits in the GABA receptors in different regions of the brain are associated with behavioral and attentional processing deficits linked to anxiety and autistic behaviors. The understanding of the neurobiology of FXS has {{led to the development of}} targeted treatments for the core behavioral features of FXS, which include social deficits, inattention, and anxiety. These symptoms are also observed in individuals with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, therefore the targeted treatments for FXS are leading the way in the treatment of other neurodevelopmental syndromes and autism. The GABAergic system in FXS represents a target for new treatments. Herein, we discuss the animal and human trials of GABAergic treatment in FXS. Arbaclofen and <b>ganaxolone</b> have been used in individuals with FXS. Other potential GABAergic treatments, such as riluzole, gaboxadol, tiagabine, and vigabatrin, will be also discussed. Further studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of GABAergic treatments for FXS.
