5|$|Object {{permanence}} is {{the understanding}} that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be observed (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way). This is a fundamental concept studied {{in the field of}} developmental psychology, the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence <b>emerges</b> <b>in</b> human development.|$|E
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly <b>emerges</b> <b>in</b> May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
5|$|The group {{leaves the}} {{facility}} and <b>emerges</b> <b>in</b> a desert landscape on the Moon. The year is 2074 {{and most of}} humanity was killed by Radical-6 after it was unleashed by Free the Soul from a Mars mission test site in 2028. They re-enter the facility and discover a cold sleep pod. K explains that each person {{was brought to the}} facility to recreate the events that Zero Sr. and Akane had previously experienced. Clover, Alice, and Phi were abducted in 2028 and placed in cold sleep until the Nonary Game began. The pod opens to reveal a clone of Sigma, and K reveals he is actually Akane in disguise; in the timelines where Akane was killed, the armor was instead occupied by Sigma's clone, Kyle.|$|E
50|$|Malicorne, a French {{electric}} folk group <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> 1973, {{starting with}} traditional music {{and then later}} blended it with pop. Canadian Stan Rogers wrote and performed folk music with strong historical and nautical themes, <b>emerging</b> <b>in</b> 1976. Si Kahn <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> 1974 at the more political and topical end of the folk music spectrum.|$|R

5|$|Yagnavalkya {{explains}} that warm air inhaled passes to the Brahmarandhra via the navel which helps in curing diseases. When hot air is {{retained in the}} heart it is the stage when it makes entry into the Sahasrara Chakra, the thousand petaled lotus, that then <b>emerges</b> <b>in</b> an inverted form. When the vital air is held in the abode of Brahman (Atman), which is the heart, according to verses 12.15–22, the fire located {{in the region of}} Susumna, which is between the eyebrows glows. These exercises, which stimulates the heart with vital air and fire, lead to the perception of light internally and externally. At this stage one should behold with the mind's eye, the fire-like glowing moon in the forehead, and meditate on the inner self in the Chitta (mind).|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} cub <b>emerges</b> <b>in</b> most litters, {{usually a}} male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.|$|E
5|$|Like most owls, {{the barn}} owl is nocturnal, relying on its acute sense of hearing when hunting in {{complete}} darkness. It often becomes active shortly before dusk and {{can sometimes be}} seen during the day when relocating from one roosting site to another. In Britain, on various Pacific Islands and perhaps elsewhere, it sometimes hunts by day. This practice may depend on whether the owl is mobbed by other birds if it <b>emerges</b> <b>in</b> daylight. However, in Britain, some birds continue to hunt by day even when mobbed by such birds as magpies, rooks and black-headed gulls, such diurnal activity possibly occurring when the previous night has been wet making hunting difficult. By contrast, in southern Europe and the tropics, the birds seem to be almost exclusively nocturnal, with the few birds that hunt by day being severely mobbed.|$|E

5|$|While the Silver Line was {{originally}} planned to terminate at Stadium-Armory, in 2012 {{the plan was}} changed for the line to end at Largo Town Center instead, because Stadium-Armory's pocket track is too short for trains to turn around. It follows the Blue and Orange Line tracks through DC, continuing through Arlington along the Orange Line and branching off immediately east of the West Falls Church station. The new tracks run in the median of the Dulles Connector Road to an elevated bridge, which takes them over Virginia Route 123. Two elevated stops along {{the west side of}} Route 123 serve the national headquarters of CapitalOne, SAIC and two enclosed Tysons Corner shopping malls. The tracks then enter a tunnel which <b>emerges</b> <b>in</b> the median of Virginia Route 7. Two elevated stations above Route 7 serve the western section of Tysons Corner. The elevated track then swings into the median of the Dulles Access Road until it reaches the airport. Along the way, five new stations would be built with platforms in the median of the access road and a faregate and pedestrian bridges to parking areas elevated above the highway. In anticipation of the Herndon station being built, in 1999 Fairfax County constructed a 1,750-space parking garage with ramps to the Dulles Access Road toll lanes and this facility is being used for bus commuters on an interim basis. The garage has drawn criticism because of alleged construction flaws. As originally planned, upon reaching the airport the track will enter a tunnel which will follow the path of the arrivals driveway of the airport terminal to a station located close to the terminal. The track would leave the tunnel near the airport hotel and economy parking lots and would head north parallel to the main runways. A storage yard and maintenance facility would branch off to the west occupying the airport's buffer zone north of the end of its major runways. The final two stops would be in the median of the Dulles Greenway, serving the Ashburn suburb. Hence, the line is expected to draw both airport traffic and commuters from the far western suburbs of Washington, DC. Buses currently provide these users with limited public transportation. In contrast, the Silver Line is expected to provide trains once every six minutes during rush hours and once every fourteen minutes during non-rush hours.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concepts}} of [...] "science" [...] and [...] "religion" [...] are a recent invention: [...] "religion" [...] <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the 17th {{century in the}} midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation, [...] "science" [...] <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century {{in the midst of}} attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature, and the phrase [...] "religion and science" [...] <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts.
