25|$|Capcom later {{released}} Final Fight 2 in 1993, {{a sequel}} created {{specifically for the}} SNES. In this installment, Guy's sensei, Genryusai and his daughter Rena (Guy's fiancee), are kidnapped by the new incarnation of Mad Gear. In the game's story, Guy is off on a training mission and is unable to rescue his fiancee and master. Instead, the game features Guy's sister-in-law, Maki Genryusai, who has also been trained in the same fighting style, and Carlos Miyamoto, a South American swordsman. Guy only makes an appearance {{in the end of}} the game, although the game does feature power-up icons shaped after his character. In Final Fight 3, released in 1995, Guy finally returns to Metro City and teams up with Haggar to rid Metro City of the Skull Cross gang, the latest gang to try to pick up where Mad Gear had left off. They are joined by Metro City SCU officer Lucia Morgan and former gang member who double crossed the gang, Dean (who wanted revenge when Skull Cross murdered his family). The four succeed, and are able to rid Metro City of the criminals. Metro City is left in shambles, but <b>Guy</b> <b>does</b> not seem to care, and leaves that to Haggar.|$|E

He said, [...] "I'm reaching out to everyone I possibly can to get every side of the story." [...] Carter {{said that he was}} remaining neutral about the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. [...] "I obviously have to reach out to all sides", he said. [...] "For the longest time, I personally tried to watch as many episodes of all the shows as I could to get sense of each show, and what each <b>guy</b> <b>does.</b> I don't just pick one and stick with that guy." [...] Carter researched the impact of financial decision-making on the controversy. He said he had known Leno for a long time, and O'Brien since he began working for NBC, and that these connections gave him the benefit of familiarity.|$|E

Woods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open, where he struggled the first day but ultimately claimed a dramatic sudden death victory over Rocco Mediate that followed an 18 hole playoff, after which Mediate said, [...] "This <b>guy</b> <b>does</b> things that are just not normal {{by any stretch of the}} imagination," [...] and Kenny Perry added, [...] "He beat everybody on one leg." [...] Two days later, Woods announced that he would miss the remainder of the season due to additional knee surgery, and that his knee was more severely damaged than previously revealed, prompting even greater praise for his U.S. Open performance. Woods called it [...] "my greatest ever championship." [...] In Woods' absence, TV ratings for the remainder of the season suffered a huge decline from 2007.|$|E

500|$|Sports journalists Damien Cox and Stephen Brunt {{wrote about}} Bure during the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs {{that he was}} a [...] "two-way dynamo," [...] {{accounting}} for [...] "several bodychecks he handed out on the night" [...] and for his defensive abilities as he stayed on the ice in the last minutes of a one-goal playoff match against the Toronto Maple Leafs. They spoke highly of his creativity as well, recognizing him as [...] "someone who sees in his game a world of possibilities that just never occur to others," [...] praising his [...] "sheer elegance and imagination" [...] and characterizing his hockey sense as [...] "ho-hum brilliance from the most explosive player in the sport". Brunt called him [...] "a , a van Gogh, a Picasso, a Charlie Parker". During the 1993-94 season, Bure demonstrated his strong playmaking abilities, helping linemate and friend Gino Odjick score a career-high 16 goals in a single season, more than twice the number of goals Odjick would score in any other year separated from Bure, and doubling his career goal totals up to that point in his career. According to teammate Cliff Ronning in 1994, [...] "we play a much sounder game defensively when Pavel's flying, as he was in the first period". Former Canuck teammate Jyrki Lumme spoke of Bure as a player and teammate, [...] "That <b>guy</b> <b>does</b> something spectacular every time ... it's frustrating to go against him in practice because he's all over the place. He makes everybody on our team better." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, June 15, Woods {{began the}} day with another double bogey, and trailed Rocco Mediate by one stroke after 71 holes. He winced after several of his tee shots, and {{sometimes}} {{made an effort to}} keep weight off his left foot. Woods was behind by one stroke when he reached the final hole. Left with a [...] putt for birdie, he sank it to force an 18-hole playoff with Mediate on Monday. Despite leading by as many as three strokes {{at one point in the}} playoff, Woods again dropped back and needed to birdie the 18th to force sudden death with Mediate, and did so. Woods made par on the first sudden-death hole; Mediate subsequently missed his par putt, giving Woods his 14th major championship. After the tournament, Mediate said [...] "This <b>guy</b> <b>does</b> things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination," [...] and Kenny Perry added, [...] "He beat everybody on one leg." [...] His third win in the U.S. Open tied him with Bobby Jones for the career lead in USGA championships won, with nine.|$|E
2500|$|David Lim, a music {{journalist}} and announcer on radio station Joy 94.9, {{wrote in an}} article about the best albums of 2012, [...] "When it comes to the quality of songwriting and vocal performance, this is hands down the best Guy Sebastian album yet. [...] Armageddon feels like a mature, universal pop album that would appeal to young and old, broken and fulfilled alike." [...] In earlier reviews for the singles he said [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy" [...] was [...] "feel good, sun-soaked and universally appealing", and described Battle Scars as a [...] "massive bruised ballad with a titan hook that just beats you down with no mercy." [...] Lim wrote of [...] "Get Along", [...] "The emotive political ballad 'Get Along' is possibly the best single Sebastian has ever released. I just can't get over how great his observant lyrics about religious wars are. The hook - 'Dear God, dear soul, dear Mary, Mohammed... can we all just get along?' - absolutely rips right through the heart. Music site auspOp gave positive reviews for all the released singles. They said [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy" [...] was [...] "bright as sunshine" [...] and of [...] "Gold" [...] they wrote, [...] "This new tune is precisely what <b>Guy</b> <b>does</b> best - oozing with class and old school soul. 'Gold' sounds like it could have been ripped straight from the streets of 1960s Detroit, what with its flashy brass, gorgeous gospel chorus and Guy's insane pitch-perfect vocal. They named [...] "Battle Scars" [...] {{as one of the best}} singles of the year, with [...] "stunning, crystal-clear, pitch-perfect vocals" [...] calling it [...] "superb home-grown pop". In a review for [...] "Get Along" [...] they wrote, [...] "This one is designed to get you thinking. To tap into your emotions. 'Get Along' is a song about hope, peace and understanding and a dream that perhaps one day we'll all be united, together as one people, one world, despite our differences in opinion, religion, creed and race.
