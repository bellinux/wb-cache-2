5|$|During a CNR hockey tournament held in December 1922 in Montreal, Morenz scored nine {{goals in}} a game for Stratford. A friend of Léo Dandurand, {{the owner of the}} Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, {{refereed}} the game and told Dandurand how good Morenz was. Dandurand went to Stratford in January 1923 to watch Morenz play, and <b>decided</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> sign him to the Canadiens. In April he met with William Morenz, because at the age of 20, Howie was still legally a minor.

However, in July Dandurand learned that Morenz and his father had been in contact with the Toronto St. Patricks, a rival team in the NHL. Fearing that Morenz would sign in Toronto, Dandurand sent his friend, Cecil Hart, to Stratford with instructions to sign Morenz at any cost.

On March 22, 1990, Shero was elected into the Flyers' Hall of Fame. Eight months later on November 24, Shero died at Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. He was 65.|$|E

Giancana was banned from the state of Nevada, but Sinatra continued to allow him to stay at the lodge which resulted in Sanicola seeking to remove himself as a shareholder. Although Sinatra sought to explain that Giancana was only visiting his girlfriend, Phyllis McGuire, the disagreement resulted in the end of Sinatra and Sanicola's friendship. After Giancana was spotted on the premises, Sinatra had his gambling license removed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

The Cal Neva Lodge was leased to Jack L. Warner in a deal which also saw a majority stake in Reprise Records sold to Warner Bros.
