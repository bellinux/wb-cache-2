5|$|At 6:35pm, as {{many workers}} in the city were {{finishing}} their shifts, the alarm was sounded to gather the troops of the 5th and 6th Regiments. This {{was the first time}} such an alarm had been used in the city, and it caused a great deal of excitement, and attracted yet more citizens <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> to witness events.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} and property owners {{contributed to the}} development of the city, and many families and individuals are remembered in street names. Streets laid out when Utica was a village had more irregularities than those built later in the 19th and 20thcenturies. As a result of the city's location (adjacent to the Mohawk River), many streets parallel the river, so they do not run strictly east-west or north–south. Remnants of Utica's early electric-rail systems can be seen in the West and South neighborhoods, where the rails were set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Grace dropped heavy rainfall across central Indiana, including a record one-day total of 7inches (178mm) in Indianapolis, while other locations received over 9inches (228mm). Residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks, though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes. The rapid rainfall in Indianapolis backed up the sewage system, sending {{hundreds of millions of}} gallons of sewage <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Following the deluge in the state, the governor {{declared a state of emergency}} for the state. Eight local American Red Cross chapters arrived to provide meals and aid to the affected people.|$|E

5|$|On March 17, Campbell {{appeared}} at the Montreal Forum for the Canadiens' first game after Richard's suspension. His presence provoked a riot at the Forum that spilled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> The riot caused an estimated $100,000 in property damage, thirty-seven injuries, and 100 arrests. Tensions eased after Richard made a personal plea accepting his punishment and promising to return the following year to help the team win the Stanley Cup. The incident likely cost Richard the 1954–55 scoring title (an honour Richard never achieved in his NHL career) and {{played a role in}} the off-season departure of longtime Canadiens head coach Dick Irvin.|$|E
5|$|As the War of the Fourth Coalition {{broke out}} in September 1806, Emperor Napoleon I took his Grande Armée {{into the heart of}} Germany in a memorable {{campaign}} against Prussia. Comprising the same regiments as the year before (1st and 2nd Carabiniers-à-Cheval, 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 12th cuirassiers), Nansouty's 1st heavy cavalry division was again a part of Joachim Murat's cavalry reserve. At first, due to the extraordinary speed of Napoleon's operations, the 1st heavy cavalry division and one of the two cuirassier brigades of d'Hautpoul's 2nd heavy cavalry division did not arrive at the front line in time to participate in the Battle of Jena. Beginning with the evening of 14 October, Nansouty's cavalry pursued the routed Prussian army, following an enemy corps of 10,000 infantrymen and 3 cavalry regiments <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Erfurt on 15 October. With the enemy trapped in the city, Colonel Préval of the 3rd cuirassiers negotiated the capitulation of Erfurt by nightfall, which resulted in the capture of 12,000 prisoners of war (including 6,000 wounded) and 65 cannons.|$|E
5|$|In Florida, the {{hurricane}} produced hurricane-force gusts from Miami Beach to Saint Augustine. The {{majority of the}} state experienced sustained winds of at least 50mph (85km/h). The strongest winds of 100-126mph (161-203km/h) were observed in the Lake Okeechobee region, while unofficial wind gusts reached 160mph (260km/h) at Stuart. Additionally, Vero Beach reported sustained winds of 97mph (156km/h) and peak gusts of 110mph (177km/h). The minimum central pressure near Lake Okeechobee was 956mbar (28.24inHg) at Canal Point. Palm Beach, Jupiter, and Stuart experienced the most severe damage from the storm in south Florida; hundreds of homes, apartment buildings, stores, and warehouse buildings lost roofs and windows. Interior furnishings were blown through broken glass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Overall, the storm caused two deaths and $52million in damage, mostly in Florida.|$|E

5|$|Parma made {{no effort}} to {{restrain}} his soldiers. On their rampage through the city, Italian and Spanish soldiers slaughtered the rest of the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Once their blood-lust was satiated, they began to plunder. Civilians who had taken refuge in the churches were initially ignored, but when the fire started, they were forced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> and trapped by the rampaging soldiers. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes smoldering, or in flames, trying to escape the conflagration, only to be trapped by the enraged Spanish; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they were cornered by the enraged Italians. Parma wrote to King Philip that over 4000lay dead in the ditches (moats). English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only eight buildings remained standing.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg reached Ragusa on 24 August 1461 {{along with}} the Pal Engjëlli, the Archbishop of Durrës. His men stayed on the ships {{anchored}} in the harbor while {{he went into the}} city. Due to papal pressure, the Ragusans had reconsidered Skanderbeg's requests. His fame was visible when he walked through the city-gates and the population poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> to see him. He had been greeted with a ceremony and a tour of the city inspecting its walls and weaponry. He then received the financial sum he had come for. His men were also supplied with food for their coming campaign. His popularity allowed him to be well-kept by the Ragusans where the largest Albanian community outside of Albania was present. On 29 August 1461, Skanderbeg set off for Apulia, but a storm forced him to anchor off a Dalmatian island. On 3 September 1461, Skanderbeg finally reached Barletta.|$|E
5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E
5000|$|Later, Ray {{claimed that}} Crawford, during a rage, drunkenly threw McCambridge's costumes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Crawford later laughingly {{admitted}} she had thrown McCambridge's own clothing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Ray also said of that time, [...] "Joan was drinking {{a lot and}} she liked to fight," [...] but that she was also [...] "very attractive, with a basic decency." ...|$|R

5|$|Throughout Mexico, {{the floods}} {{killed at least}} 379people, {{according}} to the federal government, and as many as 600 according to relief agencies; the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters later estimated there were 636deaths, and damage in Mexico was estimated at $451.3million (4.3billion pesos). Nationwide, the floods damaged or destroyed 90,000houses, which left about 500,000people homeless. Flooding caused thousands of landslides, many in more populated areas than the flooding in 1944. The floods also caused 39rivers to overflow, and the combination of floods and landslides destroyed bridges, houses, widespread crop fields, schools, and electrical networks. Impact was worst in Puebla, where damage totaled $240million (2.1billion pesos) and many roads were washed out. Landslides in the state killed 107people in Teziutlán. Elsewhere in the country, the floods washed crocodiles <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Villahermosa, the capital of Tabasco, and in Oaxaca, the rainfall occurred after an earthquake left thousands homeless. Flooding also extended into Central America in late September through early October, causing $40million (385million pesos) in crop damage and 70deaths.|$|E
5|$|Always in {{the thick}} of the action during this campaign, on 24 February, Nansouty was present near the city of Troyes. Negotiations for an {{armistice}} were ongoing in a village nearby and, despite formal orders to continue the fighting, the two armies had ceased the combat. Nansouty then took his men and attacked enemy troops, charging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of the village where the negotiations were taking place. The French envoy to the armistice talks, Monsieur de Flahaut saw this development and found Nansouty, bitterly protesting against the latter's action. Nansouty responded that the Emperor was doubtlessly aware that negotiations were indeed taking place there, but that he had orders to capture the position without further delay. On 27 February, the Emperor again moved against Blücher's Prussians, leaving a part of his forces near Troyes to observe the movement of Prince of Schwarzenberg's Austrian army. Nansouty, with the Guard cavalry, accompanied the Emperor, ensuring his protection and clearing his way after a bloody cavalry skirmish at Château-Thierry on 3 March. Another cavalry skirmish occurred on 5 March, with Nansouty repulsing a numerous enemy cavalry, 3,000-4,000 troopers, and capturing the bridge of Berry-au-Bac, over the Aisne, despite the enemy cannonade. Once across the Aisne with a few Polish lancer platoons, Nansouty launched a heroic pursuit, capturing enemy cannons and munitions, and taking a significant number of prisoners, among whom was the teenage Russian Prince Gagarin.|$|E
5|$|De Launay {{had limited}} options: if he allowed the Revolutionaries to destroy his main gate, {{he would have}} to turn the cannon {{directly}} inside the Bastille's courtyard on the crowds, causing great loss of life and preventing any peaceful resolution of the episode. De Launay could not withstand a long siege, and he was dissuaded by his officers from committing mass suicide by detonating his supplies of powder. Instead, de Launay attempted to negotiate a surrender, threatening to blow up the Bastille if his demands were not met. In the midst of this attempt, the Bastille's drawbridge suddenly came down and the revolutionary crowd stormed in. De Launay was dragged outside <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> and killed by the crowd, and three officers and three soldiers were killed {{during the course of the}} afternoon by the crowd. The soldiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment, however, were not wearing their uniform coats and were mistaken for Bastille prisoners; they were left unharmed by the crowds until they were escorted away by French Guards and other regular soldiers among the attackers. The valuable powder and guns were seized and a search begun for the other prisoners in the Bastille.|$|E

5|$|With {{its ranks}} {{replenished}} after the winter actions, the six-regiment division under Nansouty numbered, on 1 June 1807, {{no less than}} 3,257 men. It {{was by far the}} most powerful heavy cavalry division of the Cavalry Reserve, which then included two other such divisions, the 2nd under Saint-Sulpice and a newly added 3rd, under Espagne. As military operation resumed later in 1807, Nasouty's division was hastily directed towards the town of Deppen, where Marshal Michel Ney had managed to retreat with his Corps, after energetically extricating himself from a dangerous situation, with surprisingly few losses. With Ney's Corps, the Cavalry Reserve and the Guard, Napoleon moved towards Guttstadt, where on 9 June he found a large combined-arms enemy force. Murat took Lasalle's light horse and Nansouty's heavy cavalry and launched a series of charges that drove back the enemy force. Murat continued to press on and pushed the enemy <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Guttstadt, where he penetrated with the cavalry at nightfall. Having fought well with his men, Nansouty was rested the next day, leaving all the action at the Battle of Heilsberg to Espagne's 3rd Heavy Cavalry division.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March Kossuth gave a fiery {{speech in}} the Hungarian Diet, calling for a constitution. It was not until 10 March that Metternich {{appeared}} concerned about events in Vienna, where there were now threats and counter-threats flying. Two petitions were organised, calling for greater freedom, transparency, and representation. Students were involved in several demonstrations, culminating on 13 March when they cheered the royal family but voiced anger at Metternich. After a customary morning, Metternich was called to meet with Archduke Ludwig soon after midday. The Chancellor had troops sent <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> while also announcing a prearranged and minimal concession. In the afternoon the crowd turned hostile, and a division of troops opened fire on it, killing five. The mob was now truly incited, as the liberals were joined by underprivileged Viennese set on wreaking havoc. The students offered to form a pro-government Academic Legion if their demands were met. Ludwig was eager to accept and told Metternich he must resign, to which he reluctantly agreed. After sleeping in the Chancellery he was advised to either take back his resignation or leave the city. After Ludwig sent him {{a message to the}} effect that the government could not guarantee his safety, Metternich left for the house of Count Taaffe and then, with aid from friends Charles von Hügel and Johann Rechberg, reached the family seat of Prince Liechtenstein forty miles away at Feldsberg. Metternich's daughter Leontine joined them on 21 March and suggested England as a haven; agreeing, Metternich, Melanie and 19-year-old Richard set out, leaving the younger children with Leontine. Metternich's resignation had been met with cheering in Vienna, and even the Viennese commoners welcomed the end of Metternich's era of social conservatism.|$|E
