25|$|On Senior Day, Brad Banks was {{a perfect}} 10-for-10 for 197 yards and three touchdowns. He also scored on two of Iowa's four rushing touchdowns. Iowa's {{receivers}} were busy as Mo Brown, Dallas Clark and C.J. Jones all had touchdowns. Freshman wideout Ed Hinkel even got <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action,</b> scoring on a 58-yard punt return. Running back Fred Russell returned from a hand injury, and ran for 100 yards in becoming Iowa's 10th player to have a 1,000-yard rushing season. Iowa's victory tied a school record for wins in a season at 10.|$|E
25|$|One Ranger, seventeen-year-old , {{who wanted}} to be <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action,</b> also died in the fighting. He was the son of camp cook, D. R.

Smith was apparently too inexperienced to fully appreciate McNelly's terse orders because he got too close to a wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith even knew what was happening. Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen.|$|E

2500|$|The clothes worn on Miami Vice had a {{significant}} influence on men's fashion. They popularized, if not invented, the [...] "T-shirt under Armani jacket"–style, and popularized Italian men's fashion in the United States. Don Johnson's typical attire of Italian sport coat, T-shirt, white linen pants, and slip-on sockless loafers became a hit. Even fine timepiece manufacturers got <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> Crockett initially wore an 18k Rolex Day-Date [...] "President" [...] model in the first season, until Ebel won the contract for the remaining seasons. Similarly, Crockett's perpetually unshaven appearance sparked a minor fashion trend, inspiring men to wear {{a small amount of}} beard stubble, also known as a five o'clock shadow (or [...] "designer stubble") at all times. In an average episode, Crockett and Tubbs wore five to eight outfits, appearing in shades of pink, blue, green, peach, fuchsia, and the show's other [...] "approved" [...] colors. Designers such as Vittorio Ricci, Gianni Versace, and Hugo Boss were consulted in keeping the male leads looking trendy. Costume designer Bambi Breakstone, who traveled to Milan, Paris, and London in search of new clothes, said that, [...] "The concept of the show is to be on top of all the latest fashion trends in Europe." [...] Jodi Tillen, the costume designer for the first season, along with Michael Mann, set the style. The abundance of pastel colors on the show reflected Miami's Art-deco architecture.|$|E

His colleagues had anticipated that the Americans would give them an aircraft so that Khiêm could return to Vietnam, but second thoughts arose among Taylor and Westmoreland.

The U.S. wanted Khánh out, but were worried that Phát and Thảo could galvanize support for the beleaguered Khánh through their extremely divisive pro-Diêm views, which had the potential to provoke large-scale sectarian divisions in South Vietnam. The Marine Brigade commander, General Lê Nguyên Khang, appealed to the US Embassy in Saigon to not allow Khiêm to depart the U.S. As a result of this, Taylor messaged the State Department that [...] "Regardless what ultimate outcome may be we feel Khiêm's arrival here ... would only add tinder to what this evening appears to be very explosive situation with possibilities of internecine strife between armed forces units ...

40|$|Abstract. The {{production}} of native �/ � tubulin heterodimer <b>in</b> vitro depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> of cytosolic chaperonin and several protein cofactors.

However, this set of cofactors generates native heterodimers only very inefficiently from �-tubulin folding intermediates produced by the same chaperonin. Here we describe the isolation, characterization, and genetic analysis of a novel tubulin folding cofactor (cofactor B) that greatly enhances the efficiency of �-tubulin folding in vitro.
