She used hip hop for a [...] "broader sound" [...] {{and looked to}} bring soul singing back, stating, [...] "I used {{a lot of the}} brassiness and grittiness <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> that people hear in my live performances, but not necessarily on my records." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} The Huffington Post, and Kevin O'Donnell of Spin magazine, noted that [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] {{features}} shout vocals and raw chanting.

[...] Kathy McCabe of Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph likened [...] "Run the World" [...] to [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and [...] "Diva" [...] (2009). Johnston Breihan of The Village Voice compared [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] to schoolyard chants, due to its [...] "cheer-team beats" [...] and the repetitive use of the word [...] "Girls".

500|$|... "1+1" [...] is a downtempo R {{and soul}} music power ballad with {{influences}} of indie rock music. The song features [...] "a soft, almost non-existent" [...] backing beat and {{makes use of}} a guitar and a piano as its foundation, while wind chimes, sprinkling strings, synthesizers, funk-influenced bass and a pipe organ are also present. [...] "1+1" [...] is set in 12/8 time with a slow tempo of 50 beats per minute and {{was written in the}} key of G major. Beyoncé's voice spans from the low note of F#3 to the high note of C6. [...] "1+1" [...] essentially demonstrates her [...] "urgent" [...] and [...] "raw" [...] vocals; in an interview with Ray Rogers of Billboard magazine, Beyoncé stated that she wanted to use her album 4 to showcase this side of her vocal abilities: [...] "I used a lot of the brassiness and grittiness <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice</b> that people hear in my live performances, but not necessarily on my records." [...] Nadine Cheung wrote that the subtle instrumentation allows Beyoncé'ss voice to emphasise the emotional lyrics Amos Barshad of New York magazine and Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media described the vocals as similar to those of Whitney Houston's work.|$|E

Five major themes emerged from a qualitative case study regarding parents and the resources and supports they received through the course of their child's participation <b>in</b> Project <b>MY</b> <b>VOICE</b> (Multi-Media for Youth Voicing Outcomes Individually Created for Empowerment). Parents were surveyed and interviewed with regards to what supports and resources they received {{as a result of their}} son or daughter participating <b>in</b> Project <b>MY</b> <b>VOICE,</b> and how these supports and resources related to their child's self-determination and post-secondary transition planning activities. The findings suggest that the primary resource parents believe they received was the culminating presentation <b>in</b> Project <b>MY</b> <b>VOICE.</b> Parents expressed the positive impact that Project <b>MY</b> <b>VOICE</b> had on their child's self-determination and transition planning. Data also indicated parent satisfaction with their level of involvement, but indicated a need for improved communication methods throughout the project...|$|R
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice.</b> I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, so by the time we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If you touch a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time in her career, Gomez was given full {{creative}} control following her signing with Interscope Records. She expressed frustration and constraint with the songs chosen for her earlier in her career, and felt a disconnect from the music both personally and professionally. During the creation of Revival, the singer emphasized the importance of creating a distinct sound for herself, telling Nolan Feeney of Time that [...] "there were times in my career where I sang things that just weren’t me and weren’t for me. You can hear it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice.</b> You can hear it when it’s inauthentic." [...] Gomez aimed to create autobiographical songs which shared personal stories, whether or not she wrote them. Citing the therapeutic process of writing [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants" [...] for her greatest hits album For You (2014), the singer was inspired to separate herself from her peers and convert personal experiences into the music of Revival. For [...] "Sober", Gomez focused on using her unique vocal tone and abilities as an actress to translate feelings and emotions through her music. The singer also told producers to focus primarily on the lyrics and vocals, referencing albums of her youth that dealt with themes of growing up in the spotlight, particularly Christina Aguilera's album Stripped (2002).|$|E
2500|$|When {{he wrote}} [...] "This Town Ain't Big Enough For Both of Us", Ron could only play {{it in that}} key. It was so much work to {{transpose}} the song and one of us had to budge, so I made the adjustment to fit <b>in.</b> <b>My</b> <b>voice</b> ain't a [...] "rock" [...] voice. It's not soulful, in the traditional rock way; It's not about [...] "guts". It's untrained, unschooled, I never questioned why I was singing high. It just happened, dictated by the songs. Ron has always written Sparks' lyrics and never transposed them into a rock key for me to sing. He always packed each line with words and I had to sing them as they were.|$|E

You can hear it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>voice,</b> I sound all gritty. It’s because I was vaping for a week." [...] "Warm Blood" [...] was produced by Rostam Batmanglij and co-written with Tino Zolfo and Joe Cruz.
