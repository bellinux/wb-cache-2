25|$|An {{important}} {{concept for}} insulating fluids is the static relaxation time. This {{is similar to}} the time constant τ (tau) within an RC circuit. For insulating materials, it is the ratio of the static dielectric constant divided by the electrical conductivity of the material. For hydrocarbon fluids, this is sometimes approximated by dividing the number 18 by the electrical conductivity of the fluid. Thus a fluid that has an electrical conductivity of 1 pS/m has an estimated relaxation time of about 18 seconds. The excess charge in a fluid dissipates almost completely after <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> the relaxation time, or 90 seconds for the fluid in the above example.|$|E

30|$|Methods for {{organizing}} functional materials at the nanometer scale {{are essential for}} the development of novel fabrication techniques. One of the most relevant areas of research in nanobiotechnology concerns technological utilization of self-assembly systems, wherein molecules spontaneously associate into reproducible supramolecular structures. For this purpose, the laccase of Bacillus halodurans C- 125 was immobilized on the S-layer lattice formed by SbpA of Lysinibacillus sphaericus CCM 2177 either by (i) covalent linkage of the enzyme to the natural protein self-assembly system or (ii) by construction of a fusion protein comprising the S-layer protein and the laccase. The laccase and the S-layer fusion protein were produced heterologously in Escherichia coli. After isolation and purification, the properties of the proteins, as well as the specific activity of the enzyme moiety, were investigated. Interestingly, the S-layer part confers a much higher solubility on the laccase as observed for the sole enzyme. Comparative spectrophotometric measurements of the enzyme activity revealed similar but significantly higher values for rLac and rSbpA/Lac in solution compared to the immobilized state. However, rLac covalently linked to the SbpA monolayer yielded a <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>time</b> higher enzymatic activity than rSbpA/Lac immobilized on a solid support. Combined quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and electrochemical measurements (performed in an electrochemical QCM-D cell) revealed that rLac immobilized on the SbpA lattice had an approximately twofold higher enzymatic activity compared to that obtained with the fusion protein.|$|R

Among children with one kidney, there are approximately twice as many males, whereas among children with three kidneys there are approximately 2.5 times more females. The same pattern is observed among infants with excessive number of ribs, vertebrae, teeth and other organs which in a process of evolution have undergone reduction—among them there are more females. Contrarily, among the infants with their scarcity, there are more males. Anencephaly is shown to occur approximately twice as frequently in females. The number of boys born with 6 fingers is two times higher than the number of girls. Now various techniques are available to detect congenital anomalies in fetus before birth.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens prompted a microbiological study of fluoroquinolone structure-activity relationships with resistant mutants. Bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities for 12 fluoroquinolones were examined with a gyrase mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis and a gyrase-topoisomerase IV double mutant of Staphylococcus aureus. For both organisms C- 8 halogen and C- 8 methoxy groups enhanced activity. The MIC at which 99 % of the isolates tested were inhibited (MIC 99) was reduced three- to fivefold for the M. smegmatis mutant and seven- to eightfold for the S. aureus mutant by C- 8 bromine, chlorine, and methoxy groups. With both organisms a smaller {{reduction in the}} MIC 99 (two- to threefold) {{was associated with a}} C- 8 fluorine moiety. In most comparisons with M. smegmatis the response to a C- 8 substituent was similar (within twofold) for wild-type and mutant cells. In contrast, mutant S. aureus was affected more than the wild type by the addition of a C- 8 substituent. C- 8 halogen and methoxy groups also improved the ability to kill the two mutants and the respective wild-type cells when measured with various fluoroquinolone concentrations during an incubation period equivalent <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> doubling <b>times.</b> Collectively these data help define a group of fluoroquinolones that can serve (i) as a base for structure refinement and (ii) as test compounds for slowing the development of fluoroquinolone resistance during infection of vertebrate hosts...|$|R
25|$|Saturation of {{the sample}} with energy applied at the {{resonant}} radiofrequency. This manifests in both CW and pulsed NMR; {{in the first case}} (CW) this happens by using too much continuous power that keeps the upper spin levels completely populated; in the second case (pulsed), each pulse (that is at least a 90° pulse) leaves the sample saturated, and <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> the (longitudinal) relaxation time (5T1) must pass before the next pulse or pulse sequence can be applied. For single pulse experiments, shorter RF pulses that tip the magnetization by less than 90° can be used, which loses some intensity of the signal, but allows for shorter recycle delays. The optimum there is called an Ernst angle, after the Nobel laureate. Especially in solid state NMR, or in samples with very few nuclei with spins greater than zero, (diamond with the natural 1% of carbon-13 is especially troublesome here) the longitudinal relaxation times can be on the range of hours, while for proton-NMR they are more on the range of one second.|$|E

50|$|Comfrey is {{a fast-growing}} plant, {{producing}} {{huge amounts of}} leaf during the growing season, and hence is very nitrogen hungry.

It is said that the best time to cut comfrey is shortly before flowering, for this is when it is at its most potent in terms of the nutrients that it offers. Comfrey can continue growing into mid-autumn, but it is not advisable to continue taking cuttings after early autumn in order to allow the plants to build up winter reserves. After the growing season, leaving comfrey beds fallow may deliver higher yields in future harvests, as the plant builds up energy reserves in its roots.|$|R

Half of the singers were given water to drink and short duration of vocal rests at regular intervals during singing and the other half sang continuously without taking any water or rest. The subjects who were given hydration and vocal rests sang significantly longer {{than those who did not}} take any water or rest. The voice quality, as measured by perceptual and acoustic measures, and vocal function, as measured by phonetogram, did not show any significant changes during singing in the subjects who were given water and rest during the singing. However, subjects who sang continuously without drinking water and taking rests showed significant changes in the jitter measure and the highest pitch they could produce during singing. These results suggest that hydration and vocal rests are useful strategies to preserve voice function and quality during karaoke singing.

500|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} prefer {{to swim in}} waters of [...] Their daily {{movement}} {{is influenced by the}} tides; one tracking study showed that they are more active during high tides. Uniquely among rays they dig with their snouts in the sand, surrounding themselves in a cloud of sand that spews from their gills. They also exhibit two motions in which the abdomen and the pectoral fins are moved rapidly up and down: the pelvic thrust and the extreme pelvic thrust. The pelvic thrust is usually performed by a solitary ray, and repeated <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>times</b> rapidly. The extreme pelvic thrust is most commonly observed when the ray is swimming in a group, from which it will separate itself before vigorously thrusting with its pectoral fins. The rays also performs dips and jumps; in a dip the ray will dive and then come back up rapidly, perhaps as many as five times consecutively. There are two main types of jump: in one, the ray propels itself vertically out of the water, to which it returns along the same line; the other is when the ray leaps at a 45degree angle, often repeated multiple times at high speeds. When in shallow waters or outside their normal swimming areas the rays are most commonly seen alone, but they do also congregate in schools. One form of traveling is called loose aggregation, which is when three to sixteen rays are swimming in a loose group, with occasional interactions between them. A school commonly consists of six or more rays swimming in the same direction at exactly the same speed.|$|E

40|$|This masters thesis {{presents}} a possible solution for deepwater model testing of floating production units (FPU) in ocean basins, and investigates {{some aspects of}} the method. At present, the existing ocean basins have a maximum water depth of around 10 meters. Since typical model scales are between 1 : 30 and 1 : 100, the maximum depth using conventional model scales is around 1000 meters. Today, deepwater model testing in ocean basins are limited to ultra small scale modelling, and truncated modelling. In ultra small scale testing, both the FPU, mooring lines and risers are scaled to fit the available basin depth. However, ultra small scales tends to increase the uncertainties regarding the results, and it becomes increasingly difficult to accurately make a small model as the tolerances are reduced. In a truncated model test, a smaller scale factor is used. In practice, this means that the scaled system will go deeper than the available ocean basin depth, and the lines are thus truncated at the ocean basin bottom. The experimental results are then used to calibrate a numerical model of the system which is then used to simulate the total scaled system. Since the final results rely on a numerical model, there is a risk that higher order phenomena like green water are not properly simulated. At present, this method is preferred by SINTEF MARINTEK. The method presented in this thesis is a hybrid method that combines a scaled physical model of the FPU and a scaled numerical model of the mooring lines and risers in a real time experiment. The numerical model will receive real time information about the motions and velocities of the FPU model, and calculate the corresponding mooring line and riser forces. The resultant force from the mooring lines and risers are then passed to a controller that actuates the forces on to the FPU model using a set of lines. In order for this method to work, it is important that both the numerical code and the actuator can work in real time at a frequency resolution that can properly replicate the mooring lines and risers. The method can be called a semi-coupled method as it takes into account the forces from the mooring lines without iterating the forces and responses to dynamic equilibrium in each step. There are mainly two advantages of using a numerical model of the mooring lines. First and foremost, the depth of the ocean basin is no longer a limitation for the choice of model scale. This means that larger models can be used, and thus decreasing the uncertainties related to small scales. Secondly, the viscous forces on the numerical model can be correctly modelled as the drag coefficients can be manually set. In order to assess the active hybrid model testing (AHMT) method, the method have been divided into two parts: 1. A simulator for the vessel will send displacement data to RIFLEX that simulates the lines. The forces obtained in RIFLEX will then be passed back to the simulator and taken into account. 2. Make a controller that can actuate a reference force on an object that moves. The controller will measure the actual forces applied, and correct itself onto the reference force. The last part is treated in MSc. Student Kristian Dahl's masters thesis, and the first part is assessed in this thesis. In order to assess the system, two cases of a barge moored at 1000 meters water depth have been studied in scale 1 : 40. The first case is a one degree of freedom (DOF) system of a barge moored free to translate in surge with two mooring lines subjected to a sea state with a significant wave height of 13 meters and a peak period of 13 seconds. The model of the barge is made in JAVA, and the mooring lines is modelled in RIFLEX. The JAVA model and RIFLEX model exchanges data in real time over the network using the high level architecture (HLA) simulation standard, and have been tested at working frequencies at 100 Hz, 67 Hz and 50 Hz. The second case is a six DOF system of a barge moored with four mooring lines subjected to the same sea state as the one DOF system, now directed 45 degrees off from the barge longitudinal direction. The barge is modelled in JAVA, the mooring lines are modelled in RIFLEX, the data exchange is obtained using HLA and the working frequencies are the same as for the one DOF case. The results from both cases where compared to a RIFLEX run with the simulated response as a forced top node motion. The results from this RIFLEX run would be in dynamic equilibrium, and the difference between this force history and the force histories obtained from the HLA run was used to assess the results. From the results, it was seen that the real time calculated forces from RIFLEX delivered close to correct forces regarding the amplitudes of the forces, but had a phase lag of <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> <b>time</b> steps. It was also seen that the JAVA code and RIFLEX could communicate in real time at frequencies higher than 100 Hz, and it was concluded that the real time capabilities of RIFLEX with HLA is feasible for the cases investigated in this thesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Most {{studies of}} avian {{osmoregulation}} have focussed on basic patterns of homeostasis, or osmotically challenging (‘stressful’) situations induced by dehydration, or electrolyte overload or depletion. The focus {{has also been}} on domestic birds or on xeric species that survive without drinking (for a review, see Goldstein and Skadhauge, 2000). To date {{there have been few}} studies examining the water balance and renal function of birds {{at the other end of}} the spectrum – water overload. Nectarivores, for example, must overcome continual digestive and renal challenges. Despite being one of the simplest food resources, nectar shows marked variability in concentration, with average values for plant species ranging from 0. 2 to 2. 9 ·mol·l– 1 sucrose equivalent (or 7 – 70 % w/w; Nicolson, 1998). Nectarivorous birds are therefore faced with a far more extreme range of water load than most birds studied to date. Of necessity, when fed dilute sugar solutions, avian nectarivores have to drink up <b>to</b> <b>four</b> or <b>five</b> <b>times</b> their body mass over just 12 ·h to ingest their requisite energy (Collins, 1981; McWhorter and Martínez del Rio, 1999; Nicolson and Fleming, 2003). In addition to the high preformed water load, nectar is low in electrolytes (Hiebert and Calder, 1983). For nectarivores, the problem may be conservation of electrolytes, rather than electrolyte excess (as examined in most avian osmoregulation studies). On the other hand, when only concentrated nectars are available, nectarivores may struggle to maintain water intake sufficient for physiological requirements. Evaporative losses at high ambient temperatures may outstrip water gain on concentrated nectars (Beuchat et al., 1990; Powers, 1992), requiring birds to resort to water conserving strategies such as torpor (Lasiewski, 1964). Only a handful of studies have examined the water flux and osmoregulation of nectarivorous birds (Beuchat et al., 1990...|$|R
