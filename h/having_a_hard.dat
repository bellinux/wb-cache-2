5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} {{the most urgent}} needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had adopted the German Type UB II design for {{what became known as}} the Austro-Hungarian U-27 class in mid 1915, and had six of that class being built under license in Austria-Hungary by late 1916. In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E

Liz, seeing Jenna miserable, visits Paul and tells her that Jenna misses him. Paul visits Jenna, though not to resume their relationship, instead {{to tell her that}} he {{has come up with a}} brilliant costume for the New Queer's Eve party in which guests dress up as a pop culture phenomenon from the previous year. Unbeknownst to Paul, Jenna also has the same costume idea as his and as a result the two get back together. At the party, Paul dresses like actress Natalie Portman's character in the 2010 movie Black Swan, and Jenna dresses up as former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Lynn Swann.|$|E

When the show starts, Michael and Gabe get into an argument over how high the volume should be. After taking turns raising and lowering the volume, Michael retreats to Gabe's bedroom, hoping that his employees will follow him there. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) has been <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time with getting her daughter CeCe {{to go to sleep}} at night, so Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) picks her up to try to calm her down.

5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher has replaced the troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

25|$|The {{numerous}} {{laws against}} pagans {{seems to have}} had only limited immediate effect in stamping out the old religion. Many people simply conformed outwardly and pretended to become Christian while secretly continuing to practice their beliefs. The numerous laws against apostasy, that had been continuously promulgated since the time of Gratian and Theodosius, is evidence that the emperors were <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time even keeping Christians from going astray.|$|E

25|$|When fruits {{described}} as berries were {{studied in the}} family Melastomaceae, they {{were found to be}} highly variable in structure, some being soft with an endocarp that soon broke down, others <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> persistent endocarp, even woody in some species. Fruits classified as berries are thus not necessarily homologous, with the fleshy part being derived from different parts of the ovary, and with other structural and developmental differences. The presence or absence of berries is not a reliable guide to phylogeny. Indeed, fruit type in general has proved to be an unreliable guide to flowering plant relationships.|$|E
25|$|Although they superficially {{resemble}} {{true lobsters}} {{in terms of}} overall shape and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> carapace and exoskeleton, the two groups are not closely related. Spiny lobsters can be easily distinguished from true lobsters by their very long, thick, spiny antennae, {{by the lack of}} chelae (claws) on the first four pairs of walking legs, although the females of most species have a small claw on the fifth pair, and by a particularly specialized larval phase called phyllosoma. True lobsters have much smaller antennae and claws on the first three pairs of legs, with the first being particularly enlarged.|$|E
25|$|Bogart {{could be}} generous with actors, {{particularly}} those who were blacklisted, down on their luck, or having personal problems. During the filming of the Edward Dmytryk directed The Left Hand of God (1955), he noticed his co-star Gene Tierney <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time remembering her lines and behaving oddly. He coached Tierney, feeding her lines. He was familiar with mental illness from his sister's bouts of depression, and encouraged Tierney to seek treatment. He also stood behind Joan Bennett and insisted on her as his co-star in Michael Curtiz's We're No Angels when an ugly public scandal made her persona non grata with Jack Warner.|$|E

25|$|Jean Grey {{appears as}} a central {{character}} in the animated TV series , voiced by Venus Terzo. She is a popular soccer player and also teaches and trains the mutant students of Xavier Institute. Jean is also a popular athlete of Bayville. She wears a black costume with green accent. Since she is a telepath, she's the one who operates Cerebro aside from Professor Xavier. When humans {{found out about the}} existence of mutants, Jean was accused of using her physic/psionic abilities for things that she successfully accomplished without using her powers, such as playing basketball in school. At one point, Jean lost control of her powers which caused her to be uncontrollably read people's minds telepathically. The X-Men were <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time trying to help her, but luckily Rogue was present and used her own powers to drain enough of Jean's energy for Scott to prompt her to focus on Scott. Jean appears to have a fear of clowns, to which Mesmero uses this to take control of her mind, so she could do the villain's bidding.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{changes in}} the balance of power now {{undermined}} Paget's local supremacy. Mackworth had spent much of 1654 in London {{as a member of the}} Protector's Council but died near the end of the year. The new governor, the younger Humphrey Mackworth, did not wield the same monopoly of power as his father. Under the Rule of the Major-Generals, Shropshire fell into the area governed by the Independent James Berry and he brought to the fore Thomas Hunt, a leading local Presbyterian. Hunt was on good terms with Richard Baxter and they explored ways of opening up the pulpits to fresh preachers. Baxter visited and encouraged John Bryan, who was <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time with a conservative congregation at Holy Cross, the former Shrewsbury Abbey, just to the east of the town. Hunt and Baxter also planned to bring Henry Newcome to Shrewsbury. The congregation of Julian's wanted to secure one of these fresh voices and began to spend considerable sums on improvements to the church, as well as making a direct approach to Newcome. Baxter wrote to Newcome, making clear that Paget's parish was the ultimate target.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} to California Monte {{returned}} to his education. In high school, he was exceeding all standards and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time finding new academic challenges. Instead of graduating high school early, as was suggested by his principal, Monte found an alternative thanks to his father: a study abroad program in East Asia. At the age of 15 Monte traveled to Japan for {{a new chapter in}} his young life, namely to study martial arts and Japanese language. While there he began making money teaching English which helped finance his travels through several Southeast Asian countries. This introduced him to several new cultures, new philosophies, new languages, and in several cases, like his travels through Vietnam (just before the North would defeat the South), new skills that would become immensely valuable in his later life as a soldier. Returning to the United States, he graduated from high school and entered the University of California, Berkeley with Regents Scholarship, majoring in ancient Asian history and Archeology. In 1978 he helped to organize an exhibition of Armenian cultural artifacts at one of the university’s libraries. The section of the exhibit dealing with the 1915-23 genocide was removed by university authorities, {{at the request of the}} Turkish consul general in San Francisco. The display that was removed was eventually reinstalled following a campus protest movement. Monte eventually completed his undergrad work in under three years. Upon graduating, he was accepted into the archeology graduate program at the University of Oxford. However, Monte chose to forgo this opportunity, and instead chose to begin his lifelong struggle for the Armenian Cause.|$|E
