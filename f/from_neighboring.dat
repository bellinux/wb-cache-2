5|$|Oklahoma {{also has}} a rich African American history. Many black towns thrived in the early 20th century because of black {{settlers}} moving <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> states, especially Kansas. The politician Edward P. McCabe encouraged black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory. He discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority-black state.|$|E

5|$|The Mayan {{language}} {{family has}} no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families. Similarities with some languages of Mesoamerica are {{understood to be}} due to diffusion of linguistic traits <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> languages into Mayan and not to common ancestry.

5|$|In September 2003, a {{commercial}} truck delivering propane to customers on the peak knocked down the then-existent KUWZ tower after the vehicle's brakes failed. The {{collapse of the}} tower knocked out power to the mountain for several hours, and while KUWZ borrowed space <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> towers for several months thereafter, the station ultimately relocated its transmitter to nearby Aspen Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{resources}} include peat deposits, {{small quantities}} {{of oil and}} natural gas, granite, dolomite (limestone), marl, chalk, sand, gravel, and clay. About 70% of the radiation <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> Ukraine's 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster entered Belarusian territory, and {{about a fifth of}} Belarusian land (principally farmland and forests in the southeastern regions) was affected by radiation fallout. The United Nations and other agencies have aimed to reduce the level of radiation in affected areas, especially through the use of caesium binders and rapeseed cultivation, which are meant to decrease soil levels of caesium-137.|$|E

5|$|Officials in Delaware and Maryland {{declared}} a state of emergency before the storm struck, and thousands of people from coastal communities evacuated to shelters. Schools closed in Delaware, and non-emergency workers were sent home. Along Long Island in New York, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated their homes, and a state of emergency was declared for several counties. In Connecticut, about 20,000 people evacuated along the coast, and 7,300 evacuated <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> Rhode Island. Residents also evacuated portions of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Opposing the US 24th Infantry at Battle Mountain was the NK 6th Division, {{which had}} been {{engaging}} Task Force Kean since August 5. The division, which had originally numbered 10,000, had suffered 4,000 casualties thus far fighting at the Pusan Perimeter. However it brought in 3,100 South Koreans forcibly conscripted <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> towns to replenish its ranks. The South Koreans fought as ordered, though the North Koreans dispatched rearguard soldiers with them to shoot any who attempted to desert, defect, or surrender.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a rodent in {{the genus}} Oryzomys of family Cricetidae from {{interior}} western Mexico, {{in the states}} of Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Michoacán. First described in 1901 as a separate species, it was later lumped under O.couesi and the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) until it was reinstated as a species in 2009. It differs <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> Oryzomys populations in size and measurements and is a large, brightly colored species with a long tail and robust skull and molars. Its range has been much impacted by agricultural development, but isolated populations are thought to persist.|$|E

5|$|The birds aggressively {{defend their}} nests and {{surrounding}} areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> territories may be summoned by distinct calls {{to join the}} defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that they consider a threat, mockingbirds will at times target humans. The birds are unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted {{in the distribution of}} a warning letter to residents.|$|E
5|$|Violence {{continued}} through {{the last months of}} 2011. In September, a bus carrying Shia pilgrims <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> Karbala Governorate was stopped outside of Ramadi and 22 were executed, prompting threats from Karbala to annex parts of southern Anbar Province, including the city of Nukhayb. In November, the provincial council in Anbar announced that it was considering whether to form a semi-autonomous region with other provinces in the Sunni areas of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|An Israeli {{reserve unit}} {{was called in}} from Tiberias. It arrived after twenty minutes and took {{positions}} around the town. At that point, Samakh (Tzemah) was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> villages. They entrenched in the actual village, which had been abandoned by the residents in April 1948, with British escort. Positions in the village included the police station in the west, the cemetery in the north, the Manshiya neighborhood in the south, and the railway station. The Syrians set up their positions in an abandoned British military base {{just east of the}} village and in an animal quarantine station to the southeast.|$|E

5|$|Central African Republic President David Dacko, Bokassa's cousin, {{took over}} the country in 1960, after winning a power {{struggle}} against Abel Goumba. Bokassa left the French army to join the Central African Republic army in 1962. By 1965, the country was in turmoil—plagued by corruption and slow economic growth, while its borders were breached by rebels <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> countries. Dacko obtained financial aid from the People's Republic of China, {{but in spite of}} this support, the country's problems persisted. Bokassa, now commander-in-chief of the army, made plans to take over the government; Dacko became aware of this, and countered by forming a gendarmerie headed by police chief Jean Izamo, who quickly became Dacko's closest adviser.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the strong}} economy, the Bay Area's housing market {{and cost of}} living is {{becoming}} increasingly expensive. As of 2017, the average income {{needed in order to}} purchase a house in the region was $179,390, while the median price for a house was $895,000. Because of the high cost of living, many workers in the Bay Area live far from their place of employment, contributing to one of the highest percentages of extreme commuters in the United States, or commutes that take over ninety minutes in one direction. For example, about 50,000 people commute <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> San Joaquin county into the nine-county Bay Area daily.|$|E
5|$|From about 200,000 in the 1900 Census, Minneapolis {{soared to}} its highest {{population}} recorded in 1950 of over 521,000 people. The main {{growth of the}} city was in part due to an organized private streetcar system. With 140 million passengers by 1920, the streetcars ran down important roads extending from Downtown Minneapolis. Neighborhood residential development out of the core mostly dates {{around the turn of the}} century as a result of this system. This growth also allowed Minneapolis to annex land <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> villages and townships which subsequently pushed the incorporation of today's inner ring suburbs.|$|E

5|$|Italian {{setbacks}} in Egypt {{and their}} colony of Libya caused Hitler to dispatch aircraft to Sicily, and a blocking force to North Africa. This blocking force was put {{under the command}} of Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel and included the motorized 5th Light Division and the 15th Panzer Division. This force landed at Tripoli on 12February 1941. Upon arrival, Rommel had around 150 tanks, about half PanzerIII and IV. The rest were PanzerI's and IIs, although the Panzer I was soon replaced. On 6April 1941, Germany attacked both Yugoslavia and Greece, with fourteen divisions invading Greece <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> Bulgaria, which by then had joined the Tripartite Pact. The invasion of Yugoslavia included no less than six panzer divisions, which still fielded the PanzerI. Yugoslavia surrendered 17April 1941, and Greece fell on 30April 1941.|$|E
5|$|Khmer differs <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> {{languages}} such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a tonal language. Words {{are stressed}} on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language has been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania {{was ruled}} {{during the early}} 13th century {{by a number of}} dukes and princes {{presiding}} over various fiefdoms and tribes. They were loosely bonded by commonalities of religion and tradition, trade, kinship, joint military campaigns, and the presence of captured prisoners <b>from</b> <b>neighboring</b> areas. Western merchants and missionaries began seeking control of the area during the 12th century, establishing the city of Riga, Latvia in 1201. Their efforts in Lithuania were temporarily halted by defeat at the Battle of Saule in 1236, but armed Christian orders continued to pose a threat. The country had also undergone incursions by the Mongol Empire.|$|E
