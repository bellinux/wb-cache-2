50|$|The {{organization}} of firefighting in Slovenia has many similarities with firefighting in Austria, {{because of the}} historical influence. The emphasis is on volunteer <b>fire</b> <b>departments</b> which are non-profit organization by the law. As of 2008, there are 1295 volunteer <b>fire</b> <b>departments</b> and 68 industrial voluntary <b>fire</b> <b>departments</b> with more than 60,000 voluntary firefighters which represent the backbone of firefighting service in Slovenia. The activity of the volunteer <b>fire</b> <b>departments</b> is financially supported by local community, but <b>fire</b> <b>departments</b> are also allowed to collect private donations.

5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 1900s, the Archville Fire Company was formed in {{neighboring}} Archville, New York, with the company headquarters in a shed on the corner of Albany Post Road (current U.S. Route 9) and Union Street. The company's original equipment consisted of thirty 3½ gallon galvanized buckets, and later a 50-gallon horse-drawn pumper purchased from the Valhalla <b>Fire</b> <b>Department.</b> The company was chartered in 1909 as the Archville <b>Fire</b> <b>Department,</b> with Hubert W. Mannerly as the first fire chief. From then until 1930 the Archville department was autonomous, until Briarcliff Manor requested that Archville provide its fire protection services to Scarborough. In 1930, the Archville department changed its name to the Scarborough Fire Company and became part of the Briarcliff Manor <b>Fire</b> <b>Department,</b> although no contract had been signed and neither party expressed intentions to formalize the arrangement.

By the time he decided to call the <b>fire</b> <b>department,</b> the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it.
