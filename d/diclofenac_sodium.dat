40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{evaluate}} spontaneous pain {{after and}} before administration of <b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac,</b> isolated or associated to carisoprodol, acetaminophen and caffeine, in chronic temporomandibular disorders (TMD) patients. Were selected eighteen volunteers, {{both men and}} women, between 35 - 70 years of age (mean age 50 years). The inclusion criteria was masticatory muscle pain, and the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) was used on the diagnose. The selection of treatment for each individual was done by a triple-blind full-randomized crossover methodology. Thus, all patients were submitted to all treatment at different moments, in a non standardized sequence, avoiding tendentious results. The treatments were: A (<b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac</b> + carisoprodol + acetaminophen + caffeine), B (<b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac)</b> and C (placebo), all associated with an occlusal splint. Each treatment period was followed by an eleven-day washout. There werenÕt observed differences between initial and final values of treatments. However, there were statistically significant differences in evaluative and miscellaneous sensorial groups after B treatment; and in sensorial, affective, and total score groups after B and C treatments. Within the limitations of this investigation, we conclude that treatment of muscular TMD patients with <b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac</b> isolated promoted higher analgesia than treatment with <b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac</b> more associations or placebo, when associated to an occlusal splint...|$|R

Pain relief was also recorded. Eighteen volunteers who had been suffering from chronic pain in masticatory muscles due to temporomandibular disorders were selected after anamnesis and assessment using RDC/TMD translated to Portuguese. The 3 proposed treatments were NSAID (<b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac),</b> panacea (<b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac</b> + carisoprodol + acetaminophen + caffeine), and a placebo. The total treatment duration was 10 days, preceded and succeeded by patients’ pain assessment. A washout interval of 11 days was established between each therapy. All participants received all treatments in different moments, in a full randomized crossover methodology. The assessment of drug therapies was performed using visual analogue scale for pain on palpation followed by 11 -point numerical scale to quantify pain during treatment.

Em cada momento foram estudados 10 animais e os parâmetros analisados foram a evolução clínica, a força de ruptura, estudo histológico e o conteúdo de colágeno tecidual da parede abdominal. Os animais do grupo tratado apresentaram como complicações, deiscência e/ou hérnia incisional, perda ponderal e taxa de mortalidade, complicações estas não evidenciadas no grupo controle. Observamos também neste grupo, diminuição da força de ruptura no 7 ° e 14 ° dia de pós-operatório e diminuição da concentração de colágeno tecidual no 5 °, 7 ° e 14 ° dia de pós-operatório. Ambos os parâmetros retornaram a valores normais no 21 ° dia de pós-operatório. Quanto ao estudo histológico, concluímos que a cicatriz da parede abdominal dos animais tratados com D. S. apresentam retardo do processo cicatricial em relação aos seus controles, caracterizado por uma menor fibrogênese, menor densidade de fibras colágenas, além de um número maior de complicações, como microabscessos, em torno dos fios de sutura. The {{influence of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac</b> on abdominal wound healing was studied in rats. Eighty Wistar rats were randomly allocated to two experimental groups. Group 1 : included 40 rats, submitted to abdominal suture and treated with saline, administered IM; Group 2 : consisted of 40 rats, submitted to abdominal suture and treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac</b> in {{a dose of}} 10 mg/kg of body weight per day during 4 days. Animals of both experimental groups were followed during 21 days after the suture, being killed on the 5 th, 7 th, 14 th and 21 th postoperative day, which corresponded to M 1, M 2, M 3 and M 4 moments. Ten animals from the both experimental groups were studied in each moment, with analysis of the following parameters: clinical state, breaking strength measurements, histology and tissue collagen content of abdominal scar. Several complications were observed in rats of the <b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac</b> group, such as dehiscence, incisional rupture, weight loss, with a significant mortality rate when compared with control rats. In this group, there were no complications. Other alterations were also observed in the <b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac</b> group, such as decreased of breaking strength on the 7 th and 14 th postoperative day and decreased of collagen content on the 5 th, 7 th and 14 th postoperative day, which returns at normal values on the 21 th postoperative day. In histology, animals of the <b>sodium</b> <b>diclofenac</b> group showed a delay in the healing process, such as a significant decreased of fibrogenesis, with decreased density of collagen fibers. Complications such as microabscess arounding the suture material were only observed in this group...|$|R
