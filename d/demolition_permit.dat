5|$|The station depot {{remained}} on its concrete platform when the tracks were torn {{up on the}} old main line. In 1996, workers removed the plaque attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, the plaque was stolen shortly afterward {{and has not been}} recovered. The station depot itself was left in decrepit condition, and in 2006, the village of Harriman's building inspector ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern followed through with a <b>demolition</b> <b>permit</b> and in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front loader. The station remains were taken to a dump in Hillburn, New York.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fire, the synagogue took steps for the possible demolition of the building. The city's Department of Buildings had determined that the remains of the building was unstable, but would not approve an emergency demolition, so a board member filed an application with the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission (LPC) for a general <b>demolition</b> <b>permit,</b> which did not specify how much of the structure was planned to be razed; that will depend on a determination of [...] "structural findings". [...] The synagogue also provided materials to Community Board 3, with a request that their application be heard by an advisory panel. [...] Prior to the fire, Rabbi Mendel Greenbaum had been in discussion with groups such as the Chinese-American Planning Council and the Gotham Organization about selling the building's air rights in connection with the potential development of a neighboring parcel, {{to help pay for the}} possible renovation and preservation of the synagogue. The LPC responded on July 11 with a permit for removal of unsafe parts of the building, but required that other parts be evaluated for possible preservation. The Commission's engineers will monitor the demolition.|$|E
50|$|The May 2005 {{demolition}} was {{the subject}} of significant controversy. Though <b>demolition</b> <b>permits</b> had been denied the city government pressed for the building's destruction nevertheless, stating that the structure was in danger of collapse. Preservation groups fought the demolition with a restraining order a few hours after work commenced, but later that day a judge allowed the demolition to continue. Even though the HDC had originally denied <b>demolition</b> <b>permits</b> they did not oppose the move. The whole structure was gone within a week.|$|R

2500|$|In 1988, {{demolition}} commenced before officials led by then County Supervisor Ed Edelman {{halted the}} work with a stop-work order. [...] Demolition crews {{had already begun to}} dismantle the walls when Edelman, then Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, sheriff's deputies and more than 50 concerned community members showed up at the site to ensure the demolition work was halted.

2500|$|Brown {{was known}} for his shrewd and {{strategic}} use of the details of the planning process to affect and facilitate development projects on his watch. In regards to a parking garage on Vallejo Street desired by North Beach and Chinatown merchants, Brown circumvented neighborhood resident opponents of the garage by ordering demolition of the site's existing structure to commence on a Friday night and be done by Monday morning, when the group was certain to try to obtain a restraining order. [...] "It was with the <b>demolition</b> <b>permit</b> I outsmarted them," [...] Brown recounts proudly, claiming that as the critics rushed toward court, [...] "someone shouted out to them that the building had disappeared over the weekend. They've never recovered from that little maneuver." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} fires in November 2015, December 2015, and July 2016 {{led to a}} {{proposal}} by the city to accelerate the <b>demolition</b> <b>permitting</b> process for the site.

The commission forwarded the nomination and recommendation to the Keeper of the National Register, at which time the file was open for 45 days. During these 45 days, Bisno demolished two buildings. The Keeper returned the nomination asking for additional information.|$|R

At the meeting, the committee voted 4-3 to mark the Armory as a preferred preserved significant building. As a result, there is a 90-day hold on any <b>demolition</b> <b>permits</b> for the building to give time to explore alternate preservation attempts. If no viable alternative proposals come forward during that time frame, there would be nothing to stop demolition of the building.|$|R

50|$|In November 1984, {{the city}} was embroiled in a {{controversy}} around a condominium development proposal, which would have seen three apartment buildings on Eglinton Avenue demolished, while {{the city was}} blocking the developer's application because it represented a significant loss to the city's supply of affordable housing. Although the developer sought and won an Ontario Superior Court decision ordering the city to issue the <b>demolition</b> <b>permits,</b> Campbell was one of 11 councillors, alongside Gilbert, Pantalone, Layton, Reville, Thomas, Rowlands, Dale Martin, Anne Johnston, Ron Kanter and Chris Korwin-Kuczynski, who walked out of council chambers to prevent the meeting from attaining quorum.|$|R
5000|$|These {{laws were}} the Town Planning Act 1991, which gave local {{authorities}} the powers to refuse demolition requests {{on the grounds}} of historical, aesthetic, or cultural significance, and to designate architectural heritage zones; and the Heritage Conservation Act of 1993, which gave the government of the Brussels Capital Region the power to designate buildings to be protected for historic reasons. However, this system had its deficiencies. Whilst the Capital Region government could designate historic buildings, it was the nineteen municipal authorities within it that were responsible for <b>demolition</b> <b>permits.</b> Not until the introduction of a [...] system was this internecine conflict was resolved.|$|R

In a nod to the hotel's creator, Nazimova's experimental 1923 silent film Salomé was shown on a large poolside screen. On August 30, an on-site public auction liquidated all the furnishings, fixtures and equipment, along with odds and ends valuable only as souvenirs. <b>Demolition</b> <b>permits</b> were issued on November 2. Within days, all traces of the hotel were gone and construction of the bank building had begun.|$|R

Instead, the landowner has the option to appeal the permit refusal to the Conservation Review Board for individual properties or the Ontario Municipal Board for properties within a Heritage Conservation District and the appropriate board would make the final decision {{on whether or not}} a <b>demolition</b> <b>permit</b> is issued.

50|$|The denial caused Brian Squires {{to reevaluate}} {{the usage of}} the land, and shortly after that, revised plans to develop a {{retirement}} community appear in 2004. These plans would not see much support causing Brian Squires to hand {{over control of the}} project to the Zubick family. The building was gutted; asbestos, general fixtures and walls were all removed leaving little but a timber frame inside the building. The ghostly innards were used for the film Silent Hill in 2005. Once again a <b>demolition</b> <b>permit</b> was issued for Alma college after more attempts to sell the building are unsuccessful. In 2006 the Municipal Heritage Committee recommended that the <b>demolition</b> <b>permit</b> be denied, that city council prescribe minimum standards for maintenance of the building under section 35.3 of the Ontario Heritage Act. They also recommended that the city seek further financial assistance from the provincial Ministry of Heritage. This report would subsequently be buried by the ministry of culture only to reappear {{under the freedom of information}} act two years later and after the buildings eventual demise. the city denied the <b>demolition</b> <b>permit</b> and the building was placed on the National top ten endangered historic sits in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Dutch {{squatting}} has {{its origins}} in the 1960s when the Netherlands was suffering a housing shortage while many properties stood empty. Property owners kept buildings empty in order to speculate and drive the market price upwards. Squatting {{was seen as an}} anti-speculation political move, rather than a practical one. Property owners often failed to repair buildings in the hope of obtaining <b>demolition</b> <b>permits.</b> Squatting gained legal status under a landmark Supreme Court ruling that the concept of domestic peace (huisvrede, requiring permission from the current occupant to enter a building) also applied to squatters just as to any other occupant. This meant that property owners could only evict squatters by taking them to court.|$|R

Historians and old car enthusiasts opposed the loss of a significant automotive landmark. Ford Land applied for <b>demolition</b> <b>permits,</b> but the permits were denied by Shelby Township. Meanwhile, several old car enthusiasts and members of the Shelby Township Historical Commission banded together to submit proposals to have the Packard Proving Grounds site named as a State of Michigan Historic Site, and to have it added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R

However, the owners ignored the landmark building and by the late 1970s the Wiltern had fallen into thorough disarray. Only the intervention of a group of local preservationists saved the complex from being demolished on two occasions in the late 1970s when the owners filed for <b>demolition</b> <b>permits.</b> (The preservation of the Wiltern was one of the Los Angeles Conservancy's first victories in its fight to preserve the architectural heritage of the City.) ...|$|R
