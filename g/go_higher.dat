5|$|The 2011 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 24 and 25. In the draft, Columbus {{selected}} two players who were projected to <b>go</b> <b>higher</b> in the draft. Boone Jenner, a projected second line center, {{was expected to be}} a first-round selection, but slipped to the second round. Seth Ambroz, a projected third line enforcer, had some believing he would be taken in the second round prior to falling to the fifth. They filled out the other the remainder of their draft with players considered to have a high upside, but in need of time to develop their game. Their final selection, goaltender Anton Forsberg, was taken following the recommendation of Goaltender Coach Ian Clark. Jenner (Canada), third round pick T. J. Tynan (United States), and Forsberg (Sweden) all played for their national teams at the 2012 World Junior Championship.|$|E

Higher notes are {{possible}} but difficult to produce, and rarely called for: orchestral and concert band parts rarely <b>go</b> <b>higher</b> than C5 or D5. Even Stravinsky's famously difficult opening solo in The Rite of Spring only ascends to D5.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} Portadown {{is like that}} {{of much of the}} rest of the UK and Ireland, being a {{temperate}} oceanic climate. It has mild temperatures throughout the year, with summer temperatures not reaching levels to be deemed very hot and winter not very cold. Summer temperatures can reach more than 20°C though it is rare for them to <b>go</b> <b>higher</b> than 30°C (86°F). The consistently humid climate that prevails over Ireland can make these temperatures feel uncomfortable when they stray into the high 20's °C (80–85°F), more so than similar temperatures in hotter climates in the rest of Europe. It also receives a steady amount of rainfall throughout the year.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of writing, a composer must concentrate on voice or instrument range and spacing. Whether it is an instrument or a voice, {{it is important to}} try to not stretch the range of a part higher or lower than an instrument is usually used to. Spacing is also an important aspect of part writing. Voice crossing, which is when a part goes higher or lower than the part that is above and below them, is forbidden in common practice part writing. An example of this would be the soprano part going lower that the alto part. A subset of this rule is voice overlapping, in which instead of crossing in tandem a voice will <b>go</b> <b>higher</b> and lower than their neighbor just was. For example, the soprano going lower than the alto was the beat immediately before it.|$|E
25|$|Florida Section 1008.30 of the Florida statutes, first {{implemented}} in 1992 by the Florida Legislature, required the State Board of Education {{to create and}} implement a common placement-testing program to determine the readiness of students to enter a degree program at any public college or university. In October 2010 the Florida Department of Education's Division of Florida Colleges implemented {{one of the first}} customized college placement tests developed by a team of K-12 and college faculty. The process began in April 2008, when, on the recommendation of the <b>Go</b> <b>Higher</b> Florida! task force and with the support of Commissioner Eric Smith, Florida joined Achieve's American Diploma Project network. In September 2008, as an initial step in aligning high school exit and college entry expectations, the Division of Florida Colleges held a workshop for English/language arts and mathematics K-20 faculty from across the state.|$|E

David Cressy summarised the modern celebration with these words: [...] "The rockets <b>go</b> <b>higher</b> and burn with more colour, but they have less and less to do with memories of the Fifth of November... it might be observed that Guy Fawkes' Day is finally declining, having lost its connection with politics and religion.

500|$|Forty-five {{thousand}} spectators {{came to see}} the Piccards off on October 23, 1934, at 6:51am, {{about two}} hours behind schedule. Jeannette piloted the reconditioned Century of Progress, and the couple took along their pet turtle, Fleur de Lys. After a brief pre-launch ceremony, during which the Piccards received a bouquet from their sons and a small band played The Star-Spangled Banner, they lifted off from Ford Airport, assisted by airmen on the ground who pushed the gondola. Jean changed the flight path and shortened the flight time because of cloudy skies, which reduced the amount of scientific work they were able to do. Jeannette made [...] "unplanned and impulsive maneuvres" [...] and the Piccards failed to make complete records of their actions during the flight. The newspaper alliance had offered to pay them 1,000 if they broke the altitude record, so they jettisoned all of their sandbags, attempting to <b>go</b> <b>higher.</b> They reached [...] or about [...] up, travelled for eight hours on a journey over Lake Erie, and landed about [...] away from Dearborn, near Cadiz, Ohio. She had to choose a landing on elm trees, realizing that meant the Century of Progress would never fly again. The balloon separated from the gondola and was ripped. Jean sustained small fractures to his ribs, left foot, and ankle. According to Jeannette's description in Time magazine: [...] "What a mess! I wanted to land on the White House lawn." ...|$|E

However, its low-light photos {{and some of its}} other modes were panned for not being as good as those of other devices such as the Nokia Lumia 920 and HTC One.
