2500|$|Aqueous <b>film-forming</b> foam (AFFF), used on A and B {{fires and}} for vapor suppression. The {{most common type}} in {{portable}} foam extinguishers. [...] AFFF {{was developed in the}} 1960s under Project Light Water in a joint venture between 3M and the U.S. Navy.

50|$|In the mid-1960s, the US Navy {{developed}} aqueous <b>film-forming</b> foam (AFFF). This synthetic foam has a {{low viscosity}} and spreads rapidly {{across the surface of}} most hydrocarbon fuels. A water film forms beneath the foam, which cools the liquid fuel, stopping the formation of flammable vapors. This provides dramatic fire knockdown, an important factor in crash rescue fire fighting.|$|E
50|$|Emulsifying {{agents are}} {{effective}} at extinguishing fires on small, thin-layer spills of flammable liquids (Class B fires). Such agents encapsulate the fuel in a fuel-water emulsion, thereby trapping the flammable vapors {{in the water}} phase. This emulsion is achieved by applying an aqueous surfactant solution to the fuel through a high-pressure nozzle. Emulsifiers are not effective at extinguishing large fires involving bulk/deep liquid fuels, because the amount of emulsifier agent needed for extinguishment {{is a function of}} the volume of the fuel, whereas other agents such as aqueous <b>film-forming</b> foam (AFFF) need cover only the surface of the fuel to achieve vapor mitigation.|$|E
5000|$|A CH2 group {{connected}} to two vinyl groups {{is said to}} be doubly allylic. The bond dissociation energy of C−H bonds on a doubly allylic centre is about 10% less than the bond dissociation energy of a C−H bond that is allylic. The weakened C−H bonds reflect the high stability of the resulting pentadienyl radicals. Compounds containing the C=C−CH2−C=C linkages, e.g. linoleic acid derivatives, are prone to autoxidation, which can lead to polymerization or form semisolids. This reactivity pattern is fundamental to the <b>film-forming</b> behavior of the [...] "drying oils", which are components of oil paints and varnishes.|$|E
5000|$|Binders can be {{categorized}} according to the mechanisms for film formation. Thermoplastic mechanisms include drying and coalescence. Drying refers to simple evaporation of the solvent or thinner to leave a coherent film behind. Coalescence refers to a mechanism that involves drying followed by actual interpenetration and fusion of formerly discrete particles. Thermoplastic <b>film-forming</b> mechanisms are sometimes described as [...] "thermoplastic cure" [...] {{but that is a}} misnomer because no chemical curing reactions are required to knit the film. Thermosetting mechanisms, on the other hand, are true curing mechanism that involve chemical reaction(s) among the polymers that make up the binder.|$|E
50|$|Stain is {{composed}} of the same three primary ingredients as paint (pigment, solvent (or vehicle), and binder) but is predominantly vehicle, then pigment and/or dye, and lastly {{a small amount of}} binder. Much like the dyeing or staining of fabric, wood stain is designed to add color to the substrate (wood and other materials) while leaving some of the substrate still visible. Transparent varnishes or surface films are applied afterwards. In principle, stains do not provide a durable surface coating or film. However, because the binders are from the same class of <b>film-forming</b> binders that are used in paints and varnishes, some build-up of film occurs.|$|E
50|$|Allyl cyanide is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula CH2CHCH2CN. Like other small alkyl nitriles, allyl cyanide is soluble in organic solvents. Allyl cyanide occurs naturally as an antifeedant {{and is used}} as a cross-linking agent in some polymers. Allyl cyanide was discovered in 1863 by H. Will and W. Koerner in 1863, they found the compound to be present in mustard oil. The first successful synthesis of allyl cyanide was done by A. Claus in 1864. Recent studies show that allyl cyanide may be used as an additive in propylene carbonate-based electrolytes for graphite anodes preventing exfoliation of the anode by <b>film-forming.</b> The underlying mechanism is thought to be a reductive polymerization mechanism.|$|E
50|$|The murumuru {{palm trees}} grow in Brazil {{and around the}} Amazon and {{are one of the}} {{dominant}} trees in this region. It has a thick trunk and a shuttlecock-shaped, bushy crown. The nutritious, edible fruits are an important local food source and materials made from the tree, fruit, and seed kernels are commercially significant to the region. Hammocks are made from the tree’s fibres. Murumuru butter is highly emollient and moisturizing. It is also <b>film-forming</b> and naturally glossy. These qualities make it very protective. It contains vitamins and has a high content of beneficial oleic acid. The oil from the seeds is traditionally used to soften and protect hair. Murumuru butter is the white to yellowish fat obtained from the seeds of the murumuru palm.|$|E
5000|$|Fires are {{classified}} by the proper extinguishing agent. While water {{is used to}} fire Class A fires, using water on a class B fire (such as a grease fire) is extremely dangerous. This is because burning grease is hotter that the boiling point of water (212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius); when water is placed on grease, it creates steam which expands rapidly and splatters, causing burns and spreading the fire). Because of this, Class A fire extinguishers use water, while Class B fire extinguishers use dry chemicals (foam or powder), such as aqueous <b>film-forming</b> foam, multi-purpose dry chemicals such as ammonium phosphate, and halogenated agents (such as Halon 1301 and Halon 1211). [...] or highly pressurized carbon dioxide. Some fire extinguishers contain chemicals designed to fight both Class A and Class B fires.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to produce baths with bubbles simultaneously in {{and on top of}} the water (as in a poured beer), but the combination has not been popular. Mechanical aeration of a foam bath may produce much more foam than is sought—the Internet is replete with first hand accounts and sometimes photographs of such experiences—and many mechanically aerated baths are hot tubs which are shared and not drained between uses and so are desired to be kept free of non-maintenance materials. Mechanically aerated baths for tissue debridement of burn victims typically have added anti-foaming agents to counteract the <b>film-forming</b> properties that some medicinal additives have as a side effect, but the anti-foam is sometimes omitted or reduced for children to give them more of a pleasant distraction during debridement. Bath fizzies that also foam tend to produce disappointingly little foam when allowed to do so from their own fizz, and aeration of the water loses the gas from the fizz.|$|E
5000|$|After being applied, the <b>film-forming</b> {{substances}} in varnishes either harden directly, {{as soon as}} the solvent has fully evaporated, or harden after evaporation of the solvent through curing processes, primarily chemical reaction between oils and oxygen from the air (autoxidation) and chemical reactions between components of the varnish. Resin varnishes [...] "dry" [...] by evaporation of the solvent and harden almost immediately upon drying. Acrylic and waterborne varnishes [...] "dry" [...] upon evaporation of the water but will experience an extended curing period. Oil, polyurethane, and epoxy varnishes remain liquid even after evaporation of the solvent but quickly begin to cure, undergoing successive stages from liquid or syrupy, to tacky or sticky, to dry gummy, to [...] "dry to the touch", to hard. Environmental factors such as heat and humidity play a very large role in the drying and curing times of varnishes. In classic varnish the cure rate depends on the type of oil used and, to some extent, on the ratio of oil to resin. The drying and curing time of all varnishes may be sped up by exposure to an energy source such as sunlight, ultraviolet light, or heat.|$|E
