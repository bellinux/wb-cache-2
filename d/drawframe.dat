50|$|The {{ground floor}} houses the six stage blowing {{room where the}} fibres are opened, plucked, cleaned and blended: with bale {{breakers}} (openers, bale pluckers), carding machines, a <b>drawframe</b> to draught the sliver, a lapformer, a comber to remove the short fibres, a speedframe to attenuate further and wrap the lap onto roving bobbins. The frames are by Toyota Truetzschler.|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} the Small-Scale Spinning Test, {{which is used to}} {{characterize}} the quality of samples of cotton weighing between 15 and 30 lbs (6. 8 and 13. 6 kg), lies in the annual cot-ton crop assessments performed by the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and the Textile Research Center of Texas Tech University. Each program of evaluation involved thorough test-ing of the raw cotton followed by the ring spin-ning of at least two yarns by the ring spinning route. The machinery used was of industrial size to emulate production conditions. The Small-Scale Spinning Test advocated by the USDA’s SRRC has been extended to include fabric manufacture, yet condensed by a need to conserve space that has required the elimi-nation of one <b>drawframe</b> from the sequence of machines employed. The objectives of this study are three-fold; •	 to	describe	the	evolution	of	the	Small-Scale Spinning Test, and its execution, •	 to	examine	the	importance	of	the <b>drawframe</b> in the process, and •	 to	identify	a	new	method	of	operation	in which setup errors are minimized when the same machine is used to perform both passes of drawing. The use of 27 tex (Ne 22) yarn throughout more than 60 years of small-scale evaluations is noted. Control of linear density throughout processing is critical to minimize waste and machine downtime. Benefits can	accrue	from	the	use	of	autolevelling for both passes of drawing, and reducing the chances of	error	by	eliminating	four	of	the	five changes previously required, as well as decreasing machine downtime...|$|E
