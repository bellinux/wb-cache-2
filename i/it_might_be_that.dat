Living in large social groups {{has long been}} connected with high cognitive ability. To live in a large group, a member {{must be able to}} recognize individuals and track the social position and foraging of other members over time. Members must also be able to distinguish between sex, age, reproductive status, and dominance, and to update this information constantly. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> social complexity corresponds to their high cognition.|$|E
25|$|Expression {{profiling}} experiments often involve {{measuring the}} relative amount of mRNA expressed {{in two or}} more experimental conditions. This is because altered levels of a specific sequence of mRNA suggest a changed need for the protein coded by the mRNA, perhaps indicating a homeostatic response or a pathological condition. For example, higher levels of mRNA coding for alcohol dehydrogenase suggest that the cells or tissues under study are responding to increased levels of ethanol in their environment. Similarly, if breast cancer cells express higher levels of mRNA associated with a particular transmembrane receptor than normal cells do, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> this receptor {{plays a role in}} breast cancer. A drug that interferes with this receptor may prevent or treat breast cancer. In developing a drug, one may perform gene expression profiling experiments to help assess the drug's toxicity, perhaps by looking for changing levels in the expression of cytochrome P450 genes, which may be a biomarker of drug metabolism. Gene expression profiling may become an important diagnostic test.|$|E
500|$|Philosopher {{and film}} theorist Robert Sinnerbrink {{similarly}} {{notes that the}} images following Diane's apparent suicide undermine the [...] "dream and reality" [...] interpretation. After Diane shoots herself, the bed is consumed with smoke, and Betty and Rita are shown beaming at each other, after which {{a woman in the}} Club Silencio balcony whispers [...] "Silencio" [...] as the screen fades to black. Sinnerbrink writes that the [...] "concluding images float in an indeterminate zone between fantasy and reality, which is perhaps the genuinely metaphysical dimension of the cinematic image", also noting that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "last sequence comprises the fantasy images of Diane's dying consciousness, concluding with the real moment of her death: the final Silencio". Referring to the same sequence, film theorist Andrew Hageman notes that [...] "the ninety-second coda that follows Betty/Diane's suicide is a cinematic space that persists after the curtain has dropped on her living consciousness, and this persistent space is the very theatre where the illusion of illusion is continually unmasked".|$|E

500|$|Lord Phillips {{said that}} the appeal raised the [...] "narrow issue" [...] of whether [...] "the act of {{preparing}} a joint witness statement is one in respect of which an expert witness enjoys immunity from suit", and the broader issue of whether [...] "public policy justifies conferring on an expert witness any immunity from liability in negligence {{in relation to the}} performance of his duties in that capacity." [...] He said that it was surprising that the immunity had simply been accepted in the past and never challenged. He noted that the immunity dated back to Cutler v Dixon in 1585, over 400 years ago, before English tort law developed the modern law of negligence. It was originally a complete protection for witnesses against claims for defamation, before developing to cover protection from other tort claims. [...] He noted that it was difficult to draw the line at present between expert assistance that was immune from claim and that which was not: <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the earlier advice was negligent, not the evidence given in court resiling from that earlier advice, even if it was the later developments about which the client complained.|$|E
2500|$|Author and {{historian}} John Grainger places Gaius at the Gulf of Aqaba, or in Nabataea.

2500|$|It is {{sometimes}} argued that Daniel's prayer in verses 3-19 is a later {{addition to the}} chapter and, therefore, secondary.

[...] Still, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the author(s) of the chapter incorporated (or adapted) a traditional prayer in the course of composition, in which case the prayer would not be a later addition.|$|E

2500|$|Weimer and Vining {{also suggest}} that the [...] "go, no go" [...] rule can be a useful method for {{deciding}} amongst policy alternatives^8. Under this decision making regime, some or all policy impacts can be assigned thresholds which are used to eliminate {{at least some of}} the policy alternatives. In their example, one criterion [...] "is to minimize SO2 emissions" [...] and so a threshold might be a reduction SO2 emissions [...] "of at least 8.0 million tons per year". As such, any policy alternative that does not meet this threshold can be removed from consideration. If only a single policy alternative satisfies all the impact thresholds then it is the one that is considered a [...] "go" [...] for each impact. Otherwise <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> all but a few policy alternatives are eliminated and those that remain need to be more closely examined in terms of their trade-offs so that a decision can be made.|$|E
2500|$|A {{possible}} {{part of the}} necropolis of Khufu is {{the famous}} Great Sphinx of Giza. It's a [...] large limestone statue in shape of a recumbent lion {{with the head of}} a human, decorated with a royal Nemes-headdress. The sphinx was directly hewn out of the plateau of Giza and originally painted with red, ocher, green and black. Up to this day it is passionately disputed who exactly gave the order to build it: the most possible candidates are Khufu, his elder son Djedefra and his younger son Khaefra. The difficulties for a correct allocation lie within the total lack of any perfectly preserved portrait of Khufu. The faces of Djedefre and Khaefra are both pretty {{similar to that of the}} sphinx, but they also do not perfectly fit. Another riddle is the original cultic and symbolic function of the sphinx. Much later it was called Heru-im-Akhet (HÃ¢rmachÃ­s; [...] "horus at the horizon") by the Egyptians and Abu el-Há½l ("father of terror") by the Arabians. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the sphinx -as an allegoric and mystified representation of the king- simply guarded the sacred cemetery of Giza.|$|E

2500|$|It {{could be}} that it is {{extremely}} difficult to start life. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10â100. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions {{it will be necessary to}} assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.|$|E

2500|$|In any case, much of {{the armor}} {{was made up of}} small ossicles, bony round scutes with a {{diameter}} of less than five millimetres, of which often hundreds have been found with a single specimen. If the armor was configured in an identical way to that of Scolosaurus, many of these small ossicles had fused into a kind of pavement, forming transverse bands on the body. The banded arrangement is thought to have permitted some freedom of movement. Four of these bands might have been present on the anterior half of the tail, three on the pelvis, perhaps fused into a single [...] "sacral shield", and four across the front part of the torso. Inset in these bands were horizontal rows of larger oval, flat or keeled, scutes. Types of large scutes varied by body region. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the scutes on the shoulder, near the midline of the body, were largest and tallest; ROM 1930 includes some osteoderms with a base length of fifteen centimeters. Little is known about the armor of the limbs. Large keeled plates were present on the upper arms as shown by specimen TMP 1997.132.01 conserving a round osteoderm near the humerus with a diameter of twenty centimeters and narrower spikes associated with the lower arm. The neck was protected by two bone rings, open at the underside, that are called [...] "cervical half-rings". Earlier seen as a fusion of osteoderms, this was doubted by Arbour et al. in 2013, who pointed out that they formed a lower layer, possibly consisting of ossified cartilage, as indicated by a smooth surface and a woven bone texture. Each half-ring is constructed out of six rectangular concave plates, three per side. Each plate has a large keeled osteoderm on top, often not fused with it. With Euoplocephalus, these neck osteoderms do not have smaller osteoderms at their bases, and their keels do not overhang their posterior edges.|$|E
