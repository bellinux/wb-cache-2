50|$|The other {{goal of a}} {{hose clamp}} is to provide {{mechanical}} attachment keeping the hose attached to a barb, <b>hose</b> <b>nipple,</b> or tube. To do this the clamp is typically placed on the hose behind the first ramp of the barb or behind the raised area {{near the end of}} and completely around the circumference of the <b>hose</b> <b>nipple</b> or tube called a bead. If the hose were to slide the clamp would have to expand to fit over the barb or raised bead. This keeps the hose attached to the barb, <b>hose</b> <b>nipple,</b> or beaded tube.|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure a}} good seal, the barb, <b>hose</b> <b>nipple,</b> or beaded tube must be smooth {{and free of}} nicks, scratches, or contamination. Stuck hoses should never be removed by {{slitting}} them, as this can leave a scratch on the fitting which will cause a leak.|$|E
50|$|Conversion kits are {{configured}} {{to either}} dispense {{through the door}} of the fridge or through the top into a draft beer tower. Door mount kits have a shank that goes through the door, with an attachment for the faucet on the outside and a <b>hose</b> <b>nipple</b> for the beer line on the inside. A draft beer tower would extend above the top of the fridge and already includes the faucet, shank and 5' beer line. Installation requires a few rudimentary tools, such as a socket wrench set, screwdriver and a drill with a hole saw bit to modify the refrigerator. The CO2 tank can be installed inside the fridge if there is enough room, or placed outside the fridge and secured into place.|$|E
