5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar <b>in</b> <b>Tacoma.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1913, {{the state}} highway system was {{adjusted}} again, and several new roads {{were added to}} the system, including parts of what would become US410. The Olympic Highway traveled around the Olympic Peninsula and a section from Aberdeen to Olympia was later used as part of US410. The Pacific Highway would later have a brief concurrency with US410 from Olympia to Tacoma, and US410 would later connect to the National Park Highway <b>in</b> <b>Tacoma</b> and follow it to Buckley, where State Road5, now a secondary highway maintained by the counties, began. From the end of State Road5 in Naches, the Inland Empire Highway is concurrent with the future US410 to Dayton, where a branch of the highway travels to Clarkston. State Road5 became the McClellan Pass Highway in 1919 and was aligned further south to Chinook Pass. The McClellan Pass Highway was renamed the Naches Pass Highway in 1921 to reflect the realignment in 1919. Despite the name, the road did not cross Naches Pass, as no highway ever has.|$|E
