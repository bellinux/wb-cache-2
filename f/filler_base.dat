Specifically, the matrix based on cement substituted by 35 % of alternative raw material was considered. In case of <b>filler</b> aggregate <b>based</b> sintered ash was used. One of the requirements for the parameters of the examined materials is resistance to extreme temperatures. Investigated materials were therefore exposed at high temperatures. Thermal loading took place gradually in temperature increments of 22 °C (reference conditions), 400, 600, 800 and 1000 °C with subsequent controlled cooling.

Parameters like melt viscosity {{as a function of}} shear rate or shear stress and temperature have become more and more important. Previous study indicated that the flow behaviour of the compound depends on the filler loading. Lesser elastic torque was found with compound containing lower filler content as compared to higher filler content.

Synthesis was carried out by co-precipitation in alkaline medium and drying, being followed by characterization via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. A variable amount of filler was then incorporated into the LDPE via extrusion, which was then injection molded to obtain specimens for evaluating tensile properties (Young’s modulus, tensile strength, strain at break and toughness). For comparison, the sodium salts of the surfactants (NaDDS and NaDBS) were also used as fillers in LDPE.
