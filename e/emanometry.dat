40|$|Radon {{monitoring}} {{was carried}} out at Palampur and Dalhousie stations in Kangra and Chamba valleys using <b>emanometry</b> for discrete measurements of time-series radon data since 1992 under Himalayan Seismicity programme of Government of India. The correlation of radon data with micro-earthquakes recorded by Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) network during the time window 1992 - 1997 shows a rising trend both in microseismicity as well as radon in Kangra and Chamba valleys of N-W Himalayan region under investigation. The effect of meteorological parameters (temperature, rainfall, humidity and wind velocity) on radon emanation was studied. The correlation co-efficients of radon data and the meteorological parameters recorded at Palampur suggest that temperature, rainfall and humidity have positive correlation, whereas wind velocity has negative correlation with radon...|$|E
40|$|Radon (222 Rn), radium {{activities}} and activity ratios (226 Ra, 22 SRa/Z 26 Ra, 224 Ra/ 228 Ra) swell as 3 He/ 4 He ratios were measured {{in spring and}} well waters from the Jordan-Dead Sea Rift Valley (DSR). Our sampling centered around Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee) in the Northern Rift Valley, and on the west shore of the Dead Sea, {{in the southern part}} of the rift. 222 Rn and 226 Ra were measured by <b>emanometry,</b> Ra isotopic ratios by "/-spectrometry, 3 He/ 4 He ratios- by mass spectrometry. The 22 SRa/ 226 Ra ctivity ratio varies in DSR waters between 0. 03 and 0. 9. Such isotopic ratios are very low compared to most analysed waters in the world. These probably reflect a very uraniferous (as opposed to Th rich) lithology with which these brines hav...|$|E
40|$|The Geothermal Resource Assessment Program of the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics has {{conducted}} {{a series of}} geochemical and geophysical surveys in ten separate locations within the State of Hawaii in an effort to identify and assess potential geothermal areas throughout the state. The techniques applied include groundwater chemistry and temperatures, soil mercury surveys, ground radon <b>emanometry,</b> time-domain electromagnetic surveys and Schlumberger resistivity soundings. Although geochemical and geophysical anomalies were identified in nearly all the survey sites, those areas which show most promise, based on presently available data, for a geothermal resource are as follows: Puna, Kailua Kona, and Kawaihae on the island of Hawaii; Haiku-Paia and Olowalu-Ukumehame canyons on Maui; and Lualualei Valley on Oahu. Further surveys are planned for most of these areas in order to further define the nature of the thermal resource present. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe radioactivities of 238 U and 226 Ra in mill {{tailings}} {{from the}} U mines of COMINAK and SOMA€IR in Niger were measured and quantified using a portable High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector. The 238 U and 226 Ra activities were measured {{under field conditions}} on drilling cores with 600 s measurements and without any sample preparation. Field results were compared with those obtained by Inductive Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and <b>emanometry</b> techniques. This comparison indicates that gamma-ray absorption by such geological samples does not cause significant deviations. This work shows the feasibility of using portable HPGe detector in the field as a preliminary method to observe variations of radionuclides concentration {{with the aim of}} identifying samples of interest. The HPGe is particularly useful for samples with strong secular disequilibrium such as mill tailings...|$|E

About 94 groundwater (borewell) samples were analysed for 222 Rn concentrations and found to vary in the range 5. 3 – 283. 4 Bq L− 1 with a mean value of 87 Bq L− 1. Frequency distribution showed the 222 Rn concentration in {{a large number of}} samples in the range of 0 – 50 Bq L− 1.

40|$|Inhalation of radon/thoron {{and their}} decay {{products}} {{is the major}} contribution to the total dose to the population from the natural radiation. Long duration measurements of these gases and their progeny concentrations were made in about 200 dwellings of the Mysore city using the SSNTD techniques for I year. The detector used at each house was fixed 2 m above the ground-floor. After the exposure time of 3 months films were etched in 2. 5 N, NaOH solution at 60 degreesC for 60 min. From the track density determined using spark counter, concentrations of radon/thoron levels were evaluated. The working level concentrations of radon/thoron was calculated from the equilibrium factor, leading to the estimation of the inhalation dose. Radon in bore-well water at different locations of Mysore city was examined using the <b>emanometry</b> and exposure dose from ingestion of drinking water was estimated. The ambient gamma radiation of equivalent effective dose both in indoor and outdoor at different parts of Mysore city was determined using scintillometer. The activity of Ra- 226, Th- 212 and K- 40 in soil were measured using spectrometer. The concentrations of radon/thoron and their progeny, ambient gamma, the activity of Ra- 226, Th- 232 and K- 40 presented and analyzed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Radioactivity is an {{important}} part of the environment. In the years 2014 - 2015 a survey on medicinal radioactive springs was carried out in the Tanvald granite body. During extensive radiohydrogeochemical exploration in the surrounding area of Schindler spring, the outcrop of U - mineralization has been found at a new construction site in the Kokonín fault. It is possible to find "hot" pieces of uranium ore fragments in the quaternary cover in this place. The occurrence of the hydrothermal (vein) type of uranium in the Krkonoše - Jizera is new as it hasn't been mentioned in literatures before. After an agreement with the owners, detailed radiometric survey proceeded in the surrounding area of two affected houses by using gamma spectrometry and <b>emanometry</b> at the dense net. There is a wider area between two houses with activities of 222 Rn over 1 MBq/m 3 and on the ore outcrop was measured 3. 3 MBq/m 3. A quaternary solifluction flow with an increased radioactivity creeps down under the House 1. The highest uranium contents reached up to 291 ppm eU (= 3 595 Bq/kg 226 Ra) on the uranium ore lens outcrop. The average of gamma dose rate is 85, 6 nGy/h with maximem 261 nGy/h on the outcrop. A further radiometric survey through the entire Kokonín fault line was carried out in an area of roughly 0. 25 x 1 km 2 [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Thirty-six {{springs and}} wells from the Dead Sea Rift Valley were {{periodically}} sampled and analyzed. The latter included full chemical analyses, 222 Rn and 226 Ra (by a-counting <b>emanometry),</b> {{as well as}} 228 Ra/ 226 Ra and 224 Ra/ 228 Ra activity ratios (g spectrometry). Sampling stretched over almost 2 yr. Several hundred Rn-Ra analyses and close to a hundred isotopic ratios were measured. Most waters in the Rift Valley have both elevated Ra (several to 750 dpm/L) and Rn (a few hundred to almost 60, 000 dpm/L) content. In practically all samples 222 Rn activity considerably exceeds that of its parent 226 Ra. The Ra content {{is the result of}} all Dead Sea Rift Valley waters being mixtures of fresh water with saline brines. Ra is efficiently extracted from surrounding rocks into the brine end member. 228 Ra/ 226 Ra ratios are exceptionally low 20. 07 to 0. 9, mostly less than 0. 2. This apparently reflects the U over Th enrichment in the source rocks that contribute the Ra. Ra enrichment (both 228 Ra and 226 Ra) is locally correlated throughout the Rift Valley with water salinity. This correlation can be used to constrain the age of the brine-freshwater mixing process. In one of the hydrologic subsystems studied (the Fuliya block), the mixing of the shallow ground water must have occurred in less than 200 to 300 yr ago, probably before no more than some 30 yr. High radon activities in surface waters along the Dead Sea Rift Valley result from the formation of radium-enriched linings on the aquifer rock surface. The mixing of the radium-extracting brines with fresh water leads to continual adsorption of radium as water salinity decreases. The unique combination of fast upward flow and continual mixing in the Dead Sea Rift Valley accounts for a constant replenishment of radium in the waters. This causes a gradual buildup of a radium lining on the aquifer walls until eventually a steady-state surface activity is established. Copyrigh...|$|E
