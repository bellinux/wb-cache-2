5|$|The first Allied {{landings}} on {{the beach}} occurred on 9 September, with two regiments of Middleton's 45th Infantry Division, the 157th and 179th Infantry, landing the following day. The other regiment of the division, the 180th, would land at a different point and be held in reserve by Clark. Middleton was responsible for ten miles of beachhead between the British X Corps and the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The German defensive positions pounded the Allies, who gained little ground {{in the first few}} days of the operation. Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, faltered and sent around a confidential memo indicating that he was contemplating taking the troops back off the beaches. Middleton, telling his staff that they were not leaving, spread around the word to his troops that it was a good time to do some hard fighting. On the morning of 14 September units of the Forty-fifth did some particularly hard fighting at a large tobacco factory, consisting of five imposing stone buildings in a somewhat circular pattern. The Germans were dug <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> repulsed the Americans initially, but with the aid of some naval gun fire, the Germans were eventually pushed back. Clark visited the front later that day, and was convinced that his army was going to stay.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been {{settings}} by American composers, of which the earliest was Daniel Gregory Mason’s Songs of the countryside for chorus and orchestra (Op. 23, 1923). Later came Raymond Wilding-White’s 3 Housman Poems. Jake Heggie used Poem 20, “The night is freezing fast”, as the first song in his On the road to Christmas (1996). Later he used five Housman poems <b>in</b> <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Gone (2005), of which two were from Last Poems and three from More Poems.|$|E
25|$|Building on Tatum's pianism and aesthetics, Peterson also absorbed Tatum's musical influences, notably from piano concertos by Sergei Rachmaninoff. Rachmaninoff's harmonizations, as well {{as direct}} {{quotations}} from his 2nd Piano Concerto, are thrown <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there in many recordings by Peterson, including his work with the most familiar formulation of the Oscar Peterson Trio, with bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Herb Ellis. During the 1960s and 1970s Peterson made numerous trio recordings highlighting his piano performances that reveal more of his eclectic style that absorbed influences from various genres of jazz, popular and classical music.|$|E

Prior to the game, Colorado head coach Gary Barnett said, [...] "I do not think anybody expects us to come <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> beat Texas."

500|$|... "Callin' In Sick" [...] is a style {{parody of}} music popular in Seattle, Washington, most notably grunge. [...] "Everything You Know Is Wrong" [...] is a stylistic {{pastiche}} of They Might Be Giants. Yankovic {{explained that he}} [...] "tried to write a song sort of in their style, but perhaps {{even a little bit}} more twisted". For fans of They Might Be Giants, he put [...] "little references <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there, little allusions to other songs of theirs". Yankovic later admitted that it [...] "is a little bit harder I think to decipher exactly where the inspiration is coming from." [...] The song title is taken from the 1974 Firesign Theatre album of the same name.|$|E

500|$|Eragon {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} and {{was criticized for}} its derivative nature. Liz Rosenberg of The New York Times Book Review criticized Eragon for having [...] "clichéd descriptions", [...] "B-movie dialogue", [...] "awkward and gangly" [...] prose." [...] However, she concluded the review by noting that [...] "for all its flaws, it is an authentic work of great talent". School Library Journal wrote that in Eragon [...] "sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations". Common Sense Media called Eragons dialogue [...] "long-winded" [...] and [...] "clichéd", with a plot [...] "straight out of Star Wars by way of The Lord of the Rings, with bits of other great fantasies thrown <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there."

500|$|In February, Dodd {{turned his}} {{attention}} fully to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. When asked by the Associated Press {{on the campaign trail}} if his campaigning really made a difference in changing public perceptions, he replied, [...] "There is enough time yet to change this , because there are places like Iowa and New Hampshire that give candidates like myself a chance to be heard." [...] Dodd's strategy was to speak to voters in restaurants, homes, and small-town diners, although political analysts wondered whether such methods were out-of-date. But he maintained that [...] "chatting in a living room face to face is still a very important feature of campaigning here. I don't think you can come <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> do sort of a wholesale political operation from [...] with a pit stop here and there and a media campaign behind you." [...] At the end of February, Dodd differentiated himself from his Democratic counterparts by stating his support for the Bush administration's willingness to hold joint talks with Iran and Syria and by stating that as president he would avoid talking with Iran as long as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained as president. On the trail, he referred to Ahmadinejad as a [...] "thug".|$|E
