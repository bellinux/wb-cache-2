2500|$|Intravenous therapy {{knowledge}} and skills among healthcare providers vary greatly. While initial exposure to I.V. therapy is usually through formal nursing education programs, I.V. starting skills only develop {{from a combination of}} theoretical instruction and on the job practice. However, employers usually expect potential employees to be proficient on this area of clinical practice prior to becoming hired. The gap between actual and expected {{knowledge and}} skills can be extremely wide, especially in I.V. therapy. Part of this gap comes from the lack of <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> and/or the inaccessibility to these offerings. While not widely offered, interactive multimedia I.V. education, such as hybrid courses combining online theory with hands-on practice, can provide a way to narrow that gap in a quick and cost-effective manner which will represent an improvement on patient safety and treatment outcomes. [...] Simulated intravenous solutions used for training purposes only have been manufactured; in at least one case, the routing of training solutions into a standard medical setting has led to patient adverse events.|$|E
2500|$|Luther was {{a school}} {{recruiter}} for Captain Richard Henry Pratt and periodically visited reservations. He was sincere in his desire to show what we had learned, and persuaded parents {{to send their children}} to Carlisle by his appearance, language and skills. [...] However, many children died in boarding schools and parents were fearful to let them go. [...] Moreover, many parents were treated unfairly and had not been notified until after the children died and were buried. It was not the negligence of Captain Pratt, but rather lax Indian agents who would set aside letters from Carlisle until the parents came into the agency for something. While many parents were proud of Luther, they were afraid to send their children away fearing they would never see them again. Luther got mixed reception home on the reservation. Some were proud of his achievements while others lamented that he had, in effect, become a white man. He was happy to be home and some of his relatives aid that he “looked like a white boy dressed in eastern clothes.” Luther felt proud to be compared to a white boy. But others would not shake his hand because some returning Carlisle students were ashamed of their culture, and a few even tried to pretend that they did not speak Lakota.
