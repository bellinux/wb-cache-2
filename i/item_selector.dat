50|$|Choro-Q Hybrid: A newer {{version of}} the Digi-Q and Q-Steer, the Choro-Q Hybrid is {{available}} in two chassis types, Remote Type and Spring Type. The car bodies can be removed easily with a screwdriver {{so they can be}} swapped onto other chassis types or traded. They also include additional pieces that are fitted to the tyres or underside to perform special tricks, and slot car tracks to race on. The speed of the Remote Type's Dash button has vastly increased, and the Mario Kart Wii cars come with an <b>Item</b> <b>Selector</b> on the remote. The remote sizes have increased and the cars are charged via remote.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{to create}} a link to a Web server, [...] "GET /" [...] {{was used as a}} pseudo-selector to emulate an HTTP GET request. John Goerzen created an {{addition}} to the Gopher protocol, commonly referred to as [...] "URL links", that allows links to any protocol that supports URLs. For example, {{to create a}} link to http://gopher.quux.org/, the item type is , the display string is the title of the link, the <b>item</b> <b>selector</b> is [...] "", and the domain and port are that of the originating Gopher server (so that clients that do not support URL links will query the server and receive an HTML redirection page).|$|E
5000|$|Here, {{the client}} has {{established}} a TCP connection with the server on port 70, the standard gopher port. The client then sends a string followed by a carriage return followed by a line feed (a [...] "CR + LF" [...] sequence). This is the selector, which identifies the document to be retrieved. If the <b>item</b> <b>selector</b> were an empty line, the default directory would be selected. The server then replies with the requested item and closes the connection. According to the protocol, before the connection is closed, the server should send a full-stop (i.e., a period character) on a line by itself. However, {{as is the case}} here, not all servers conform to this part of the protocol and the server may close the connection without returning the final full-stop.|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this project is the {{introduction}} of haptic feedback for touch screens in an in-vehicle environment. Due to the numerous studies on confirmation haptic feedback, this project regards navigation haptic feedback. The importance {{of this project}} is to {{provide an overview of}} this kind of haptic feedback. Also, to prove the ability of touch screens to assist drivers in the interaction with a multifunctional device in a driving situation. For this purpose, an introduction of the background was carried out, including touch screens, technologies producing haptic feedback, the sense of touch and users in a driving situation. From this, two conclusions were taken. First, the kind of touch screen that most suits an in-vehicle environment is a multicapacitive touch screen. Also, that the best technology to produce navigation haptic feedback is the texture surface changing. Taking these results into consideration a prototype was implemented. This prototype was tested in a usability study. The main problem found out during the usability study is the long learnability time needed by the participants due to the new way of interaction introduced to be able to navigate. From the information of the usability study the following results have been extracted. The actions that were helped by the introduction of navigation haptic feedback were navigation across <b>items</b> and level <b>selectors.</b> It has been shown that a standardized selection of haptic feedback is needed in order to reduce learnability time and introduce guessability in future touch screen devices. Some more studies, when looking upon different traffic situations must be carried out in order to understand if also theese conditions require the same amount of help introduced by navigation haptic feedback. An important result of this project is that none {{of the participants in the}} usability study turned off the optional haptic feedback, when this was included in their multifunctional in-vehicle device. This shown a trust on haptics that has to be seen as a motive to continue working on it...|$|R
40|$|In privacy {{preserving}} data mining, utility mining {{plays an}} important role. In privacy preserving utility mining, some sensitive itemsets are concealed from the data- base according to certain privacy policies. Hiding sensitive itemsets from the adversaries is becoming an important issue nowadays. Also, only very few methods {{are available in the}} literature to hide the sensitive itemsets in the database. One of the existing privacy preserving utility mining methods utilizes two algorithms, HHUIF and MSICF to con- ceal the sensitive itemsets, so that the adversaries cannot mine them from the modi ed database. To accomplish the hiding process, this method nds the sensitive itemsets and modi es the frequency of the high valued utility items. However, the performance of this method lacks if the utility value of the items are the same. The items with the same utility value decrease the hiding performance of the sensitive itemsets and also it has introduced computational complexity due to the frequency modi cation in each item. To solve this problem, in this paper a modified HHUIF algorithm with <b>Item</b> <b>Selector</b> (MHIS) is pro- posed. The proposed MHIS algorithm is a modified version of existing HHUIF algorithm. The MHIS algorithm computes the sensitive itemsets by utilizing the user defined utility threshold value. In order to hide the sensitive itemsets, the frequency value of the items is changed. If the utility values of the items are the same, the MHIS algorithm selects the accurate items and then the frequency values of the selected items are modified. The proposed MHIS reduces the computation complexity as well as improves the hiding per- formance of the itemsets. The algorithm is implemented and the resultant itemsets are compared against the itemsets that are obtained from the conventional privacy preserving utility mining algorithms...|$|E
