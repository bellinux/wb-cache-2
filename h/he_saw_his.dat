5|$|When {{the grammar}} school {{returned}} to Great Yarmouth in 1944 MacMillan {{found a new}} ballet teacher, Phyllis Adams. With her help, MacMillan, aged fifteen, secured admission to the Sadler's Wells Ballet School (later the Royal Ballet School). <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> first performances of ballets, given by Ninette de Valois' Sadler's Wells company, at the New Theatre in London.|$|E
5|$|A nearby {{mountain}} {{was named}} Jabal ad-Dik ("Mount of the Rooster") {{because of a}} traditional story. According to the tradition, a Jew that lived in Jifna had visited Jerusalem during the Passion. Seeing Jesus rise from the dead, the man immediately converted and told his wife what <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>His</b> wife refused to believe him unless the rooster she had just killed {{would come back to}} life. Instantly, the rooster flew away towards the mountain. The story was recited in some monasteries on Holy Thursday together with other biblical readings.|$|E
5|$|He {{lived on}} for four more years, {{spending}} {{his days in}} his palace gardens. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, his damnatio memoriae. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed suicide. He died on 3 December 312.|$|E

5|$|In October 1899, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> first combat {{action when}} he led 300 Marines to take the town of Noveleta, from Filipino rebels known as Insurrectos. In the initial moments of the assault, his first {{sergeant}} was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but quickly regained his composure and led his Marines {{in pursuit of the}} fleeing enemy. By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.|$|E
5|$|They {{went on to}} Albemarle Island, where Darwin saw a small jet {{of smoke}} from a {{recently}} active volcano. On 1 October he landed near Tagus Cove and explored Beagle Crater. There <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> first Galapagos land iguanas. Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only note of the finches he was not bothering to label by island. He caught a third species of mockingbird.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, his sons, {{and other}} Confederate {{soldiers}} encountered Union Army cavalry along Grassy Lick Run south of Romney on April 24, 1862. Parsons carried a double-barreled shotgun, {{and proceeded to}} fire his weapon at the Union forces at close range. As Parsons made his escape from the Union Army forces, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> son fired upon as he ran across the road, and supposed he had been killed. He traveled {{to the home of}} a Mr.Hott, and told him of the news of his son's possible death. Parsons became pale and was helped down from his horse by Hott's sons, so he would not fall. According to Hott, Parsons died moments later.|$|E

5|$|Therefore, {{he finally}} sailed into Piraeus where {{the crowd had}} gathered, {{desiring}} to see the famous Alcibiades. He entered the harbor full of fear till <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> cousin and others {{of his friends and}} acquaintance, who invited him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero's welcome. Nevertheless, some saw an evil omen in {{the fact that he had}} returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the Plynteria (the feast where the old statue of Athena would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies took note of this and kept it in mind for a future occasion.|$|E
5|$|As {{the third}} {{son of a}} cadet (junior) branch of the Fürstenberg princely family, Karl Aloys was {{prepared}} for a military career. His tutor, Lieutenant Ernst, was in active service in the Habsburg military, and took six-year-old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with him. In this way, he learned as a child the Habsburg military manual, and {{came into contact with}} important military men who later furthered his education and career; he also acquired an honorary rank as Kreis-Obristen, or Colonel of the Imperial Circle, {{by the time he was}} ten years old. As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister Count Franz Moritz von Lacy and Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon; he was also invited to dine with Emperor Joseph II. He started his service in 1777 as a Fähnrich (ensign) in the Habsburg military organization. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> first field service during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1777–78), although he was not involved in any battles.|$|E
5|$|Quinn {{signed with}} the Pittsburgh Steelers as an undrafted free agent {{following}} the 1997 NFL Draft. Quinn entered training camp behind Kordell Stewart, Mike Tomczak and Jim Miller on the depth chart, but after training camp Quinn had beaten out Miller and became the team's third-string quarterback. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> only game action on November 9 against the Baltimore Ravens, throwing for 10yards on one completion. Following the 1997 season, the Steelers allocated Quinn to play in NFL Europe, he later agreed {{to play for the}} Rhein Fire. In his second game with the Fire on April 12, Quinn completed 13 of 21 passes for 194yards. He also completed two touchdown passes. With Quinn as the starting quarterback, the Fire played in the World Bowl. However, Quinn was hampered by a sprained ankle and could not play in the game. He returned to the Steelers after the NFL Europe season but was waived on August 31.|$|E

5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} Fighter Command's need for {{units in the}} south of the country, No. 41 Squadron was redeployed to RAF Hornchurch in Essex on 3 September 1940. On 5 September, Lock flew as Red 2, {{positioned}} behind and protecting the Squadron's Leader. He shot down two Heinkel He 111s over the Thames Estuary. One of his victims crashed into a river, the other caught fire and its undercarriage fell down. Lock followed it down. He quickly realised his mistake—reducing height to pursue a damaged enemy put a pilot at risk from enemy fighters—but it was too late. A Messerschmitt Bf 109 attacked him and he sustained damage to his Spitfire and a wound to his leg. Lock immediately zoom-climbed. The Bf 109 attempted to follow but the pilot stalled and fell away. Lock reversed direction and dived. Waiting for the German fighter to come out of its dive he fired several short bursts and it exploded. Looking around he saw the second He 111 land in the English Channel, about ten miles from the first. Lock circled above the He 111 and noticing a boat he alerted the boat to its presence by flying over it and led the vessel to the crash site. As he left the scene he saw the crew surrendering to the occupants of the boat. On the way home <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> first victim in the river, with a dingy nearby. A further Bf 109 was claimed destroyed on that date.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev {{met with}} {{personal}} tragedy, {{as his son}} Leonid, a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on 11 March 1943. The circumstances of Leonid's death remain obscure and controversial, as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. As a result, Leonid's fate {{has been the subject}} of considerable speculation. One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Nikita Khrushchev pleading for his life. This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin in the Secret Speech. While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev's file was tampered with after the war. In later years, Leonid Khrushchev's wingmate stated that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>his</b> plane disintegrate, but did not report it. Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a Politburo member. In mid-1943, Leonid's wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in a series of orphanages. Leonid's daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife.|$|E
