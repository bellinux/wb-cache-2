Long-term access to <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> is stable: The percentage of workers reporting that they have access to <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> through their job is largely unchanged from the mid- 1990 s and down only slightly from the late 1980 s. In 2005, 74 percent of workers who were not self-employed reported they were eligible for <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> through their own job, up slightly from 73. 6 percent in 1995.

Although there is a positive association between {{the availability of}} retiree <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> and early retirement, this association could be driven by other factors that are correlated with retiree <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> and affect retirement decisions. I build a simple model to show that individuals in poor health and with poor outside insurance options value retiree <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> more. I then use variation in health status and outside insurance options to examine, within a difference-in-differences framework, whether the estimated correlation between retiree <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> and early retirement reflects demand for health insurance. My results indicate that the effect of retiree <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> is not statistically significantly larger for those in poor health, but that it is larger for those who lack insurance from other sources, particularly from their spouses. I conclude that retiree <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> do increase the hazard of early retirement and that demand for health insurance among the near-elderly is not closely tied to health status. ...|$|R

Between 1997 and 2010, the percentage of non-working retirees over age 65 with retiree <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> fell from 20 percent to 16 percent.

Earlier research found little impact of reductions in coverage on retirees, but that may be because initial changes employers made to retiree <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> affected future retirees as opposed to then-current retirees. Over time, more and more retirees have “aged into ” those program changes, resulting in the greater impact found in more recent studies.

The Eastern Enterprises v.

That act provided for arguably the most generous fully paid healthcare benefits in the nation, including pregnancy termination for family members of those designated as beneficiaries of the Reachback Tax.
