40|$|Hop-derived sesquiterpenoid-type {{oxidation}} {{products have}} been associated with a spicy or herbal hoppy beer character. However, the flavour threshold values of hitherto identified oxygenated sesquiterpenes are generally much higher than their estimated levels in beer. By applying two-step supercritical fluid extraction of hop pellets using carbon dioxide. followed by chromatographic purification of the enriched sesquiterpenoid fraction, highly specific varietal hop oil essences containing all main oxygenated sesquiterpenes were obtained. Post-fermentation addition (at ppb levels) of these purified sesquiterpenoid essences from various European aroma hops led to distinctive spicy or herbal flavour notes, reminiscent of typical 'noble' hop aroma. It is concluded that a spicy hop <b>flavour</b> <b>impression</b> in beer depends significantly on minor constituents of the natural sesquiterpenoid hop oil fraction. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Three {{procedures}} for the isolation of volatiles from grilled goat meat were compared: dynamic headspace entrainment on Tenax TA, simultaneous steam distillation-extraction, and solid-phase microextraction. Headspace entrainment on Tenax TA extracted {{the highest number of}} Maillard-derived volatile compounds. Two hundred and three volatile components were identified: 159 are reported {{for the first time in}} goat meat. Most of the volatiles detected (155) were lipid oxidation products, such as hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters. Forty-eight Maillard-derived compounds were identified. comprising pyrazines, pyrroles, thiophenes, furanthiol derivatives, alkyl and alicyclic sulphides, pyridines, and thiazoles. Some reported character impact compounds of cooked meat, e. g., 12 -methyltridecanal, (EE) - 2, 4 -decadienal, methional, and dimethyl trisulphide were identified in the volatile profile of goat meat, together with a series of C- 2 to C- 5 alkylformylcyclopentenes, which have been reported in cooked chicken, pork, beef and lamb, as being important for the characteristic <b>flavour</b> <b>impression</b> of different animal species.

40|$|Purpose - The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to investigate the binding of several lactones to soya protein isolate and soya protein under different conditions and, particularly, the extent of binding of the lactones ?- 9, ?- 10, d- 10 and d- 11, in different concentrations as well as the effect of various parameters on their binding ability. Design/methodology/approach - Capillary column gas chromatography was used for the determination of lactones and the manual system was used for taking samples and for headspace analysis. Infrared spectroscopy was used for confirmation and investigation. Findings - The percentage of binding of lactones ?- 9, ?- 10, d- 10, d- 11 on the soya protein is almost the same (about 33 - 34 per cent). According to the Klotz equation, the bound ligand concentration was calculating as the number of moles of ligand bound per mole of protein. The results varied, but were similar. Specific experiments in water system with soya protein isolate (1 per cent) showed that the time taken for lactones ?- 10 and d- 11 to reach equilibrium, the factors of temperature and pH affected the percentage of lactone bound. Research limitations/implications - The amount of added lactone in products containing soya protein isolate should be investigated by using panel tests to confirm the improvement of flavour. Practical implications - Flavour binding of lactones can be used to provide some foods with the required <b>flavour</b> <b>impression</b> by adding lactones to a bland soy protein base. Originality/value - The flavour binding of lactones, which was investigated in the present paper, has not been adequately investigated in previous scientific research and the effects of the factors that influence their binding are very important...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{traits of}} three {{broccoli}} cultivars, which were grown for autumn crop was determined: ‘Chevalier’ F 1, ‘Milady’ F 1 (cultivars of Dutch origin) and ‘Cezar’ F 1 (of Polish origin). Immediately after harvest sensory quality of broccoli was evaluated, using the quantitative descriptive analysis method (QDA). In ‘brainstorming’ session there were chosen 14 attributes (profiles) concerning smell, texture, taste / <b>flavour.</b> Overall quality <b>impression</b> was also scored and hedonic test of broccoli liking was performed. Other quality traits determined were: antioxidant activity, total carotenoids content, vitamin C content, colour parameters in CIE L*a*b* system. These traits were determined separately for florets and stems of broccoli plants, {{both of which}} are usable parts of this vegetable. Results showed that investigated cultivars differed in respect of quality traits concerning sensory attributes, antioxidant activi­ty, carotenoids content, vitamin C content and colour parameters. Results showed also that florets of broccoli performed higher antioxidant activity than stems. Carotenoids content in broccoli cultivars was much higher in florets than in stems, but vitamin C content was on similar level in florets and stems of the plants. Florets and stems of all broccoli cultivars differed much in respect of colour parameters – lightness, greenness and yellowness...|$|R
40|$|This study {{verified}} {{the effect}} of the spontaneous fermentation/natural ferment (NF) on the chemo-sensory quality of cachaça, comparing to the commercial ferment (CF). The effect of ageing (maturation) was also analysed in the beverage. Microbiological analysis (plating on selective media for total/wild yeast and bacteria counting) and physico-chemical analysis (pH, acidity and soluble solids) were performed in the samples of the must and the ferment collected during three cycles of fermentation in a semi-industrial scale. Samples of cachaça were stored in 5 -L oak containers for 45 days, subsequently analyzing the physico-chemical characteristics (pH, acidity, alcohol content, copper and secondary compounds) and sensory acceptability (aroma, flavour, colour, body and global impression). The fermentation with NF showed higher number of wild yeasts; however {{there was no difference in}} the number of bacteria comparing to CF. An intense acidification occurred during the preparation of NF, which was also observed in the initial cycles of fermentation, but decreased afterwards. Greater alterations in cachaça composition were found to be more exclusively related to the maturation than to the type of ferment, except for the acidity. However, there was a significant loss of aroma, <b>flavour</b> and global <b>impression</b> after maturation but only in cachaça produced with the CF. The results revealed a strong interaction between ferment and maturation of the beverage, suggesting that substances produced by the microorganisms from different inocula during fermentation reacted differently with the wood components of the barrels influencing the sensory attributes...|$|R

In this examination, six kind of gingerbread was made. The difference in the compound of the examined gingerbreads was use of various kinds of sweeteners. For this examination were used honey, invert sugar and malt extract. For the other gingerbread doughs were used these combinations of sweeteners (invert sugar + honey, invert sugar + malt extract and honey + malt extract). For this sensory analysis were used eight descriptors [...] shape, colour, surface, smell, porosity, aroma of spices, overall <b>flavour</b> and overall <b>impression.</b> Besides the sensory analysis, also was measured colour of gingerbreads with using spectrophotometer. By the sensory analysis and spectrophotometric determinativ was found, that the darkest gingerbreads were with invert sugar in combination with honey and the lightnest gingerbreads were with malt extract and with honey. From {{the results of this}} sensory analysis was defined that, the sample where invert sugar was used, gave best results. The use of malt extract for gingerbread dough is not suitable, mainly because of the bad colour, smell and flavour of the final product. There is possibility to use malt extract in combination with invert sugar for better characteristics of the final product. In this case, the invert sugar will be the predominate sweetener (malt extract in amount of 2 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Hops {{constitute}} an indispensable {{raw material for}} beer production. The hop essential oil (-derived) volatiles are at {{the origin of the}} highly desired hoppy aroma of beer. (Bio) chemical transformations and losses during the brewing process alter the hop oil volatile fingerprint, resulting in hoppy aroma in beer that is clearly different from the aroma of the hops. Nevertheless, the nature of hoppy aroma is up-to-date far from understood. Especially ‘noble kettle hop’ aroma, which is a typical flavour characteristic of traditional Pilsner-type beers obtained by vigorous boiling of aroma hops, has been a matter of debate and knowledge concerning this controversial issue remains contradictory and fragmentary. This PhD study aims at providing scientific insights into the impact of the boiling process on the analytical and sensory characteristics of hop essential oil volatiles. Such knowledge is of utmost importance to completely understand the chemical background of ‘kettle hop’ aroma. In first instance, a literature overview on hops, hop aroma, (bio) chemical transformations of hop oil volatiles during the brewing process and hoppy aroma of beer is presented. In order to obtain scientific insights on changes in the hop oil volatile profile upon boiling, lab scale boiling experiments (in water) with total hop essential oil (cv. Saaz) were conducted. HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis and multivariate data analysis (PCA, CA) revealed clustering between unboiled and boiled hop essential oil samples, due to decreases in terpene hydrocarbon levels and an increase in the level of particular α-humulene and β-caryophyllene oxidation and hydrolysis products upon boiling. Also a series of volatiles specific for boiled hop oil could be observed, pointing to de novo generation of volatiles {{as a result of the}} boiling process. Sensory evaluations of boiled hop essential oil in non-aromatised iso-α-acid bittered lager beer demonstrated that boiled hop oil imparts ‘spicy/herbal’ impressions and ‘kettle hop’ aroma to beer. Seen the interesting flavour characteristics (spicy, herbal notes) of boiled hop essential oil, the search for hop oil volatiles involved in this <b>flavour</b> <b>impression</b> was further focused by SPE fractionation of boiled hop essential oil. Fractions expressing ‘spicy’ and ‘hoppy’ notes when spiked to water were subjected to comprehensive analytical profiling via HS-SPME-GC-MS. Comparison of the boiled hop oil fractions with the corresponding unboiled hop oil fractions allowed for identification of additional volatiles formed de novo during the boiling process. Sensory evaluation of hop oil fractions in non-aromatised iso-α-acid bittered lager beer suggested that fractions containing high oxygenated sesquiterpenoid levels are most relevant in relation to ‘kettle hop’ aroma. Moreover, an SPE methodology was developed to enrich oxygenated sesquiterpenoids from commercial kettle hopped lager beers. Many compounds formed de novo upon lab scale boiling of hop oil (cv. Saaz) were detected in the commercial beers. Moreover, GC-O analysis demonstrated that several α-humulene and β-caryophyllene oxidation products elute in flavour-active zones of the hop oil-derived fractions as well as in the fractions derived from a commercial lager beer. Enrichment of a sesquiterpene hydrocarbon fraction from total hop essential oil (cv. Saaz) and subsequent lab scale boiling of this fraction unambiguously proved oxidation of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Moreover, SPE isolation of the sesquiterpene oxidation products formed de novo and addition of this fraction to non-aromatised iso-α-acid bittered lager beer demonstrated a cause-and-effect relationship between these constituents and ‘spicy/kettle hop’ flavour. Via GC-O analysis of the oxidation product fraction, two intervals with significant odour-activity were established. Humulene epoxide III, humulenol II, caryophylla- 4 (12), 8 (13) -diene- 5 α/β-ol, (3 Z) -caryophylla- 3, 8 (13) -diene- 5 α-ol, 14 -hydroxy-β-caryophyllene and (3 Z) -caryophylla- 3, 8 (13) -diene- 5 β-ol were identified in these intervals and since except for humulene epoxide III all these oxidation products were also found in flavour-active zones of a commercial kettle hopped lager beer, these volatiles are candidate key impact compounds for ‘kettle hop’ aroma. By boiling increasing hop essential oil (cv. Saaz) concentrations in both water and wort, a positive correlation between the initial hop oil concentration and formation of sesquiterpene oxidation products upon boiling was found. Varietal aspects were also investigated (cv. Saaz, cv. Hallertau Tradition, cv. Perle and cv. Magnum). The results suggest that most of the sesquiterpene oxidation products formed de novo during boiling are identical for the different varieties, and thus point to the importance of the intrinsic hop oil composition for development of ‘kettle hop’ aroma during the brewing process. Moreover, selinenols and related compounds (i. e. cadinols, muurolols, eudesmols) could not be detected upon boiling of a selinene-rich sesquiterpene hydrocarbon fraction cv. Super Pride, supporting the hypothesis that these compounds are biosynthesised by the hop plant. Finally, scientific insights obtained on lab scale were verified in real brewing practice by brewing eight different pilot-scale lager beers, aromatised with Saaz hop pellets or hop oil (-derived fractions). Analysis of wort samples of an ‘early’ kettle hopped beer indicated de novo formation of sesquiterpene oxidation products during the wort boiling process. This aroma profile of this beer was predominated by ‘spicy/herbal’ impressions. Combination of ‘early’ and ‘late’ kettle hopping resulted in a highly appreciated beer with intense ‘kettle hop’ flavour. A delicate balance between both ‘spicy/herbal’ and ‘floral/citrusy’ connotations appeared to be required in order to obtain the full complex spectrum of ‘kettle hop’ flavour. Aromatisation by post-fermentation addition of the sesquiterpene oxidation product fraction resulted in a beer that approached the flavour of an ‘early’ kettle hopped beer. Using comprehensive multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), the previously proposed candidate key impact compounds could be identified in both the fraction and the resulting beer. Moreover, addition of this oxidation product fraction positively influenced the bitterness perception and significantly increased mouthfeel aspects. Post-fermentation aromatisation with boiled hop oil resulted in a beer that received a high score for ‘kettle hop’ aroma and, moreover, the flavour profile of this beer was highly comparable to a conventionally kettle hopped Pilsner-type lager beer. It was concluded that these two new aromatisation technologies impart interesting flavour characteristics to beer and are promising techniques to mimic ‘kettle hop’ flavour by post-fermentation aromatisation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In the {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} bachelor thesis focused on the topic Sensory evaluation of herbal teas from the conventional and ecological production, the basic theoretical knowledge concerning the issue of herbal teas and sensory analysis are summed up. The practical part deals with {{the assessment of the}} influence of conventional and ecological way of production on sensory characteristics of herbal teas. Ten samples of teas of one sort were prepared for the sensory evaluation, five sorts from the conventional producer and five of the same teas from the ecological producer. Tested herbal teas were chamomile, marigold, nettle, peppermint and sage. The evaluation was performed in the sensory laboratory of the Department of Food Technology of the Mendel University in Brno in March 2016 by ten trained evaluators. Following descriptors were evaluated with each sample: overall visual aspect of dry tea before preparation, intensity of aroma, acceptability of aroma, presence of strange aroma, colour hue and its intensity, clearness, intensity of flavour, acceptibility of flavour, presence of strange <b>flavours</b> and overall <b>impression</b> after preparation. For the teas evaluation was used the method of description, category scales and graphical unstructured scales. On the grounds of the sensory analysis it was found that selected sorts of teas in dry state were evaluated better at the ecological production. However, we cannot definitely say which teas had better sensory characteristics. It can be stated that when herbal teas are concerned, the sensory characteristics were not notably influenced by the way of production...|$|R
