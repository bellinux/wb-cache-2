50|$|However, once built, {{the boot}} image can be simply copied onto devices, patched within {{reasonable}} limits, and remains <b>disposable</b> in <b>case</b> of any problems (viruses in particular). This is possible because unlike other hard drive images (which may contain any data, et al.), pure boot images contain no mission-critical data. By definition a pure boot image contains no data that cannot be reproduced from configurations or off-the-shelf executables. In particular end-user data {{is not part}} of a boot image, although some operating systems require that a copy of user preferences or configuration files be kept within the boot image itself, e.g. Microsoft Windows registry. Utilities like Norton Ghost keep a backup copy of the boot image, for quick re-imaging (often called re-installation) {{in the event of a}} problem, thus avoiding the need to diagnose a specific problem with a specific machine.|$|R
30|$|In parallel, the EU has {{established}} a fundamental right to move and settle within the EU area for EU citizens and long-term Third Country Nationals (TCN). The EU free movement area now encompasses 28 countries with a total {{population of more than}} half a billion. An increasing share of these inhabitants are ‘internal EU migrants’, most of whom are workers. The financial and economic crisis since 2009 has reinforced the dominance of intra-EU labour migration, as the German case illustrates (Sachverständigenrat, 2013 : 54). Nonetheless, migrant workers from the newest EU member states tend to be employed in precarious and dangerous jobs (Woolfson and Likic-Brboric, 2008). These workers (and foreign workers in general) arguably serve as a ‘hyper-flexible buffer’ since ‘being <b>disposable</b> in <b>case</b> of downturn, [they] can carry most of the uncertainty burden without causing political problems’ (Meardi et al., 2012 : 7). Increasing unemployment in the southern EU countries and in Ireland may promote further intra-European circular mobility in coming years.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Dental {{professionals}} may be {{at increased}} risk of developing occupational allergic diseases specially to methacrylates that can permeate protective <b>disposable</b> gloves. <b>Case</b> report. We presented a case of occupational allergic contact dermatitis in a 28 -year-old dental technician. The patient had complained of itching and cracking of fingers for 6 months. The dermatitis improved over weekends. Skin erythema and scaling were present with primarily involvement of the fingertips. Patch testing with dental series gave positive vesicular reaction to methyl methacrylate. Follow-up after 6 months of allergen avoidance showed a complete regression of dermatitis. Conclusion. Methacrylates serve as bases for acrylic resins which are used in prosthetics. Methyl methacrylate as a small molecular acrylate can permeate thin protective disposable gloves. Using adequate personal protective equipment, like nitrile rubber gloves, {{is the most important}} preventive measure in this occupation. Health practitioners should recognize possible occupational hazards in dentistry and implement appropriate preventive measures to protect health of workers...|$|R
40|$|The article {{provides}} a {{conceptualization of the}} link between recent migration flows and labour market uncertainty through the analysis of a critical example, the construction sector (characterized by economic volatility, worker mobility, employment insecurity, safety risk) in the UK and Spain (countries with large immigration, flexible labour markets and volatile construction sectors). Transnational labour mobility {{can be seen as a}} structural response to recent European dilemmas over how to combine flexibility and security, through the creation of a hyper-flexible buffer of migrant workers who, being <b>disposable</b> in <b>case</b> of downturn, can carry most of the uncertainty burden without causing political problems. This raises two issues: the social sustainability of such segmentation, in particular with regard to occupational health and safety; and the role organized labour can have, in particular in organizing such workers. The issues are analysed through labour market statistics and interviews with unionists, migrant organization representatives, employers and employment policy officers in both countries...|$|R
30|$|Product description: “Clens” is a {{new concept}} of a <b>disposable</b> contact lens <b>case</b> that solves {{sanitation}} problems, including bacterial infections caused by unavoidable external touch such as lens tweezers and fingers. Clens is an item that uses the structure of small cymbals. When users push the bottom side to upwards, the feature stretches while embracing the finger, which enables users to wear the lens {{without the need for}} lens tweezers or touching the lens with fingers. As a result, users feel less bothered because there is no external touch and concerns of bacterial infection decreases. This product is ideal for those who highly regard sanitation and eyeball health.|$|R
40|$|Biopharmaceuticals are an {{important}} part of the present day healthcare industry. Research, early stage development, scale-up, technology transfer, and commercial manufacturing are important phases of any drug product life cycle. Under ideal conditions, processes can be scaled up from lab to manufacturing scale based on the theoretical considerations. But, there are various non-process related issues which can impact the process performance and need to be considered for successful scale-up and technology transfer to manufacturing. This thesis presents three case studies which focus on the approaches for overcoming technical challenges encountered during scale-up, technology transfer and production of therapeutic enzymes at large scale. Case study 1 describes the strategies and process development activities associated with technology transfer of a clarification and capture ultrafiltration and diafiltration (UFDF) process from a pilot scale into a manufacturing plant that utilizes single use <b>disposables</b> technology. <b>Case</b> study 2 discusses the studies performed to develop column packing and qualification methods to address the challenges associated with platform approach and manufacturing at multiple sites. Case study 3 discusses the unanticipated changes required for methods to pack highly compressible chromatography media, post technology transfer to manufacturing scale, to minimize the risk of process failure.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{determinants of}} housing construction in {{regions in the}} Czech Republic. The main research question {{is the impact of}} standard of living on housing construction. The living standard is expressed in terms of net disposable income per capita and housing construction represents the number of housing starts. Other determinants included to the model estimation are rate of unemployment, housing price and number of mortgage. Analysis works with the panel data from period 2005 - 2015 and all variables are used in the logarithmic form with one year lag. The model is estimated by random effects model. The assumption about positive impact of living standard on housing construction is not confirmed, because of the statistical insignificance of variable net <b>disposable</b> income. In <b>case</b> of other variables expected effects are confirm. The increases in rate of unemployment and housing prices have the negative impact on housing construction. And opposite the number of mortgage has positive impact on housing construction...|$|R
40|$|Conventional DNA {{separation}} procedures involve large sizes, high voltages and are {{unfit for}} large molecules. Proposed set-up constitutes two fold separation techniques, porous filter for fractionating strands on size and final run through microchannels (agarose, buffer solution) viscous enough for DNA electrophoresis. For {{arriving at the}} final set-up all the physical contradictions like voltage, viscosity of the fluid, length of the channel were analyzed. The physical set up consists around 20 microchannels (varying diameters) positioned at 500 um (centre-to-centre spacing) assembling entire device within 1 cm. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) treated DNA assays, are fed to microchannel entrances. Mixture of DNA strands are then passed through magnetic filters. Filtering property of the filters is adjusted by regulating corresponding magnetic field strengths. Smallest strands pass through small pored filter, owing to high velocity (in electrophoresis), thus categorization being done. Proposal replaces conventional apparatus by miniaturized equipment, in ideal <b>case</b> <b>disposable.</b> Miniaturization reduced voltages requirement, solving high-voltage handling problems. Proposed apparatus can fractionate large (> 200 kbp) molecules and even organic molecules...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to provide state energy and {{environmental}} policy makers and legislators with information on the state-level jobs and economic activity benefits of taking action to increase the delivery of energy efficiency, It provides a state-level case study showing the benefits of increase delivery of energy efficiency including increased employment and increased <b>disposable</b> income. This <b>case</b> study was prepared of a specific state, Wisconsin so that the analysis could be specific and concrete. This information should be helpful to state-level policy makers and legislators considering measures to increase the delivery of energy efficiency in their {{states as well as}} those considering how reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. There are, of course many things that states can do to increase the delivery of energy efficiency. Within the context of the U. S.

40|$|Cost-effectiveness {{in health}} care {{management}} is critical. The situation in debt-stricken Greece is further aggravated by the financial crisis and constant National Health System expense cut-downs. In an effort to minimize the cost of laparoscopy, our department introduced reusable laparoscopic instruments in December 2011. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess potential cost reduction of laparoscopic operations in the field of general surgery. Hospital records, invoice lists, and operative notes between January 2012 and December 2013, were retrospectively reviewed and data were collected on laparoscopic procedures, instrument failures, and replacement needs. Initial acquisition cost of 5 basic instrument sets was € 21, 422. Over the following 24 months, they were used in 623 operations, with a total maintenance cost of € 11, 487. Based on an average retail price of € 490 per set, projected cost with disposable instruments would amount to € 305, 270, creating savings of € 272, 361 over the two-year period under study. Despite the seemingly high purchase price, each set amortized its acquisition cost after only 9 procedures and instrument cost depreciated to less than € 55 per <b>case.</b> <b>Disposable</b> instruments cost 9 times more than reusable ones, and their high price would almost equal the total hospital reimbursement by social security funds for many common laparoscopic procedures...|$|R
