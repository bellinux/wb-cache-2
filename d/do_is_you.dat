2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E

40|$|Crop {{rotation}} - {{a double}} benefit Cue: If you mention organic farming, {{most people think}} of using compost and manure instead of chemical fertilizers. But there is much more to organic farming than that. One very important method for organic farmers is crop rotation. By planting a sequence of different crops over a period of three or four seasons, farmers can gain two major benefits: firstly, they can maintain the fertility of their soil; secondly, they can reduce the number of pests and diseases that attack their crops. To find out more about how crop rotation works, Eric Kadenge visited the Kenya Institute of Organic Farming, a centre which trains farmers and extension officers in organic farming practices. He spoke to the assistant director, Lois Chege, about the training her institute is providing, and the challenges that face organic farmers in Kenya. IN:		?Organic farming has different ? OUT:		? hope for the future. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 56 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That report was from Eric Kadenge at the Kenya Institute of Organic Farming. Transcript Chege	Organic farming has different techniques that we train the farmers and the extension staff, and most of these techniques involve tillage. The other main thing that we train people is about composting from different animals and also from vegetation. We have realised that to overcome the issue of pests and diseases we can only {{be able to do so}} effectively by using a crop rotation programme, so we advise depending on what types of crop are suitable for which area and which soils. Kadenge	Now I would be very interested in hearing one sequence of different crops in order to control pests. Chege	The first thing that you consider, you have to consider how fertile is your soil. By this you have to apply compost in your soil. Then after that you decide which part you want to put maybe a crop like maize. A crop like maize is a heavy feeder; it requires a lot of nutrients such that when it grows it will take away a lot of nutrients from the soil. So the following season that comes, you can not return to any crop that is in the family of heavy feeders, like kales or cabbage. What you will return to is a legume crop, because they are nitrogen fixers. That means they will be contributing towards the soil fertility in terms of nitrogen. Then the following season, you will come back with a moderate feeder; maybe tomatoes, maybe eggplants, peppers, they are moderate feeders. Then the final season you will have to put a light feeder, such as carrots or sweet potatoes. That is usually the sequence. But when you are also considering the following seasons to come, if you have grown an eggplant, you cannot replace the following season with a pepper, because they are in the same family. What you <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> have to look for a crop that is of a different family, that does not share the same pests and diseases. Why we are doing this is to break the pest and disease cycle that is always built up by farmers every year, all round. Kadenge	And how about the disadvantages that this kind of farming has; what are they? Chege	The first disadvantage that I will talk about is lack of market for organic produce. Most of our farmers have produce already in their farms which are organically grown, but they cannot find a market for organic products. This means they are selling their products to the common market. Organic foods or products should fetch a higher price because it is healthy food in itself, and at the moment our farmers are just fetching the local prices that are existing within our markets. So we are hoping that if we would have a certifying body, already we have started working on the organic Kenyan standards, and these standards are going to help our farmers to have regulations by which they should farm, and then if we have this certifying body, they will use the standards to certify the products for our farmers. Kadenge	So what you would like to see if a certifying body which is Kenyan? Chege	Yes. We as the organic farmers, we have tried to initiate such a body, and it is already registered; we call it Kenya Organic Farmers Association. And this is why we have initiated to start formulation of the Kenyan organic standards, so that in line with this, the Kenya Organic Farmers Association then can be able to be accredited by other bodies. At the moment the situation is that in Kenya we have no policy that promotes organic farming, so we are hoping this is going to take place. Kadenge	So to sum up, how would you say organic farming is doing here in Kenya in comparison to conventional farming? Chege	Organic farming here in Kenya is growing very fast. We used to be opposed, but now we are a friend to everybody. We have so many visitors visiting us, and this is a reflection to tell us that we have a broad future for this organic farming in Kenya. And if our government would open room and support this organic farming, it has a very positive room to grow. And if I compare it with conventional, conventional is declining in terms of, it has become very expensive for a local farmer to afford. For you to grow a crop in a farm, you have to really put a lot of inputs which a farmer is hardly affording, especially at this time when our economy is very low. So organic farming is the hope for the future. End of track.

40|$|The {{importance}} of enclosures Cue: The H 5 N 1 avian flu virus {{is not the}} first kind of avian flu to affect poultry flocks, either in Africa or other parts of the world. However, this particular strain of the virus is especially dangerous, because as well as affecting birds, it can also be passed to humans, and is often fatal. Once an outbreak occurs, the most effective way of preventing it from spreading is, currently, by destroying affected birds and preventing transfer of the virus outside the outbreak area. However this is an expensive and labour-intensive process. It is therefore much better to invest in protecting poultry flocks so that they are less like to catch the virus, than try to deal with outbreaks when they occur. So how can poultry, flocks be protected? For some diseases such as Newcastle disease, vaccinations are available. However, with avian flu the effectiveness of vaccines is less clear, and most countries are not adopting vaccination as a control strategy. Instead, poultry keepers are being advised to protect their flocks by housing their birds in some kind of enclosure or cage, and taking precautions to ensure that all food and water are disease-free. Dorothy Tumbo lives in Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, and keeps chickens in an enclosure, called a fowl run, in her backyard. She spoke to Sylvia Jiyane about how this helps to protect her birds, and began by explaining how, on one occasion when some of her birds got sick, she took them to a local veterinary clinic. The vets feared they might have a form of avian flu, although not the H 5 N 1 strain, which has not yet occurred in Zimbabwe. IN:		?At one time I had about 50 ?? OUT:		??more if they are infected. ? DUR?N:	 6 ? 51 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Celia Abolnik, a senior research assistant from a veterinary institute in South Africa, was talking to Lucas Moloi. Earlier we heard Sylvia Jiyane interviewing urban poultry keeper Dorothy Tumbo. The interviews come from a radio resource pack on avian flu produced by CTA. Transcript Tumbo	At one time I had about 50 that I had taken, and over 30 actually died because of avian flu. What actually happened is that the other person, who was about five houses away from where I was, had their chickens actually dying. And then mine also started dying and when we took our chicks to the vet, that was when we were told there was an outbreak of a disease actually around our area. They thought it was avian flu, and they also suspected it could be Newcastle, but we left them with the chicks so they could actually test. These guys, the people from the vet, also encouraged us to clean our fowl runs. If one group of poultry is ready for market you remove it, then you have to clean your fowl run and spray it with chemicals before you put a new batch of poultry into the fowl run. You find that if you keep on doing that you find that cleaning, you have to be clean, you have to spray your fowl runs, and {{you have to make sure}} that the water and all the vaccines are given to the poultry, and also make sure that the eating utensils are clean, and there is a clean supply of water. That way you eliminate the diseases, but if you are not very careful then you will see that the chicks or the poultry will actually start to just die and if you don?t realise it at the end of the day you won?t have anything left, because all of them will be attacked by the diseases. Jiyane	That brings us to the point of access to the poultry house. In your own experience, maybe at your house, who normally accesses the poultry enclosure? Tumbo	Actually I have got one person who is managing that, sort of a worker, a woman I employed, and she?s the one who is actually feeding those chickens. You look at the number of chickens you are having, and then you have to make sure that you have enough feeding trays that will cover, so that at least you don?t keep on going into the fowl run now and again to replace the feed that will be finished. What you have to do, you have to look at them well measured, to say that at least if I?ve got these big, five or six big containers, and if I put in the morning, it means the next time I will put the feed will be in the evening, so that at least you limit the number of going in and out to about twice a day only, and with only one person going in to replace the water the feed, and everything. So you have to have feeding trays and water points which are almost enough to last a full day, or about 12 hours, before you go in there. Jiyane	And besides the risks of diseases, like we have mentioned avian flu, Newcastle and other diseases, what could be the other risks of keeping poultry in the backyard? Tumbo	Yes the other risks, especially in urban areas is there are a lot of thieves, and if people realise that there is poultry that is being kept there, they would want to come and actually steal them when they are almost ready. So you fowl run has to be quite strong, and if possible put some burglar bars, and also make sure that it is always under lock and key so that people don?t access your chickens. Otherwise, besides the thieves the other risk is mainly that one we have talked about of diseases. Because if all those are eliminated it is quite a viable business which can actually generate a lot of income for people. Jiyane	And finally, Dorothy, in the event of a disease outbreak in poultry enclosures, what are the practical steps that one should take to prevent the disease from spreading? Tumbo	If you have noticed that, especially maybe the first thing you have to see is maybe you can see one animal dropping dead, and then you see another maybe showing signs that it is not well. What you have to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> have to remove them, actually isolate them, remove those birds that you see are not well. Remove them and put them somewhere away and actually observe. If it keeps on going then you have to seek advice from other people, like what I said in the beginning that we ended up taking the birds to the vet, so that at least they can test to see what it was that was affecting the chickens. NARR	While keeping backyard poultry in enclosures may be possible for urban poultry keepers like Dorothy, what about for those in villages, whose chickens normally scavenge for food around the homesteads? Should they also be kept in an enclosure? In areas where the risk of avian flu is high ? for example because of the presence of migratory birds ? keeping all poultry in some kind of house or enclosure is definitely recommended. To find out more about how, and why this should be done, Lucas Moloi spoke to Celia Abolnik, a senior research assistant at the Arc-Onderstepport Veterinary Institute in Pretoria, South Africa. Moloi	In areas affected by the avian flu, what are the advantages of keeping poultry in fenced enclosures? Abolnik	Obviously if your birds are fenced they are separated from birds that are free ranging that might be carrying infectious diseases. In the ideal situation you would want an enclosed structure, but the best thing to do is not to leave open food and water that will attract wild birds into contact with chickens. So the sharing of food and water is probably the major way in which wild birds, or free ranging birds are encouraged into contact with poultry. Moloi	So is there a particular material and design to construct a safe enclosure? Abolnik	It must be bird proof, it must be rat proof. The water must be, and the feed must be separated from any contact with birds and rodents from outside. Moloi	Some poultry keepers may not afford expensive material and design. What should they do to protect their poultry? Abolnik	You could use inexpensive materials to build an enclosure that is rat and bird proof. Moloi	Like? Abolnik	Mud bricks, grass, sheet metal, anything that they have access to. Moloi	Should there be restrictions on who to enter poultry enclosures in areas affected by the avian flu? Abolnik	Definitely. A poultry owner should not allow any person just to walk into his poultry enclosure, especially since they may be carrying infected poultry or wild bird faeces on their person, their boots, their shoes, their clothes, their hands, and handling of birds might transmit the disease in that way. Moloi	Is there a special diet that poultry could be fed with to reduce chances of contracting the avian flu? Abolnik	There is no special diet that will prevent them getting avian flu, although the {{importance of}} good nutrition is vital, because birds that are immuno-suppressed, birds that have a very weak immune system, sometimes due to hunger, or because they are not getting all the nutrients, might be more predisposed to infections, and might suffer and die more if they are infected.
