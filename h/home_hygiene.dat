5000|$|Although media {{coverage}} of the hygiene hypothesis has declined, a strong ‘collective mindset’ has become established that dirt is ‘healthy’ and hygiene somehow ‘unnatural’. This has caused concern among health professionals that everyday life hygiene behaviours, which are the foundation of public health, are being undermined. In response to the need for effective hygiene in home and everyday life settings, the International Scientific Forum on <b>Home</b> <b>Hygiene</b> has developed a [...] "risk-based" [...] or targeted approach to <b>home</b> <b>hygiene</b> that seeks to ensure that hygiene measures are focussed on the places, and at the times most critical for infection transmission. Whilst targeted hygiene was originally developed as an effective approach to hygiene practice, it also seeks, as far as possible, to sustain [...] "normal" [...] levels of exposure to the microbial flora of our environment to the extent that is important to build a balanced immune system.|$|E
50|$|Hygiene in {{home and}} {{everyday}} life settings {{plays an important}} part in preventing spread of infectious diseases. It includes procedures used in a variety of domestic situations such as hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, food and water hygiene, general <b>home</b> <b>hygiene</b> (hygiene of environmental sites and surfaces), care of domestic animals, and home healthcare (the care of those who are at greater risk of infection).|$|E

Compared to typically-developing {{children}}, {{children with}} special health care needs (CHSCN) {{are at increased risk}} for poor oral health including dental decay. Facilitators and barriers to twice daily tooth brushing among pre-school aged CSHCN were examined to identify modifiable caregiver behaviors or beliefs that could improve the oral health of CSHCN. Methods. Ninety caregivers of CSHCN, ages 23 to 62 months, were interviewed about <b>home</b> oral <b>hygiene</b> routines and what interferes with, and supports, a habit of twice-daily brushing. Results. Nearly all (98 %) caregivers had begun brushing their child's teeth {{at the time of the}} interview. Of those, 50 % reported twice daily brushing of child's teeth. Caregivers identified having a variety of tooth brushing supplies as a support to twice daily brushing (p =. 02). Caregivers who reported a lack of tooth brushing skills were less likely to brush their child's teeth twice daily (p =. 02). Conclusions. Overall, the facilitators and barriers in this study were also identified by parents of typically-developing children. Enhancing caregivers' <b>home</b> oral <b>hygiene</b> skills and interprofessional opportunities to provide anticipatory guidance on caregiver tooth brushing skills should continue to be studied and optimized...|$|R

50|$|Oral health can be {{difficult}} for pet owners and veterinary teams to manage in cats, particularly for pets whose owners are not committed to regular teeth brushing and/or dental treats. It is critical that veterinarians and pet experts educate owners to the benefits of supporting good oral health. Oral disease is common among cats, and may lead to other health issues such as bacterial infections of major organs including the heart, kidneys and liver. Dietary selection, along with at <b>home</b> dental <b>hygiene</b> care, allows cat owners to influence the oral status of their pets.|$|R

5000|$|Good <b>home</b> <b>hygiene</b> means {{targeting}} {{hygiene procedures}} at critical points, at appropriate times, {{to break the}} chain of infection i.e. to eliminate germs before they can spread further. Because the [...] "infectious dose" [...] for some pathogens can be very small (10-100 viable units, or even less for some viruses), and infection can result from direct transfer from surfaces via hands or food to the mouth, nasal mucosa or the eye, 'hygienic cleaning' procedures should be sufficient to eliminate pathogens from critical surfaces.

50|$|The International Scientific Forum on <b>Home</b> <b>Hygiene</b> has {{developed}} a risk management approach to reducing home infection risks. This approach uses microbiological and epidemiological evidence to identify the key routes of infection transmission in the home. These data indicate that the critical routes involve the hands, hand and food contact surfaces and cleaning utensils. Clothing and household linens involve somewhat lower risks. Surfaces that contact the body, such as baths and hand basins, can act as infection vehicles, as can surfaces associated with toilets. Airborne transmission can be important for some pathogens. A key aspect {{of this approach is}} that it maximises protection against pathogens and infection, but is more relaxed about visible cleanliness in order to sustain normal exposure to other human, animal and environmental microbes.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} literature on the effect of providing oral healthcare education to care home nurses on their oral healthcare knowledge and attitude and their oral hygiene care skills. METHODS: A literature search was obtained for relevant articles on oral healthcare education of nurses in care homes, using five electronic retrieval systems and databases. The search was limited to human studies, articles published in English and articles published during the period January 1990 to December 2011. The methodological quality of an article was assessed on the basis of criteria published by the Cochrane Collaboration. For articles not meeting all methodological quality criteria, relevance criteria were used to determine how much scientific evidence could be assigned to the study findings. RESULTS: In accordance with the methodological quality criteria, two randomized controlled trials were included. Additionally, four studies were included after determining the scientific evidence of the study findings. The studies included revealed some scientific evidence and indications that an oral healthcare education programme for care home nurses may improve the nurses' oral healthcare knowledge and attitude. Any effect of oral healthcare education to care <b>home</b> nurses' oral <b>hygiene</b> care skills could not be determined. CONCLUSIONS: Oral healthcare education may {{have a positive effect on}} care home nurses' oral healthcare knowledge and attitude and on care <b>home</b> residents' oral <b>hygiene,</b> whereas any effect on care <b>home</b> nurses' oral <b>hygiene</b> care skills could not be found...|$|R
5000|$|At present, these {{components}} of hygiene {{tend to be}} regarded as separate issues, although all are based on the same underlying microbiological principles. Preventing the spread of infectious diseases means breaking the chain of infection transmission. The simple principle is that, if the chain of infection is broken, infection cannot spread. In response to the need for effective codes of hygiene in home and everyday life settings the International Scientific Forum on <b>Home</b> <b>Hygiene</b> has developed a risk-based approach based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), which {{has come to be known}} as [...] "targeted hygiene". Targeted hygiene is based on identifying the routes of spread of pathogens in the home, and applying hygiene procedures at critical points at appropriate times to break the chain of infection.|$|E
5000|$|Laundry {{detergents}} {{contain a}} mix of ingredients including surfactants, builders, optical brighteners, etc. Cleaning action arises primarily from {{the action of the}} surfactants and other ingredients, which are designed to maximise release and suspension of dirt and microbes into the wash liquid, together with enzymes and/or an activated oxygen-based bleach which digest and remove stains. Although activated oxygen bleach is included in many powder detergents to digest and remove stains, it also produces some chemical inactivation of bacteria, fungi and viruses. As a rule of thumb, powders and tablets normally contain an activated oxygen bleach, but liquids, and all products (liquid or powder) used for [...] "coloureds" [...] do not. Surfactants also exert some chemical inactivation action against certain species although the extent of their action is not known. [...] In 2013 the International Scientific Forum on <b>Home</b> <b>Hygiene</b> (IFH) reviewed some 30 studies of the hygiene effectiveness of laundering at various temperatures ranging from room temperature to 70 °C, under varying conditions. A key finding was the lack of standardisation and control within studies, and the variability in test conditions between studies such as wash cycle time, number of rinses etc. The consequent variability in the data (i.e. the reduction in contamination on fabrics) obtained, in turn makes it extremely difficult to propose guidelines for laundering with any confidence, based on currently available data. As a result, there is significant variability in the recommendations for hygienic laundering of clothing etc. given by different agencies.|$|E
40|$|<b>Home</b> <b>hygiene</b> plays a {{significant}} role in well-being and health of consumers. It is linked with the nature and quality of household practices and of the household technical system. At the same time the impact of the level of <b>home</b> <b>hygiene</b> on well-being and human health is related to demographic parameters such as percentage of elderly and family organisation and composition. In this paper the impact of some demographic, social and technological changes on the level of <b>home</b> <b>hygiene</b> is discussed. In conjunction the interaction between housekeeping and the achievement of <b>home</b> <b>hygiene</b> is elaborated. If the level of <b>home</b> <b>hygiene</b> alters, a household will try to adjust their practices such that a desired level of hygiene is regained. For that correction process a household needs reliable information about the actual hygiene situation. It is discussed how the validity of the traditional hygiene indicators is fading away and how this may affect public health. Key conclusions: Demographic changes in the upcoming decades will lead to an increasing number of people with a greater propensity for infection. Changes in the micro-social system, housekeeping, will lead to a decrease in housekeeping hygiene and therefore to an increased exposure to micro-organisms. Innovative, sustainable technology in housekeeping will lead in some circumstances to a lower level of hygiene in housekeeping. The traditional hygiene-indicators in housekeeping lose their validity when housekeeping cannot anticipate the changes in the level of hygiene. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

30|$|A {{significant}} proportion of the world’s population uses potable water for drinking, cooking, personal and <b>home</b> <b>hygiene</b> (WHO 2004). However, there has been a growing concern among the general public with respect to the safety and aesthetic qualities of potable water supplies.

Potable water released into the distribution system becomes altered during its passage through pipes, open reservoirs, standpipes and storage tanks.|$|E
40|$|Hygiene {{refers to}} the science of the {{establishment}} and maintenance of (human) health. In everyday life, hygiene is closely associated with good housekeeping, This article will focus on <b>home</b> <b>hygiene</b> in relation to cleaning, on microorganisms, and on sustainable development of domestic technology. In domestic cleaning there are two beneficial effects: the aesthetic aspects of cleanness {{and the removal of}} microorganisms. In cleaning science substantial attention is paid to the interrelation between cleaning and removal of microorganisms. It appears that the parameters of the cleaning process and the detergent properties {{play a significant role in}} this interrelation. Changing technology to reduce the environmental impact of household cleaning not only influences the household activities and the functional performance of the cleaning processes but also has an impact on the level of hygiene. Results are presented of research in which the hygiene has been evaluated in relation to such changes. One option recently studied to reduce the environmental impact of households is the reduction of water consumption by water reuse. In such concepts water is used in successive steps for various processes before it is drained.
