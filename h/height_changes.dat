25|$|The Official History {{records that}} the AA {{artillery}} in Tobruk was 'incessantly in action against attacks of all kinds, from all heights, but especially by dive-bombers'. The regimental historian notes that these Stuka attacks concentrated on gun positions, {{which was a}} serious threat to HAA sites, whose instruments could not cope with the rapid <b>height</b> <b>changes.</b> The gunners devised a tactic of opening fire with short fuzes just before the dive started, to force the pilots to fly through a ring of bursts. The battery cooks, drivers and clerks then joined in, firing machine-guns and captured 20mm Breda guns. This aggressive method was known as 'Porcupine', and was so effective that the Luftwaffe changed to high-level bombing. Each mobile HAA troop established at least one alternative site and the guns were regularly switched between them, the empty sites being rigged up as dummies. The two available gun laying (GL Mk I) radar sets had to be positioned away from the vulnerable gun sites and used for early warning to supplement the single RAF radar, and a ring of searchlights operated round the harbour at night. Harbour defence was by pre-arranged barrages by five of the six HAA troops, the sixth troop remaining on watch for other raiders. 152 Battery dug in west of the harbour engaged 1000 enemy aircraft in a six-month period. 4th AA Brigade recorded that there was a steady decline in numbers of aircraft attacking as the siege went on, with the attackers switching to high-level and night attacks. In the last two months of the siege, troops of HAA guns took it in turn to move out to the perimeter and take on ground targets under the control of 9th Australian Division. Their long-range harassing fire made up for the shortage of medium artillery. In September 1941, the batteries of 51st HAA Rgt were relieved and left Tobruk by sea to rejoin RHQ for rest and refit in Palestine.|$|E

40|$|Studies of the {{response}} of ice sheets to climate change require data sets with high accuracy and uniform ice-sheet coverage. The most common technique used in analyzing satellite altimetry data to study <b>height</b> <b>change</b> in the ice sheets is the dH/dt technique based on the cross-over geometry. In this thesis two alternative techniques to cross-overs are studied and applied to all ERS radar and ICESat laser altimetry data to study <b>height</b> <b>change</b> in Antarctica. The first technique, block kriging, uses all available data to build a statistical model of the elevation field. Results of <b>height</b> rate of <b>changes</b> dh/dt ill Antarctica for the years 1995 - 2001 produced using block kriging and cross-over analysis are compared. In the Amery Ice Shelf and in the West Antarctic coastal area and near latitude - 81 °N, the difference in dh/dt between the two methods are statistically significant. A second technique combines kriging and Kalman filtering to allow for time evolutions of the <b>height</b> <b>change</b> rate and other parameters used {{in the description of}} the surface elevation field. An application of the technique to laser altimetry data from the current NASA's ICESat mission shows the potential of the technique in detecting <b>height</b> <b>change.</b> (cont.) In addition, the method can potentially characterize surface elevation in Antarctica at small horizontal scales of the order of the laser footprint size. The quality of laser altimetry data at the present is not sufficient for <b>height</b> <b>change</b> detection at the accuracy level of 2 cm/yr required for studying mass balance in Antarctica. by An Thanh-Thuy Nguyen.

"While the defects {{were not}} {{prohibitive}} and the Mark 33 remained in production until fairly late in World War II, the Bureau started {{the development of}} an improved director in 1936, only 2 years after the first installation of a Mark 33. The objective of weight reduction was not met, since the resulting director system actually weighed about 8000 pounds more than the equipment it was slated to replace, but the Gun Director Mark 37 that emerged from the program possessed virtues that more than compensated for its extra weight. Though the gun orders it provided were the same as those of the Mark 33, it supplied them with greater reliability and gave generally improved performance with 5-inch gun batteries, whether they were used for surface or antiaircraft use. Moreover, the stable element and computer, instead of being contained in the director housing were installed below deck where they were less vulnerable to attack and less of a jeopardy to a ship's stability. The design provided for the ultimate addition of radar, which later permitted blind firing with the director. In fact, the Mark 37 system was almost continually improved. By the end of 1945 the equipment had run through 92 modifications—almost twice the total number of directors of that type which were in the fleet on December 7, 1941. Procurement ultimately totalled 841 units, representing an investment of well over $148,000,000. Destroyers, cruisers, battleships, carriers, and many auxiliaries used the directors, with individual installations varying from one aboard destroyers to four on each battleship. The development of the Gun Directors Mark 33 and 37 provided the United States Fleet with good long range fire control against attacking planes. But while that had seemed the most pressing problem at the time the equipments were placed under development, it was but one part of the total problem of air defense. At close-in ranges the accuracy of the directors fell off sharply; even at intermediate ranges they left much to be desired. The weight and size of the equipments militated against rapid movement, making them difficult to shift from one target to another.Their efficiency was thus in inverse proportion to the proximity of danger."
