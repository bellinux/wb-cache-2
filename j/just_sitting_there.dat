Conversely, [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] describes a girl furious after a break-up.

In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, [...] "with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted."

[...] "To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [...] love of Tim McGraw's music." [...] Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, rather than McGraw as a person.

The album was assembled from many hours of improvised instrumentation that Hollis and Friese-Greene had edited and arranged using digital equipment. The result was a mix of rock, jazz, classical, and ambient music. Critically praised, the album reached the UK Top 20 and was certified Silver by the BPI for sales of over 60,000 copies.
