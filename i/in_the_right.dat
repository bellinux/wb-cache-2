500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman is an {{extension}} of Wollstonecraft's arguments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Men. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Men, as the title suggests, she is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> of particular men (18th-century British men) while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman, she is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> afforded to [...] "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter of <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman addresses the issue of natural rights and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. <b>The</b> <b>Rights</b> of Woman thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|R

5|$|T-26 model 1931 with gun plus {{machine gun}} armament: twin-turreted version with a 37mm gun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> turret (some modern sources mention this tank as T-26 model 1932). There were two models of 37mm {{guns in the}} USSR {{suitable}} for mounting in light tanks at that time—the Hotchkiss gun (or its Soviet improved variant PS-1), and the more powerful PS-2 gun developed by P. Syachentov. The latter was superior, but only experimental models existed. Therefore, the first 10 pre-production T-26s, which had a design identical to the Vickers 6-Ton, were equipped with a Hotchkiss gun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> turret to increase firepower compared to the machine gun armed Vickers tank. The experimental PS-2 gun was mounted on only three T-26 tanks, the right turrets of which were replaced with small gun turrets from the T-35-1 (prototype of the T-35 heavy tank).|$|E

5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties {{into the upper}} back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of}} the opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E
