40|$|Enrichment culture {{techniques}} {{produced more}} than 1200 isolates of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that were screened for antifungal activity against the <b>indicator</b> <b>mould</b> Aspergillus fumigatus. Approximately 10 % of the LAB were active, but only 4 % had medium or strong activity in an agar plate assay. The majority of isolates with strong antifungal activity were Lactobacillus coryniformis strains, but Lactobacillus plantarum and Pediococcus pentosaceus were also frequently identified. Some of the isolates lost activity during storage but most maintained their fungal inhibitory effect. Large variations in sensitivity were observed between different moulds and yeasts. Antifungal cyclic dipeptides and phenyllactic acid were detected in culture filtrates from several of the LAB isolates. Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. coryniformis strain Si 3 produced an antifungal compound that lost activity when treated with proteinases. The antifungal peptide(s) was heat stable, with a size of approx. 3 kDa and had maximum activity at pH 3. 0 to 4. 5. Addition of ethanol to the growth medium of strain Si 3 prevented a decline in observed antifungal activity during the stationary phase. Glycerol addition to agar plates with L. coryniformis strains, overlaid with soft agar suspensions of yeast cells or fungal spores, strongly enhanced the antifungal effect. This was particularly true with spoilage moulds and yeasts, e. g. Penicillium roqueforti and Pichia anomala, not normally affected by the antifungal metabolites of L. coryniformis. Chemical and genetic data suggested that reuterin (3 -hydroxypropionaldehyde) {{was the cause of}} this effect. The glycerol/diol dehydratase operon of L. coryniformis was partially elucidated and found to be similar to that Lactobacillus collinoides. Bioassay-guided isolation of new metabolites from LAB revealed that Lactobacillus plantarum MiLAB 14 produces hydroxylated fatty acids with strong antifungal effects. 3 -Hydroxydecanoic acid, 3 -hydroxydodecanoic acid, 3 -hydroxytetradecanoic acid and 3 -hydroxy- 5 -cis-dodecenoic acid were characterized from the supernatant of MiLAB 14. The hydroxy fatty acids had total inhibitory effects in the range 10 to > 100 µg ml- 1 against several moulds and yeasts...|$|E
30|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to assess the {{possibility}} of detecting the activity of moulds on the historical objects based on the measurements of MVOCs carried out with the SPME–GC–MS method which has been previously developed and optimized for this measurement [19]. This study will also reveal the information about the applicability of the new method. The investigations were accomplished for selected species of moulds, which were inoculated onto various types of model samples and one real historical sample. After a specific time of incubation, the MVOCs emitted by the fungi were analysed in the GC–MS set. For the acquired chromatograms, a qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed in order to ascertain whether the identified compounds included <b>indicators</b> of <b>moulds</b> activity which might be used to detect fungi growing on actual historical objects.|$|R
30|$|Mould {{growth is}} a complex process, {{facilitated}} by the co-presence of certain hygrothermal conditions, often defined {{in the form of}} species-/substrate specific temperature and relative humidity isopleths [5], which, if no other data are available, are frequently used for the appraisal of an indoor environment’s susceptibility to mould growth (e.g. [6, 7]). Other methods of assessing the mould growth potential include performance models based on dose–response functions developed for certain materials [8 – 10]. A more detailed analysis of mould presence and intensity in the air or on a surface of a given indoor environment, however, requires direct testing [11]. There are many analytical techniques {{that can be used to}} measure mould levels, including culture-based, microscopic, chemical and immunoassay methods, and more recently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods, each with their respective strengths and biases (see [12] for a review of various techniques). In this study we apply a chemical method which uses the quantification of N-acetylhexosaminidase (NAHA) activity to measure mould levels. NAHA has been found to be a reliable <b>indicator</b> of <b>mould</b> cell biomass, with high sensitivity and specificity [13 – 17]. The method allows both for surface and air examination, and was previously shown to be effective in the investigation of mould levels within heritage buildings [18].|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} radiation and refrigeration {{on the shelf}} life of hilsa, Tanualosa ilisha was studied by monitoring the microbiological, chemical and sensory changes of unirradiated and irradiated fish samples using low dose irradiation, doses of 300 krad, 600 krad and 900 krad. Irradiation (900 krad) dramatically reduced population of bacteria, namely total viable counts 48. 850 cfu per gm for unirradiated, 31. 850 cfu per gm and 19. 600 cfu per gm of 300 krad and 600 krad, respectively. The effect was more pronounced at the higher dose (900 krad), total viable count were 14. 100 cfu per gm. Another microbial <b>indicator</b> total <b>mould</b> counts (TMC) was 8. 750 cfu per gm, 6. 350 cfu per gm, and 19. 600 cfu per gm for 300 krad and 600 krad, respectively. The effect was more pronounced at the higher dose (900 krad) where total viable counts were 14, 100 cfu per gm. Total volatile nitrogen values increased slowly attaining a value of 101. 02 mgN per 100 gm for unirradiated T. ilisha during refrigerated storage, whereas for irradiated fish, lower values of 71. 13, 59. 33 and 47. 03 mgN per 100 gm muscle were recorded. Sensory evaluation showed a good correlation with bacterial populations {{on the basis of}} overall acceptability scores...|$|R
40|$|From a broad {{overview}} of business management literature, the proposition emerged that strategic conditions within an organisation can translate into sustainable business development outcomes. However, in the rapidly evolving business environment, {{the quest to}} grow or sustain competitive advantage demands that business practices become more proactive, creative and innovative. Globalisation and technological advances drive the need for innovation within a business context and the resultant rapid pace of change demands that businesses adopt a customer-focused entrepreneurial orientation to accommodate this need for innovation. This study investigated whether the principles of marketing, business management tools {{and management of the}} customer-base could be incorporated as key drivers to develop innovative and creative tactics that could serve as viable solutions to sustain business development strategies of automotive refinish paint distributors. An initial step in this research comprised a theoretical overview of the internal business environment as a system of the enterprise that aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the organisation, which could be applied to support strategic business goals and objectives. The literature review further entailed an investigation and explorations regarding best practices that automotive refinish paint distributors could follow in order to identify, focus on and develop their source of competitive advantage, sustainability and profitability. From the literature review, a methodological framework was developed that could be applied to specific success <b>indicators,</b> <b>moulded</b> to produce distinctive competencies in the automotive refinish paint industry; defining a significant foundation from which the objectives of this study could be researched. The study adopted the qualitative research approach and focused on a single case of a refinish paint distributor. The reason for selecting the case study method is that an entire organisation could be investigated in depth with particular attention to detail. A detailed questionnaire was drawn up in order to conduct face-to-face interviews with selected respondents, based on the profound expertise of the selected personnel. This was done to enable the researcher to assess the prevalent elements of business sustainability applied by the automotive refinish distributor to enhance their competitive advantage. The design of the empirical element of this study, aimed at providing a blueprint that would enable the researcher to structure the research problem {{in such a way that}} the outcome of the study would be valid, objective and reliable. Due to the qualitative nature of this study, the results are interpreted through inductive reasoning, observations, projective and participatory approaches all of which are integrated into a comprehensive model indicating key drivers to promote, improve and facilitate the business sustainability of the automotive refinish paint distributor. A range of recommendations and managerial implications extracted from the results of the empirical study are presented in the final chapter...|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} of the microbial volatiles {{was focused on the}} compounds with eight carbons in their chains, the so-called C 8 -complex MVOCs [31], particularly the alcohols: 1 -octen- 3 -ol, and 3 -octanol; and ketones: 1 -octen- 3 -one, 2 -octanone and 3 -octanone because they are <b>indicators</b> of the <b>moulds</b> activity, as it was mentioned in the introduction [22, 25, 30, 31]. These compounds are released in high concentrations and are adequate for detecting the metabolic activity of many species [22, 30, 43]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated in the literature that some enzymatic pathways are finished at other volatile products like heptanone and hexanone beside or instead of the C 8 compounds [31]. Other authors have also shown that terpenes and sesquiterpenes are useful bioindicators of the mould activity [28, 44]. Thus, it can be determined that all of the aforementioned groups of compounds are bioindicators {{that can be used for}} the detection of the vegetative mycelium because they distinguish between active and inactive fungi.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the content of {{ergosterol}} in different microorganisms (bacteria, yeasts and moulds) isolated from the air as well as in six species of moulds in their different morphological forms—live mycelium, dead myce-lium, and spores. Evaluation of the level of mould contamination of the air in various places using culture method and ergosterol determination was also per-formed. The analysis of ergosterol was carried out by gas chromatography equipped with flame ionisation detector. For evaluation of the results, analysis of variance and multiple comparison test were used. The quantity of ergosterol in the spores of various species of mould was in the range 1. 9 – 9. 4 pg/spore. The presence of yeasts and bacteria in the air does not significantly affect ergosterol concentration, in view of the low content of that sterol in their cells (max. 0. 009 pg/cell for bacteria and 0. 39 pg/cell for yeast). An ergosterol concentration above 1 ng per m 3 can be considered an <b>indicator</b> of excessive <b>mould</b> contam-ination of indoor air. Based on determination of ergosterol in the air of mouldy rooms the result obtained may be compared with the culture method, due to the 1, 000 times higher concentration of ergosterol in the mycelium compared with spores. However, in the analysis of outdoor air, in view of the presence of mould mainly in the form of spores and the degradation of ergosterol by UV radiation, analysis of that compound may indicate a lower level of contam-ination compared with the culture method...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDwellings {{showing a}} {{presence}} of moulds {{are considered to}} be unhealthy both by the inhabitants and by sanitary authorities. Although the thresholds of pathogenicity have not yet been established, the toxic, allergic and infectious risk of indoor moulds is better understood today. A study on indoor fungi contamination for 128 dwellings was done between October and May in France. It concerned 69 dwellings, the occupants of which either complained to the sanitary authorities about problems of moulds and humidity or consulted a doctor who related their symptoms to housing conditions. Fifty-nine other dwellings, the occupants of which were healthy, constituted the control group. We present the statistical analysis of questionnaires, which aimed to clarify characteristics of dwellings associated with high concentrations of airborne moulds. Air samples were taken with an impactor in 500 rooms. On visiting dwellings, investigators obtained answers to 25 questions concerning characteristics of inhabitants and living space, as well as the presence of <b>mould</b> <b>indicators.</b> Indoor and outdoor temperature and indoor relative humidity of air measurements were taken. The total concentration of fungi in the air was significantly higher in ground floor apartments versus those on other floors (p = 0. 047), in small and highly occupied dwellings (p = 0. 03 and 0. 003), in dwellings with electric heating (p = 0. 04), without a ventilation system (p = 0. 003), with water damage (p = 0. 003), and finally, in those where the investigator noted an odour of moisture or visible moulds (p < 0. 001). The efficacy of the latter criteria in the evaluation of insalubrity is discussed...|$|R
