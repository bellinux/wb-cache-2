50|$|Most {{chestnut}} wood production {{is done by}} coppice systems, cut on a 12-year rotation to provide small timber which does not split as badly as large logs. In southern England (particularly in Kent), sweet chestnut has traditionally been grown as coppices, being recut every 10 years or so on rotation for poles used for firewood, <b>fencing</b> (<b>fence</b> posts and chestnut paling), and especially to support the strings up when hops are grown.|$|E

50|$|A kind {{of memory}} barrier which {{separates}} one buffer {{from the rest}} of the memory is called a <b>fence.</b> <b>Fences</b> are there to ensure that a buffer is not being overwritten before rendering and display operations have completed on it. Implicit <b>fencing</b> is used for synchronization between graphics drivers and the GPU hardware. The <b>fence</b> signals when a buffer is no longer being used by one component so it can be operated on or reused by another. In the past the Linux kernel had an implicit <b>fencing</b> mechanism, where a <b>fence</b> is directly attached to a buffer (cf. GEM handles and FDs), but userspace is unaware of this. Explicit <b>fencing</b> exposes <b>fences</b> to userspace, where userspace gets <b>fences</b> from both the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem and from the GPU. Explicit <b>fencing</b> is required by Vulkan and offers advantages for tracing and debugging.|$|R

5000|$|Emil Beck {{was born}} in Tauberbischofsheim, in the Main-Tauber-District of Baden-Württemberg in Germany on 12 July 1935. The former hairdresser Emil Beck began in the mid 1950s with <b>fencing.</b> <b>Fencing</b> scenes from the movie The Three Musketeers had {{impressed}} the young man. In 1954 Emil Beck was the [...] "founding father" [...] of the Fencing-Club Tauberbischofsheim.

5|$|Sheep {{producers}} {{have used a}} wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and <b>fencing.</b> <b>Fencing</b> (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used. More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.|$|R
50|$|A split-rail <b>fence</b> or log <b>fence</b> (also {{known as}} a zigzag <b>fence,</b> worm <b>fence</b> or snake <b>fence</b> {{historically}} due to its meandering layout) {{is a type of}} <b>fence</b> constructed in the United States and Canada, and is made out of timber logs, usually split lengthwise into rails and typically used for agricultural or decorative <b>fencing.</b> Such <b>fences</b> require much more timber than other types of <b>fences,</b> and so are generally only common in areas where wood is abundant. However, they are very simple in their construction, and can be assembled with few tools even on hard or rocky ground. They also can be built without using any nails or other hardware; such hardware was often scarce in frontier areas. They are particularly popular in very rocky areas where post hole digging is almost impossible. They can even be partially or wholly disassembled if the <b>fence</b> needs to be moved or the wood becomes more useful for other purposes. During the American Civil War, these split rail <b>fences</b> were a major source of firewood for both the Union and Confederate armies.|$|R
