2500|$|Researchers and {{practitioners}} <b>in</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> contend that, if education were {{to follow the}} medical maxim of [...] "first, do no harm," [...] then no further justification would be required for providing resources for gifted education as they believe gifted children to be at-risk.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare early-adolescent girls <b>in</b> <b>gifted</b> and general <b>education</b> {{programs}} on constructs related to gender-role stereotyping. Participants included 132 girls <b>in</b> a <b>gifted</b> program and 77 girls in general education. All partici-pants were in grades 6 - 8. Because the gifted group was significantly higher in socioeconomic status than the general education group. this variable was covaried in the analyses. Results showed that girls <b>in</b> the <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> program held stronger self-perceptions of instrumentality (or steteotypically masculine personal-ity attributes). evidenced higher achievement motivation, were less traditional in their career aspirations, and were more liberal toward the rights and roles of women than their peers in general education. The two groups did not differ significantly on self-perceptions of expressiveness (or stereotypically feminine personality traits). degree of competitiveness. or fear of success. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding differences in gender-role stereotyping and achieve-ment-related choices between girls <b>in</b> <b>gifted</b> and general <b>education</b> programs...|$|R
2500|$|Based on data {{collected}} in 1921–22, Terman concluded that gifted children suffered no more health problems than normal for their age, save {{a little more}} myopia than average. [...] He {{also found that the}} children were usually social, were well-adjusted, did better in school, and were even taller than average. A follow-up performed in 1923–1924 found that the children had maintained their high IQs and were still above average overall as a group. Data collected in the 1920s also including a pioneering effort to implement above-level testing on a large scale, a practice that is widespread <b>in</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> today.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 Language {{minority}} Students (LMS) {{constitute an}} indispensable component <b>in</b> the <b>gifted</b> <b>education.</b> Over the years, {{research has indicated}} that a culturally responsive (Gay, 2000) curriculum would benefits LMS in various aspects, where after-school programs, serve as the Community of Practice (COP) (Gutierrez et. al., 1995), places unique role on those highly capable LMS. LMS <b>in</b> the <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> could be motivated through the heritage language instruction in the after-school program. This thesis reveals that highly capable elementary students who attended the community based after-school program are motivated in class performance, in curiosity, and in communication for knowledge when proper instruction of heritage language is given in the program. This study takes place in a suburban town within the greater Seattle area, in the State of Washington. A two-week observation was conducted as the author works there. This research provides implications for both educators and parents that heritage language instruction is better received if casual pedagogical approaches are implemented and more study time is allotted...|$|R
5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness {{is that there}} is no generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although there is no scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants <b>in</b> school <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> programs. <b>In</b> practice, many school districts in the United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion <b>in</b> school <b>gifted</b> programs.|$|R
50|$|Test anxiety {{can also}} be labeled as anticipatory anxiety, {{situational}} anxiety or evaluation anxiety. Some anxiety is normal and often helpful to stay mentally and physically alert. When one experiences too much anxiety, however, it can result in emotional or physical distress, difficulty concentrating, and emotional worry. Inferior performance arises not because of intellectual problems or poor academic preparation, but because testing situations {{create a sense of}} threat for those experiencing test anxiety; anxiety resulting from the sense of threat then disrupts attention and memory function. Researchers suggest that between 25 and 40 percent of students experience test anxiety. Students with disabilities and students <b>in</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>educations</b> classes tend to experience high rates of test anxiety. Students who experience test anxiety tend to be easily distracted during a test, experience difficulty with comprehending relatively simple instructions, and have trouble organizing or recalling relevant information.|$|R

40|$|We examine recent {{research}} across countries and cultures {{in regard to}} the issues related to the formation of <b>gifted</b> and talented <b>education</b> perspectives, policies, and practices. Many modern cultures and subcultures have developed formal and informal definitions {{of what it means to}} be gifted and talented, and when we compare the perceptions, policies, and practices across nations, we discover very different constructs of intelligence and ability. These understandings of giftedness and <b>gifted</b> and talented <b>education</b> can be grouped into four binary dimensions, scholarly versus co-curricular capabilities, aptitude versus achievement, nature versus nurture, and individualistic versus collective, that have significant implications for policy and practice. These constructs can serve as a foundation for countries that are looking to formalize or expand their <b>gifted</b> and talented <b>education</b> models or can be used to challenge the norms of established systems. We put forward recommendations to address some of the challenges <b>in</b> advancing <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> cross-nationally, an area that is often assumed to introduce risks of enlarging social inequity. We also provide a cross-national matrix that captures known elements of <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> policies and programs from over 20 subnational jurisdictions, countries, and world regions. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of intrinsic motivation and perceived compe-tence on subsequent academic achievement among second- and third-grade stu-dents participating in a national study of students <b>in</b> <b>gifted</b> programs.

Factor analyses sup-ported the internal validity of the intrinsic motivation and perceived competence measures in subgroups of second- and third-grade students and <b>in</b> students <b>in</b> <b>gifted</b> versus regular <b>education</b> programs. Structural equation modeling indicated that intrinsic motivation influenced perceived competence and that perceived compe-tence influenced subsequent academic achievement...|$|R
50|$|The District Administration {{reported}} that 109 or 3.88% {{of its students}} were <b>gifted</b> <b>in</b> 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. Services {{designed to meet the}} needs of gifted students include the annual development of a Gifted Individual Education Plan, support services and specially-designed instruction designed to challenge the student. Students <b>in</b> the <b>gifted</b> <b>education</b> program have access to the district's GATE program. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student’s building principal, requesting an evaluation. The writing request for evaluation commences a state-mandated 60-day evaluation deadline. To be eligible for mentally <b>gifted</b> programs <b>in</b> Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.|$|R
