The matrix (the soil from a suspected archaeological feature) is slowly added to agitated water. The soil, sand, and other heavy material, known as <b>heavy</b> <b>fraction,</b> will sink to the bottom. The less dense organic material such as charred seeds, grains and charcoal will tend to float to the surface. The material that floats to the top, called light fraction, is poured into a sieve (usually 250-500 µm). The light fraction is then dried and later examined under a low power microscope. Samples of the <b>heavy</b> <b>fraction</b> are also gathered for later analysis. Flotation can be undertaken manually with buckets, [...] or by machine-assisted flotation where water is circulated through a series of tanks by a pump.Waterlogged plant remains are separated from the matrix by a combination of wet-sieving and/or small-scale flotation in a laboratory. [...] Desiccated plant remains are usually recovered by dry-sieving, using a stack of different sieves to separate larger items such as cereal straw and fruit stones from smaller items such as weed seeds.|$|E

In order to compare the compositions and distribution of organic carbon in constructed and natural river wetlands, sediments from the Xinxue River Constructed Wetland and the Xinxue River, China, were sampled at two depths (0 - 15 cm and 15 - 25 cm) in both upstream and downstream locations. Three types of organic carbon were determined: light fraction organic carbon, <b>heavy</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon. The results show that variations in light fraction organic carbon are significantly larger between upstream and downstream locations than they are between the two wetland types; however, the opposite trend is observed for the dissolved organic carbon. There are no significant differences in the distribution of <b>heavy</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon between the discrete variables (e. g., between the two depths, the two locations, or the two wetland types). However, there are significant cross-variable differences; for example, the distribution patterns of <b>heavy</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon between wetland types and depths, and between wetland types and locations. Correlation analysis reveals that light fraction organic carbon is positively associated with light fraction nitrogen in both wetlands, while <b>heavy</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon is associated with both <b>heavy</b> <b>fraction</b> nitrogen and the moisture content in the constructed wetland.

40|$|Bio-oil，the only liquid {{product in}} fast {{pyrolysis}} process of biomass has {{been expected to}} be very promising in the future, and the technique of pyrolysis of bio-oil has also been attracted considerable attention {{in the field of}} thermal chemical conversion recently. Bio-oil is the complex mixture in the process of depolymerization of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose under non-thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, and it can only be treated as primary liquid fuel not only because of its high oxygen content, viscosity, but also the corrosivity and low calorific value. Many researches have focused on bio-oil’s applications and further treatments. Hydrogenation and catalytic cracking has been attracted much attention in upgrading bio-oil, It’s been found out that heavy component of bio-oil is difficult to crack in the above two cases and in reforming. For the purpose of improving efficiency of bio-oil exploitation and achieving better solutions to problems occurred during bio-oil pyrolysis and gasification,as well as providing necessary data for the design of pyrolysis and gasification equipments, the physicochemical properties analysis of bio-oil produced from wood powder by self-heating biomass fast pyrolysis facility was carried out initially. Then TG, TG-FTIR and tube furnace were employed to investigate pyrolysis characteristics of bio-oil and model compounds of its <b>heavy</b> <b>fractions.</b> Finally, the design of a domestic entrained-flow reactor is introduced for improving efficiency of bio-oil utilization. The thermogravimetric analysis of bio-oil and model compounds of its <b>heavy</b> <b>fractions</b> were carried out under high purify N 2 atmosphere from room temperature to a maximum temperature of 930 ℃ with different heating rates(10 ℃/min～ 30 ℃/min). The results indicated that bio-oil pyrolysis occured in 2 steps. The evaporation of low-boiling point compounds occurred in the first stage,, followed by the cracking of <b>heavy</b> <b>fractions.</b> With increasing heating rate, the starting temperature of weight loss, the maximum velocity of weight loss and its corresponding temperature increased simultaneity; but no difference among the ultimate weight losses was observed. The evolving volatile products during the pyrolysis process were analyzed by FTIR, and the results indicated that: free water, released during the primary stage of bio-oil pyrolysis, flowed by acids, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones due to their low boiling point. The final products were mainly consisted of H 2 O and CO 2 due to cracking of bio-oil <b>heavy</b> <b>fractions.</b> For the model compounds of <b>heavy</b> <b>fractions</b> of bio-oil, the online analysis showed that hydroxybenzenes had the greatest tendency to decompose, followed by aldehydes and carbohydrate.

Enhancing <b>heavy</b> <b>fractions</b> cracking such as carbohydrates pyrolysis {{plays an important role in}} improving efficiency of bio-oil usage. Pyrolysis of bio-oil and its model compounds of <b>heavy</b> <b>fractions</b> in tube furnace was carried out over a temperature range of 700 ～ 1000 ℃ under inert atmosphere.

The gaseous product mainly consists of H 2, CO, CO 2 and hydrocarbons such as CH 4 、C 2 H 4 、C 2 H 6.
