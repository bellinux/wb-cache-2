50|$|Although {{hidden under}} {{rationality}} of narrators and informative writing {{style of the}} writer, The Last Samurai by Helen DeWitt thoroughly explores human desire and <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> There are two different kinds of desire in the novel in which each character indulges: ambition towards vertical achievement, and longing for horizontal expansion in experience. Desire that is vertical in nature {{can be seen in}} people who constantly try to be the best in an area. On the other hand, desire that is horizontal is seen in people who enjoys to contemplate their choice, to wonder the life they couldn’t live, and to expand their experience. They would often throw questions such as: ‘What would my life have looked like if I had made a different decision at that moment?’ They always open the possibility of living a different life and long to experience the other side of their life. Imagining these two distinctive aspirations in terms of direction, one runs vertically forward and the other looks around to expand their experience.|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of coordination gaps {{is critical to}} the effective functioning of a customer support team. To address the managerial challenge of designing Information Technology (IT) to facilitate coordination in customer support teams, this paper develops a framework describing the drivers of coordination gaps in customer support teams. Measures for the characteristics of problem resolution processes, the characteristics of IT that assist in the {{management of}} coordination gaps, and coordination gaps are developed and validated. Results from a field study administered to 399 respondents from 41 teams in Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Seton Hospital, and Southwestern Bell support the proposition that coordination gaps arise from a lack of fit between the characteristics of problem resolution processes used and the characteristics of IT used. What is more important, the results also indicate that processes with differing characteristics require <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>IT.</b> customer support, coordination, business process analysis, groupware...|$|E

40|$|Hate {{speech is}} {{commonly}} defined {{with reference to}} the legal category of incitement. Laws targeting incitement typically focus on how the speech is expressed rather than its actual content. This has a number of unintended consequences: first, law tends to capture overt or obvious forms of hate speech and not hate speech that takes the form of 2 ̆ 7 reasoned 2 ̆ 7 argument, but which nevertheless, causes as much, if not more harm. Second, the focus on form rather than content leads to categorization errors. Hate speech taking the form of 2 ̆ 7 reasoned argument 2 ̆ 7 is often legally characterized as either political or academic debate, and so is deemed both permissible and justified in societies where free speech principles exist. In this paper, I argue {{that it is important to}} identify instances of hate speech as hate speech, no matter how articulately or reasonably the speech is expressed. The danger in mischaracterizing an instance of hate speech by calling it academic or political debate is that it risks normalizing the views and sentiments that are expressed and accepting those views as an important part of our political and academic discourses. With reference to Habermas 2 ̆ 7 account of 2 ̆ 7 distorted communication 2 ̆ 7, I propose different criteria for defining and understanding hate speech and suggest that there might be good reasons for interpreting the concept of incitement more broadly, so as to include these <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>it...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of distinguishing between potential and realized value for IT investments {{has been recognized}} by senior managers and IS researchers since {{some time in the}} 1980 s, when it became apparent that not all IT investments were likely to achieve equivalent levels of return on investment. This chapter explores a new perspective with respect to potential and realized value, specifically noting the importance that rational expectations of IT strategic planners and investment managers play in conditioning decisionmaking by senior managers. The key insights that we offer are as follows: (1) Since organizational, operational and market contexts will tend to vary around <b>different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>IT</b> investments, it is only natural that such heterogeneity in outcomes should be reflected in the heterogeneous expectations of the managers who make the investments; (2) With this in mind, it should also be apparent that understanding heterogeneity in both potential and realized value should be a matter of arriving at an appropriate set of expectations, based on the acquisition of relevant updated information over time that will permit adaptive learning to occur on the part of senior managers; (3) No matter what the process is that enables managers to update their expectations (and achieve rational expectations in the process about their IT investments), the planning process that leads to new estimates of the payoffs from specific IT investments should be tuned for encouraging the tracking of a trajectory of values for potential value. This view is analogous to what an investor would do in tracking the value of stocks held in an investment portfolio, which are subject to value changes based on a variety of forces that are likely to affect the future cash flows of the firm and the present value of its growth opportunities. We develop this IT investment planning perspective in terms of the underlying theory and offer a number of new conceptual and methodological ideas that will enable managers to think their IT investment processes through with a more effective understanding of the rational expectations that are likely to be inherent in them.
