5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to <b>exist</b> <b>among</b> some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also <b>exist</b> <b>among</b> California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and wait for them to reach estrus.|$|E

The Negriales rocks may originate from parental magmas {{that are different}} from the main Lastarria magmas.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, a {{new process}} based on GTAW was developed, called plasma arc welding. It affords greater control and {{improves}} weld quality {{by using a}} nozzle to focus the electric arc, but is largely limited to automated systems, whereas GTAW remains primarily a manual, hand-held method. Development within the GTAW process has continued as well, and today a number of variations <b>exist.</b> <b>Among</b> the most popular are the pulsed-current, manual programmed, hot-wire, dabber, and increased penetration GTAW methods.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} argued that all the {{specimens}} belong to the same species, A. lithographica. Differences do <b>exist</b> <b>among</b> the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the different ages of the specimens, some may be related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as Archaeornis siemensii, the Eichstätt specimen as Jurapteryx recurva, the Munich specimen as Archaeopteryx bavarica, and the Solnhofen specimen as Wellnhoferia grandis.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues <b>exist</b> <b>among</b> lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|The PAP {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} returned to power by voters and has thus formed the Cabinet since Singapore's 1959 general election. The Government is generally {{perceived to be}} competent in managing the country's economy, and largely free from political corruption. Transparency International's 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, which compares countries according to {{the degree to which}} corruption is perceived to <b>exist</b> <b>among</b> public officials and politicians, ranked Singapore in joint first place with Denmark and New Zealand out of 178 countries. In addition, Singapore was second only to New Zealand in the Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, the Government has been criticized for using unfair election tactics, such as discouraging voting for opposition parties in the 2006 general election by stating that wards that elect opposition candidates will receive state-subsidized improvements to public housing only after all PAP-held wards have been attended to. It has also been accused of violating freedom of speech through Ministers bringing defamation suits against opposition politicians, and by restricting the circulation of foreign newspapers deemed to have engaged in domestic politics.|$|E
