5|$|The three Scottish soldiers' killings was an {{incident}} {{that took place in}} Northern Ireland during the Troubles. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> 10 March 1971, when the Provisional Irish Republican Army shot dead three unarmed British Army soldiers of the 1st Battalion, Royal Highland Fusiliers. Two of the three were teenage brothers; all three were from Scotland. They were killed off-duty and in civilian clothes, having been lured from a city-centre bar in Belfast, driven to a remote location and shot whilst relieving themselves by the roadside. Three British soldiers had been killed prior to this event; all had been on duty and killed during rioting.|$|E
5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> my {{last day}} in Hanoi. I was {{exhausted}} and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that}} the soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

25|$|Their opponents {{included}} the Newmarket Redmen, who fell 7-3 in a two-game, total-goals series {{to decide the}} OHA title. That set up a best-of-three national final in Toronto against the Port Arthur West End club.

Game 2 was tied 2-2 after regulation time, which {{was followed by a}} 10-minute, non-sudden death overtime. The Greys outscored Port Arthur 3-1 in the extra frame, won the game 5-3 and became the first team to win the Memorial Cup a second time. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> <b>on</b> March 28, 1927—the third anniversary of the 1924 championship.

500|$|Two other {{participants}} were profoundly affected. Firstly, Knicks center Darrall Imhoff was branded as {{the player who}} let Chamberlain score 100 on him, although he only played 20 of 48minutes and {{was not on the}} court when <b>it</b> <b>happened.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the game immortalized little-used Warriors reserve player Joe Ruklick as the man who gave Chamberlain the 100-point assist. Decades later, The New York Times interviewed Ruklick and found out that he refers to himself as [...] "a walking footnote" [...] of one of basketball's greatest moments. The game also produced the famous picture of Chamberlain sitting on a bench, holding up a paper with a scribbled [...] "100". The photograph was actually a matter of improvisation: when Warriors PR manager Harvey Pollack entered the Warriors locker room, he took a paper and scribbled the number on it, and Associated Press photographer Paul Vathis who was there at the game (not for professional reasons, but rather because he wanted to give his son a treat) took the now-famous photo. Cherry calls it the [...] "ultimate picture" [...] of Wilt Chamberlain.|$|E

But what makes weather is gases and clouds, and the reason the weather on the Earth is hard to predict is because we have oceans and continents that interact with our atmosphere. That makes {{it very hard to}} predict the weather, as we all know. But if you take a planet like Jupiter or Neptune you don't have continents and you don't have oceans. All you have is gas, all you have is atmosphere, and therefore it's a lot easier to model the weather on those planets. But it's the same physical process, it's {{the same kind of thing}} <b>happening,</b> whether <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> the Earth or whether <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> Neptune. Therefore by studying weather on Neptune we learn about weather in general, and that helps us understand the weather on Earth better".|$|R
