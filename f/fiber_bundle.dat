50|$|In mathematics, {{a bundle}} map (or bundle {{morphism}}) is a morphism {{in the category}} of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles.</b> There are two distinct, but closely related, notions of bundle map, depending on whether the <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> in question have a common base space. There are also several variations on the basic theme, depending on precisely which category of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> is under consideration. In the first three sections, we will consider general <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> {{in the category of}} topological spaces. Then in the fourth section, some other examples will be given.|$|R
30|$|The morphological, physical, and {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} nonwood plant <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> of ramie, pineapple, sansevieria, kenaf, abaca, sisal, and coconut <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> were investigated. All fibers except those of coconut fiber had noncircular cross-sectional shapes. The crosssectional area of the <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> was evaluated by an improved method using scanning electron microscope images. The coefficient factor defined as {{the ratio of the}} cross-sectional area determined by diameter measurement, to the cross-sectional area determined by image analysis was between 0.92 and 0.96 for all fibers. This indicated that the area determined by diameter measurement was available. The densities of the <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> decreased with increasing diameters. The diameters of each fiber species had small variation of around 3.4 %- 9.8 % within a specimen. The tensile strength and Young’s modulus of ramie, pineapple, and sansevieria <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> showed excellent values in comparison with the other fibers. The tensile strength and Young’s modulus showed a decreasing trend with increasing diameter of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles.</b>|$|R

25|$|If E is a vector bundle (or indeed any <b>fiber</b> <b>bundle)</b> over N and φ:M→N is {{a smooth}} map, then the {{pullback}} bundle φ*E is a vector bundle (or <b>fiber</b> <b>bundle)</b> over M whose fiber over x in M {{is given by}} (φ*E)x = E'φ(x).|$|E
25|$|Codimension 0 immersions are {{equivalently}} relative dimension 0 submersions, and {{are better}} {{thought of as}} submersions. A codimension 0 immersion of a closed manifold is precisely a covering map, i.e., a <b>fiber</b> <b>bundle</b> with 0-dimensional (discrete) fiber. By Ehresmann's theorem and Phillips' theorem on submersions, a proper submersion of manifolds is a <b>fiber</b> <b>bundle,</b> hence codimension/relative dimension 0 immersions/submersions behave like submersions.|$|E
50|$|First, one can {{consider}} <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> {{in a different}} category of spaces. This leads, for example, {{to the notion of}} a smooth bundle map between smooth <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> over a smooth manifold.|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of specimen size on the mechanical properties of bamboo. Single bamboo fibers and bamboo <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> obtained from both chemical retting and mechanical retting were tested. The tensile strength of chemically retted single bamboo fiber was 47.6  % higher than that of the mechanically retted fibers. The tensile strength of the chemically retted <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> was over 2.1 times higher than that of the mechanically retted one, while the tensile modulus was almost 1.4 times higher. For the chemical retting, the <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> were 65.7  % less in tensile strength compared to the single fiber, 12.3  % less for the tensile modulus, and 9.7  % less for the elongation. For the mechanical retting, the tensile strength, tensile modulus and elongation of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> were 68.8, 52.3 and 60.9  % lower than that of the single fibers, respectively. Compared with single bamboo fibers and bamboo <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles,</b> the tensile strength of bamboo strips was reduced by 67.7 and 3.3  %, respectively. The modulus of bamboo <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> was 42.7  % less compared to the single bamboo fibers, and 16.9  % higher compared to the bamboo <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles.</b> The mechanical properties of bamboo strips were lower than that of samples made from outer portion of the bamboo, but higher than that of samples made from inner portion of the bamboo.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Brain image {{registration}} aims at reducing anatomical variability across subjects {{to create a}} common space for group analysis. Multi-modal approaches intend to minimize cortex shape variations along with internal structures, such as <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles.</b> A difficulty is that it requires a prior identification of these structures, which remains a challenging task {{in the absence of}} a complete reference atlas. We propose an extension of the log-Geometric Demons for jointly registering images and <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> without the need of point or fiber correspondences. By representing <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> as Weighted Measures we can register subjects with different numbers of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles.</b> The efficacy of our algorithm is demonstrated by registering simultaneously T 1 images and between 37 and 88 <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> depending on each of the ten subject used. We compare results with a multi-modal T 1 + Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and a tensor-based registration algorithms and obtain superior performance with our approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to measure the {{variability}} of a population of white matter <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> without imposing unrealistic geometrical priors. In this respect, modeling <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> as currents seems particularly relevant, as it gives a metric between bundles which relies neither on point nor on fiber correspondences and which is robust to fiber interruption. First, this metric is included in a diffeomorphic registration scheme which consistently aligns sets of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles.</b> In particular, we show that aligning directly <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> may solve the aperture problem which appears when fiber mappings are constrained by tensors only. Second, the measure of variability of a population of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> is based on a statistical model which considers every bundle as a random diffeomorphic deformation of a common template plus a random non-diffeomorphic perturbation. Thus, the variability is decomposed into a geometrical part and a “texture ” part. Our results on real data show that both parts may contain interesting anatomical features. ...|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, the Lagrangian {{theory on}} <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> is {{globally}} formulated in algebraic {{terms of the}} variational bicomplex, without appealing to the calculus of variations.

25|$|In {{differential}} geometry, an Ehresmann connection (after the French mathematician Charles Ehresmann {{who first}} formalized this concept) is {{a version of}} the notion of a connection, which makes sense on any smooth <b>fiber</b> <b>bundle.</b> In particular, it does not rely on the possible vector bundle structure of the underlying <b>fiber</b> <b>bundle,</b> but nevertheless, linear connections may be viewed as a special case. Another important special case of Ehresmann connections are principal connections on principal bundles, which are required to be equivariant in the principal Lie group action.|$|E
25|$|More generally, if G is any {{topological group}} and H a closed {{subgroup}} which {{also happens to}} be a Lie group, then G→G/H is a <b>fiber</b> <b>bundle.</b>|$|E

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of Adams' theorem, <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> with spheres as total space, base space, and fiber can occur only in these dimensions. <b>Fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> with similar properties, but different from the Hopf fibrations, were used by John Milnor to construct exotic spheres.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new way for {{tracking}} brain white matter <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> in diffusion tensor maps. Diffusion maps provide information about mobility of water protons in different directions. Assuming that diffusion is more important along axons, this information {{could lead to the}} direction of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> in white matter. Nevertheless, protocoles for diffusion image acquisition suffer from low resolutions and instrument noise. This paper is essentially dedicated to the design of a Markovian model aiming at the regularization of direction maps, and at the tracking of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles.</b> Results are presented on synthetic tensor images to confirm the efficiency of the method. Then, white matter regions are regularized in order to enable the tracking of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles,</b> which is of increasing interest in functional connectivity studies...|$|R
25|$|The most general {{conditions}} under which the quotient map will admit local cross-sections are not known, although if G is a Lie group and H a closed subgroup (and thus a Lie subgroup by Cartan's theorem), then the quotient map is a <b>fiber</b> <b>bundle.</b> One {{example of this is}} the Hopf fibration, S3→S2 which is a <b>fiber</b> <b>bundle</b> over the sphere S2 whose total space is S3. From the perspective of Lie groups, S3 can be identified with the special unitary group SU(2). The abelian subgroup of diagonal matrices is isomorphic to the circle group U(1), and the quotient SU(2)/U(1) is diffeomorphic to the sphere.|$|E
25|$|The third {{condition}} applies on triple overlaps Ui ∩ Uj ∩ Uk and {{is called}} the cocycle condition (see Čech cohomology). The importance {{of this is that}} the transition functions determine the <b>fiber</b> <b>bundle</b> (if one assumes the Čech cocycle condition).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{packaging}} architecture for chip-level optical interconnections based on imaging <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles.</b> Imaging <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> consist of densely packed arrays of small core fibers such that an object imaged {{at one end of}} the bundle is correspondingly imaged on the opposite end. In optical communication applications <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> can be directly coupled to an array of optical sources. Each spot is carried by multiple fibers that in turn can directly illuminate each element in a detector array. Neither end requires any additional optical elements. Thus, imaging <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> are capable of supporting the spatial parallelism of free space interconnects with relaxed alignment and geometry constraints. This paper is focused specifically on multi-chip system designs...|$|R
2500|$|In summary, {{there is}} a {{one-to-one}} correspondence (up to equivalence) between the descents of principal connections to associated <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles,</b> and G-connections on associated <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles.</b> [...] For this reason, {{in the category of}} <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> with a structure group G, the principal connection contains all relevant information for G-connections on the associated bundles.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} generic {{framework}} for the registration, the template estimation and the variability analysis of white matter <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> extracted from diffusion images. This framework {{is based on the}} metric on currents for the comparison of <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles.</b> This metric measures anatomical differences between <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles,</b> seen as global homologous structures across subjects. It avoids the need to establish correspondences between points or between individual <b>fibers</b> of different <b>bundles.</b> It can measure differences both in terms of the geometry of the bundles (like its boundaries) {{and in terms of the}} density of <b>fibers</b> within the <b>bundle.</b> It is robust to fiber interruptions and reconnections. In addition, a recently introduced sparse approximation algorithm allows us to give an interpretable representation of the <b>fiber</b> <b>bundles</b> and their variations in the framework of currents.
