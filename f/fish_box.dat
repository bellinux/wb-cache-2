50|$|<b>Fishing</b> tackle <b>boxes</b> {{have for}} many years been an {{essential}} part of the anglers equipment. <b>Fishing</b> tackle <b>boxes</b> were originally made of wood or wicker and eventually some metal <b>fishing</b> tackle <b>boxes</b> were manufactured. The first plastic <b>fishing</b> tackle <b>boxes</b> were manufactured by Plano in response to the need for a product that didn't rust. Early plastic <b>fishing</b> tackle <b>boxes</b> were similar to tool boxes but soon evolved into the hip roof cantilever tackle boxes with numerous small trays for small tackle. These types of tackle boxes are still available today but they have the disadvantage that small tackle gets mixed up. <b>Fishing</b> tackle <b>boxes</b> have also been manufactured so the drawers themselves become small storage boxes, each with their own lids. This prevents small tackle from mixing, and can turn each drawer into a stand-alone container which can be used to carry small tackle to a rod some distance from the main tackle box.|$|R

Body size and growth rates are more important than age when determining sexual maturity in bearded dragons. Males will become very aggressive towards each other and will assert their dominance by inflating their beards and through fast head bobbing. Breeding typically occurs in the early spring. Females will lay a clutch of 11-30 oblong-shaped eggs in a shallow nest dug in the sand. After being laid, the eggs are buried and are left unattended. The eggs will hatch approximately 60 to 80 days later, depending on the incubation temperature. In captivity, they can be incubated in a styrofoam <b>fish</b> <b>box,</b> but without a male lizard, the female's eggs will not be fertile. However, a female bearded dragon can retain sperm, and thus produce fertile eggs even after being separated from a male.|$|E
50|$|On 18 May 1896 a major civil {{disturbance}} occurred in Newlyn, {{which was at}} the time a major fishing port. Newlyn was home to a large number of Methodist and Non-Conformist religious groups, some of whom practised a ban on fishing {{on the day of the}} Sabbath. Non-Cornish fisherman, largely from Lowestoft and other English ports, did not hold the same opinions about observing the Sabbath, and so continued to fish on a Sunday, which would attract higher prices for their fish than sold on a weekday. On the morning of the 18th, a group of 40 fishermen bolstered by a mob of roughly a thousand supporters, boarded a number of non-Cornish fishing boats moored in the harbour and destroyed their catches. Police were alerted and arrived on the scene within a few hours, although they numbered only eight, supported by Cornwall County officers Superintendent Richard Nicholas and Inspector Matthews. Out at sea, over 100 Lowestoft vessels were approached by a small steamer piloted by the Newlyn harbour master, warning them of the situation. The harbour master himself was pursued by a local trawler, and by late afternoon a fleet of vessels from Porthleven had arrived in support of the mob. The following morning, police clashed with rioters around Newlyn Harbour, with Inspector Matthews severely injured by a <b>fish</b> <b>box</b> which was thrown at him, cutting his head and breaking his finger. During the chaos, seven “Yorkie” vessels were spotted making for Penzance to land their catches, and over 300 rioters made for Penzance harbour. Police intercepted the group at Penzance, and, backed by a large number of local youths, managed to deter them from attack. By mid afternoon the situation was out of control, and the police called in the military. At 6pm 400 soldiers from the Royal Berkshire Regiment under Major Massard arrived by train at Penzance and took temporary billets in the town, remaining on standby until the police required them. Two hours later, a large riot broke out between Newlyn, Porthleven and St Ives fishermen. Police were beaten back when they tried to intervene, giving them cause to call upon the assistance of the army who had arrived earlier. The police and army joined together and were met with stone-throwing as they crossed the Newlyn Bridge, but were able to occupy the piers long enough to see in the arrival of HMS Ferret. The presence of the military on land and sea was enough to calm the rioters, and by midnight the disturbance was over.|$|E

40|$|Even today, the fisherman's barge is {{the type}} of vessel most {{commonly}} used for fishing on the River Main and its tributaries upstream beyond the city of Würzburg. Like the similar fishing barge of the Middle Main (see Deutsches Schiffahrtsarchiv 18 / 1995) the oaken boat is a flat-bottomed vessel whose ends taper to a narrow width at bow and stern. The sides consists of one plank each. The wooden fisherman's barges of the Upper Main were documented in 1980 - 81 within the framework of a research project. Present-day vessels were found to have an average length of ca. 8. 1 m, while there is clear evidence that they were at least 1 m Ionger in earlier times. Their width is greatest between the forward third and the middle, where it measures 1. 5 m on average. With a length-width ratio of 7 : 1, the present vessels are narrower than their older Counterparts, which exhibited a length-width ratio of 6 : 1. The two boat ends curve upward by about 0. 5 m over a length of ca. 1. 9 m. The boat is paddled and poled; in former times it was towed upstream. As a rule the fishermen of the present use outboard motors for propulsion. With regard to the arrangement of the ribs in the middle section between the upwardly curving ends, the fisherman's barge of the Upper Main differs from that of the Middle Main. At regular intervals of 0. 9 - 1. 0 m several rib pairs have been installed. The vessel has no built-in <b>fish</b> <b>box</b> but tows a floating box in which to store the fish live during the haul. During the 1980 s wooden fisherman's barges were still being built on the Upper Main by a boatbuilder in Knetzgau near Bamberg. At that time he was the last boatbuilder in the entire Rhine basin still producing oaken boats. Since the 1960 s he had been practising this trade as a sideline in an open-air boatyard behind his home. A record of orders received provided evidence of the boats supplied by this boatyard as well as their distribution area, which expanded spatially {{in the course of the}} years.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} some factors affecting the normal output rate and percentage yield of filleting cod. The man-machine relationships chosen for inclusion in the study included the effect of overall fish length upon the normal output rate and yield of filleting, the effect of the experience of the filleter upon each of the aforementioned factors, the effect of work table layout upon filleting rate and the effect of cutting time upon percentage yield. [...] The aforementioned study was carried out at a small fish processing plant utilizing five filleters randomly selected from the work force. These filleters were asked to fillet boxes of gut-in codfish, of various size categories, the performance rating and weight of the fillets produced being recorded. From these results the normal input, output and percentage yield was calculated. [...] An analysis of the results of this study showed: [...] 1. A linear relationship between input, as pounds per hour, and length, input rate increased as the length increased. [...] 2. A linear relationship between input, as fish per hour, and length, the time required to fillet a fish increased as the length increased. [...] 3. A linear relationship between output and length, the quantity of fillet produced increased as the length increased. [...] 4. Little or no relationship between percentage yield and length. [...] 5. The indication of a correlation between speed and yield for two of the four filleters used in the study. [...] 6. A reduction in (a) unproductive activities (33 percent reduction in time taken for the get fish motion, 19 percent for the place fillet motions), and (b) the number of eye fixiations (22 percent reduction in time) by conversion from a group to an individual work place filleting table. However, the aforementioned conversion would introduce certain non- productive miscellaneous activities (get box of fish, get fillet pan, place empty <b>fish</b> <b>box,</b> place pan of fillets) into the filleting cycle, said activities taking up to 30 - 36 seconds between the filleting of each box of fish (4 to 18 percent, depending on the size of the fish, of the total cycle time per box of fish filleted) ...|$|E

40|$|The Dover sole, Microstomus pacificus (Lockington) is {{a fairly}} large {{flatfish}} belonging to the family Pleuronectidae. It is not a true sole, but a flounder. However, through continued common usage of the term "sole" {{for most of the}} flounders along the Pacific Coast, this appellation has become recognized by the fishing industry and the different government agencies concerned. It has been known along the Pacific Coast under several different common names, such as slippery sole (California and Puget Sound), lemon sole (Vancouver), smear dab (Puget Sound), rubber sole and short finned sole (San Francisco), slime sole (California and Puget Sound), tongue sole, and Dover sole (Pacific Coast). The common name of Dover sole was first suggested by Mr. Stewart, employee of the New England Fish Co., Astoria, Oregon, around 1939 according to the Eureka fishermen. He probably associated Microstomus pacificus, the only representative of its genus along the eastern Pacific Coast, with Microstomus kitt Walbaum, which ranges from the White Sea into English waters and is probably taken off the Dover coast. The two species are very similar in general appearance and might well appear identical to an untrained observer, but in meristic counts and morphometric measurements they differ significantly. In 1946, Clemens and Wilby used the name Dover sole in their Fishes of the Pacific Coast of Canada, and in 1948 it was adopted as the official name in California by the Department of Fish and Game. It is evident that the name Dover sole has a greater marketing value than some of the other names, such as slime sole, slippery sole, etc., with their rather unappetizing connotations. Although the range of the Dover sole extends from Southern California to Alaska, it is important commercially only from San Francisco northward along the Oregon coast. Small amounts have been landed in Washington and British Columbia, but the centers of fishing are at Fort Bragg and Eureka in California, and at Newport and Astoria in Oregon. South of Monterey it is not found in great abundance. In developing a management program for the conservation of a fisheries resource, a knowledge of the biology of the species concerned is important. Full utilization of the population is desirable, but a balance must be maintained between the recruitment and the total mortality. Regulation of fishing areas, closed seasons, restrictions on destructive gear, and limitations on total catch are tools that may be used in the maintenance of a fisheries resource at the most productive level, but their use should be based on sound reasoning and biological facts. It is in the hope of providing a few of the required facts that this study is presented. In the course of this investigation approximately 3, 200 specimens of Dover sole were examined during the period from July, 1948, to October, 1949. The bulk of the material was gathered from commercial fishermen and dealers in the Eureka region, although a small amount of sampling was conducted at Fort Bragg. After the fish are taken from the vessel during normal commercial handling, they are weighed by the dealer and dumped in a pile near the end of a conveyor system. The measuring board was placed on a <b>fish</b> <b>box</b> or bench as close to this source of supply as possible, and specimens were taken at random from the pile. Each fish was weighed, laid on the board with the nose against the end plate and the total length measured. The abdominal wall was cut to determine the sex and to obtain gonad samples. Stomach contents were sampled in some cases. If scales were required they were taken by means of a pair of forceps and either placed in an envelope or put directly on a slide. Otoliths were taken by holding the fish firmly with the left hand (thumb in the lower eye orbit) and making a diagonal cut into the head exposing the brain and inner ears. Otoliths were taken from both sides, placed in an envelope, and preserved dry. All data were recorded on a white plastic sheet with a lead pencil. In this way, the sampler, with wet slimy hands, could write down the necessary information and by washing the sheet in water have a clean neat record. After transferring the information to paper, the plastic sheet was washed with a cleanser to remove the pencil marks...|$|E

25|$|Fishing was {{the most}} {{important}} industry from the 14th century until the mid-19th. Salt water fishing began before 1320, when too fine nets were seized by City authorities, but expanded greatly from the 16th century. Fisher Street was named after the fishing community there. From about 1775 welled and dry smacks were used, mostly as cod boats, and rigged as gaff cutters. Fishermen sailed as far as Iceland in the summer. They served Billingsgate Fish Market in the City of London, and moored in Barking Pool. Scymgeour Hewett, born on 7 December 1797, founded the Short Blue Fleet (England's biggest fishing fleet) based in Barking, and using smacks out of Barking and east coast ports. Around 1870 this fleet changed to gaff ketches that stayed out at sea for months, using ice for preservation of fish produced by flooding local fields in winter. Fleeting involved fish being ferried from fishing smacks to gaff cutters by little wooden ferry-boats. The rowers had to stand as the boats were piled high with <b>fish</b> <b>boxes.</b> Rowers refused to wear their bulky cork lifejackets because it slowed down their rowing. At first the fast 50-foot gaff cutters with great booms projecting beyond the sterns raced the fish to port to get the best prices.|$|R
