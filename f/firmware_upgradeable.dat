50|$|The iriver E100's <b>firmware</b> is <b>upgradeable</b> using {{a special}} Windows {{application}} which is bundled with the iriver E100. The device {{was released in}} Europe with Firmware version 1.02 preloaded. The firmware updater, which can be downloaded from the iRiver support site, does not run on 64-bit versions of Windows. However the firmware updater on the original software CD does.|$|R
50|$|AirPods {{also contain}} <b>upgradeable</b> <b>firmware,</b> {{although}} it is unknown whether the charging case is capable of receiving firmware updates. Since launch, Apple has upgraded the AirPod firmware from 3.3.1 to 3.7.2.|$|R
50|$|Similarly to the Nintendo DSi, {{the menu}} has <b>upgradeable</b> <b>firmware.</b> Game cards {{can also be}} hot-swapped while in the menu. The power button prompts the user to either put the console into sleep mode, or shut it down.|$|R
50|$|The <b>firmware</b> is <b>upgradeable,</b> and {{can also}} be user {{modified}} with various programs to change things such as the button mapping and graphics. The latest firmware (version 7.300) allows for many new features, including play lists {{and the ability to}} remember its place in four different files at once. The latter feature makes it more suitable for audio books, as it makes searching for where one left off unnecessary. The original YP-55 models came with a gray cloth case, later models used a plastic case which allows access to all the controls without opening it.|$|R
50|$|The GP2X was {{designed}} to play music and videos, view photos, and play games. It had an open architecture (Linux based), allowing anybody to develop and run software. Also, there was the possibility for additional features (such as support for new media formats) to be added in the future due to the <b>upgradeable</b> <b>firmware.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thus {{hardware}} modems supporting {{those standards}} were becoming steadily {{more complex and}} expensive themselves, {{not to mention the}} fact that several conflicting standards in the early days of the various 33.6K (V.34) and 56K protocols led to incompatibilities and the construction of modems with <b>upgradeable</b> <b>firmware,</b> which did all of the processing via a programmable DSP.|$|R
50|$|The ICD 2 {{supports}} most PIC and dsPIC devices {{within the}} PIC10, PIC12, PIC16, PIC18, dsPIC, rfPIC and PIC32 families, and supports full speed execution, or single step interactive debugging. At breakpoints, data and program memory {{can be read}} and modified using the MPLAB IDE. The ICD 2 <b>firmware</b> is field <b>upgradeable</b> using the MPLAB IDE.|$|R
500|$|Like the Wii, the DSi has <b>upgradeable</b> <b>firmware,</b> and {{features}} a menu interface that displays applications as selectable icons. The seven primary icons represent [...] "Card Software", [...] "Nintendo DSi Camera", [...] "Nintendo DSi Sound", [...] "Nintendo DSi Shop", [...] "DS Download Play", [...] "PictoChat", and [...] "system settings"; additional applications may be downloaded from the DSi Shop. Icons {{are set in}} a grid navigable with the stylus or D-pad, and may be re-arranged via drag-and-drop. The power button can either soft reset the console, returning it to the main menu, or shut it down. Game cards may be hot swapped when the console is set to the main menu, allowing players to switch game cards without shutting down.|$|R
