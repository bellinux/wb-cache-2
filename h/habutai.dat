(luck) are the same in Japanese, the name was further changed to Daifuku mochi (...) (great luck rice cake), a bringer of good luck. By {{the end of the}} 18th century, Daifuku were gaining popularity and people began eating them toasted. They were also used for gifts in ceremonial occasions.|$|E
50|$|Heko obi ("obi for men between 15 and 25") is an informal, soft obi, {{free flowing}} {{and made of}} tie-dyed fabrics, made from silk crape, <b>habutai,</b> cotton, or others.

Adult men wear the heko obi only at home, but young boys can wear it in public, for example at a summer festival with a yukata.|$|E
