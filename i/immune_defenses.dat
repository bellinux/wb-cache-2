Yet, for the adaptive advantages of genetic variation to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.|$|E

40|$|Trade-offs between <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> and life-history traits {{have the}} {{potential}} to dramatically alter the function and evolution of both traits involved. Female Drosophila melanogaster show reduced <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> after mating, suggesting a potential trade-off between mating or consequent reproduction and <b>immune</b> <b>defense.</b> In this work, I demonstrated that post-mating systemic immunosuppression varies in degree across different bacterial pathogens. I also showed that the effect of mating on <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> is genetically variable in degree among female flies, but that males are not significantly genetically variable for the degree of post-mating systemic immunosuppression they elicit in their mates. My data revealed that the variation in females is likely due to recessive deleterious alleles and did not reveal evidence for an evolutionary trade-off. I determined that reduced <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> after mating is dependent on seminal fluid transfer and on the presence of a female germline. Consistent with this result, I identified a family of genes involved in formation of the vitelline membrane that are more reduced in expression after infection in virgin females than in mated females. These results together are consistent with a model in which virgin females reduce reproductive effort to favor <b>immune</b> <b>defense,</b> an action that may not be adaptive or physiologically possible for mated females. I identified many immune genes that are differentially altered by infection in virgin versus mated females. These included a family of antimicrobial peptide genes, genes in the Turandot family, and TepII, all of which have more strongly increased expression in virgin than in mated females in response to infection. In a separate experiment, I found that when females are infected with bacteria, virgins have higher antimicrobial peptide transcript levels at early time points in the infection. It is possible, then, that mating alters females' capacity for systemic <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> by directly or indirectly reducing their immune system activity...|$|R

40|$|Both {{malnutrition}} and undernutrition {{can lead}} to compromised <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> in a diversity of animals, and "nutritional immunology" has been suggested {{as a means of}} understanding immunity and determining strategies for fighting infection. The genetic basis for the effects of diet on immunity, however, has been largely unknown. In the present study, we have conducted genome-wide association mapping in Drosophila melanogaster to identify the genetic basis for individual variation in resistance, and for variation in immunological sensitivity to diet (genotype-by-environment interaction, or GxE). D. melanogaster were reared for several generations on either high-glucose or low-glucose diets and then infected with Providencia rettgeri, a natural bacterial pathogen of D. melanogaster. Systemic pathogen load was measured at the peak of infection intensity, and several indicators of nutritional status were taken from uninfected flies reared on each diet. We find that dietary glucose level significantly alters the quality of <b>immune</b> <b>defense,</b> with elevated dietary glucose resulting in higher pathogen loads. The quality of <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> is genetically variable within the sampled population, and we find genetic variation for immunological sensitivity to dietary glucose (genotype-by-diet interaction). <b>Immune</b> <b>defense</b> was genetically correlated with indicators of metabolic status in flies reared on the high-glucose diet, and we identified multiple genes that explain variation in <b>immune</b> <b>defense,</b> including several that have not been previously implicated in immune response but which are confirmed to alter pathogen load after RNAi knockdown. Our findings emphasize the importance of dietary composition to <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> and reveal genes outside the conventional "immune system" that can be important in determining susceptibility to infection. Functional variation in these genes is segregating in a natural population, providing the substrate for evolutionary response to pathogen pressure in the context of nutritional environment...|$|R
25|$|After infection, a {{secreted}} glycoprotein, small soluble glycoprotein (sGP or GP) is synthesized. EBOV replication overwhelms {{protein synthesis}} of infected cells {{and the host}} <b>immune</b> <b>defenses.</b> The GP forms a trimeric complex, which tethers the virus to the endothelial cells. The sGP forms a dimeric protein that interferes with the signaling of neutrophils, another type of white blood cell, which enables the virus to evade the immune system by inhibiting early steps of neutrophil activation. The presence of viral particles and the cell damage resulting from viruses budding out of the cell causes the release of chemical signals (such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8), which are molecular signals for fever and inflammation.|$|E
500|$|Microorganisms or toxins that {{successfully}} {{enter an}} organism encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system. [...] The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors, which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms, or when damaged, injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals, {{many of which}} (but not all) are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens. Innate <b>immune</b> <b>defenses</b> are non-specific, meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way. This system does not confer long-lasting immunity against a pathogen. The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{quality of}} {{available}} food may affect insect herbivores directly (via growth and survivorship) and/or indirectly (by modifying insect vulnerability to parasitoids and pathogens). We {{examined the relationship}} between different phenolic compounds, belonging to various phenolic groups, in Betula pubescens spp. czerepanovii (mountain birch) foliage and the larval performance of the geometrid Epirrita autumnata (autumnal moth). Direct effects on insect performance were described by pupal weight, developmental rate, and survivorship; indirect effects were described by the encapsulation rate of an implant inserted into the insect hemocoel, a commonly used way to describe insect <b>immune</b> <b>defense.</b> We found profound differences in the effects of different phenolic categories: several individual hydrolyzable tannins were associated positively with larval performance but negatively with level of <b>immune</b> <b>defense,</b> whereas flavonoid glycosides were inversely related to larval survival but showed no association with the larvae <b>immune</b> <b>defense...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{species with}} {{separate}} sexes, antagonistic selection on {{males and females}} (intralocus sexual conflict) {{can result in a}} gender load that can be resolved through the evolution of sexual dimorphism. We present data on intralocus sexual conflict over <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> in a natural population of free-ranging lizards (Uta stansburiana) and discuss the resolution of this conflict. Intralocus sexual conflict arises from correlational selection between <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> and orange throat coloration in these lizards. Males with orange throats and high antibody responses had enhanced survival, but the same trait combination reduced female fitness. This sexual antagonism persisted across the life-cycle and was concordant between the juvenile and adult life stages. The opposing selective pressure on males and females is ameliorated by a negative intersexual genetic correlation (rm,f =- 0. 86) for <b>immune</b> <b>defense.</b> Throat coloration was also genetically correlated with <b>immune</b> <b>defense,</b> but the sign of this genetic correlation differed between the sexes. This resulted in sex-specific signaling of immunological condition. We also found evidence for a sex-specific maternal effect on sons with potential to additionally reduce the gender load. These results have implications for signaling evolution, genetic integration between adaptive traits, sex allocation and mutual mate choice for indirect fitness benefits...|$|R

2500|$|The C3bBb {{complex is}} {{stabilized}} by binding oligomers of factor P (Properdin). The stabilized C3 convertase, C3bBbP, then acts enzymatically to cleave much more C3, {{some of which}} becomes covalently attached to the same surface as C3b. This newly bound C3b recruits more B, D and P activity and greatly amplifies the complement activation. When complement is activated on a cell surface, the activation is limited by endogenous complement regulatory proteins, which include CD35, CD46, CD55 and CD59, depending on the cell. Pathogens, in general, don't have complement regulatory proteins (there are many exceptions, which reflect adaptation of microbial pathogens to vertebrate <b>immune</b> <b>defenses).</b> [...] Thus, the alternative complement pathway is able to distinguish self from non-self {{on the basis of}} the surface expression of complement regulatory proteins. Host cells don't accumulate cell surface C3b (and the proteolytic fragment of C3b called iC3b) because this is prevented by the complement regulatory proteins, while foreign cells, pathogens and abnormal surfaces may be heavily decorated with C3b and iC3b. [...] Accordingly, the alternative complement pathway is one element of innate immunity.|$|E

40|$|<b>Immune</b> <b>defense</b> at an {{interface}} with {{the external environment}} reflects the functions of physical and chemical barriers provided by epithelial and immune cells. Resident epithelial cells, such as keratinocytes, produce numerous peptides with direct antimicrobial activity but also provide a physical barrier against invading pathogens and signal the recruitment of circulating immune cells, such as neutrophils. Antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin are produced constitutively by neutrophils and are inducible in keratinocytes in response to infection. The multiplicity of antimicrobial peptides and their cellular sources has resulted in an incomplete {{understanding of the role}} of cathelicidin production by epithelial cells in cutaneous <b>immune</b> <b>defense.</b> Therefore, this study sought to evaluate keratinocyte antimicrobial activity and the potential contribution of keratinocyte cathelicidin to host protection against two leading human skin pathogens. Wild-type mice and those with a targeted deletion of the cathelicidin gene, Cnlp, were rendered neutropenic prior to cutaneous infection. Interestingly, Cnlp-deficient mice remained more susceptible to group A streptococcus infection than mice with Cnlp intact, suggesting the involvement of epithelial cell-derived cathelicidin in host <b>immune</b> <b>defense.</b> Keratinocytes were then isolated in culture and found to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, an effect that was partially dependent on their ability to synthesize and activate cathelicidin. Further, lentivirus-mediated delivery of activated human cathelicidin enhanced keratinocyte antimicrobial activity. Combined, these data illustrate the potential contribution of keratinocyte cathelicidin to the innate <b>immune</b> <b>defense</b> of skin against bacterial pathogens and highlight the need to consider epithelial antimicrobial function in the diagnosis and therapy of skin infection...|$|R
