5|$|After the Mariner and Viking {{spacecraft}} {{had returned}} pictures of Mars as <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars {{had to be}} abandoned, and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, {{the best known of}} which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{stars have}} been found to have planets to date, and four {{planetary}} systems have been discovered with the SuperWASP project. HD 142 is a yellow giant that has an apparent magnitude of 5.7, and has a planet (HD 142 b)1.36 times the mass of Jupiter which orbits every 328 days. HD 2039 is a yellow subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 9.0 around 330 light years away which has a planet (HD 2039 b) triple the mass of Jupiter. WASP-18 is a star of magnitude 9.29 which was discovered to have a hot Jupiter-like planet (WASP-18b) taking less than a day to orbit the star. The planet is suspected to be causing WASP-18 to appear older than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> WASP-4 and WASP-5 are solar-type yellow stars around 1000 light years distant and of 13th magnitude, each with a single planet larger than Jupiter. WASP-29 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K4V and visual magnitude 11.3, which has a planetary companion of similar size and mass to Saturn. The planet completes an orbit every 3.9 days.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{manages to}} contact UNIT to {{coordinate}} efforts {{of how to}} return the other passengers safely to Earth. The Doctor and Christina scout ahead, while the others attempt to repair the bus. The Doctor and Christina spot a sandstorm on the horizon when they are met by two Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship. They explain they were delivering a shipment to San Helios, which had housed over hundred billion just recently but now is desert wherever they scan. The Doctor has them scan the approaching sandstorm and finds <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a swarm of stingray-like aliens that are destroying the ecosystem. He suspects they are generating the wormhole to travel to their next planet to feed upon, and they must hurry and close the wormhole before they can reach Earth. Christina uses her burglary skills to obtain a power crystal and its mounting from the Tritovore ship, but accidentally wakes an alien stingray, which consumes the Tritovores.|$|E

5|$|The novel, {{described}} as a political, social and ethical commentary {{on the nature of}} good and evil, takes place in the Land of Oz, in the years leading to Dorothy's arrival. The story centers on Elphaba, the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious Wicked Witch of the West and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become Glinda the Good Witch of the South. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters and situations from L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and its 1939 film adaptation in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> to be 'Wicked', and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script. To this end, he collaborated with Emmy Award–winning writer Winnie Holzman to develop the outline of the plot {{over the course of a}} year while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
25|$|From this {{it can be}} {{seen that}} {{attributes}} are related to substance in some way. It is not clear, however, even from Spinoza's direct definition, whether, a) attributes are really the way(s) substance is, or b) attributes are simply ways to understand substance, but not necessarily the ways <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E

25|$|David Kronke, The Daily News of Los Angeles (April 22, 2001) — Nero Wolfe, alas, is {{undone by}} uneven {{performances}} {{and a sense}} that it's more witty and urbane than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> Hutton is too antic — {{he seems to be}} playing the sassy newsroom copy boy in a '30s B-picture — and his narration tries far too hard to push jokes that just aren't funny. Maury Chaykin, a normally reliable character actor, is alternately flat or rudderlessly blustery as Wolfe.|$|E
25|$|Virtual gastric band uses {{hypnosis}} to {{make the}} brain think the stomach is smaller than <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> and hence lower {{the amount of food}} ingested. This brings as a consequence weight reduction. This method is complemented with psychological treatment for anxiety management and with hypnopedia. Research has been conducted into the use of hypnosis as a weight management alternative. In 1996 a study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective for weight reduction if reinforced with hypnosis. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ACT, a mindfulness approach to weight loss, has also {{in the last few years}} been demonstrating its usefulness.|$|E
25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E

25|$|Allegorically, the Inferno {{represents}} the Christian soul seeing sin for what <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> {{and the three}} beasts represent three types of sin: the self-indulgent, the violent, and the malicious. These three types of sin also provide the three main divisions of Dante's Hell: Upper Hell, outside the city of Dis, for the four sins of indulgence (lust, gluttony, avarice, anger); Circle 7 {{for the sins of}} violence; and Circles 8 and 9 for the sins of malice (fraud and treachery). Added to these are two unlike categories that are specifically spiritual: Limbo, in Circle 1, contains the virtuous pagans who were not sinful but were ignorant of Christ, and Circle 6 contains the heretics who contradicted the doctrine and confused the spirit of Christ. The circles number 9, with the addition of Satan completing the structure of 9 + 1 = 10.|$|E
25|$|In the {{trenches}} of World War One, Johnson's name {{was used by}} British troops to describe the impact of German 150mm heavy artillery shells which had a black colour. In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert: We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue {{at the top of}} the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. <b>It</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but I think it is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there’s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.|$|E
25|$|An object either (1) is {{immediate}} to a sign, {{and that}} is the object as represented in the sign, or (2) is a dynamic object, which is the object as <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is,</b> on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's universe of discourse, the totality of things in that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) immediate to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) dyanamic, an actual interpretant, for example a state of agitation, or (3) final or normal, a question's true settlement, which would be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.|$|E

25|$|Whilst on {{the surface}} the new Potsdamer Platz appears so far to have {{lived up to its}} {{expectations}} as a futuristic centre of commerce at the heart of Europe's youngest capital city, there has been much debate as to just how successful <b>it</b> <b>really</b> <b>is.</b> Certainly its long term success and viability have become much harder to judge since the recent worldwide economic downturn, a situation compounded by the actions of its two principal owner-occupiers. Daimler and Sony caused a major surprise on 2 October 2007 when both announced that they were putting their respective complexes at Potsdamer Platz on the market. Whilst neither intended to move out, both felt it preferable to rent the space from new owners rather than continue to be the owners themselves (and so be responsible for the buildings' upkeep and maintenance). Daimler had recently come through a painful separation from their former American subsidiary Chrysler and needed a quick injection of cash in order to refocus on automotive production. Ironically, the announcement came on the ninth anniversary of their complex's official opening, a fact not lost on many people. Sony meanwhile, put their decision down to a need to review their global strategy {{in the face of a}} fast-changing worldwide economic climate. The implications for Potsdamer Platz were ominous, with suggestions that overall confidence in the project was faltering, and more pessimistic claims that the development had largely failed in its original intentions.|$|E
