5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun.

5|$|Believed to {{have been}} {{introduced}} by Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud, although some sources, such as Abdel-Wahab, claim {{that it was in}} use three centuries earlier, the flag was rectangular in shape and divided into nine stripes, the middle one green and double the size of all other bands, while the others alternated between yellow and red. Featured {{in the center of the}} green stripe was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade in white and the hilt multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each stripe. These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star voided with a <b>disk</b> <b>of</b> a different color in the center—either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue disk—, and a large disk voided in its lower right by a small <b>disk</b> <b>of</b> different color, with the combination being either a small red disk within a larger blue disk or a small yellow disk within a larger red disk. The first yellow stripe contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second stripe, red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third stripe (second yellow one) is identical to the first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth stripe (second white one) is identical to the second stripe.|$|E

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star. Detailed observations reveal a large <b>disk</b> <b>of</b> dust and gas orbiting the star, {{which was the first}} debris disk to be imaged around another star. In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there are indications that planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the <b>disk</b> <b>of</b> the gas and dust that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100150km and a small, rocky core.|$|E
5|$|Close {{examination}} of the inner region of the Andromeda Galaxy with the same telescope also showed a smaller dust ring that {{is believed to have}} been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago.

This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparative}} study <b>of</b> the circumstellar <b>disks</b> in Be/X-ray binaries and isolated Be stars {{based upon the}} H-alpha emission line. From this comparison {{it follows that the}} overall structure <b>of</b> the <b>disks</b> in the Be/X-ray binaries is similar to the <b>disks</b> <b>of</b> other Be stars, i. e. they are axisymmetric and rotationally supported. The factors for the line broadening (rotation and temperature) in the <b>disks</b> <b>of</b> the Be stars and the Be/X-ray binaries seem to be identical. However, we do detect some intriguing differences between the envelopes. On average, the circumstellar <b>disks</b> <b>of</b> the Be/X-ray binaries are twice as dense as the <b>disks</b> <b>of</b> the isolated Be stars. The different distribution of the Be/X-ray binaries and the Be stars seen in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) versus peak separation diagram indicates that the disks in Be/X-ray binaries have on average a smaller size, probably truncated by the compact object.

5|$|Dynamical {{friction}} from {{a massive}} belt of planetesimals could also enable Planet Nine's capture {{in a stable}} orbit. Recent models propose that a 60–130 Earth mass <b>disk</b> <b>of</b> planetesimals could have formed via streaming instabilities following the photoevaporation of the outer parts of the gas disk. If the disk had a distant inner edge, 100–200 AU, a planet encountering Neptune would have a 20% chance of being captured in an orbit similar to that proposed for Planet Nine. The observed clustering is more likely if the inner edge is at 200 AU. Unlike the gas nebula the planetesimal disk {{is likely to be}} long lived, potentially allowing a later capture.|$|E
