Tunable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization {{of the products}} provides a unique ability {{to learn about the}} secondary reaction products of the nascent photoproducts formed. The data show evidence for four significant primary reaction channels: a previously unidentified low kinetic energy C-Cl bond <b>fission</b> <b>channel</b> producing unstable allyl radicals, an excited state C-Cl bond <b>fission</b> <b>channel</b> producing Cl atoms with high translational energy, an HCl elimination pathway releasing significant energy to product translation to HCl and its momentum-matched mass 40 partner, and an HCl elimination channel producing low kinetic energy HCl products and predominantly unstable mass 40 products. The measured branching of these primary reaction channels of [all C-Cl] : [fast C-Cl] : [slow C-Cl] : [fast HCl] : [slow HCl] : [all HCl] is 1. 00 : 0. 971 : 0. 029 : 0. 291 : 0. 167 : 0. 458 (where fast refers to the high recoil kinetic energy channels).

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{procedure}} to describe the fission-fragment mass distributions of fissioning systems in the actinide region by a sum of at least 5 Gaussian curves, one for the symmetric component and a few additional ones, together with their complementary parts, for the asymmetric components. These components {{have been attributed to}} the influence of fragment shells, e. g. in the statistical scission-point model of Wilkins, Steinberg and Chasman. They have also been associated with valleys in the potential-energy landscape between the outer saddle and the scission configuration in the multi-channel fission model of Brosa. When the relative yields, the widths and the mean mass-asymmetry values of these components are fitted to experimental data, the mass distributions can be very well reproduced. Moreover, these <b>fission</b> <b>channels</b> are characterised by specific values of charge polarisation, total kinetic energy and prompt-neutron yields. The present contribution investigates the systematic variation of the characteristic fission-channel properties {{as a function of the}} composition and the excitation energy of the fissioning system. The mean position of the asymmetric <b>fission</b> <b>channels</b> in the heavy fragment is almost constant in atomic number. The deformation of the nascent fragments at scission, which is the main source of excitation energy of the separated fission fragments ending up in prompt-neutron emission, is found to be a unique function of Z for the light and the heavy fragment of the asymmetric <b>fission</b> <b>channels.</b> A variation of the initial excitation energy of the fissioning system above the fission saddle is only seen in the neutron yield of the heavy fragment. The charge polarisation in the two most important asymmetric <b>fission</b> <b>channels</b> is found to be constant and to appreciably exceed the macroscopic value. The variation of the relative yields and of the positions of the <b>fission</b> <b>channels</b> as a function of the composition and excitation energy of the fissioning system obey a hidden systematics that can be explained by the number of states in the vicinity of the outer fission barrier as a function of mass asymmetry, if the potential is constructed as the sum of the macroscopic contribution of the compound nucleus and empirically determined fragment shells.

The experiments {{were designed to}} probe the branching to the three unimolecular dissociation pathways of the radical and to test theoretical predictions of the relevant dissociation barriers. Our crossed laser-molecular beam studies show that 193 nm photolysis of 2 -chloro- 2 -butene produces 2 -buten- 2 -yl in the initial photolytic step. A minor C-Cl bond <b>fission</b> <b>channel</b> forms electronically excited 2 -buten- 2 -yl radicals and the dominant C-Cl bond <b>fission</b> <b>channel</b> produces ground-state 2 -buten- 2 -yl radicals {{with a range of}} internal energies that spans the barriers to dissociation of the radical.
