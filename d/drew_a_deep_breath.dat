60|$|Heyst <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> The girl {{gave him}} a quick, wide-eyed glance.|$|E
60|$|Bill {{fastened}} a gimlet eye {{upon his}} brother-in-law and <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|The old man stopped abruptly, {{and taking}} his outstretched hand, <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{placing the}} horn {{to his lips}} and <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> he blew with his utmost force.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eight," [...] Tyrrel suggested, <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of suspense. It {{was a big}} sum, indeed, for {{a modest}} estate like Penmorgan.|$|R
6000|$|... "First Ursula, then Eunice," [...] said Tabitha, <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "I can’t stay here. I’ll {{dress and}} wait for the morning." ...|$|R
60|$|Stoutenburg, having gained his point, {{jumped to}} his feet and <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|I <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and slowly}} pressed on the trigger. The buck stood {{still as a}} stone.|$|E
60|$|He put the {{cigarette}} between his lips, <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> then slowly sent the smoke down his nostrils.|$|E
6000|$|Cayke stared so {{hard that}} her eyes seemed about to pop out of her head. [...] "O-o-o-h!" [...] she exclaimed, <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of delight.|$|R
60|$|Again, with closed eyes, she lay {{silent for}} a while. Once she {{attempted}} to <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> <b>breath,</b> which caused her to cough slightly several times.|$|R
60|$|Not {{until he}} was some {{distance}} away did he <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> Somehow {{he felt as if}} he had just emerged from a prison cell.|$|R
60|$|Sally {{stopped and}} <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> Ginger Kemp {{did not reply}} for a moment. He seemed greatly impressed.|$|E

60|$|John <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> Pugsy, {{removing}} the cigarette from his mouth, delivered himself of a stately word of praise.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad he didn't {{get away}} with my boat," [...] {{returned}} the money-lender's son, <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "I'll keep this handkerchief to remember him by." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>draws</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> misled young man. The {{night is}} very beautiful. It is {{near to the}} dawn {{now and in the}} bushes live things are {{beginning}} to stir and whisper.|$|R
60|$|He {{heard her}} <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> and silence fell upon them again. The dog {{down the road}} had stopped barking. The woman in the flat had stopped singing. They were curiously alone.|$|R
60|$|Ingleby, {{in spite}} of his protestations, <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief, but Leger, who {{appeared}} to be recovering now, smiled.|$|E
60|$|At length Broad {{ceased to}} expand, <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> {{that made the}} whole forest tremble, and shrank into his usual size.|$|E
60|$|The {{thought that}} the scout was at hand to assist them cheered the young officer wonderfully, and he <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] Tyrrel answered, <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief. [...] "I ask no {{more than}} that. Say what you can honestly. The money shall be paid you {{before the end of}} a fortnight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I met Lucy outside," [...] replied Pan, <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> [...] "But {{first about}} Dad. I didn't {{take time to}} talk much with him. I wanted to see you.... Is Dad well in health?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{paused to}} <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and his big hands trembled over the blaze. Anson leaned forward, like a serpent ready to strike, and Jim Wilson was as tense with his divination {{of the plot}} at hand.|$|R
60|$|Patsy <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> {{but said}} nothing to the others, who, when {{relieved}} of the boy's presence, began to discuss volubly his singular proposal.|$|E
60|$|Like this! Aline <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> It {{would be}} like this--forever and ever and ever--until she died. She bent forward and stared at him.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Milroy <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief. [...] "Thank you," [...] she said, {{loud enough}} for her {{daughter}} to hear. [...] "I want nothing more." ...|$|E
6000|$|We had sat {{together}} by the hall fire for about ten minutes, when {{he took out his}} handkerchief, and wiped away the perspiration from his forehead, <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> of relief. [...] "It has gone!" [...] he said faintly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Britt was right," [...] he exclaimed, <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> {{as if to}} free {{his lungs}} of the foul air of deceit. [...] "They are all frauds together," [...] and with this {{decision}} came {{a sense of relief}} as well as of loss.|$|R
6000|$|The {{enclosed}} was a jeweller's bill, {{the length}} and the total of which lengthened his face and <b>drew</b> from him <b>a</b> low whistle. [...] He held {{it in his hand}} for a long time, standing quite still and silent. Then <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> he said aloud: ...|$|R
6000|$|Linley <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> {{of relief}} {{when he was}} left alone with his wife. [...] "What makes your mother so {{particularly}} disagreeable this morning?" [...] he inquired.|$|E
6000|$|Duane <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and {{sheathed}} his gun. He felt {{calm and}} cool, glad the fray was over. One violent expression burst from him. [...] "The fool!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'All right, then, I'll bet a penny I'm right.' He <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> as {{who should}} say, 'It's {{a lot of}} money, but it's worth risking it.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "You {{should wear}} them at night," [...] Ma said. Mary did, but Laura {{could not bear}} at night the torment of the steels that would not let her <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath.</b> Always before she could get to sleep, {{she had to take}} off her corsets.|$|R
6000|$|... "RESPONSIO MORTIFERA." [...] Fatal answer. Yes, {{all present}} {{knew that it}} was, indeed, a fatal answer. Then there fell a silence such as falls in a sick-room when the watchers of the dying <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> and say softly one to another, [...] "All is over." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{crossed the}} street, went through office and lobby, and then Duane asked MacNelly {{to take them}} to a private room. Without a word the Captain complied.
