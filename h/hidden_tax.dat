2500|$|Because {{carbon dioxide}} {{emitting}} fossil fuels are intrinsically {{connected to a}} developed nation-state's economy, the taxation of fossil fuels or policies that decrease the availability of cost-effective fossil fuels is a significant political matter for fear that those taxes might precipitate a decrease in economic vitality. [...] The replacement of cost-effective fossil fuels with more expensive renewable energy sources are {{seen by many as}} a <b>hidden</b> <b>tax</b> that would achieve the same result of depressing economic vitality and lead to impoverishment. [...] Beyond the economic vitality of a single nation, some are concerned that taxation would depress economic activity in a manner that could affect the geopolitical order by providing incentives to one set of countries over another.|$|E

2500|$|The Province of Manitoba charges Manitoba Hydro a water {{rental fee}} {{proportionate}} {{to the total}} volume of water passed through the generating stations. Increases in this rental have provided an important stream of non-tax revenue to the Provincial government. [...] While at first glance it may seem [...] for the provincial government to collect such fees from a company it owns, the government argues that such fees help ensure that Manitobans receive a direct return on that portion of energy resources that is exported. More controversially, in 2002-2004 the New Democratic Party provincial government collected a direct dividend from Manitoba Hydro. This was criticized by the provincial opposition parties for various reasons but mostly as evidence that Hydro rates were unnecessarily high with the excess amounting to a <b>hidden</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Congress used {{four main}} methods {{to cover the}} cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver). Congress made two issues of paper money, in 1775–1780, and in 1780–81. The first issue {{amounted}} to 242million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was [...] "not worth a Continental", as people said, and a second issue of new currency was attempted. The second issue quickly became nearly worthless—but it was redeemed by the new federal government in 1791 at 100 cents on the dollar. At the same time the states, especially Virginia and the Carolinas, issued over 200million dollars of their own currency. In effect, the paper money was a <b>hidden</b> <b>tax</b> on the people, and indeed was the only method of taxation that was possible at the time. The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes—but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper. The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages—usually in arrears—declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships suffered by their families.|$|E

5000|$|If the {{practice}} of the industry causes more complicated pricing, which is hard for the consumer to understand (such as risk-based pricing, <b>hidden</b> <b>taxes</b> and fees in the wireless industry, negotiable pricing), this can cause competition based on price to be meaningless (because it would be too complicated to explain to the customer in a short advertisement).

5000|$|High or {{unpredictable}} inflation {{rates are}} regarded as harmful to an overall economy. They add inefficiencies in the market, and {{make it difficult for}} companies to budget or plan long-term. Inflation can act as a drag on productivity as companies are forced to shift resources away from products and services in order to focus on profit and losses from currency inflation. [...] Uncertainty about the future purchasing power of money discourages investment and saving. [...] Inflation can also impose <b>hidden</b> <b>tax</b> increases. For instance, inflated earnings push taxpayers into higher income tax rates unless the tax brackets are indexed to inflation.|$|E
50|$|A {{major theme}} {{throughout}} the work also {{revolves around the}} idea of inflation as a <b>hidden</b> <b>tax</b> making warfare much easier to wage. Because people will reject the notion of increasing direct taxes, inflation is then used to help service the overwhelming debts incurred through warfare. In turn the purchasing power of the masses is diminished, yet most people are unaware. Under Ron Paul's theory, this diminution has the biggest impact on low income individuals since it is a regressive tax. Paul argues that the CPI presently does not include food and energy, yet these are the items on which the majority of poor peoples' income is spent.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown {{that in the}} design of a system of {{intergovernmental}} transfers based on fiscal capacities and fiscal needs {{it is important not to}} create perverse incentives for the sub-national governments. Several proposals for Argentina assume that the tax-rate elasticities of the tax bases are zero and, in this way, the sub-national governments cannot modify their standard fiscal capacity. In general terms, when these elasticities are different from zero, the jurisdictions will have incentives to manipulate tax rates to obtain higher transfers. They will also have incentives to <b>hide</b> <b>tax</b> bases. To avoid these manipulations fiscal capacities and fiscal needs must be estimated using exogenous data for these governments.

50|$|In {{the colonial}} era, Americans insisted on their rights as Englishmen {{to have their}} own {{legislature}} raise all taxes. Tax loads were very light. Beginning in 1765 the British Parliament asserted its supreme authority to lay taxes, and a series of American protests began that led directly to the American Revolution. The first wave of protests attacked the Stamp Act of 1765, and marked the first time Americans from each of the 13 colonies met together and planned a common front against taxes the colonists considered illegal.

Though technically excise, these taxes are really just substitutes for direct taxes, rather than being levied for the usual reasons for excise.|$|R
