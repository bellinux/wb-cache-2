2500|$|American Communications Association v. Douds is also {{important}} because {{it is part of}} the Court's evolving jurisprudence on bills of attainder. It stands firmly in the Court's bill of attainder jurisprudence established by Justice Frankfurter in his dissent in United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946), thereafter adopted by a majority of the Court. Frankfurter and a majority of the Court believed that the framers of the Constitution were not concerned as much with unfairness as they were with specification of the offense, the legislative (rather than judicial) determination of guilt, and retribution for past acts. Douds stands firmly in this analysis, which found favor with the Court until 1965. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> <b>then,</b> that the Supreme Court refused to declare Section 9(h) a bill of attainder, because it prohibited future rather than past acts. The ability to [...] "escape" [...] the penalty (e.g., renounce membership in the Communist Party and take the oath) also negated any conclusion that Section 9(h) was a bill of attainder. In 1965, however, the Supreme Court held, 5-to-4, that Section 504 of the Taft-Hartley Act was a bill of attainder in United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437 (1965). Section 504 made it an actual crime for any person who was or had been a member of the Communist Party to serve as an officer in a labor union. The Court overturned Section 504 because past behavior was being punished. But the Court went further, and said that singling out members of the Communist Party for punishment also invalidated Section 504 as a bill of attainder. How could the Court reconcile this with its analysis in Douds, where it had not held such specificity to invalidate the law? [...] The Brown Court said that general legislation which required regulatory rulemaking did not specify individuals well enough to make the law a bill of attainder. That regulatory action was needed under Section 9(h) but not under Section 504 saved Section 9(h). The Court implied that its Equal Protection analysis would be applied in cases where punishment was meted out under regulatory procedures, and that due process and equal protection would guarantee rights in these situations. Douds was difficult to reconcile with Brown in another way, too. [...] Douds had focused heavily on the fact that the Taft-Hartley Act's restrictions were intended to prevent future, not past, actions. [...] This was critical to saving Section 9(h). But in Brown, the Court held that [...] "Punishment serves several purposes; retributive, rehabilitative, deterrent—and preventive", establishing that a law can be a bill of attainder even it is preventive.|$|E

2500|$|Following this adventure, Burton {{prepared}} {{to set out}} for the interior accompanied by Lieutenant Speke, Lieutenant G. E. Herne and Lieutenant William Stroyan and a number of Africans employed as bearers. However, while the expedition was camped near Berbera, his party was attacked by a group of Somali waranle ("warriors"). The officers estimated the number of attackers at 200. In the ensuing fight, Stroyan was killed and Speke was captured and wounded in eleven places before he managed to escape. Burton was impaled with a javelin, the point entering one cheek and exiting the other. This wound left a notable scar that can be easily seen on portraits and photographs. He was forced to make his escape with the weapon still transfixing his head. It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>then</b> that he found the Somalis to be a [...] "fierce and turbulent race". However, the failure of this expedition was viewed harshly by the authorities, and a two-year investigation was set up to determine to what extent Burton was culpable for this disaster. While he was largely cleared of any blame, this did not help his career. He describes the harrowing attack in First Footsteps in East Africa (1856).|$|R
40|$|Managed care {{consists}} {{of a set of}} approaches, organizational arrange-ments, and strategies with considerable diversity of practice. A key ele-ment, which requires considerable management of available resources, is prepayment for care with limited consumer out-of-pocket obligations. Most common among management strategies is the use of capitation, risk-sharing and payment incentives, utilization review, and services sub-stitution. Other developing strategies include physician profiling, use of practice guidelines and clinical pathways, disease management, and qual-ity monitoring. The growth of managed care organizations (MCOs) has resulted in considerable private centralization of the management of health care ser-vices. It has shifted considerable power and control from individual pro-fessionals, who viewed themselves as autonomous experts, to adminis-trators and managers, who increasingly establish constraints on health care practice.

5000|$|The {{emphasis}} of transitional justice was on how abuses {{of human rights}} get treated during political transition: legal and criminal prosecution.

50|$|The {{most likely}} {{candidate}} for {{the introduction of the}} Paenitentiale Umbrense to the Continent is Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon missionary and a competent canonist who work tirelessly to reform the Frankish, German and Bavarian churches {{in the first half of}} the eighth century.

40|$|In November 2006 the New Zealand Law Commission and the Ministry of Justice {{launched}} a joint programme of tribunal reform in New Zealand. The {{aim of the}} project was to “recommend a structure for existing tribunals as well as a framework for the establishment of tribunals in the future”. As I write this, the whisper from the Beehive suggests that the change in government means that the tribunal reform project is to be put on ice. This is a disappointing development but it should not surprise us. Although the tribunal system in New Zealand has been ripe for reform almost since the first tribunal was established, successive attempts to introduce coherence to the “system” have foundered in the difficult waters of the legislative process. From their humble (and relatively late) beginnings in 1908, New Zealand's system of tribunals now occupies a significant (perhaps even pre-eminent) position in New Zealand's system of justice, particularly in the field of Administrative Law. Despite this, tribunals remain a largely forgotten element of the wider legal system. Few student texts give much mentioned of them and they remain very much an academic and political backwater. It should <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>then</b> that, given their astonishingly low profile in New Zealand, tribunals remain largely un-loved, unnoticed and un-reformed institutions. This paper from which it comes aims to at least partially fill the lacuna in New Zealand's legal literature by examining the current system {{in the light of the}} Law Commission's proposals...|$|R
40|$|Troubled times often {{gives rise}} to great art that {{reflects}} those troubles. So too with political theory. The greatest work of twentieth century political theory, John Rawls's A theory of justice, was inspired in various respects by extreme social and economic inequality, racialized slavery and racial segregation in the United States. Arguably the most influential work of political theory since Rawls—Michael Walzer's Just and unjust wars—a sustained and historically informed reflection on the morality of interstate armed conflict—was written {{in the midst of}} the Vietnam War. It should <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> <b>then,</b> that the bellicose period of the past 20 years should give rise to a robust new literature in political theory on the morality of armed conflict. It has been of uneven quality, and to some extent episodic, responding to particular challenges—the increased prevalence of asymmetric warfare and the permissibility of preventive or preemptive war—that have arisen as a result of specific events. In the past decade, however, a group of philosophers has begun to pose more fundamental questions about the reigning theory of the morality of armed conflict warfare—just war theory—as formulated by Walzer and others. Jeff McMahan's concise, inventive and tightly argued work Killing in war is without doubt the most important of these challenges to the reigning theory of the just war. This review article discusses McMahan's work, some of the critical attention it has received, and its potential implications for practice...|$|R
