The relationship between dislocations and trapped hydrogen was explored using thermally induced desorption. It {{was found that the}} dislocations in Pd caused by hydrogen absorption anneal over a wide range of temperatures and that although they start to anneal below 250 ^∘C, temperatures well above 750 ^∘C are required to <b>fully</b> <b>anneal</b> the metal. It was shown that allowing further time at lower temperatures does not further anneal the metal. It is suggested that this is due to dislocation tangling and pinning, causing different temperatures to be required for different pinning defects. It was found that hydrogen trapped in LaNi 5 is released {{in a wide range of}} temperatures and it was therefore concluded that hydrogen is trapped in the dislocation strain field and dislocation core as well as vacancies. The direct comparison of deuterium release and dislocation density showed no correlation, in agreement with previous indirect comparisons. Dislocations in LaNi 5 were shown to anneal at temperatures as low as 150 ^∘C, in contrast to previous reports which suggested more than 500 ^∘C was required. This lower annealing temperature for dislocations at least partly explains why low temperature ageing increases the pressure hysteresis in hydrogen cycled LaNi 5...|$|R

40|$|The In situ Compression of Annealed Molybdenum Nanopillars in the Transmission Electron MicroscopebyMatthew LowryDoctor of Philosophy in Engineering - Materials Science and EngineeringUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Andrew Minor, Co-chairProfessor J. W. Morris, Jr., Co-chair	The {{compression}} of {{focused ion beam}} (FIB) machined metallic pillars with submicron diameters offers {{a unique opportunity to}} explore dislocation behavior in a limited volume. This data is of particular interest due to the recent observation of an apparent size effect in the {{compression of}} metallic pillars. More specifically, metallic pillars with diameters on the order of microns and below have shown elevated yield stresses, elevated flow stresses, stochastic yield point fluctuations, and large strain bursts relative to the bulk. By harnessing the resolution of the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and performing the compressions in situ in the TEM, it is possible to directly observe dislocation behavior during compression and thereby help to explain the source of the size effect. Moreover, the results from in situ compressions {{can be used as a}} comparison point for theoretical models that also attempt to explain the dislocation behavior leading to the size effect. 	Standing in the way of performing such compressions in situ in the TEM is the high density of defects imparted by FIB milling, in particular the high density of dislocations. The dislocations are too dense to see individual dislocation behavior, limiting the utility of the TEM. This dissertation details efforts to remove dislocations from FIB-milled molybdenum by in situ annealing in the TEM, thereby unlocking the FIB as a sample preparation technique for in situ TEM studies of mechanical properties. 	To that end, three classes of pillars were prepared from molybdenum by FIB-milling and subsequent in situ annealing in the TEM: as-fabricated pillars, <b>fully</b> <b>annealed</b> pillars, and partially annealed pillars. As-fabricated pillars were simply milled and then directly compressed without any annealing. The <b>fully</b> <b>annealed</b> pillars, on the other hand, were annealed such that nearly all dislocations were driven from the pillars, leaving either zero or a few isolated dislocations. The pillars in the final class, those that were partially annealed, were annealed such that the dislocation density was reduced but a significant density remained. Each class of pillar displayed a distinct mechanical response under subsequent in situ compression in the TEM, in which load-displacement data was collected in tandem with visual data from the TEM. 	It was found that as-fabricated pillars behaved much the same as ex situ tests performed by others, displaying the size effect already reported. Moreover, the high density of defects made it difficult to interpret dislocation behavior, as it was not possible to discern the motion of individual dislocations. On the other end of the spectrum, the <b>fully</b> <b>annealed</b> pillars behaved as pristine crystals, loading elastically until sudden catastrophic collapse. Using a Hertzian analysis, it was found that <b>fully</b> <b>annealed</b> pillars sustained stresses approaching the ideal strength of molybdenum. Finally, the partially annealed pillars behaved in an intermediate manner, displaying limited plasticity akin to <b>fully</b> <b>annealed</b> pillars when the dislocation density was low, and widespread plasticity corresponding to the size effect when the density was higher. Ultimately, it was found that through annealing, it is possible to explore dislocation behavior in pillars with a wide range of dislocation densities. Moreover, the FIB can also be used in future studies of mechanical behavior in limited volumes without necessarily being limited by the initial dislocation density imparted by the FIB...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a complete and}} fully automatic method for estimating the volume of an airbag, through all stages of its inflation, with multiple synchronized high-speed cameras. Using recorded contours of the inflating airbag, its visual hull is reconstructed with a novel method: The intersections of all back-projected contours are first identified with an accelerated epipolar algorithm. These intersections, together with additional points sampled from concave surface regions of the visual hull, are then Delaunay triangulated to a connected set of tetrahedra. Finally, the visual hull is extracted by carving away the tetrahedra that are classified as inconsistent with the contours, according to a voting procedure. The volume of an airbag's visual hull is always larger than the airbag's real volume. By projecting a known synthetic model of the airbag into the cameras, this volume offset is computed, and an accurate estimate of the real airbag volume is extracted. Even though volume estimates can be computed for all camera setups, the cameras should be specially posed to achieve optimal results.

The sequential engineering of porous organic nanoarchitectures based on the covalent Ullmann coupling of star-shaped 1, 3, 5 -tris(3, 5 -dibromophenyl) benzene molecules on Au(111) in vacuum is investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. This molecule can form one-covalent-bond or two-covalent-bonds with neighboring molecules. At room temperature, the molecules self-assemble into a porous halogen-bonded network stabilized by two types of X 3 synthons. One-covalent-bond dimers appear on the surface after annealing at 145 °C. One-covalent-bond chains are created after annealing at 170 °C. Most of the molecules are bonded to two neighbors. One-covalent-bond hexagons as well as two-covalent-bond dimers are appearing on the surface after annealing at 175 °C.
