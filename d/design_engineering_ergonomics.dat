40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal International Journal of the Digital Human and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper aims to provide a retrospective {{of the use of}} a digital human modelling tool (SAMMIE) that was perhaps the first usable tool and is still active today. Relationships between digital human modelling and inclusive <b>design,</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> and <b>ergonomics</b> practice are discussed using examples from design studies using SAMMIE and government-funded research. Important issues such as accuracy of representation and handling multivariate rather than univariate evaluations are discussed together with methods of use in terms of defining end product users and tasks. Consideration is given {{to the use of the}} digital human modelling approach by non-ergonomists particularly with respect to understanding of the impact of human variability, jurisdiction and communication issues...|$|R

40|$|This course aims {{to provide}} {{insights}} into the ways that industrial and organisational psychology can help organisations to develop human resource management systems {{that allow them to}} be both competitive and humane. As an applied area of psychology, the overall objective of the course is to integrate psychological theory and research with the tools and methods that will enable a student to translate theory into practice effectively. The course will take the student through the context of personnel selection, the selection process; (e. g. job analysis, designing selection procedures, criterion development,), the tools of selection; (e. g. the nature of psychological measurement, psychological testing, the selection interview), selection for specific occupations; and performance appraisal and counselling; (the appraisal process, the context of performance assessment, work envoronment and job <b>design,</b> <b>engineering</b> psychology and <b>ergonomics,</b> and work stress and occupational health). As more and more organisations recognise their reliance on their human resources, and the importance of a good person-organisation fit, such human resource management systems become vital for organisational effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{poverty is}} a {{critical}} issue for a globally ageing population. Increasing heating/cooling requirements combined with declining incomes {{has resulted in a}} global challenge that requires urgent attention. Three Scottish Universities/Colleges collaborated on a user centred and user led concept development process that focused on empowering elderly users to take steps to make their energy usage more cost effective and efficient. This study starts by analysing a cross section of home energy products and then develops and evaluates concepts with a range of stakeholders, including housing associations. The study benefitted from Research Teaching linkages/projects across undergraduate and postgraduate levels. From the initial research, it was concluded that there are serious usability issues with existing products. These failings prevent the products from being successful within the chosen demographic and ironically add to the energy challenge. Design concepts were developed by academic (teaching and research) staff from a diversity of backgrounds including: Electronic and Electrical <b>Engineering,</b> Interaction <b>Design,</b> Product <b>Design</b> <b>Engineering,</b> Psychology, <b>Ergonomics</b> and Social Sciences. The concept and design development benefited from engagement with the target audience and the paper will present the findings of this engagement. Key evaluation targets for the concepts were based on user insights, including: user-friendly interface; informative displays; ease of implementation and understanding of data. Concepts also had to fundamentally gain the confidence of the demographic through demonstrating how one could reduce energy consumption, therefore reducing fuel poverty. This step change in the acceptance would be a critical driver during the development of the concepts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- When {{designing}} a product {{for every day}} use, designer has to consider various influential factors, among them aesthetics and ergonomics are very important. In the group of different products covering the same main function (purpose), those that look more attractive are usually more successful on the market. To {{be able to develop}} successful design solutions, designer has to possess expert knowledge and experience in many fields of <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> including <b>ergonomics</b> and aesthetics. Such experts are rare. Teams of experts are usually established as alternative, yet it increases development costs of the product. The other possibility is to support designer with expert advices, given by the intelligent computer program. The paper presents a proposal for the intelligent advisory system with expert knowledge in fields of aesthetic and ergonomic design that would be able to offer expert help to the designer regarding of ergonomics and aesthetics of the product.

40|$|In general, {{computer}} {{tools for}} ergonomic CAD do not assist designer with higher level advice when performing ergonomic design. Designer has to possess expert {{knowledge and experience}} in many fields of <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> including <b>ergonomics</b> in order to deliver successful designs. Such multi-levelexperts are rare and usually occupied. Two alternative ways are used to substitute these experts: teams of experts covering different areas of knowledge are established or some intelligent computer programs with expert knowledge are applied. In the second case, expert knowledge has to be collected, organized and encoded into the knowledge base of the system. An intelligent decision support system has been developed in order to overcome this bottleneck. This paper presents a knowledge base, containing ergonomic design knowledge specific for hand tools design. A pneumatic hammer handle design {{is used as a}} case study to show how ergonomic design knowledge built in the system is used to improve the ergonomic value of the product...|$|R

40|$|The Sterilization {{process of}} {{pharmaceutical}} {{drugs in the}} world is important. That is absolutely necessary to prevent contamination of the drug to the effects from the outside. One of technique to keep the drug packaging sterilization is to use glass vials glass ampoule). In the fast decade Glass vials with click-open system widely used by the pharmaceutical industry to conduct drug packaging, especially in the form of Liquid. In terms of sterilization, glass ampoule was able to prevent the contamination of drugs against external influences, but from the use by health workers there are still some problems to the use of glass ampoules. Some of the problems include the possibility scratch paramedics hands when breaking ampoules head, the chances of transmitting diseases (hepatitis, HIV) and the possible presence of small pieces of glass ampoules are included in the drug when cutbacks are not perfect. This study will resolve the problem above design method that begins with identifying needs (Costumer Needs Identification), the development of concept (concept generation), the selection of concepts (concept selection), <b>design</b> analysis (<b>ergonomics,</b> <b>engineering),</b> prototype, prototype and improved prototype.
