5|$|There is much {{interest}} in the coordination chemistry of neptunium, because <b>its</b> <b>five</b> oxidation states all exhibit their own distinctive chemical behavior, and the coordination chemistry of the actinides is heavily influenced by the actinide contraction (the greater-than-expected decrease in ionic radii across the actinide series, analogous to the lanthanide contraction).|$|E

Despite a large-scale search for the boat or any possible remnants, no trace was ever found. The remnants of Pauline triggered showers over the southwest United States and may have been responsible for a damaging tornado which occurred near Glendale, Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Titania orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of about , being the second farthest from the planet among <b>its</b> <b>five</b> major moons. Titania's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 8.7 days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Titania is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward the planet.|$|E

5|$|Allan Border is {{a former}} {{international}} cricketer and captain of the Australia cricket team. A left-handed middle order batsman, he scored centuries in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Border scored 11,174 runs in 156 Tests and captained Australia in 93 of them. He holds the record for consecutive appearances (153 matches) as a player in Tests. Border was named by Wisden as one of <b>its</b> <b>five</b> Cricketers of the Year in 1982.

5|$|At 08:00, two {{formations}} 18 Bf 109s of I and III./JG 77, led by Major Siegfried Freytag, {{took off}} with their pathfinders. At the same time 23 Bf 109s of II./JG 77 took off. Around the Bocholt area they formed up {{with the other two}} Gruppen. Heading south and still north of Antwerp, JG 77 passed Woensdrecht airfield. It was home to No. 132 Wing RAF and <b>its</b> <b>five</b> Spitfire squadrons; No. 331 Squadron RAF, No. 332 Squadron RAF (Norwegian), No. 66 Squadron RAF and No. 127 Squadron RAF, and No. 322 Squadron RAF (Dutch). Some pilots from II./JG 77 either mistakenly believed it to be Antwerp, or thought the opportunity was too good to pass up. Two German fighters were claimed shot down, and one pilot captured. However, none of the JG 77 casualties fit this description.|$|E
