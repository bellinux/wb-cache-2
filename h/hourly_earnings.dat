2500|$|The gender pay gap is the {{difference}} between male and female earnings. In 2008 the OECD suggested that the median earnings of female full-time workers were 17% lower than the earnings of their male counterparts and that [...] "30% of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the labour market." [...] The European Commission suggested that women's <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings</b> were 17.5% lower on average in the 27 EU Member States in 2008. A paper by political activist website [...] "nationalpartnership.org" [...] suggests that as of April 2017, women in the United States were on average paid [...] "80 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to an annual gender wage gap of $10,470".

30|$|In column (2), the {{distance}} measure and the dummies for mismatch and weak match are included {{at the same}} time as independent variables in the <b>hourly</b> labor <b>earnings</b> equation. In this case, the estimated coefficient for the mismatch dummy drops (in absolute value) from −[*] 0.318 to −[*] 0.076, while the coefficient for weak match drops from −[*] 0.061 to −[*] 0.003 and remains non-significant. So, adding {{the distance}} measure to the set of independent variables, the coefficient for mismatch dummy is about 75 % smaller relative to the result reported in column (1). Also, the distance measure seems to be related to important changes in <b>hourly</b> labor <b>earnings.</b> Evidence indicates that a 0.10 increase in the distance measure, which ranges between 0 and 1, is associated with 5 % lower labor earnings.|$|R

U.S. real average <b>hourly</b> <b>earnings</b> are essentially flat to down, with today's inflation-adjusted wage equating to about the same level as that attained by workers in 1970. ... So where have the benefits of technology-driven productivity cycle gone? Almost exclusively to corporations and their very top executives." [...] In addition to the technological side of it, the affected functionality emanates from the perceived unfairness and the reduced trust of people towards the state. The study by Kristal and Cohen showed that rising wage inequality has brought about an unhealthy competition between institutions and technology. [...] The technological changes, with computerization of the workplace, seem to give an upper hand to the high-skilled workers as the primary cause of inequality in America. The qualified will always be considered to be in a better position as compared to those dealing with hand work leading to replacements and unequal distribution of resources.|$|E

30|$|The {{results show}} that <b>hourly</b> labor <b>earnings</b> {{penalties}} tend to increase as the distance measure between occupation and field and study enlarges.

Thus, estimates suggest that the continuous measure of mismatch presented here helps to capture {{an important part of}} the heterogeneity in the labor earnings differences between mismatched and matched workers that is not accounted for by binary variables.|$|R
