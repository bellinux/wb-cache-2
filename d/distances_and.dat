5|$|After the war, many Presbyterian leaders {{felt the}} need to adopt a new {{organizational}} structure. The Synod of New York and Philadelphia was intended to be an annual gathering of the members of all presbyteries and one elder from every congregation.

5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service {{in large numbers}} seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, {{a part of the}} local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater <b>distances</b> <b>and</b> families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Cartography, {{the study}} and {{practice}} of map-making, and geography, {{the study of the}} lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth.

5|$|GRBs {{were first}} {{detected}} in 1967 by the Vela satellites, {{which had been}} designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests. Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, and thus their <b>distances</b> <b>and</b> energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.|$|E

5|$|Special Stages are {{entered by}} finding giant rings hidden in secret passageways: the player {{is placed in}} a 3D {{environment}} and must turn all {{of a number of}} blue spheres red by running through them, but must avoid all red spheres, including formerly blue ones.

Completing a Special Stage earns the player a Chaos Emerald; collecting all seven Emeralds allows the player to turn into Super Sonic or Super Knuckles, more powerful versions of the characters.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog was {{developed}} {{for its ability to}} encourage reluctant cattle to travel long <b>distances</b> <b>and</b> may be the best breed in the world for this work.

5|$|The {{galaxy is}} {{inclined}} an estimated 77° {{relative to the}} Earth (where an angle of 90° would be viewed directly from the side). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk. A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise <b>distances</b> <b>and</b> radial velocities are required.|$|E

5|$|These {{can occur}} in sea breezes or in desert regions. In a sea-breeze front, cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a {{boundary}} between two masses of air like a shallow cold front. Glider pilots can gain altitude by flying along the intersection {{as if it were}} a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable <b>distances</b> <b>and</b> so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.|$|E
5|$|Until this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} a {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Some supported the idea that GRBs occur within the Milky Way, but are visibly faint {{because they are not}} highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological <b>distances</b> <b>and</b> are extremely energetic. Although the possibility of multiple types of GRBs meant that the two theories were not mutually exclusive, the distance measurement unequivocally placed the source of the GRB outside the Milky Way, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|A droving dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are {{understood}} {{to have been}} of the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly referred to as}} Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short <b>distances</b> <b>and</b> for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E

5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long <b>distances</b> <b>and</b> sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed.|$|E
5|$|A slow-moving {{predator}} feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the sicklefin lemon shark seldom travels long <b>distances</b> <b>and</b> many individuals {{can be found}} year-round at certain locations. Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, with females giving birth {{to no more than}} 13 pups every other year, following a gestation period of 1011 months. Although they are potentially dangerous to humans and known to respond vigorously to any provocation, under normal circumstances, sicklefin lemon sharks are cautious and tend to retreat if approached. The IUCN has assessed this species as Vulnerable; its low reproductive productivity and rate of movement limits the capacity of depleted stocks to recover. Off India and Southeast Asia, this species has been severely depleted or extirpated by unregulated exploitation for its meat, fins, and liver oil.|$|E
