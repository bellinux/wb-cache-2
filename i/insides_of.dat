5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with the soft tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers {{would be able to}} {{challenge}} the eleven-year old track record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the kerbs, forcing the drivers {{to stay away from the}} <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> the corners. Pirelli chose the soft and medium compounds for the event.|$|E
5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on the <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> their elbows. This is spread across {{their bodies and}} those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up and drop from the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E

Facial features include black markings on the muzzle and behind the ears. A black stripe marks the outer surface of each leg. Females have four teats far back on the abdomen. The hair feels coarse, more {{like that of a}} deer than the glossy hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E

5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to playing the game, Adams {{was involved in}} the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for the <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create the balls. As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats, choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes on the face. The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the <b>insides</b> <b>of</b> the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E

40|$|Yassa Island is {{situated}} in the Nakama River natural conservation region. Road was constructed to the island in 1964. Since the construction, water has been exchanged between outside and <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the road through three culverts buried under of road. Mangrove death is spread in the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> creek. Reasons of death of mangrove should be clarified. For the first step, tidal and water level, water temperature and chemical composition of water were measured in outside and <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the creek. The following results are obtained: 1) The variation of water level between ebb and flow in <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the creek is small relative to that in outside. 2) In <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the creek, when inflow is larger than outflow, mangrove plants are submerged during a long time. However, when outflow is larger than inflow, they are dried during a long time. 3) The periods when mangrove plants are submerged or dried were calculated. 4) The variation of Cl^- concentration is less in <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the creek than in outside of the creek. 5) Saturation degree of DO and pH are low, and concentration of H_ 2 S is high in <b>inside</b> water <b>of</b> the creek compared with in outside water. 6) Water volume and depth at low tide were calculated in <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> the creek...|$|R
