Reynolds said, [...] "I've known about 'Green Lantern' my whole life, but I've never really followed it before. I {{fell in love with the}} character when I met with Martin Campbell". Reynolds called the film [...] "an origin story to a certain degree, but it's not a labored origin story, where the movie begins in the third act. The movie starts when it starts. We find out Hal <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> fairly early on, and the adventure begins". Alternatively Chris Pine and Sam Worthington had been in discussions for the role. Bradley Cooper, Jared Leto and Justin Timberlake were other top contenders, while Brian Austin Green, a Green Lantern fan, campaigned for the part, but ultimately did not audition.|$|E

500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I {{think that was a}} curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E
500|$|Pérez {{moved up}} to the double-AA New Haven Ravens where he batted [...]253 and {{improved}} his fielding percentage to [...]967 and was considered the Rockies' top prospect at shortstop. The Rockies promoted Pérez to triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox {{at the end of}} the 1995 season with the intention of bringing him up to the major leagues the next year. In fact, although Pérez was invited to 1996 spring training, he spent most of year with the Sky Sox and was not called up until the end of August, making his major league debut on August 31. In his season with the Sky Sox, his batting average had improved to [...]316. Commented Rockies manager Don Baylor: [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who had the year that traditionally earns a call up. I want to see what he can do." [...] Pérez hit [...]156 over 17 games and returned to the Sky Sox for the beginning of the 1997 season.|$|E
500|$|Jon Favreau {{said it was}} {{originally}} his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, [...] "I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> {{you want to see}} fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it." [...] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin [...] "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.|$|E

Bermuda's wife Leslie is in there too. Plus there’s my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my electrician, a couple from my church, the owner of my favorite ice cream shop, my aunt's boyfriend… I think we got maybe 2 or 3 people from the casting office, but the overwhelming majority were friends and family members that just wanted to come to the shoot.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to the Master Chief as a {{character}} is mixed. Some reviewers see the character's silent nature as a strength; others have said that this quality leaves him insufficiently developed and not believable. UGO ranked the Master Chief at number eight on its 2007 list of top heroes of all time", ahead of fellow video game characters Samus Aran, Link, and Gordon Freeman. In 2009, GameDaily listed the [...] "strong and silent type" [...] among top 25 video game archetypes, using Master Chief as an example. Master Chief was also ranked number eight in Empires list of the greatest video game characters. In 2009, GamesRadar included him among the 25 best new characters of the decade. UGO listed Master Chief's [...] "trademark" [...] helmet in its 2011 list of the coolest helmets and headgear in video games. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the eight [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "Chief isn't the strongest or most crafty hero, and he isn't particularly charismatic or intelligent or playful. But when civilization {{is on the line}} and all other options have been exhausted, Chief <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who's going to get you through."

500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E

500|$|Darryl {{thinks his}} {{popularity}} {{with the staff}} will make him a shoo-in, so he thinks {{he does not have}} to do an interview like everyone else. He is caught off-guard when he actually must do an interview and they ask for his resume. Darryl writes up an overly extensive four-page resume, which Jo quickly derides, though Jim encourages Darryl by saying that the interview and resume are mere formalities for him. When Andy interviews for the manager position, Gabe hijacks the meeting in an attempt to sabotage him by asking random trivia questions, which Andy successfully parries, but Gabe ends up screaming at him and acting like a lunatic. Gabe is also dismissive of Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) during her interview, saying she is not a [...] "real candidate". Kelly exacts revenge by telling Jo about Gabe's relationship with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and his harassing behavior after their breakup. In response, Jo sends Gabe back to Sabre's Florida headquarters, and installs Kelly in Gabe's position on the search committee. Kelly then says she has accepted Dwight's bribery and looks forward to the benefits of his return to the manager's chair, as Toby haltingly says they could give Dwight another trial run and Jim looks on in horror. After Phyllis tells Jim that Kelly and Dwight have pre-fired her, Jim tells Dwight he is not and will not be the manager, and the office begins arguing about who will be selected. When the discussion gets out of control, with Ryan (B. J. Novak) preferring a homeless man, Andy declaring he wants the job, and Darryl's daughter Jada asking out loud if Jim <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> making him manager, Jim cuts it short and brings the committee back to the conference room to make up their minds.|$|E

2500|$|On September 10, 2003, during warm-ups in Chicago {{during a}} tight pennant race, Newman {{took a turn}} in the batter's box during warm-ups to take some fun hits.

His wife Deborah and Twins general manager Terry Ryan remained at the hospital with him throughout the stay where he remained unconscious until September 26. During that time, Gardenhire struggled to keep his team focused while all dealt with their feelings for Newman. Minnesota Twins center fielder Torii Hunter said of Newman, [...] "For me, I think it hurt me more than anybody to see him go down like that, because this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> who pretty much taught me the game, and how to play the game hard." [...] While Newman was away from the team, his jersey, number 62, was hung in the dugout for each game as a salute. On October 4, 2003, after being released from the hospital, Newman threw out the first pitch prior to Game 3 of the Twins American League Divisional Series versus the New York Yankees. Gardenhire waved Newman's jersey to fans and was visibly emotional to have him back on the field with him after his long hospital stay.|$|E
