25|$|In {{addition}} to the restricted stock studies, U.S. publicly traded companies are able to sell stock to offshore investors (SEC Regulation S, enacted in 1990) without registering the shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The offshore buyers may resell these shares in the United States, still without having to register the shares, after holding them for just 40 days. Typically, these shares are sold for 20% to 30% below the publicly traded share price. Some of these transactions have been reported with discounts of more than 30%, resulting {{from the lack of}} marketability.

25|$|Railtrack was {{severely}} criticised for both its performance {{in improving the}} railway infrastructure and for its safety record. Between its creation and late 1998, the company had a relatively calm relationship with its first economic regulator, John Swift QC, whose strategy was to encourage Railtrack to make commitments to improvement. But critics said that the regulator was not tough enough and that the company had, as a result, been able to abuse its monopoly position. In particular, its customers, the passenger and freight train operators, were desperate for regulatory action to force the company to improve its stewardship of the network and its performance. Swift had been appointed rail regulator in 1993 by the then Conservative transport secretary John MacGregor MP. When the Labour government took over after the general election in May 1997, the new transport secretary (and deputy prime minister) John Prescott took a much harder line. When Swift's five-year term of office expired on 30 November 1998, he was not reappointed. After an interim <b>holding</b> <b>period,</b> during which Chris Bolt, Swift's chief economic adviser and effective deputy, filled the regulator's position, in July 1999 a new rail regulator began a five-year term, and a new, much tougher regulatory era began.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical papers {{link the}} {{liquidity}} premium to the optimal trading decisions of investors facing transaction costs. In particular, investors'holding periods determine how transaction costs are amortized and priced in asset returns. Using a unique data set containing two million trades, this paper investigates {{the relationship between}} <b>holding</b> <b>periods</b> and transaction costs for 66, 000 households from a large discount brokerage. The author finds that transaction costs are an important determinant of investors'holding periods, after controlling for household and stock characteristics. The relationship between <b>holding</b> <b>periods</b> and transaction costs is stronger among more sophisticated investors. Households with longer <b>holding</b> <b>periods</b> earn significantly higher returns after amortized transaction costs, and households that have <b>holding</b> <b>periods</b> that are positively related to transaction costs earn both higher gross and net returns.

The largest companies that fit our criteria (for a maximum of 49 companies) for {{every year for the}} past twenty years (based on market cap and CGER) will be examined.

The strain rate was 10 3 s 1 and the strain amplitudes were 0. 4 and 1. 0. The alloy showed asymmetrical cyclic stress response behaviour. In the first few load cycles the alloy showed a cyclic hardening in tensile region and a cyclic softening in compression region. Both the stress amplitudes stabilised, however, after several load cycles. Based on the analysis of relaxation behaviour of the alloy during hold time the stress response behaviour observed in this study could be understood qualitatively.
