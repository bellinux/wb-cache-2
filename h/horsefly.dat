The larva of the Australian <b>horsefly</b> (Scaptia muscula) lives in antlion (for example Myrmeleon pictifrons) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (Lasiochalcidia igiliensis) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax.|$|E

Murphy, familiar with the <b>Horsefly</b> FACs of World War II, asked General Earle E. Partridge for five pilots to fly reconnaissance. On 9 July 1950, Lieutenants James A. Bryant and Frank G. Mitchell flew the first airborne FAC missions of the Korean War from K-5 Taejon Air Base. They flew into K-5 with two Stinson L-5 Sentinels modified with needed VHF radios—which promptly became inoperable. Borrowing two 24th Division L-17 Navions, the lieutenants contacted surprised fighter pilots and directed about 10 flights of F-80s in air strikes.|$|E

Further, attractiveness increases with stripe width, so the relatively narrow stripes of the three living species of zebras should be unattractive to <b>horseflies.</b>|$|R

500|$|Unlike {{the other}} {{described}} Myrmeciites species, M.(?) tabanifluviensis {{is the only}} species not from the McAbee Fossil Beds. The holotype, currently deposited in the Courtenay and District Museum paleontology collections as 2003.2.10 CDM 034 was recovered from shale of an unnamed formation outcropping {{near the town of}} <b>Horsefly,</b> British Columbia. The specimen is incomplete with both the head and portions of the mesosoma and gaster missing. The adult had an estimated length in life of over [...] The right portions of the legs are well preserved while the left legs are missing with two [...] spurs, one of which is long and the other is short and narrow. Due to the incomplete nature of the specimen and position of the preserved portions, the gender is not identifiable, though the presence of wings indicates it to be a reproductive adult. The small size of the specimen, with a fore-wing length of approximately , separates this species from other members of the British Columbia Myrmeciinae. The type locality for the species, near the <b>Horsefly</b> River, was the basis for Archibald, Cover and Moreau choosing the specific epithet tabanifluviensis, combined with the <b>horsefly</b> genus name Tabanus, the Latin word ﬂuvius meaning [...] "river" [...] and the sufix -ensis meaning [...] "origin" [...] or [...] "place". The justification of placing this ant in Myrmeciites is due to incomplete preservation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Horseflies</b> (Tabanidae) are polarotactic, being {{attracted}} to linearly polarized light when searching for water or host animals. Although {{it is well}} known that <b>horseflies</b> prefer sunlit dark and strongly polarizing hosts, the reason for this preference is unknown. According to our hypothesis, <b>horseflies</b> use their polarization sensitivity to look for targets with higher degrees of polarization in their optical environment, which as a result facilitates detection of sunlit dark host animals. In this work, we tested this hypothesis. Using imaging polarimetry, we measured the reflection–polarization patterns of a dark host model and a living black cow under various illumination conditions and with different vegetation backgrounds. We focused on the intensity and degree of polarization of light originating from dark patches of vegetation and the dark model/cow. We compared the chances of successful host selection based on either intensity or degree of polarization of the target and the combination of these two parameters. We show that the use of polarization information considerably increases the effectiveness of visual detection of dark host animals even in front of sunny–shady–patchy vegetation. Differentiation between a weakly polarizing, shady (dark) vegetation region and a sunlit, highly polarizing dark host animal increases the efficiency of host search by <b>horseflies...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{prevalence}} study of Leishmania spp. in hematophagous insects captured {{from the environment}} in bat roosts and pigeon nests, or feeding their hosts (cattle, pigs, horses, dogs and humans) in urban, peri-urban and rural areas, between 2012 and 2014. For this study, the amastigotes present in these insects were detected by histochemical and PCR techniques. Positive gene amplification for Leishmania was found in two <b>horseflies</b> of the species Tabanus importunus collected in the environment, and amastigote forms of Leishmania spp., as well as erythrocytes and leukocytes, were histochemically detected in one of that insect. The other analyzed insects were not positive by PCR our by direct parasitological examination. Only <b>horseflies</b> captured in urban and peri-urban areas were positive. During the collection, no phlebotomine sand flies were captured in rural areas far from the city limits. It can be concluded that the discovery of <b>horseflies</b> positive for Leishmania spp. in urban and peri-urban areas indicates the likelihood that urban areas and their surroundings provide vector parasites with an environment suitable for the spread and consequent perpetuation of the biological cycle of this protozoan...|$|R
