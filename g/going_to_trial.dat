Turner, head antitrust regulator for the United States Department of Justice, expressed doubts related to such issues as the emerging cable television market, and concerns over the journalistic integrity of ABC and {{how it could be}} influenced by the overseas ownership of ITT. ITT management promised that the company would allow ABC to retain autonomy in the publishing business. The merger was suspended, and a complaint was filed by the Department of Justice in July 1967, with ITT <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> in October 1967; the merger was officially canceled after the trial's conclusion on January 1, 1968.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the first}} day of trial, Cooper's bizarre {{behavior}} (such as fleeing from his defense attorney, refusing to change his prison clothes because regular clothes [...] "burned" [...] him, and talking to himself while in the fetal position) induced the court to conduct a further competency hearing. This time the trial judge observed Cooper and heard testimony from people including lay witnesses, defendant Cooper, and a third psychologist who concluded that Cooper was incompetent. While expressing his uncertainty and not disagreeing with the psychologist, the judge ruled against Cooper and ordered the <b>trial</b> <b>to</b> proceed, finally opining: I think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take smarter people than me to make a decision here.

25|$|Several {{cases have}} been brought before the {{national}} courts against bloggers concerning issues of defamation or liability. U.S. payouts related to blogging totaled $17.4 million by 2009; in some cases these have been covered by umbrella insurance. The courts have returned with mixed verdicts. Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in general, are immune from liability for information that originates with third parties (U.S. Communications Decency Act and the EU Directive 2000/31/EC). In Doe v. Cahill, the Delaware Supreme Court held that stringent standards had to be met to unmask the anonymous bloggers, and also took {{the unusual step of}} dismissing the libel case itself (as unfounded under American libel law) rather than referring it back to the trial court for reconsideration. In a bizarre twist, the Cahills were able to obtain the identity of John Doe, {{who turned out to be}} the person they suspected: the town's mayor, Councilman Cahill's political rival. The Cahills amended their original complaint, and the mayor settled the case rather than <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E

500|$|Robert Barton, {{president}} of Parker Brothers, bought {{the rights to}} Finance from Knapp Electric later in 1935. Finance would be redeveloped, updated, and continued to be sold by Parker Brothers into the 1970s. Other board games based on a similar principle, such as a game called Inflation, designed by Rudy Copeland and published by the Thomas Sales Co., in Fort Worth, Texas, also {{came to the attention}} of Parker Brothers management in the 1930s, after they began sales of Monopoly. Copeland continued sales of the latter game after Parker Brothers attempted a patent lawsuit against him. Parker Brothers held the Magie and Darrow patents, but settled with Copeland rather than <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial,</b> since Copeland was prepared to have witnesses testify that they had played Monopoly before Darrow's [...] "invention" [...] of the game. The court settlement allowed Copeland to license Parker Brothers' patents. Other agreements were reached on Big Business by Transogram, and Easy Money by Milton Bradley, based on Daniel Layman's Finance. Another clone, called Fortune, was sold by Parker Brothers, and became combined with Finance in some editions.|$|E
500|$|Jose Sarria {{fought against}} police harassment, both of gays and of gay bars. Raids on gay bars were routine, with {{everyone}} inside the raided bar {{taken into custody}} and charged with such crimes as being [...] "inmates in a disorderly house". Although the charges were routinely dropped, the arrested patrons' names, addresses and workplaces were printed in the newspapers. When charges were not dropped, the arrested men usually quietly pleaded guilty. Sarria encouraged men to plead not guilty and demand a jury trial. Following Sarria's advice, more and more gay men began demanding jury trials, so many that court dockets were overloaded and judges began expecting that prosecutors have actual evidence against the accused before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> One favored harassment technique, employed especially on Halloween after midnight, was to arrest drag queens under an old city ordinance that made it illegal {{for a man to}} dress in women's clothing with an [...] "intent to deceive". In consultation with attorney Melvin Belli, Sarria countered this tactic by distributing labels to his fellow drag queens (hand-made, {{in the shape of a}} black cat's head) that read [...] "I am a boy". If confronted, the queen would simply display the tag to prove that there was no intent to deceive. Sarria's actions helped bring an end to Halloween police raids. Along with Guy Strait, Sarria formed the League for Civil Education (LCE) in 1960 or 1961. The LCE ran educational programs on the topic of homosexuality and provided support for men being ostracized for being gay and for those caught in police raids.|$|E

2500|$|The prosecutor, San Francisco District Attorney Matthew Brady, an {{intensely}} ambitious man {{who planned to}} run for governor, made public pronouncements of Arbuckle's guilt and pressured witnesses to make false statements.

In view of Delmont's constantly changing story, her testimony would have ended any chance of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> Ultimately, the judge {{found no evidence of}} rape. After hearing testimony from one of the party guests, Zey Prevon, that Rappe told her [...] "Roscoe hurt me" [...] on her deathbed, the judge decided that Arbuckle could be charged with first-degree murder. Brady had originally planned to seek the death penalty. The charge was later reduced to manslaughter.|$|E

To do so, four legal elements must be proven: (1) a professional duty owed to the patient; (2) breach of such duty; (3) injury caused by the breach; and (4) resulting damages.
