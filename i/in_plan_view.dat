25|$|Ion etching by argon gas {{has been}} {{recently}} {{shown to be}} able to file down MTJ stack structures to a specific layer which has then been atomically resolved. The TEM images taken <b>in</b> <b>plan</b> <b>view</b> rather than cross-section reveal that the MgO layer within MTJs contains a large number of grain boundaries that may be diminishing the properties of devices.|$|E
25|$|The King George whiting is {{the only}} member of the genus Sillaginodes and is further {{distinguished}} from any other possible taxa assigned to that genus by a number of distinct anatomical features. It is the largest of the Sillaginid fishes with 129 to 147 lateral line scales, and like all fishes in the family is best distinguished by the shape of its swim bladder. <b>In</b> <b>plan</b> <b>view,</b> the swim bladder has a land slug-like appearance, with a posteriorly tapering extension and two anterolateral extensions or ‘horns’. There are no duct-like processes on the ventral surface unlike taxa in the genus Sillago.|$|E
25|$|Two prototypes of the Mü17 Merle {{were built}} with {{emphasis}} on simple construction, straightforward handling and easy rigging and de-rigging, using automatic connections for the aileron and airbrake controls. The plywood- and fabric-covered wooden wings are trapezoidal <b>in</b> <b>plan</b> <b>view</b> with swept leading edges and straight trailing edges, ailerons over the outer half of the trailing edges and spoilers mid-chord at approx half span. Adhering to the 'Schüle München' the fuselage is a welded steel-tube space-frame with fabric covering and wooden tail surfaces, also covered in plywood and fabric. Despite failing in the Olympic selection the Mü17 Merle was put into production with around 60 units built before and after World War II, many with variations such as retractable landing gear.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{observation}} of doped patterns in semiconductor, usually on cleavedsections through multilayers but recently also <b>in</b> <b>plan</b> <b>views</b> of patterneddoping of a technological layer, is acquiring high interest {{because of its}} straightforward application in the semiconductor technology. Plenty of experimental data has been collected [1 - 4] from conventional SEM observation and recently first results showed improved contrasts attainable with specimen immersed into electric field. Main features are the sign of contrast- the p-type regions are always brighter than the n-type ones, and the contrast grows toward lower energies...|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>plan</b> <b>view,</b> the twin-mainfloats, {{like those}} of the Short N.2B, were square-fronted with a slight {{increase}} in beam from front to rear, while the stern tapered to a point like a mitred arch. They had a concave bottom (the edges were protected by metal strips) and a sharp step at approximately 3/4 length; a tailfloat was fitted to the fuselage below the conventional tailplane. Attached {{to the rear of the}} tailfloat was a taxying rudder, with an additional drop-plate which improved steering on water, and which, thanks to the hinged mounting at the forward end, would rise up into its recess in the tailfloat on contact with the ground when beaching. Wingtip floats were deemed unnecessary. A detail drawing, which appeared in Flight Magazine in 1920, showed the empennage and tailfloat assembly, including the hinged rudder drop-plate.|$|E
500|$|Zvi Hecker {{architecture}} {{has continued}} to emphasize geometry and modularity, but with increasing asymmetry. Ramot Polin (1972–75) is a rare prefabricated apartment complex with 720 non-rectangular components. The apartments were expanded later, incorporating more cubic rather than pentagonal components. The design idea of this neighborhood {{may seem to be}} the more purely geometrical, however it is likened to a chemical structure, and <b>in</b> <b>plan</b> <b>view</b> to an open hand, and a leaf- therefore imparting it with metaphorical qualities. More examples of advanced geometry in Hecker's work are the Spiral Apartment House in Ramat Gan, (1981–1989), and the Heinz-Galinski-Schule (1992–1995) in Berlin, noted for their high degree of complexity. The Heinz-Galinski-Schule won Zvi Hecker the Deutscher Kritikerpreis in 1995- it was stated that the decision of the jury was based on their appreciation of the [...] "expressive geometry of his construction." [...] The Spiral Apartment House is located adjacent to his earlier Dubiner house, providing a juxtaposition of two important moments in his career. The work of Zvi Hecker has been compared to that of Antonio Gaudi, for expressiveness and expanding of architectural ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Initially the Brikken had a Farman style forward {{elevator}} {{but this}} was soon removed. The pilot sat exposed on or slightly ahead of the wing leading edge on a simple frame; the Gnome Omega seven cylinder rotary engine was mounted behind him at the trailing edge in pusher configuration, driving a two blade propeller. Its fuel tank was suspended under mid-chord. [...] Behind the engine the fuselage consisted of two frames, with long parallel members vertically cross braced, arranged to converge <b>in</b> <b>plan</b> <b>view</b> to the tail. A large oval rudder was mounted on the final, common vertical with a tailplane above it.|$|E

[...] Externally, it appears as a large white marquee with twelve 100m-high yellow support towers, one for each month of the year, or each hour of the clock face, {{representing}} the role played by Greenwich Mean Time. [...] <b>In</b> <b>plan</b> <b>view</b> it is circular, 365m (one metre for each day in a standard year) in diameter. [...] It has become one of the United Kingdom's most recognisable landmarks. [...] It can easily be seen on aerial photographs of London. [...] Its exterior is reminiscent of the Dome of Discovery built for the Festival of Britain in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935 Mervyn Chadwick and Raymond Gordon {{had come}} {{together}} to develop the then popular Flying Flea or other low powered aircraft suited to a predicted market in low cost, single seat flying. The appearance in England of the single seat Tipsy S in the following summer suggested that a low winged cantilever monoplane might be more popular and safer, so {{they set out to}} produce an aircraft along the same lines. [...] This became the Gordon Dove, built by Chadwick and Gordon's Premier Aircraft Constructions Ltd, formed in November 1936. [...] Though some commentators have described this as [...] "plagiarism" [...] from the Tipsy, it was significantly different from its inspiration and easily distinguished when seen in the air, <b>in</b> <b>plan</b> <b>view.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Gabardini {{monoplane}} {{was designed}} with a steel tube structure, which was unusual. [...] Its shoulder mounted monoplane wings were built around two tubular steel spars, with wooden ribs and canvas covering. <b>In</b> <b>plan</b> <b>view</b> the low aspect ratio wings were barely straight, tapered to generously rounded tips. [...] Roll control was by wing warping, with conventional control column input. [...] The wings were wire-braced to the fuselage from above {{as well as}} from below. [...] The three upper wires on each side, one from the front spar and two from the rear at about mid-span, ran {{to the top of a}} three-legged pylon over the cockpit. [...] The lower wires were attached to the frame that also carried the landing wheels and skids.|$|E

5000|$|The radar {{operator}}'s {{station was}} at the aft end of the gondola. The radar operator controlled the SRC-720 radar set and viewed its display scopes from the isolated rear compartment, which he entered {{by way of a}} small hatch with a built-in ladder {{on the underside of the}} aircraft. In addition to the radar systems themselves, the radar operator had intercom and radio controls, as well as the controls and sight for the remote turret. The compartment's canopy followed the curvature of the gondola's rear section, with only a single rounded step to the forward canopy's double step. The rear of the gondola was enclosed by a blown Plexiglas cap that tapered quickly <b>in</b> overhead <b>plan</b> <b>view</b> to a barely rounded point; the shape was somewhat taller in side profile than it was <b>in</b> overhead <b>plan</b> <b>view,</b> giving the end of the [...] "cone" [...] a rounded [...] "blade" [...] appearance when viewed in perspective.|$|R

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was flat-sided, {{built up}} around four longerons which {{were made of}} spruce at the rear and ash forward of the cockpit. [...] Behind the cockpit, the fuselage narrowed <b>in</b> <b>plan</b> <b>view</b> in a gently curved way to the tail, but less usually Comper made the fuselage reduce in depth also; whilst the upper longeron was horizontal with the aircraft in flying position, the lower one was angled upwards. [...] The fin and rudder formed an approximate quadrant, though the unbalanced rudder extended down between the elevators to the fuselage bottom. [...] The nearly rectangular tailplane was mounted on the upper longeron. A standard curved decking, built up with stringers over frames topped the fuselage from front to rear. Forward of the cockpit the lower longerons curved strongly upwards and inwards, meeting the now inward curving upper members at the engine bulkhead, on which was mounted the 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub I flat-twin driving a two-bladed small diameter propeller. The single axle undercarriage was mounted {{on a pair of}} short V-shaped legs, each V cut out of plywood and mounted vertically on the lower longerons, so that the track was about 4ft (1.22 m). The CLA.2 sat close to the ground, with its wheels only slightly ahead of and below the wing leading edge.|$|E
