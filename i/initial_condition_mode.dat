These conditions are motivated by minimisation of the renormalised stress-energy tensor, and are valid for setting a vacuum state even in a context where the spacetime is changing rapidly. Moreover, these alternative conditions are potentially observationally distinguishable. We apply this to the kinetically dominated universe, and compare with the more traditional approach.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of a short-distance cutoff, the choice of a vacuum state in an inflating, non-de Sitter universe is unavoidably ambiguous. The ambiguity is related to the time at which <b>initial</b> <b>conditions</b> for the <b>mode</b> functions are specified and to the way {{the expansion of the universe}} affects those <b>initial</b> <b>conditions.</b> In this paper we study the imprint of these uncertainties on the predictions of inflation. We parametrize the most general set of possible vacuum <b>initial</b> <b>conditions</b> by two phenomenological variables. We find that the generated power spectrum receives oscillatory corrections whose amplitude is proportional to the Hubble parameter over the cutoff scale. In order to further constrain the phenomenological parameters that characterize the vacuum definition, we study gravitational particle production during different cosmological epochs.

Considering different values of the parameters α, β and m, we derive several new inflationary solutions in which one fields just evolves {{in the background and}} is not important for the inflationary dynamics. In addition, we find new solutions where both fields are dynamically important during inflation. Moreover, we discuss the {{evolution of}} perturbations in both scalar fields and the spacetime metric, concentrating on the production of entropy perturbations.

40|$|Long-term {{transient}} simulations {{are carried}} out in an <b>initial</b> <b>condition</b> ensemble <b>mode</b> using a global coupled climate model which includes comprehensive ocean and stratosphere components. This model, which is run for the years 1860 - 2100, allows {{the investigation of the}} troposphere-stratosphere interactions and the importance of representing the middle atmosphere in climate-change simulations. The model simulates the present-day climate (1961 - 2000) realistically in the troposphere, stratosphere and ocean. The enhanced stratospheric resolution leads to the simulation of sudden stratospheric warmings; however, their frequency is underestimated by a factor of 2 with respect to observations. In projections of the future climate using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on emissions scenarios A 2, an increased tropospheric wave forcing counteracts the radiative cooling in the middle atmosphere caused by the enhanced greenhouse gas concentration. This leads to a more dynamically active, warmer stratosphere compared with present-day simulations, and to the doubling of the number of stratospheric warmings. The associated changes in the mean zonal wind patterns lead to a southward displacement of the Northern Hemisphere storm track in the climate-change signal...|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} vacuum state for a quantum scalar field {{propagating}} in a de Sitter spacetime (massive and arbitrarily coupled to the gravitational field) is discussed. The problem of finite-time <b>initial</b> <b>conditions</b> for the <b>mode</b> functions is analyzed, {{as well as}} how these determine the vacuum state of the quantum system. The principle guiding the choice of vacuum state is the following: one wants the vacuum contribution to the energy-momentum tensor to contain all the ultraviolet divergent terms, so that the particle creation terms are finite, and covariantly conserved. There is a suitable set of modes (instantaneous adiabatic basis) in which this splitting of the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor can be carried out. Numerical results are presented for different finite-time <b>initial</b> <b>conditions</b> (m = 0. 6, {zeta} = 1 / 6).

40|$|We study {{corrections}} to {{the power}} spectra of curvature and tensor perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio in single field slow roll inflation due to <b>initial</b> <b>conditions</b> imprinted by a fast-roll stage prior to slow roll. For {{a wide range of}} initial inflaton kinetic energy, this stage lasts only a few e-folds and merges smoothly with slow-roll leading to non-Bunch-Davies <b>initial</b> <b>conditions</b> for <b>modes</b> that exit the Hubble radius during slow roll. We describe a program that yields the dynamics in the fast-roll stage while matching to the slow roll stage independent of the inflationary potentials. Corrections {{to the power}} spectra are encoded in a transfer function T_α(k). We obtain T_α(k) to leading order in a Born approximation valid for modes of observational relevance today. A fit yields T_α(k) = 1 + A_αk^-pcos[2 πω k/H_sr+φ_α], with 1. 5 ≲ p ≲ 2, ω≃ 1 and H_sr the Hubble scale during slow roll inflation, where curvature and tensor perturbations feature the same p,ω {{for a wide range of}} <b>initial</b> <b>conditions.</b> These corrections lead to both a suppression of the quadrupole and oscillatory features in both P_R(k) and r(k_ 0) with a period of the order of the Hubble scale during slow roll inflation. The results are independent of the specific inflationary potentials, depending solely on the ratio of kinetic to potential energy κ and the slow roll parameters to leading order. For a wide range of κ and the values of ϵ_V;η_V corresponding to the upper bounds from Planck, we find that the low quadrupole is consistent with the results from Planck, and the oscillations in r(k_ 0) could be observable if the modes corresponding to the quadrupole and the pivot scale crossed the Hubble radius a few e-folds after the onset of slow roll.

40|$|Massive bigravity, a {{theoretically}} consistent {{modification of}} general relativity with an additional dynamical rank two tensor, successfully describes the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe without a cosmological constant. Recent analyses of perturbations around a cosmological background have revealed power law instabilities in both scalar and tensor perturbations, motivating {{an analysis of the}} <b>initial</b> <b>conditions,</b> evolution, and cosmological observables to determine the viability of these theories. In this paper we focus on the tensor sector, and study a primordial stochastic gravitational wave background in massive bigravity. The phenomenology can differ from standard General Relativity due to non-trivial mixing between the two linearized tensor fluctuations in the theory, only one of which couples to matter. We study perturbations about two classes of cosmological solutions in bigravity, computing the tensor contribution to the temperature anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and the present stochastic gravitational wave background. The result is strongly dependent on the choice of cosmological background and <b>initial</b> <b>conditions.</b> One class of background solution generically displaying tremendous growth in the amplitude of large-wavelength gravitational waves, while the other remains observationally indistinguishable from standard General Relativity {{for a wide variety of}} <b>initial</b> <b>conditions.</b> We analyze the <b>initial</b> <b>conditions</b> for tensor <b>modes</b> expected in an inflationary cosmology, finding again that there is a strong dependence on the assumed background.

40|$|In Hořava and Einstein-Æther {{theories}} of modified gravity, {{in spite of}} the violation of Lorentz invariance, spherically-symmetric stationary black hole solutions possess an inner universal horizon which separates field configurations into two disconnected classes. We compute the late time radiation emitted by a dispersive field propagating in such backgrounds. We fix the <b>initial</b> <b>conditions</b> on stationary <b>modes</b> by considering a regular collapsing geometry, and imposing that the state inside the infalling shell is vacuum. We find that the mode pasting across the shell is adiabatic at late time (large inside frequencies).

In turn, this suggests that the universal horizon should play no role in the thermodynamical properties of these black holes.

Our discussion includes the post-inflationary universe i. e. radiation-dust mixture era. For this purpose, we first extract an explicit equation describing evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation in the FLRW universe with arbitrary spatial sectional curvature. We may percept when K≠ 0, curvature scale would be as significant as the perturbations scales to recognize {{the behavior of the}} spectral indices. We also focus on the entropy perturbation in order to extract behavior of the isocurvature spectral index in terms of the curvature index and time. Our analysis shows that spectra of curvature and entropy perturbations in sub-horizon scales could be function of topology. Moreover, an accurate analysis makes clear that time-average of isocurvature index in case K= 0 is about zero,so that imprint of entropy perturbation in time duration may be negligible.

We show that these two approaches [...] as currently implemented [...] lead to radically different expectations for the trans-Planckian corrections to the CMB and emphasize that in the BEFT formalism we expect the perturbation spectrum {{to be dominated by}} quantum gravity corrections for all scales shorter than some critical value. Conversely, in the NPH case the quantum effects only dominate the longest modes that are typically much larger than the present horizon size. Furthermore, the onset of the breakdown in the standard inflationary perturbation calculation predicted by the BEFT formalism is likely to be associated with a feature in the perturbation spectrum, and we discuss the observational signatures of this feature in both CMB and large scale structure observations. Finally, we discuss possible modifications to both calculational frameworks that would resolve the contradictions identified here.
