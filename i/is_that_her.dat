All that is known of his mother <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> maiden name was Sinclair and that she died when John Knox was a child. Their eldest son, William, carried on his father's business, which helped in Knox's international communications.|$|E
5|$|Many {{legends and}} fantastic stories about Anne Boleyn have survived over the centuries. One {{is that she}} was {{secretly}} buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors. Her body was said to have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk. Another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> heart, at her request, was buried in Erwarton (Arwarton) Church, Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s she was {{attending}} art {{classes at the}} Art Students League of New York, and in 1941 she had her first solo exhibition. A student of Hans Hofmann and Chaim Gross, Nevelson experimented with early conceptual art using found objects, and dabbled in painting and printing before dedicating her lifework to sculpture. Usually created out of wood, her sculptures appear puzzle-like, with multiple intricately cut pieces placed into wall sculptures or independently standing pieces, often 3-D. A unique feature of her work <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> figures are often painted in monochromatic black or white. A figure in the international art scene, Nevelson was showcased at the 31st Venice Biennale. Her work is seen in major collections in museums and corporations. Nevelson {{remains one of the}} most important figures in 20th-century American sculpture.|$|E

25|$|As Jennifer is {{introduced}} on February 9, 1976, the role was originated by child actress Maren Stephenson until August 8, 1977. For storyline purposes, the role is briefly {{taken over by}} Jennifer Peterson from December 1, 1977 to July 4, 1979, until the character was written out of the show upon completion. A main reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> mother, Laura Horton, had been shipped off to a psychiatric facility {{and would not be}} able to care for her. Laura's exit was prompted by the fact that her portrayer, Rosemary Forsyth, wanted to leave the show to pursue other things.|$|E
25|$|The volume {{contains}} five {{poems and}} six short stories, {{all on the}} theme of Christianity. Some of the poems can be taken as comments or epilogues on the short stories (e.g. Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh refers to the gifts in the stable which The Naughty Donkey in the preceding story attempts to eat). Although relatively unknown, this work, when referred to at all, is often stated as being for children; however the stories it contains are firmly aimed at an adult audience and with adult themes, especially for 1965. For instance, in the story The Water Bus, Mrs Hargreaves's cleaner tries to offload her woes to her employer, the main one of which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> daughter is dying in hospital after an illegal abortion went wrong.|$|E

25|$|Scholars differ {{about why}} Dowager Queen Elizabeth {{spent the last}} five years of her life living at Bermondsey Abbey, to which she retired on 12 February 1487. Among her modern biographers, David Baldwin {{believes}} that Henry VII forced her retreat from the Court, while Arlene Okerlund presents evidence from July 1486 that she was already planning her retirement from court to live a religious, contemplative life at Bermondsey Abbey. Another suggestion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> retreat to Bermondsey was forced on her because she was in some way involved in the 1487 Yorkist rebellion of Lambert Simnel, or at least was seen as a potential ally of the rebels, a curious role for her to take if she was convinced that both her sons had died in 1483.|$|E
25|$|Terra was {{originally}} designed by Yoshitaka Amano, who drew concept art of her. Tetsuya Nomura, {{one of the}} game's graphic directors, redesigned her in chibi form for her representation in the game. Some of the differences <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> ingame appearance has green hair, {{as opposed to the}} original blonde. In a 2006 interview, Amano stated that Terra was his favorite character to design in the video game industry. The development team intended for the game to have an ensemble cast, with no unique protagonist; however, since {{the first half of the}} game revolves heavily around Terra, the team decided to have the second half start with another character, Celes Chere. Another reason for this shift is that the team wanted Terra's story arc to progress in a new direction after the first half.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{contribution}} Ralya {{has made}} to the Bahá'í Faith in fiction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> works center on the moral dilemmas of modern society {{in the west and}} spiritual insights and development that reflect an understanding of the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith in response to these challenges. On the one hand she has envisioned an attainable utopia (that is, not completely perfect) with specifics based on suggestions made in writings of the Bahá'í Faith. A particularly strong analysis is made of marital fidelity vs the divine law against adultery vs intense love and friendship {{between a man and a}} woman not married, though many topics are addressed including the moral and practical need for war, sustainable economics if children and mothers are of central importance to society, attitudes of the oneness of humanity vs racism, the importance of the arts and so on. On the other hand, she has examined many of the same issues in young ladies lives in high school.|$|E

500|$|Hermesianax {{wrote of}} [...] "Philitas, singing of nimble Bittis", and Ovid twice calls her [...] "Battis". It is {{commonly}} thought that Bittis or Battis was Philitas' mistress, and that Hermesianax referred to love poetry; another possibility <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> name connoted [...] "chatterbox", {{and that she}} was a humorous personification of Philitas' passion for words.|$|E
500|$|The mosque {{acquired}} {{its current}} name, al-Azhar, sometime between the caliphate of al-Mu’izz {{and the end}} of the reign of the second Fatimid caliph in Egypt, al-Aziz Billah. Azhar is the masculine form for zahrā′, meaning [...] "splendid" [...] or [...] "most resplendent." [...] Zahrā′ is an epithet applied to Muhammad's daughter Fatimah, wife of caliph Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib. She was claimed as the ancestress of al-Mu’izz and the imams of the Fatimid dynasty; one theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> epithet is the source for the name al-Azhar. The theory, however, is not confirmed in any Arabic source and its plausibility has been both supported and denied by later Western sources.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{is one of}} {{the most}} celebrated American actresses, but she has also been criticized for a lack of versatility. Her {{on-screen}} persona closely matched her own real personality, something Hepburn admitted herself. In 1991 she told a journalist, [...] "I think I'm always the same. I had a very definite personality and I liked material that showed that personality." [...] Playwright and author David Macaray has said, [...] "Picture Katharine Hepburn in every movie she ever starred in and ask yourself if she's not playing, essentially, the same part over and over... Icon or no icon, let's not confuse a truly fascinating and unique woman with a superior actress." [...] Another repeated criticism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> demeanor was too cold.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew a girl," [...] I said, [...] "or, rather, a young married woman, who was {{cured of}} folly by the homoeopathic method. <b>Her</b> great trouble <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> husband {{had ceased to}} be her lover." ...|$|R
50|$|Historian {{of biology}} David Rudge has also {{carefully}} reexamined the records upon which Hooper's argument is based.

500|$|One {{of the key}} {{differences}} between Wollstonecraft's novels and her philosophical treatises, as feminist critic Cora Kaplan has argued, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> fiction celebrates female emotion and argues for its value while her treatises present emotion as [...] "reactionary and regressive, almost counter-revolutionary". Johnson has extended this argument and contends that Wollstonecraft is interested in presenting the benefits of romantic friendship over marriage: [...] "whereas Wollstonecraft shrinks from homosocial 'familiarity' and advocates the ennobling properties of domestic heterosexuality in Rights of Woman, her novels not only resist the heterosexual plot, but displace it with protolesbian narratives wrested from sentimentality itself." [...] While many critics have argued that Mary [...] "capitulates to" [...] or [...] "matures into" [...] both sentimentality and heterosexuality, Johnson's interpretation has become the standard.|$|E
500|$|One {{of the key}} {{differences}} between Wollstonecraft's novels and her philosophical treatises, as feminist critic Cora Kaplan has argued, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> fiction values female emotion while her treatises present it as [...] "reactionary and regressive, almost counter-revolutionary". The Rights of Woman [...] portrays sexuality as a masculine characteristic, and while Wollstonecraft argues that some masculine characteristics are universal, this {{is not one of}} them. In The Wrongs of Woman, however, she accepts, relishes, and uses the sexualized female body as a medium of communication: Maria embraces her lust for Darnford and establishes a relationship with him. While in the Rights of Woman she had emphasized companioniate relationships, arguing that passions should cool between lovers, in The Wrongs of Woman, she celebrates those passions. Challenging contemporary moralists such as John Gregory and Rousseau, Wollstonecraft claimed that women could be fully sexualized beings.|$|E
500|$|Dixon, a {{songwriter}} and singer, often writes or co-writes her own records. Discussing {{the writing process}} of The Alesha Show she said, [...] "I've written the majority of it and I co-write as well {{with a lot of}} people". Critics have suggested some of her songs are autobiographical, such as [...] "To Love Again" [...] (2009), co-written with Gary Barlow and John Shanks. Vocally, reviewer Andy Gill of The Independent suggested that Dixon's vocal strengths lie with more up-tempo songs, saying [...] "the problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> bubbly personality (and voice) is simply not as well suited to ballads as to perky dancefloor anthems". However, The Guardians Caroline Sullivan complemented her live vocals whilst reviewing her tour, The Alesha Show. She said, of her concert tour, that [...] "it was her singing that made the impression: she's more powerful than you would imagine, and when pitted against her band at their most blaring, she more than held her own. While this was going on, she was being flung between two male hoofers, proving, if nothing else, that pop stars who claim they can't dance and sing simultaneously just aren't trying".|$|E

500|$|The Everglades: River of Grass {{galvanized}} {{people to}} protect the Everglades and is compared to Rachel Carson's 1962 exposé of {{the harmful effects of}} DDT, Silent Spring, as both books are [...] "groundbreaking calls to action that made citizens and politicians take notice". Its impact is still relevant as it is claimed to be a major reason Florida receives so many tourists, and [...] "remains the definitive reference on the plight of the Florida Everglades". It has gone through numerous editions, selling 500,000copies since its original publication. The Christian Science Monitor wrote of it in 1997, [...] "Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature, it also reads like a blueprint for what conservationists are hailing as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world". The downside to the book's impact, according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> metaphor is so prevailingly dominant that it is inaccurate in describing the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades: [...] "River of Grass" [...] describes one. David McCally wrote that despite Douglas' [...] "appreciation of the complexity of the environmental system" [...] she described, popular conception of the Everglades shared by people who have not read the book overshadows her detailed explanations.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Jack {{returns from}} {{a weekend in}} Paris with Phoebe, his new fiancée, and insists that Liz should get to know Phoebe better. He tells her to take Phoebe and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) on a girls' day out. As their day {{progresses}} Liz senses Phoebe is not who she claims to be. Liz's suspicions are confirmed when she covertly follows Phoebe to a restaurant and spies her holding hands with an older gentleman. This is alarming for two reasons: first, Phoebe is already engaged to Jack, and secondly, she has previously claimed to be afflicted by [...] "Avian Bone Syndrome," [...] a result of which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> purportedly brittle bones {{would not be able}} to stand such intense physical contact. Even though Liz tries to remain inconspicuous at the restaurant, Phoebe notices her. Knowing that Liz is on to her deceptions, Phoebe confronts Liz, who is not interested in Phoebe's excuses and tells her that she has a choice: tell Jack about her cheating or Liz will do so herself. Phoebe becomes angry and then shocks Liz when she drops her British accent. Liz tries to tell Jack about her suspicions, but he is immediately offended by her seemingly unfounded and slanderous comments about his fiancée, which puts a heavy strain on their working relationship.|$|E
