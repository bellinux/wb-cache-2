This study is motivated by <b>dip</b> <b>coating</b> at very low capillary numbers when the deposited film thickness is less than 1 µm and such interaction forces become important. The objective of this work is to demonstrate that in {{the presence of a}}n extra body force the solution procedure differs significantly from the classical one and leads to substantial deviations from the Landau-Levich law for the entrained film thickness. In particular, attractive potentials produce film thickening and the resulting film thickness is independent of speed to lowest order. Repulsive potentials bring about more complicated behavior and lead either to films whose thickness is also independent of speed, or to a modification of the leading order constant in the classical Ca^(2 / 3) law.

Aniline monomer was polymerised to PAn emeraldine salt (ES) in the presence of poly (butyl acrylate-co-vinyl acetate) and the processable blend was developed by redissolving 1 - 2 w/w% of the resulting sensing polymer residue in dichloromethane (DCM). Some of this residue was washed in ammonia solution to de-dope the PAn to emeraldine base (EB) to act as a protective layer {{on the surface of the}} sensing polymer. This residue was then washed with distilled water until a neutral pH was realised with the waste water, dried and redissolved in DCM at 1 - 2 w/w% to create a processable blend barrier polymer solution. The final sensor design utilised 125 μm polyester insulated platinum wire as conducting electrodes that were <b>dip</b> <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> the PAn ES blend solution and dried in a desiccator.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of a biodegradable polymer coated stent loaded with tempamine on in-stent neointimal formation. METHODS: Stainless steel stents were <b>dip</b> <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> biodegradable elastomeric poly (ester-amide) (co-PEA) or in polymer solution mixed with 50 % (wt%) and 100 % (wt%) tempamine. One group 100 % (wt%) tempamine loaded stents were further <b>dip</b> <b>coated</b> <b>in</b> co-PEA polymer to form a top layer. Stainless steel bare, polymer-only, and different doses tempanine coated stents were implanted into porcine coronary arteries with a stent to artery ratio 1. 2 : 1. Histomorphometric analysis was performed at 5 days and 6 weeks respectively. RESULTS: Histomorphometric analysis showed that the bare, polymer-only and tempamine-coated stents elicited a similar tissue response at 5 days. At 6 weeks, the peri-strut inflammation and neointimal hyperplasia of polymer-only stents were comparable to the bare stents. Compared to the bare stents, 50 % tempanine coated stents had a trend to decrease the arterial injury (0. 62 +/- 0. 41 versus 0. 34 +/- 0. 18, P = 0. 075) and neointimal hyperplasia (1. 80 +/- 0. 77 versus 1. 27 +/- 0. 39 mm 2, P = 0. 085). However, 100 % tempanine coated showed significantly increased inflammatory response and neointimal formation. CONCLUSION: These co-PEA polymer coatings showed a biocompatible performance. Loaded with 50 % tempamine had a trend to decrease neointimal hyperplasia. The 100 % tempamine for stent-based delivery may have potential cytotoxic effects to arterial wall. Using a co-PEA polymer topcoat could effectively abolish these side effects. status: publishe...|$|R

In vitro investigations demonstrate that nanotopography can be used to control cell reactions to a material surface, indicating its potential application in tissue engineering and implant fabrication. Developments in the catalyst, optical, medical and electronics industries have resulted in the production of nanopatterned surfaces using a variety of methods. The general protocols for nanomanufacturing require high resolution and low cost for fabricating devices. With respect to biological investigations, nanotopographies should occur across a large surface area (ensuring repeatability of experiments and patterning of implant surfaces), be reproducible (allowing for consistency in experiments), and preferably, accessible (limiting the requirement for specialist equipment). Colloidal lithography techniques fit these criteria, where nanoparticles can be utilized in combination with a functionalized substrate to produce in-plane nanotopographies.
