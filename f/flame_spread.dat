60|$|It {{was just}} then {{that his son}} Titus, having taken all the strongholds in Galilee, though they were desperately defended by the Jews, had {{advanced}} to besiege Jerusalem. All the Christians had heeded the warning that our blessed Lord had left them, and were safe at a city in the hills called Pella; but the Jews who were left within were fiercely quarrelling among themselves, and fought with one another as savagely as they fought with the enemy. Titus threw trenches round and blockaded the city; and the famine within grew to be most horrible. Some died in their houses, but the fierce lawless zealots rushed {{up and down the}} streets, breaking into the houses where they thought food was to be found. When they smelt roasting in one grand dwelling belonging to a lady, they rushed in and asked for the meat, but even they turned away in horror when she uncovered the remains of her own little child, whom she had been eating. At last the Roman engines broke down the walls of the lower city, and with desperate struggling the Romans entered, and found every house full of dead women and children. Still they had the Temple to take, and the Jews had gathered there, fancying that, at the worst, the Messiah would appear and save them. Alas! they had rejected Him long ago, and this was the time of judgment.

And yet this wonderful nation has lived on in its dispersion ever since. The city was utterly overthrown and sown with salt, and such treasures as could be saved from the fire were carried in the triumph of Titus--namely, the shew-bread table, the seven-branched candlestick, and the silver trumpets--and laid up as usual among the spoils dedicated to Jupiter.

40|$|Burst {{oscillations}} {{during the}} rising phases of thermonuclear X-ray bursts are usually believed to originate from <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> on the neutron star surface. However, the decrease of fractional oscillation amplitude with rise time, {{which provides a}} main observational support for the <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> model, have so far been reported from only a few bursts. Moreover, the non-detection and intermittent detections of rise oscillations from many bursts are not yet understood considering the <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> scenario. Here, we report the decreasing trend of fractional oscillation amplitude from an extensive analysis of a large sample of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Proportional Counter Array bursts from ten neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. This trend is 99. 99 % significant for the best case, which provides, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, by far the strongest evidence of such trend. Moreover, it is important to note that an opposite trend is not found from any of the bursts. The concave shape of the fractional amplitude profiles for all the bursts suggests latitude-dependent flame speeds, possibly due to the effects of the Coriolis force. We also systematically study the roles of low fractional amplitude and low count rate for non-detection and intermittent detections of rise oscillations, and attempt to understand them within the <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> scenario. Our results support a weak turbulent viscosity for <b>flame</b> <b>spreading,</b> and imply that burst rise oscillations originate from an expanding hot spot, thus making these oscillations a more reliable tool to constrain the neutron star equations of state.

It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. An understanding of the ignition transient of a solid propellant rocket motor becomes increasingly more important as larger and more sophisticated solid propellant rocket motors are developed. Cost considerations alone require the minimal use of empirical methods in rocket development. Consideration of structural strength limitations, possible critical trajectory guidance and vehicle attitude control requirements, and the problem of ignition shock to sensitive instrumentation require that the ignition transient response be known and used as a basis for design. The ignition transient includes the entire time from initiation of the ignition signal to the attainment of design operating conditions within the rocket motor. The ignition transient can be separated into three intervals: the ignition lag interval - the delay between the initial ignition signal and the igniting of the first propellant element; the <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> interval - the time required for the propellant surface to become wholly ignited following first ignition; and the chamber filling interval - the time from completion of <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> to the attainment of design operating conditions. This research is the logical extension of the modified ignition transient prediction theory of Summerfield, Parker, and Most to small solid propellant rocket motors with practical configurations. The object was to design, develop, and test-fire small rocket motors with practical configurations using a realistic igniter and to compare the experimental results with computer predicted ignition transients. Two case bonded motors were developed, one with a circular port and the other with a star shape port. A combined total of 57 circular and star shape motors were tested using various exit nozzle areas and propellant grain lengths of 3. 5, 7. 625, and 9. 5 inches. A large discrepancy was found between the predicted and experimental results in the <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> interval, with a smaller difference occurring in the chamber filling interval. Three possible reasons are considered for the slow pressure rise; back <b>flame</b> <b>spreading,</b> back chamber filling, and cooling-off of the igniter gas as it flows along the motor length. Based on diagnostic firing runs, it was determined that back <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> did not occur and that back chamber filling was only a minor contributor to the slow pressure rise. Cooling-off of the igniter gas is considered the major probable cause for the slow pressure increase. Completion of <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> was determined to take place after 50 % of the equilibrium chamber pressure was reached. This indicates a need to assign equal importance to the <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> and chamber filling intervals when considering ways to control the ignition transient. The ignition prediction theory of Summerfield, Parker, and Most appears to be fundamentally correct. The results of this research indicate a need for refinement in the theory, particularly in the <b>flame</b> <b>spreading</b> interval in order to better predict the performance of rocket motors of practical configuration.
