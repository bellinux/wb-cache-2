40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a part of}} an ongoing study on <b>incorporating</b> <b>the</b> Multiple Intelligence into learning materials for children. This study believes that <b>incorporating</b> <b>the</b> Multiple Intelligence theory into learning materials is able to add more values towards the usability aspects of learning materials. In accordance, this paper aims at describing an attempt in designing a learning material that <b>incorporates</b> <b>the</b> Multiple Intelligence. In particular, the aims of the paper are (1) to suggest on how the elements of Multiple Intelligence could be incorporated into learning materials and (2) to outline the design and development of a sample of learning material that <b>incorporates</b> <b>the</b> Multiple Intelligence. User-centered design (UCD) approach is used as part of the methods in the design process, which involves three stages: (1) requirement gathering, (2) prototype development, and (3) user testing. This study involves children and teachers at kindergartens. As the results, an initial design of the learning material that <b>incorporates</b> <b>the</b> Multiple Intelligence is obtained and discussed in this paper at length...|$|R

The legions of the late Republic remained, unlike the legions of the later Empire, predominantly Roman in origin, although some small number of ex-auxiliary troops were probably <b>incorporated.</b> <b>The</b> army's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy.|$|E
