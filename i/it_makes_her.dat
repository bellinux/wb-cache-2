In the pilot, we made her look much more teacher-y. Now we're having more fun with her character, keeping her bright and unusual. Quirky is the word. Emma’s also always in stacked Mary Janes or T-strap heels. It takes the outfit down from being too stylish or too sexy. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> look prim and almost old-fashioned." ...|$|E

Over four months after her shout-out at the Tonys, Hall announced on her Twitter {{that she would be}} a guest star in the show's fifth season, and soon appeared in the episode [...] "The Mane Attraction" [...] as Coloratura/Rara. Upon the episode's premiere, Hall live streamed her reaction to the episode with her niece on Periscope and letting viewers ask questions during the commercial breaks, she went into detail about her experiences behind the scenes of the production of the episode and her history with the show itself, admitting to binge-watching the first three seasons of the show when she first started to watch it.|$|E

500|$|The film {{features}} analogue sound-effects exclusively throughout. The lead sound-designer Per Sundström explained: [...] "The key to good {{sound effects}} {{is working with}} natural and real sounds.(...) These analogue sounds can be digitally reworked as much as necessary, but the origin has to be natural". Sundström designed the soundscape to come {{as close to the}} actors as possible, with audible heartbeats, breathing, and swallowing. Late in production it was also decided to overdub actress Lina Leandersson's voice with a less feminine one, to underline the backstory. [...] "She's 200 years old, not twelve. We needed that incongruity. Besides, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> menacing", Sundström said. Both men and women up to the age of forty auditioned for the role. After a vote, the film team ended up selecting Elif Ceylan, who provides all of Eli's spoken dialogue. Footage of Ceylan eating melon or sausage was combined with various animal noises to emulate the sound of Eli biting into her victims and drinking their blood. The sound crew won a Guldbagge Award for Best Achievement from the Swedish Film Institute, for the [...] "nightmarishly great sound" [...] in the film.|$|E
500|$|Variety Brian Lowry {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review. He opined that the Lynette storyline looked [...] "extremely promising" [...] {{and enjoyed the}} addition of Joely Fisher to the cast as Lynette's [...] "tight-assed new boss." [...] He identified the Bree storyline as [...] "the real water-cooler sequence" [...] and complimented Marcia Cross' performance. However, Lowry criticized the Gabrielle and Susan storylines, opining that they are [...] "exhibiting signs of wear and tear." [...] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly noted that the episode had [...] "a particularly sleepy opening 20 minutes" [...] while its exciting plot points all occurred {{in the second half}} of the episode. He praised the scene in which Bree changes the tie on Rex's corpse and called Cross' performance throughout the episode [...] "pitch-perfect." [...] Slezak also complimented Huffman's performance, but wondered if Fisher was [...] "a steely enough an actress to go Manolo-a-Manolo with Huffman every week." [...] Though he criticized the repetitive nature of the Susan and Gabrielle storylines, Slezak thought that the Applewhite mystery would help reduce the show's chances of falling into a sophomore slump. He praised Woodward's acting as well as her character's storyline, opining, [...] "there's something so inherently warm and maternal in Woodard's performance, such apple-pie wholesomeness, that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> touches of menace all the more chilling." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Olivia {{has been described}} as [...] "an incredibly driven, incredibly brilliant agent with her own complicated past that will be peel back over time." [...] She is a loner and dedicates almost all of her time to her work. She has a strong sense of justice, which drives her to solve a case by any means necessary. It is this quality which both impresses and irritates Broyles, as <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> a good agent but also makes her prone to biting off more than she can chew when it comes to pursuing suspects. Olivia had an abusive stepfather, and shot him several times in defense of her mother and herself. She was unable to finish him off, and so he recovered and disappeared, leaving her to blame herself for not exacting retribution against him, contributing to her determination to bring criminals to justice. She was nine years old when she shot her stepfather, and she states in an earlier episode that she knew {{what she wanted to do}} for a career [...] "pretty much since [...] was nine", indicating a direct link between the childhood abuse and her job.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the final}} {{portion of the}} film, the Beatles and Preston are shown giving an unannounced concert from the studio rooftop. They perform [...] "Get Back," [...] "Don't Let Me Down," [...] "I've Got a Feeling," [...] "One After 909," [...] and [...] "Dig a Pony," [...] intercut with {{reactions}} and comments from surprised Londoners gathering on the streets below. The police eventually {{make their way to}} the roof and try to bring the show to a close, as the show was disrupting businesses' lunch hour nearby. This prompts some ad-libbed lyrical asides from McCartney: during the second performance of 'Get Back,' he sings, [...] "Get back, Loretta... you've been out too long, Loretta... you've been playing on the roofs again... and your mummy doesn't like that... <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> angry... she's gonna have you arrested! Get back, Loretta!". In response to the applause from the people on the rooftop after the final song, McCartney says, [...] "Thanks Mo!"

2500|$|Wood-Davis viewed Kim and Grace as an [...] "odd pairing {{and very}} unexpected" [...] who bonded over their shared love of Esther. Grace is scared at the {{prospect}} of permanent imprisonment and feels vulnerable. She opens up to Kim about her deteriorating relationship with Trevor because she is someone familiar. But Kim uses {{this as an opportunity to}} seduce Grace who responds positively and the pair have sex. The development lead writers to play the Kim character even crazier over Grace, thinking she and Grace will be together upon their release from prison. Wood-Davis said Kim thinks [...] "she's found a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow." [...] Wall told Sally Brockway from Soaplife Grace does not realise [...] "how insane Kim is". Their tryst makes Grace feel powerful and she does not have feelings for Kim. Wall added that Grace knows Kim is attracted to her and <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> feel good while in prison and have a [...] "power-trip". The story had potential to ruin Grace's life and she worries that Esther will not give the baby up. Grace realises that Kim has more power over Esther. She fakes feelings of love for Kim and manipulates her into ensuring Esther is committed to the surrogacy deal. Wall branded Grace's scheme a [...] "dangerous game" [...] because she knows that Kim is [...] "pretty much insane". But noted that Grace has dealt with worse people in her past, [...] "far freakier, weirder people than Kim." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was created as {{the sister of}} established character, Brooke Freeman (Beth Allen) due to Blampied's and Allen's physical similarity. Bree first appeared on the show when Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva) mistook her for his girlfriend – Brooke. Although Bree tried {{to get on with}} Brooke, the feelings were not mutual and Brooke struggled to accept her sister. Whilst the two characters were getting to know each other, so too were their actresses; Blampied and Beth Allen and the two shared a dressing room. Blampied herself was an only child, but found working alongside Allen reassuring, [...] "I was kind of getting to know Beth in an almost sisterly way at the same time Bree and Brooke were getting to know each other. So it's kind of worked for me." [...] After Vinnie left Brooke for her behaviour towards Bree, he and Bree started an affair, creating a love triangle between the sisters. Bree revealed to Vinnie that her qualifications as a surgeon were dodgy and alerted Brooke. However instead of deepening the rival between the two, it only forced the two closer together. Blampied explained the situation stating; [...] "Instead of throwing Bree under a bus, Brooke decides she quite likes that Bree has a big secret, because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>her</b> more human – or more like she is ... Brooke decides she is going to take Bree under her wing and help her out of the mess. In many ways Bree becomes Brooke's little protege. I think they've both had the chance to let their guard down with one another. Now that Brooke has seen Bree at her lowest – desperate and vulnerable – it has endeared her to Brooke." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the series {{suffered}} a sophomore slump and that the second season {{failed to live up}} to the first. Henry Goldblatt of Entertainment Weekly gave the new season a [...] "B", blaming the deteriorating quality on the fact that it [...] "morphed into four series," [...] with [...] "the actresses wandering through their separate scenes." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today suggested that the series' weakness was due to Marc Cherry leaving the episodic screenwriting to other writing staff members. Variety Brian Lowry gave the season premiere a positive review, opining that the Lynette storyline looked [...] "extremely promising" [...] and enjoyed the addition of Joely Fisher to the cast as Lynette's [...] "tight-assed new boss." [...] He identified the Bree storyline as [...] "the real water-cooler sequence" [...] and complimented Marcia Cross' performance. However, Lowry criticized the Gabrielle and Susan storylines, opining that they are [...] "exhibiting signs of wear and tear."

[...] Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC complimented that Applewhite storyline, writing: [...] "Forget Lynette's career stress, Gabrielle's baby daddy drama, and even Bree's new widowhood: This story has legs, and apparently arms." [...] She found it strange that the Bree, Andrew, and Danielle characters showed little emotion in regards to Rex's death. Additionally, she noted that the Lynette and Gabrielle storylines provided comic relief while Susan, a character [...] "so often saddled with the comic relief of the show, had a sad and serious premiere." [...] Sarah Gilbert of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, stating the episode delivered [...] "lots of juicy resolution, several power suits, and, you guessed it, lots of tears and shouting." [...] Aaron Wallace of Ultimate Disney notes Susan's decreasing importance throughout the season, pointing out Bree, who [...] "comfortably moves into position as the show's lead". Also in response to Susan's storyline, many critics saw the character suffer as a result of the declining quality of the second season. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that the writers were making her look [...] "too stupid".|$|E
