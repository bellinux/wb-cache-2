50|$|Data from 2012 {{showed that}} the {{percentage}} of households of Vučitrn that could not afford basic goods and services was lower than <b>Kosovo's</b> average. Whereas 20% of all Kosovan residents could not afford a meal with meat once per week, the same was true of 15% of Vučitrn residents; 30% compared to <b>Kosovo's</b> average of 42% could not afford to pay for public utilities; 24% compared to <b>Kosovo's</b> average of 34% were unable to cover the expenses of treating flu or any other minor illness; 37% compared to <b>Kosovo's</b> average of 49% could not afford to buy new clothes and footwear whenever necessary; 67% compared to <b>Kosovo’s</b> average of 71% could not afford to go to a restaurant once a month; and 74% compared to <b>Kosovo's</b> average of 76% could not afford to pay for a week's holiday away from home once a year.

5|$|The {{flag of the}} Republic of <b>Kosovo</b> {{was adopted}} by the Assembly of <b>Kosovo</b> {{immediately}} following the declaration of independence of <b>Kosovo</b> from Serbia on 17 February 2008. The flag is the result of an international design competition, organised by the United Nations-backed <b>Kosovo</b> Unity Team, which attracted almost one thousand entries. The now-used design was proposed by by Muhamer Ibrahimi. It shows six white stars in an arc above a golden map of <b>Kosovo</b> on a blue field. The stars symbolise Kosovo's six major ethnic groups.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly before <b>Kosovo's</b> {{declaration}} of independence, the European Union approved deployment of a non-military 2,000-member Rule of Law mission, [...] "EULEX," [...] to develop further <b>Kosovo's</b> police and justice sector. All twenty-seven {{members of the}} EU approved the EULEX mandate, including the minority of EU countries that have still not recognised <b>Kosovo's</b> independence.

Daniel Silander outlines {{the background to}} the elections and gives an overview {{of some of the}} factors which underpinned the violence. He argues that the on-going indecision over the territory’s legal status has had a damaging effect on <b>Kosovo’s</b> development. This has undermined attempts to strengthen <b>Kosovo’s</b> political system and economy, ensuring that the territory’s population remains deeply divided...|$|R
5|$|Until 2008, <b>Kosovo</b> did {{not have}} a flag of its own. However, during {{different}} periods of history, different flags were flown in <b>Kosovo.</b> Before 1969, the only flags that could legally fly over <b>Kosovo</b> (then an autonomous province) were those of SFR Yugoslavia and SR Serbia. If a nationalist flag were flown, such as Albanian, Serbian or Croatian, a person could go to prison for doing it.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Italy {{transformed}} the Albanian Kingdom into Greater Albania, a protectorate of Italy that included most of <b>Kosovo</b> and {{a portion of}} western Macedonia which was detached from Yugoslavia after the Axis powers invaded in 1941. <b>Kosovo</b> Albanians enthusiastically welcomed the Italian occupation. Although officially under Italian rule, the Albanians in <b>Kosovo</b> controlled the region and were encouraged to open Albanian schools, which had been prohibited under Yugoslav rule. They were also given Albanian citizenship by Italian authorities and allowed to fly the Albanian flag. Nevertheless, the Italians kept {{hundreds of thousands of}} troops in Albania and surrounding areas. Yugoslav sources indicated that there were approximately 20,000 Italian soldiers and 5,000 Italian police and frontier guards in <b>Kosovo,</b> and 12,000 soldiers and 5,000 police and border guards in the Albanian-annexed portion of Macedonia. At the same time, Italian military authorities warned that at least ten hostages would be shot for every Italian soldier killed or wounded in these regions.|$|E

5|$|For the 500 Jews {{who lived}} in Albanian-dominated <b>Kosovo,</b> the {{experience}} was starkly different and many did not survive the war. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, German forces occupied Albania, <b>Kosovo</b> and other territories that had been annexed to the country. In 1944, an Albanian Waffen-SS division was formed, which arrested and {{handed over to the}} Germans a further 281 Jews from <b>Kosovo</b> who were subsequently deported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where many were killed. In late 1944, the Germans were driven out of Albania-proper and the country became a communist state under the leadership of Enver Hoxha. Around the same time, Axis forces in the Albanian-annexed regions of <b>Kosovo</b> and western Macedonia were defeated by the Yugoslav Partisans, who subsequently reincorporated these areas into the newly established Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|From 1991 to 1992, Jashari {{and about}} 100 other ethnic Albanians wishing {{to fight for}} the {{independence}} of <b>Kosovo</b> underwent military training in the municipality of Labinot-Mal in Albania. Afterwards, Jashari and other ethnic Albanians committed several acts of sabotage aimed at the Serbian administrative apparatus in <b>Kosovo.</b> Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Hamëz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of <b>Kosovo</b> Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village.|$|E

The resolution reaffirms calls for [...] "substantial autonomy and meaningful self-administration for Kosovo".|$|R

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, a number of senior U.S. {{intelligence}} officials met {{with the leaders of}} the KLA, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents arrived in northern Albania to monitor the fighting in <b>Kosovo</b> and assist in training rebel fighters. In exchange for American military, financial and intelligence support, KLA leaders promised not to carry out any actions outside <b>Kosovo,</b> not to continue participating in the drug trade, and not to accept help from Islamic radicals. Thus, the KLA ordered the 36 foreign Islamist fighters (or mujahideen) fighting in their ranks to leave <b>Kosovo.</b> Though few <b>Kosovo</b> Albanians sympathized with the Islamists, some argued that the KLA should have accepted assistance from any source, fundamentalist or otherwise. When KLA commanders ordered the mujahideen to leave, they refused, and disagreements arose within the KLA ranks as what was to be done with them.|$|E

5|$|<b>Kosovo</b> Albanians were {{generally}} less hospitable to Jews {{than their counterparts}} in Albania. Due to their historical experiences with Serbs and the Ottoman Empire, they tended to be more unfriendly towards local non-Albanians. Many enthusiastically supported the Germans as a result. Claims have been made that <b>Kosovo</b> Albanians protected Jews after German forces took over territories that Italian authorities had controlled during the war, but the protection that Jews received in <b>Kosovo</b> {{in the early years of}} the war was due more to the Italian authorities than to the local Albanian population. It is estimated that 210 Jews from <b>Kosovo</b> perished during the war. An official Yugoslav state report published in 1964 recorded 74 Jewish wartime fatalities in the region. Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Albania, <b>Kosovo</b> and other Albanian-controlled territories during the war. A somewhat greater number, as well as several hundred refugees, hid and survived with the assistance of the local Albanian population.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1944, the {{division}} was disbanded. At the same time, Albanians in <b>Kosovo</b> took up arms against the Partisans {{when they learned}} that the region would not be unified with Albania after the war, despite earlier Partisan promises. Atrocities occurred when 30,000 Partisans were sent to <b>Kosovo</b> to quell Albanian resistance in the region. Between 3,000 and 25,000 <b>Kosovo</b> Albanians {{were killed in the}} ensuing violence.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of April 23, 1998 a band of <b>Kosovo</b> Liberation Army (KLA) fighters was ambushed by a much smaller group of Yugoslav Army (VJ) border guards near the Košare outpost, just west of Dečani. The fighters {{had been trying to}} smuggle weapons and {{supplies}} into <b>Kosovo</b> via northern Albania. Nineteen were killed in the ensuing attack, and a further two were captured. The VJ did not sustain any casualties. Some of the militants retreated back to Albania, while others managed to break through the ambush and make it past the Yugoslav border, into <b>Kosovo.</b> Following the clash, the VJ confiscated a large quantity of arms that the militants had been transporting.|$|E
