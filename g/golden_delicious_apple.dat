40|$|Background: Apple is {{the most}} {{consumed}} fruit in many {{countries of the world}} and has very important role in individual's diet and health. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the vitamin C (Ascorbic acid), organic acids (citric acid and malic acid), and phenolic compounds concentrations of apple cultivars grown in Khorramabad and Boroujerd cities. Materials and Methods: At this cross-sectional study, fruit samples were collected at the middle of 2008 (September). For this reason each tree calculated as trial unit and 5 apples were picked at the physiological puberty period. Phenolic compounds concentrations were measured by a new method using solid phase micro extraction of the upper atmosphere - supersonic (SPME GC / MS), Ascorbic acid concentrations were gained by 2, 6 -dichlorophenol-indophenol method, and organic acids concentrations were calculated by Titration method. Results: Ascorbic acid concentrations in Red and <b>Golden</b> <b>delicious</b> <b>apples</b> were 9. 49 and 9. 09 mg and 9. 29 mg in total per 100 grams. Malic acid concentrations in Red and <b>Golden</b> <b>delicious</b> <b>apples</b> were 0. 26 and 0. 27 and citric acid concentrations in Red and <b>Golden</b> <b>delicious</b> <b>apples</b> were 0. 28 mg per 100 grams in both cultivars. Acidity of Red delicious was 4 and <b>Golden</b> <b>delicious</b> was about 3. 7. The acidity of Red delicious was higher than the Golden one. α-farensene was the most phenolic compound in both cultivars. Conclusion: Finally, apple cultivars grown in Lorestan have 3 times more ascorbic acid than the amount which mentioned in Iranian Food Consumption Table.

40|$|The {{changes of}} main sugars and organic acids of Red <b>delicious</b> and <b>Golden</b> <b>delicious</b> <b>apples</b> from Semirom region in Isfahan Province were {{determined}} by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The apples were harvested, graded and packed in three kinds of wood, car-board and perforated polyethylene film packages and stored for eight months at 0 ± 0. 5 oC and 90 to 95 % relative humidity for further analysis. Sucarose, glucose and fructose, as well as citric and L-malic acids were detected and quantified in all packed samples.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the temperature {{dependence of the}} constants involved in a mathematical model relating the aerobic respiration rate of <b>Golden</b> <b>Delicious</b> <b>apples</b> to the P(O 2) of the surrounding atmosphere, O 2 consumption (r(O 2)) and CO 2 production (r(CO 2)) rates were measured at four temperatures (21, 16, 6 and 1 °C) and five partial pressures of O 2 (0, 3, 5, 10 and 21 kPa), while P(CO 2) was maintained close to zero. The cellular oxidation of the respiratory substrate was expressed {{as a function of}} dissolved O 2 by a Michaelis-Menten-like equation.

40|$|Objectives: Fruits and {{vegetables}} {{may be beneficial}} on lipid profile of hyperlipidemic subjects. The present study was aimed to verify the effect of <b>golden</b> <b>delicious</b> <b>apple</b> on Lipid Profile in hyperlipidemic and overweight men. Methods: Forty six hyperlipidemic and overweight men were randomly divided into two groups. Intervention group received 300 g <b>golden</b> <b>delicious</b> <b>apple</b> per day for 8 weeks. Control group had the regular dietary regimen {{for the same period}} of time. Blood samples were analyzed for serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), lipoprotein a (Lp a) and LDL/HDL ratio at baseline and after intervention. Results: Total polyphenols and fibers were 485 mg/kg and 4. 03 g/ 100 g in fresh apple respectively.

40|$|Problem statement: Bruise {{damage is}} {{a major cause of}} fruit quality loss.

40|$|Enzymatic {{browning}} is {{the main}} cause of quality loss in minimally processed fresh-cut apples and this study was aimed to control it by evaluating the use of a treatment with α-lipoic acid and ascorbic acid on <b>Golden</b> <b>Delicious</b> <b>apples.</b> Also hexanal, an effective natural enhancer of apple odor, was added to the treatment. At the end of the preservation period, colorimetric analysis demonstrated that α-lipoic acid exerts an anti-browning effect comparable with that of ascorbic acid about 60 times more concentrated and, moreover, chemical assays demonstrated its synergistic interaction with this substance. The application of the “anti-browning mix” does not substantially change the volatile profile of the apple slices while the addition of hexanal (0. 076 mmol per liter of air) improves it primarily with an increased production of hexyl acetate (about 86 % of the average aromatic component), without modifying the fruit respiration. Practical ApplicationsThe combined treatment has proved to be useful to preserve and improve <b>Golden</b> <b>Delicious</b> <b>apples</b> quality over the span of 8 days (1 day more than the average shelf life recommended by many producers for this kind of product). The presence of hexanal makes the treatment very interesting in the context of minimally processed fruit, where apples are used in an early stage of ripening that best tolerates the processing chain but that is characterized by a low volatile biosynthesis. Moreover, the presence of α-lipoic acid gives to the fruit the connotation of “nutraceutical food. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{computer}} vision-based algorithm for <b>golden</b> <b>delicious</b> <b>apple</b> grading is proposed which works in six steps. Non-apple pixels as background are firstly removed from input images. Then, stem end is detected by combination of morphological methods and Mahalanobis distant classifier. Calyx region is also detected by applying K-means clustering on the Cb component in YCbCr color space. After that, defects segmentation is achieved using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. In the next step, stem end and calyx regions {{are removed from}} defected regions to refine and improve apple grading process. Then, statistical, textural and geometric features from refined defected regions are extracted. Finally, for apple grading, a comparison between performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), MLP and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers is done. Classification is done in two manners which in the first one, an input apple is classified into two categories of healthy and defected. In the second manner, the input apple is classified into three categories of first rank, second rank and rejected ones. In both grading steps, SVM classifier works as the best one with recognition rate of 92. 5 % and 89. 2 % for two categories (healthy and defected) and three quality categories (first rank, second rank and rejected ones), among 120 different <b>golden</b> <b>delicious</b> <b>apple</b> images, respectively, considering K-folding with K= 5.
