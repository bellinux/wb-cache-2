5|$|Exactly who Ælfgar {{received}} {{aid from}} in the Irish Sea region is uncertain. It is conceivable that, after his flight from England in 1055, Ælfgar was outfitted in Dublin, then ruled by Murchad (with Diarmait as overlord). Likewise, since Diarmait's forces had previously driven Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, and apparently from Mann in 1061, the joint campaign of Ælfgar and Magnús in 1058which utilised Islesmen and Dublinerscould well have involved Diarmait's cooperation as well. That being said, {{there are several reasons}} to doubt a part played by Diarmait in Ælfgar's military undertakings. For instance, Diarmait seems to have lent assistance to Ælfgar's enemiesthe Godwinsonsin the 1050s and 1060s. Diarmait also appears to <b>have</b> <b>previously</b> backed Cynan ab Iago (fl. 1064), a man who was a bitter rival and seemingly the eventual slayer of Ælfgar's ally and son-in-law, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn.|$|E
