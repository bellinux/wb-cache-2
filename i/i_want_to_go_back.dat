2500|$|Mr. President, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to {{something}} Senator Kerry said earlier tonight and ask a follow-up of my own.

60|$|We call ours a {{utilitarian}} age, {{and we do}} {{not know}} the uses of any single thing. We have forgotten that water can cleanse, and fire purify, and that the Earth is mother to us all. As a consequence our art is of the moon and plays with shadows, while Greek art is of the sun and deals directly with things. I feel sure that in elemental forces there is purification, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to them and live in their presence.|$|E

60|$|On {{the back}} of this book {{is the name of the}} New Jerusalem and on the first page of it a phrase about the {{necessity}} of going back to the old even to find the new, as a man retraces his steps to a sign-post. The common sense of that process is indeed most mysteriously misunderstood. Any suggestion that progress has at any time taken the wrong turning is always answered by the argument that men idealise the past, and make a myth of the Age of Gold. If my progressive guide has led me into a morass or a man-trap by turning to the left by the red pillar-box, instead of to the right by the blue palings of the inn called the Rising Sun, my progressive guide always proceeds to soothe me by talking about the myth of an Age of Gold. He says I am idealising the right turning. He says the blue palings are not so blue as they are painted. He says they are only blue with distance. He assures me there are spots on the sun, even on the rising sun. Sometimes he tells me I am wrong in my fixed conviction that the blue was of solid sapphires, or the sun of solid gold. In short he assures me I am wrong in supposing that the right turning was right in every possible respect; as if I had ever supposed anything of the sort. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to that particular place, not because it was all my fancy paints it, or because it was the best place my fancy can paint; but because it was a many thousand times better place than the man-trap in which he and his like have landed me. But above all <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to it, not because I know it was the right place but because I think it was the right turning. And the right turning might possibly have led me to the right place; whereas the progressive guide has quite certainly led me to the wrong one.|$|E
