40|$|Three {{classes of}} IgG have been {{described}} <b>for</b> <b>camelids.</b> IgG 1 has a conventional four-chain structure, while IgG 2 and IgG 3 do not incorporate light chains. The structures and antigen-binding affinities of the so-called heavy-chain classes have been studied in detail; however, their regulation and effector functions are largely undefined. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the participation of conventional and heavy-chain IgG antibodies in the camelid immune defense directed against West Nile virus (WNV). We found that natural infection or vaccination with killed WNV induced IgG 1 and IgG 3. Vaccination also induced IgG 1 and IgG 3; IgG 2 was produced during the anamnestic response to vaccination. When purified IgGs were tested in plaque-reduction neutralization titer (PRNT) tests, IgG 3 demonstrated PRNT activities comparable to those of conventional IgG 1. In contrast, IgG 2 demonstrated only suboptimal activity at the highest concentrations tested. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that macrophages bound IgG 1, IgG 2, and IgG 3. Furthermore, subneutralizing concentrations of all three isotypes enhanced WNV infection of cultured macrophages. Our results document distinctions in regulation and function between camelid heavy-chain isotypes. The reduced size and distinct structure of IgG 3 did not negatively impact its capacity to neutralize virus. In contrast, IgG 2 appeared to be less efficient in neutralization. This information advances our understanding of these unusual antibodies in ways that can be applied in the development of effective vaccines <b>for</b> <b>camelids...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dystocia in the {{camelids}} is rare, {{however the}} exceptionally long {{neck and the}} fetal extremities predispose to flexion of these as a common cause of dystocia. A prolonged (< 2 hr) second stage of labor, bloody vaginal discharge or colic is the frequent sign of dystocia. The maternal causes of dystocia <b>for</b> <b>camelids</b> include uterine torsion, pelvic immaturity, uterine inertia and cervical dilation failure, whereas the fetal causes described are fetal malpostures and rarely fetal monsters like Schistosoma reflexus and Pero-somus elumbis or fetal dropsical conditions such as hydrocephalus. Dromedary camels must be restrained in a sternal recumbency for examination and vicious animals must be given xylazine (0. 25 - 2. 2 mg/Kg IM or IV). South American camelids may be restrained by using either xylazine or butarphanol (0. 5 - 0. 1 mg/Kg IM). Uterine torsion is much more common in llamas and alpacas whereas it is infrequent in the dromedary camel. The methods of dystocia correction by using mutations, fetotomy and cesarean section are described...|$|E

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} C (VEGF-C) {{is a key}} {{mediator}} of lymphangiogenesis, acting via its receptors VEGF-R 2 and VEGF-R 3. High expression of VEGF-C in tumors correlates with increased lymphatic vessel density, lymphatic vessel invasion, sentinel lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Recently, we found that in a chemically induced skin carcinoma model, increased VEGF-C drainage from the tumor enhanced lymphangiogenesis in the sentinel lymph node and facilitated metastatic spread of cancer cells via the lymphatics. Hence, interference with the VEGF-C/VEGF-R 3 axis holds promise to block metastatic spread, as recently shown by use of a neutralizing anti-VEGF-R 3 antibody and a soluble VEGF-R 3 (VEGF-C/D trap). By antibody phage-display, we have developed a human monoclonal antibody fragment (single-chain Fragment variable, scFv) that binds with high specificity and affinity to the fully processed mature form of human VEGF-C. The scFv binds to an epitope on VEGF-C that is important for receptor binding, since binding of the scFv to VEGF-C dose-dependently inhibits the binding of VEGF-C to VEGF-R 2 and VEGF-R 3 as shown by BIAcore and ELISA analyses. Interestingly, the variable heavy domain (V(H)) of the anti-VEGF-C scFv, which contains a mutation typical <b>for</b> <b>camelid</b> heavy chain-only antibodies, is sufficient for binding VEGF-C. This reduced {{the size of the}} potentially VEGF-C-blocking antibody fragment to only 14. 6 kDa. Anti-VEGF-C V(H) -based immunoproteins hold promise to block the lymphangiogenic activity of VEGF-C, which would present a significant advance in inhibiting lymphatic-based metastatic spread of certain cancer types...|$|R

The majority of respondents identified a general demographic of an intact male camelid raised by its biological mother with daily or weekly handing by humans. Aggressive behavior emerged at one to three years of age, and was directed more frequently at humans than at other animals. Treatment interventions included behavioral modification, castration, moving and/or isolating the animal. All treatments had a higher rate of failure than success.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the present status {{of the use of}} artificial insemination (AI) in South American camelids and wild equids is offered. Technical aspects of semen collection, dilution and cryopreservation have limited the development and use of AI in camelid and equid species. To-date, efficiency is low but progress has been made and viable offspring have been produced through the use of AI in domestic South American camelids using both fresh and frozen semen. The origin, composition, and function of the viscous component of camelid seminal plasma remain a mystery and an obvious area for future research. A better understanding of the normal constituents of seminal plasma will enable the rational design of semen extenders suitable <b>for</b> <b>camelids.</b> Post-thaw sperm viability is very low, and studies are needed to address questions of optimal freezing and thawing procedures as well as the insemination dose. The basis for differences in reported pregnancy rates with sexed and frozen semen in domestic equids, and the ultimate success of AI in wild equids will require continued research into the ‘‘stallion effect’’, extenders and cryoprotectants, optimal volume and number of spermatozoa, temperatures during handling, processing an transport, and insemination techniques.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of how livestock policies are made and implemented in a national context, and how they can be improved to better serve the interests of the poor. It seems that good opportunities for improving rural livelihoods in Bolivia through livestock policy {{are to be found in}} the <b>camelid</b> sector. Markets <b>for</b> <b>camelid</b> meat, fiber, and leather are currently small but hold significant potential to benefit poor herders in the Andean highlands. The study used the key informant method supplemented with official documents, newspaper sources and recently published research on the livestock sector. Interviews helped reveal policymaker's concerns, whereas field trips allowed the researcher to talk to a few peasants and learn their perspectives from the bottom. Newspapers contained many lively stories of how well-intentioned policies went awry at the implementation stage, while published research analyzed various political, institutional and technical aspects of policymaking in the sector. The author concludes that given the weak state capacity the range of feasible public policies that could be implemented to foster pro-poor development is limited. The clearest role for the state lies in the realm of animal health and sanitation, in particular, the establishment and maintenance of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) -free zones, prevention programs to control the incidence of sarcocistiosis, a camelid parasite, and support for municipal governments in improving sanitary conditions in slaughterhouses. The National Service for Agricultural and Livestock Sanitation (SENASAG) is a relatively new government agency, created in 2000 to handle such animal disease issues. To date, however, it has focused most of its resources on establishing an FMD-free zone for cattle production in the eastern lowlands. Three strategic entry points are recommended that can both improve the performance of the sector and the participation of the poor in productive activities.

The programme has been planned for the following main reasons: the great potential for development of ASAC fine fibre production and genetic resources, the opportunity for the poorest land resources (Puna) to develop alternative livestock production systems, the existence of Argentine projects in the same field (PROMECAD- PROgrama MEjora CAmelidos Domestico- and INTA research activity- Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria-), the current low volume of fibre production due to the reduced number of animals reared in Argentina (150, 000 heads), the low product valorisation, the lack of marketing knowledge, and the low technological level of fibre processing. The main objectives of the programme have been: 1) to set up a methodology for the genetic improvement of ASAC and for the optimal management of fibre production; 2) to analyse the international market <b>for</b> <b>camelid</b> fibres and to identify new trading opportunities, 3) to study technical, economic and financial problems associated with the commercial exploitation of camelid fibres. Among the benefits resulting from this project, there has been an improvement in the level of cooperation between public and private operators {{for the development of the}} sector and the opportunity for the economic valorisation of ASAC fibres, while new possibilities for the commercial cooperation between Europe and Argentina have been identified.

40|$|To {{test whether}} camelids, as an {{artiodactyl}} family, are characterised by comparatively low energy expenditure, we collated literature data from experiments {{where at least}} one camelid and one ruminant species received the same diet, and literature data on camelid metabolism and energy requirements. Additionally, we measured the maintenance and resting metabolism in five alpacas, six llamas and five Bactrian camels by chamber respirometry. Irrespective of whether dry matter intake was expressed as g kg− 0. 75 day− 1, g kg− 0. 9 day− 1, or g kg− 1. 0 day− 1, camelids ingested significantly less food than domestic ruminants (data available for sheep and goats). Although metabolic rates and energy requirements reported <b>for</b> <b>camelids</b> vary over a large range, they are generally below the ‘average’ basal mammal metabolism, and below published energy requirements for ruminants. The mean metabolic rates measured {{in this study were}} 215 ± 68, 261 ± 33 and 248 ± 51 kJ kg− 0. 75 day− 1 for alpacas, llamas and Bactrian camels, respectively.

40|$|The {{development}} of gene maps constitutes a key feature for understanding genome architecture and comparative evolution. The genomes of some livestock {{species such as}} cattle, horses and pigs, have received considerable attention over the years due to their economic importance. In contrast, though camelids are gaining worldwide popularity as production and companion animals, cytogenetics and genome mapping in these species lag far behind those of other mammals. One {{of the reasons for}} the scarce body of knowledge regarding the camelid genome is their particularly difficult karyotype for analysis. All six extant camelid species have a diploid number of 74 chromosomes; the gross morphological similarities shared by many of the autosomes, combined with the relatively small size of some chromosome pairs, present serious challenges for identifying individual chromosomes using conventional cytogenetic techniques. The Alpaca Genome Project includes whole genome sequencing, radiation hybrid (RH) mapping and human-camel comparative chromosome painting (Zoo-FISH). However, there is no common platform that aligns various maps and precisely assigns them to individual chromosomes. Therefore, the goal of this research project was to construct a cytogenetic map for the alpaca genome by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of large insert clones from the alpaca CHORI- 246 genomic BAC library. The BACs were selected based on the available Zoo-FISH, RH and sequence map data to target evolutionarily conserved genes and to get uniform distribution of markers throughout the alpaca genome. Candidate genes for traits of interest such as various congenital and reproduction-related disorders, as well as for phenotypic traits such as fiber color and texture, were also selected for mapping. A total of 230 markers were mapped to the 36 alpaca autosomes and the sex chromosomes; moreover, comparative mapping showed exceptional conservation of both gene synteny and order between alpaca and dromedary camel chromosomes. The cytogenetic map of the alpaca genome is a platform that effectively integrates the whole genome sequence and the radiation hybrid map with cytogenetic data, thus facilitating the discovery of genes of interest and providing tools for studying chromosome evolution and for clinical cytogenetics by means of a collection of chromosome-specific markers <b>for</b> <b>camelids...</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite being {{widely used}} for {{long-term}} storage {{and dissemination of}} male genetic material in many species, semen cryopreservation and artificial insemination (AI) are not well-developed <b>for</b> <b>camelids.</b> The main reasons for the delay in developing these technologies are the poor in vitro semen quality of camelids and the viscous nature of the seminal plasma. Though high fertility is routinely achieved with natural mating on commercial alpaca farms, the low sperm concentration and high viscosity makes semen dilution and cryopreservation challenging. An effective sperm cryopreservation and artificial insemination program would allow alpaca producers to cheaply and safely disseminate superior male genetics throughout the national herd and beyond. The recent discovery that alpaca semen viscosity {{is caused by the}} protein mucin 5 B (Kershaw-Young and Maxwell 2012 b) and that this protein can be effectively broken down with the protease papain without affecting sperm quality (Kershaw-Young et al. 2013) has facilitated further attempts to cryopreserve alpaca spermatozoa and utilise cryopreserved spermatozoa in artificial insemination. The aims of the following thesis were to: 1) 	measure the effect of varying doses of β-NGF on the timing of ovulation, plasma progesterone (P 4) concentration and corpus luteum (CL) size in female alpacas 2) 	determine the effects of diluent type, cryoprotectant concentration, storage method and freeze/thaw rates on the post-thaw survival of cryopreserved alpaca spermatozoa. 3) 	determine the effects of the addition of varying concentrations of seminal plasma pre-freeze and post-thaw on the function of cryopreserved alpaca spermatozoa 4) 	compare the fertility of fresh, papain-treated and frozen-thawed spermatozoa using artificial insemination. 5) 	validate a heterologous oocyte-binding assay for the assessment of alpaca sperm quality This project comprised both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The in vitro studies focused on the development of a semen cryopreservation protocol. Several key aspects of cryopreservation were optimised – the diluent type, concentration of cryoprotectant, storage vessel and freezing and thawing rates. Addition of seminal plasma both before and after freeze-thawing was also investigated. Sperm quality was assessed by subjective motility assessment, fluorescent staining to determine acrosome, membrane and DNA integrity. The in vivo studies determined the timing of ovulation, subsequent size of corpora lutea (by transrectal ultrasound) and plasma progesterone concentration (by radioimmunoassay of blood plasma) following treatment of females with either β-NGF or buserelin. In Chapter 5, the ovulation timing finding and those of the in vitro sperm cryopreservation experiments were used to conduct a field trial in which females were artificially inseminated with either fresh, papain-treated or frozen-thawed spermatozoa to establish fertilising potential of spermatozoa after having undergone these treatments. The major findings of these studies were as follows: 1) 	The time to ovulation after induction treatment was 26. 2 ± 1. 0 h. 2) 	The minimum dose of β-NGF for effective induction of ovulation was > 0. 1 mg. 3) 	The post-thaw motility and viability of ejaculated alpaca spermatozoa has been greatly improved by optimising cryopreservation protocols.

A livestock development project (called 2 ̆ 2 Project Alpaca 2 ̆ 2) working in the community was then assessed {{in terms of how}} its assumptions of system dynamics compared with empirical findings. The goal of Project Alpaca was to increase incomes <b>for</b> <b>camelid</b> (i. e., llama and alpaca) herders on the Bolivian altiplano by improving the processing, production, and marketing of alpaca wool. Project implementation was carried out by an indigenous herders 2 ̆ 7 association, with funds provided for construction of a modern alpaca wool processing plant and technical interventions at the farm level. Specific research objectives were to determine which conceptual model of system dynamics (equilibrium or nonequilibrium) best approximated the vegetation and livestock dynamics in Cosapa, and determine the impacts of technical innovations introduced by Project Alpaca. Vegetation dynamics were assessed by comparing plant species composition and production between grazed and ungrazed sites. Pastoral management strategies, livestock population dynamics between 1982 to 1995, and project impacts were assessed using a household survey. Results from the vegetation analyses showed that grazing protection had little impact on plant productivity, but reduced species diversity in wetland areas. The vegetation thus exhibited nonequilibrial characteristics. Regarding livestock dynamics, populations were relatively stable (over 13 years), although mortality was affected by severe drought, suggesting a combination of equilibrial and nonequilibrial interactions. Project Alpaca assumed an equilibrium model by emphasizing system stability and production maximization. The technical interventions showed positive, negative, and neutral associations with animal productivity. Construction of fenced exclosures on communal land has increased conflicts over land tenure rights, and may marginalize poorer households and increase social stratification. Development recommendations include shifting efforts away from intensification interventions that limit movement and flexibility, and strengthening social and economic networks that buffer the impacts of system variability...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{several issues}} related to isotopic ecology in northern Peru. The first portion of the dissertation focuses on baseline carbon and nitrogen isotopic variability in plants for comparison with paleodietary data. The second portion applies these data to assess animal management practices (camelids) in the Virú Valley on the north coast of Peru using isotopic analysis of bone collagen and serially sampled hair. A detailed survey of plants from the Moche River Valley region demonstrates significant east-west variation in plant carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions, following changes in altitude from the Pacific coast to the highlands. A growth chamber study and a field experiment show the potential for Andean fertilizers (seabird guano and camelid dung) to increase the δ 15 N values of plant tissues (by + 11 to + 45 ‰ for seabird guano and by + 2 to + 4 ‰ <b>for</b> <b>camelid</b> dung). These findings {{have important implications for}} the reconstruction of diet in the Andean region, potentially confounding the interpretation of bulk isotopic data (from bone collagen or hair keratin), with camelid dung fertilized plants appearing isotopically similar to terrestrial animal meat, and guano fertilizer maize appearing isotopically similar to high trophic level marine organisms. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions from camelid bone collagen and hair keratin from two sites (Huaca Gallinazo and Huaca Santa Clara) in the Virú Valley (Peru) are highly variable, with an overall tendency towards higher δ 13 C and δ 15 N values relative to modern animals raised in highland environments, suggesting {{that at least some of}} these animals were raised locally. The high amount of isotopic variability between individuals, inconsistent amount of within-individual variation, and no consistent shift in isotopic compositions leading up to the time of death is consistent with small-scale camelid husbandry on the north coast of Peru, with small groups of camelids being managed by individual families or other small social units. The isotopic analysis of zooarchaeological material derived from livestock has great potential with respect to better understanding animal husbandry practices, and human-animal interactions in the broadest sense...|$|R

The engineered human V(H) domains described here may be useful for immunotherapy, due to their expected low immunogenicity, and in applications involving transient high temperatures, due to their efficient refolding after thermal denaturationPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{ranges of}} blood sugar in common {{domestic}} ruminants {{are lower than}} in many monogastric mammals. [...] However this generalization does not extend to wild ruminants or <b>camelids.</b> <b>For</b> serum glucose in mg/dL, reference ranges of 42 to 75 for cows, 44 to 81 for sheep, and 48 to 76 for goats, but 61 to 124 for cats; 62 to 108 for dogs, 62 to 114 for horses, 66 to 116 for pigs, 75 to 155 for rabbits, and 90 to 140 for llamas have been reported. [...] A 90 percent reference interval for serum glucose of 26 to 181 mg/dL has been reported for captured mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), where no effects of the pursuit and capture on measured levels were evident. [...] For beluga whales, the 25-75 percent range for serum glucose has been estimated to be 94 to 115 mg/dL. [...] For the white rhinoceros, one study has indicated that the 95 percent range is 28 to 140 mg/dL. [...] For harp seals, a serum glucose range of 4.9 to 12.1 mmol/L 88 to 218 mg/dL has been reported; for hooded seals, a range of 7.5 to 15.7 mmol/L about 135 to 283 mg/dL has been reported.|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} great efforts for its control and eradication, {{tuberculosis}} {{remains one of}} the most important zoonosis worldwide. Its causative agents, the members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, have a wide host range that complicates the epidemiology of this disease. Among susceptible species to these pathogens, camelids from the New World (llama, alpaca and vicuña) and Old World (Bactrian camel and dromedary) are acquiring an increasing importance in several European countries because of its growing number and could act as reservoirs of the disease for livestock and humans in their natural habitat. In addition, tuberculosis caused by a number of M. tuberculosis complex members is a life-threatening disease in these animal species. Although tuberculosis has been known to affect <b>camelids</b> <b>for</b> a long time, ante-mortem diagnosis is still challenging because of the lack of standardized diagnostic techniques and the limited sensitivity and specificity of the most widely applied tests. However, in recent years, several techniques that can at least partially overcome these limitations have been developed. This paper reviews the results and advances achieved in tuberculosis diagnosis in camelids in the last decade as well as the progresses on ongoing investigations, with special attention to the remaining challenges that still have to be faced to assure the availability of reliable tools for the detection of tuberculosis-infected animals and herds.

40|$|South American {{camelids}} {{have been}} poorly genetically investigated and little {{information is available}} in llamas (Lama glama) regarding {{the diversity of the}} caseins at the protein and gene level. Exon skipping and duplication events previously reported in the αS 1 -casein gene (CSN 1 S 1) led us to investigate the genetic variability at this locus. Seventy-two positive clones for the αS 1 -casein transcripts were analyzed and randomly sequenced. The comparative analysis of the sequences revealed 2 transitions, c. 366 A>G and c. 690 T>C, at the 10 th nucleotide of exon 12 and 94 bp of exon 19, respectively. These SNP are responsible for 2 amino acid changes, Ile→Val in position 86 and Tyr→His in position 194 of the mature protein. Both polymorphisms clarify the genetic events behind the protein variants A and B. This result was confirmed by isoelectric focusing analysis of llama milk samples. Quick methods based on PCR-RFLP and allele-specific PCR were set up for allelic discrimination in a population of 128 animals. Based on genotyping results, 4 haplotypes were observed and the estimated frequencies indicated B as the most common haplotype (0. 629) in the investigated population. These data add knowledge to the genetic variability of a species little investigated, and open opportunity for new investigation in the field of milk protein <b>for</b> South American <b>camelids,</b> including the possibility, in the future, to select alleles with favorable characteristic...|$|R
40|$|Background: Information {{about the}} {{clinical}} and clinicopathologic aspects of cerebrospinal nematodiasis (CN) in camelids is limited. Hypothesis: Clinical and therapeutic variables will {{be identified as}} factors predictive of survival. Animals: Client-owned camelids suspected of having CN admitted to Purdue University between 1995 and 2015. Methods: A retrospective study was performed. A diagnosis of CN was based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) eosinophilic pleocytosis or postmortem findings. Results: Eleven alpacas and 9 llamas met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-five percent of the camelids were male (27 % castrated and 73 % intact). Common clinical abnormalities included proprioceptive deficits (100 % of animals), recumbency (55 %), tachypnea (55 %), and ataxia (40 %). Among the 85 % of treated animals, 100 % received PO fenbendazole, and 88 % received a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The survival rate to discharge was 45 %. Plasma fibrinogen concentration, creatine kinase activity, and serum creatinine concentration were significantly higher in nonsurvivors. Blood eosinophil count, platelet count, and total CO were significantly lower in nonsurvivors. Factors associated with survival were species, sex, absence of treatment with corticosteroids, and clinical improvement. There was no association between recumbency at admission and survival. A plasma fibrinogen concentration above > 266 mg/dL was an excellent diagnostic test to predict survival {{in the presence of}} neurological signs or CSF eosinophilia. Conclusions: Although prognosis <b>for</b> CN in <b>camelids</b> is guarded, presence of recumbency at admission is not predictive of nonsurvival. Male camelids and llamas appear more likely to die from CN. Corticosteroid treatment is contraindicated in animals diagnosed with CN...|$|R
40|$|Background: Rapid, economical, and {{quantitative}} assays <b>for</b> measurement of <b>camelid</b> serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) are limited. In camelids, failure of transfer of maternal immunoglobulins has a reported prevalence {{of up to}} 20. 5 %. An accurate method for quantifying serum IgG concentrations is required. Objective: To develop an infrared spectroscopy-based assay for measurement of alpaca serum IgG and compare its performance to the reference standard radial immunodiffusion (RID) assay. Animals: One hundred and seventy-five privately owned, healthy alpacas. Methods: Eighty-two serum samples were collected as convenience samples during routine herd visits whereas 93 samples were recruited from a separate study. Serum IgG concentrations were determined by RID assays and midinfrared spectra were collected for each sample. Fifty samples were set aside as the test set and the remaining 125 training samples were employed to build a calibration model using partial least squares (PLS) regression with Monte Carlo cross validation to determine the optimum number of PLS factors. The predictive performance of the calibration model was evaluated by the test set. Results: Correlation coefficients for the IR-based assay were 0. 93 and 0. 87, respectively, for the entire data set and test set. Sensitivity in the diagnosis of failure of transfer of passive immunity (FTPI) ([IgG] < 1, 000 mg/dL) was 71. 4 % and specificity was 100 % for the IR-based method (test set) as gauged relative to the RID reference method assay. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This study indicated that infrared spectroscopy, in combination with chemometrics, is an effective method for measurement of IgG in alpaca serum. <br...|$|R
