The first two games, Reel Fishing (released in 1996) and Reel Fishing II (released in 2000) {{appeared}} on the PlayStation. They were followed by Reel Fishing III in 2003 on the PlayStation 2. A special fishing reel controller was released with the first game that was also compatible with the sequels. The first game was successful enough to reach [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] status.|$|E
50|$|Gameplay, {{like other}} {{games in the}} <b>fishing</b> <b>simulator</b> genre {{consists}} of casting a line from a fishing pole to reel in fish. In the game, the player casts the line and reels in fish with the touch screen. Whether or not a player can catch a fish usually depends on timing and {{the placement of the}} tackle. The game includes multiple fishing techniques, including bait fishing as well as fly fishing. The game also includes 15 stages, 40 fish, and over 100 pieces of tackle. Players can also keep caught fish in a fish tank for display.|$|E
40|$|Abstract OnlyWith {{international}} efforts to develop ecosystem-based management of ocean uses, {{there has been a}} growing call for the development of integrated assessment tools, including the design of models which can be used to identify possible futures and evaluate alternative management strategies. Along with this, there is increasing recognition that such models should include explicit representations of human behaviour and its drivers, as this is key to understanding the potential responses to economic, ecological and regulatory changes. The presentation will use examples from Australia to illustrate the diversity of approaches and domains of application in which such modelling can be developed, and discuss some of the key issues which need to be considered in developing these models. Examples will include whole-of-system models, such as Atlantis in the Australian South-East Fishery and multiple use applications of the In Vitro platform in North-Western Australia, as well as the highly spatial multi-species and multi-fleet Effects of Line <b>Fishing</b> <b>Simulator</b> in the Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo Reef (Western Australia) ...|$|E

Compared to a 3 D simulator for autonomous robotic fish by Liu and Hu, an improved body wave equation capable of multimodal swimming motions is adopted in our simulator and artificial swimming data can be further imported enabling various fictive swimming patterns. Furthermore, the swimming data generated from the simulator can directly be fed into the fish robots for verification, and vice versa. Finally, a series of fishlike robots with different mechanical design have been built to validate our well-formed ideas and to reach {{a new level of}} performance close to actual fish for real applications. ...|$|R

40|$|A spatially-structured {{simulation}} {{model of the}} metapopulation dynamics of common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) and their harvest by line fishing was developed to evaluate potential management options on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), including closing areas to fishing. The effects of line <b>fishing</b> <b>simulator</b> (ELFSim) incorporates a spatially-structured model of the life-history of common coral trout, including larval dispersal, harvest by multiple fishing sectors (commercial, charter and recreational), {{and a range of}} mechanisms for regulating harvest. The model is designed to allow considerable flexibility in biological and fishery dynamics, to be portable to contexts other than the GBR, and to be modular to allow comparison of different implementations of biological and harvest model components. In this paper, we describe the details of the model and discuss its utility as a tool for evaluating fishery management strategies in the context of diverse stakeholder expectations. We illustrate a simple application by changing the rate at which larvae settle on the reef from which they were spawned, under a range of spatial closures and a scenario of steadily increasing fishing effort. The results identify the conditions under which a “larval subsidy effect” may be important to the performance of fishery management strategies. This effect was manifest as increased catches outside of areas closed to fishing when larvae were freely exchanged among reefs compared to when larval exchange was diminished or absent...|$|E

We participated in two projects: “The 3 D digital museum of Taiwan city and architecture” and “Digital model database and professional service for Taiwan city and architecture”. The first one attempted {{to build a}} virtual museum for Taiwan city and architecture through the past four hundred years.

40|$|AbstractComputational {{simulation}} {{has been}} used as a powerful tool to represent the dynamical behavior of systems based on complex analytic models. These types of models have two main drawbacks: (a) limitations due to the degree of abstraction needed to simulate them, (b) high computing power to simulate a heavily simplified models. The computing power available today can overcome these limitations to perform quicker simulations of complex models that are closer to reality. In this paper, the experiments and performance analysis of a distributed simulation for a complex individual oriented model (fish schools) are presented.

40|$|AbstractExploring the {{multi-core}} {{architecture is}} an important issue to obtaining high performance in parallel and distributed discrete-event simulations. However, the simulation features must fit on parallel programming model in order to increase the performance. In this paper we show our experience developing a hybrid MPI+OpenMP version of our parallel and distributed discrete- event individual-oriented <b>fish</b> schooling <b>simulator.</b> In the hybrid approach developed, we fit our simulation features in the following manner: the communication between the Logical Processes happens via message passing whereas the computing of the individuals by OpenMP threads. In addition, we propose a new data structure for partitioning the fish clusters which avoid the critical section in OpenMP code. As a result, the hybrid version significantly improves the total execution time for huge quantity of individuals, because it decreases both the communication and management of processes overhead, whereas it increases the utilization of cores with sharing of resources...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPartitioning {{and load}} {{balancing}} are highly important issues in distributed individual-oriented simulation. Choosing how to distribute individuals on the distributed environment {{can be a}} crucial factor {{at the moment of}} executing the simulation. Partitioning an individual-oriented system should be efficient in order to reduce communication involved in interaction between individuals belong to different logical processes. Furthermore, if the individual-oriented model exhibits mobility patterns, {{we should be able to}} maintain the load balancing in order to keep the global application performance. In this work, we present a proximity load balancing strategy for a distributed cluster-based individual-oriented <b>fish</b> school <b>simulator.</b> On one hand, we implement a robust cluster-based partitioning method by means of covering radius criterion and voronoi diagrams. We use a proximity criterion to distribute individuals on the distributed architecture. On the other hand, we propose a proximity load balancing strategy in order to maintain the application performance as the simulation progresses...|$|R

40|$|Weakly {{electric}} fish use electroreception - {{the generation}} and detection of electric currents - {{to explore the}} world around them. Neurophysiological studies of these fish have greatly increased our understanding of central electrosensory processing, and have significant implications for sensory processing in the cerebellum and cerebellar-like neural structures. This thesis addresses a particular deficiency {{in our understanding of}} electrosensory systems: the input pattern of currents stimulating the fish's electroreceptors has not yet been well defined. My goals were to quantitatively reconstruct the electric organ discharge (EOD) and electrosensory images detected by weakly electric fish. These were accomplished by mapping the EODs of six gymnotiform species, simulating the EODs in two (Eigenmannia and Apteronotus), and predicting the electrosensory input during exploratory behaviors. The EOD maps display a wide diversity of species-specific patterns, implying significant differences in field generation, sensory input patterns, possible behavioral strategies, and processing algorithms. Each fish must interpret electrosensory images which are highly dependent upon its own particular EOD pattern. To study electrolocation noninvasively during natural behaviors, I developed a 3 -d electric <b>fish</b> <b>simulator</b> based on the boundary element method. The simulator solves Poisson's equation for the electric potential in and around the fish, modeled as an electrostatic boundary value problem. Models of two species were built and optimized to match the measured maps. By varying only a few parameters, I explored how the electric organ structure and activation generate a particular EOD pattern: Eigenmannia has a synchronous electric organ and dipolar EOD, while Apteronotus is better described as a propagating multipole. The simulator was used to reconstruct the EOD during a previously published tailprobing behavior of Eigenmannia, and from my own videotapes of Apteronotus exploring objects under infrared light. Simulations of selected exploratory behaviors revealed the EOD fields, modulations from body orientation and objects, and the resulting electrosensory patterns. The results (1) imply the fish control their body positions to regulate particular features of the electrosensory image, (2) predict features of the electrosensory input reaching the brain, and (3) suggest algorithms needed to extract useful signals from the electrosensory stream...|$|R
40|$|AbstractParallel {{discrete}} event simulation (PDES) {{have shown}} to be an useful paradigm for simulating complex and large-scale models. An individual-oriented approach allows modelers capture complex emerging global behaviors generated by simple local interaction, like observed in self-organized systems. Usually, this type of simulations are highly expensive in terms of computing and communications. One one hand, we can reduce the computing involved in individual interactions by means of developing a robust partitioning method. On the other hand, {{we have to be}} able to efficiently handle a huge number of individuals interacting with other individuals stored in memory of remote processors. In this work we will analyze and compare three communication strategies: synchronous and asynchronous message passing (via MPI) and bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) for our distributed cluster-based individual-oriented <b>fish</b> school <b>simulator.</b> In this type of simulations, the main contributions of our work are: a) we showed that distributed time-driven simulations do not always improve the performance when using synchronous communication strategies, b) we show asynchronous communications strategies are more efficient. In addition, we have verified that the bulk-synchronous parallel method is a scalable...|$|R

40|$|Data {{structure}} {{is an important}} issue to get good performance in parallel and distributed applications. These data structures have to be designed with the memory paradigm in mind where the data structure will be used in order to explore the architecture in a better way and subsequently obtain the best Speedup. Current parallel programming languages enable us to easily transform a parallel solution developed for a distributed paradigm to a hybrid solution just by adding pragma codes. At first approach, this is an interesting solution because it does not require several code modifications. Nevertheless, this interchange can cause a slowdown if an appropriate and deep adaptation is not carried out in the code. In this paper, we present our experience when we migrated a data structure developed for a distributed paradigm to a hybrid paradigm. This data structure was implemented in our <b>Fish</b> Schooling Agent-Based <b>simulator</b> where it might be useful either as a distributed paradigm or a hybrid paradigm. The results show the importance of customizing the data structure for the appropriate infrastructure and parallel programming paradigm. We believe that the data structure should have a flexible and dynamic behavior in accordance with the paradigm used. XVIII Workshop de Procesamiento Distribuido y Paralelo (WPDP) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we extend FIShPASs (FIshing Stock Probabilistic Agent-Based Simulator) [1], a {{probabilistic}} agent-based {{model for the}} behavior of the common sole (Solea Solea), with capabilities for exploring different fishing scenarios. In order to assess and predict the availability of the fish stock under different <b>fishing</b> efforts, the <b>simulator</b> allows the user to specify fishing mortality rates (F) on a monthly basis. We simulated the following scenarios for a period of 10 years (120 months). : - Virgin Stock (F= 0) : the stock of common sole is not affected by fishing activities. This represents a sort of null model that indicates the ideal population dynamics; - moderate fishing effort F= 0. 2; overfishing F= 1. 2); - Optimal period of fishery closure: we simulated different periods of fishing ban for investigating the optimal policies that has the minimum impact on fish stock; - Recovery after overfishing: with this scenario we calculated the time that the fish stock takes to reach sustainable levels, after simulating a period of strong fishing effort; In addition the simulator has been integrated with SURBA (SURvey-Based Assessments) [2], a well- established model in the context of marine biology, in order to validate our model.
