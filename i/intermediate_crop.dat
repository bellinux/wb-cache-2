Effects of different farm types (with and without lifestock raising) combined with tillage treat-ments on plants, soil and environment have been investigated. This article presents results on soil fertility, N-balances and cash crop yields according to the farm system. All in all, the superiority of a management system with cattle over stockless organic farming is demonstrated. The mixed farm type led to higher amounts of humus in the soil, lower N-losses and higher yields.

High infection levels {{lead to an}} increase of the spore potential in soil. 3 and 4 years randomized crop rotation field trials are performed at 3 sites with 4 replicates on naturally infested fields with either T. controversa or T. caries spores with crop rotation links commonly used in organic farming to determine whether it is possible to decrease the spore potential in soil. The influence of stable manure on bunt spores is tested. Brassica species setting free thiocyanate and isothiocyanate compounds after mulching are cultivated to examine the possibility to reduce the spore potential in soil. Soil samples are taken yearly from each plot and common and dwarf bunt spore potential is determined. In the crop rotation without perennial grass clover or fallow a higher reduction of bunt spores potential in soil was found.

40|$|In organic agriculture, it is {{important}} to tackle crop and weed management from a system perspective to make it effective, especially in poorly competitive crops such as vegetables. For that reason, we developed two innovative integrated crop and weed management systems for a field vegetable crop sequence in a commercial organic farm that we have been comparing to a standard farm system from 2006 to 2008. The three systems are applied to a spinach-potato-cabbage-tomato two-year crop sequence and include different levels of technical innovation: Standard Crop Management System (SCMS); <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Crop</b> Management System (ICMS); and Advanced Crop Management System (ACMS). ICMS is based on a sequence of physical weed management treatments, whereas ACMS also includes a subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) living mulch. In this paper we analyse the results obtained on spinach (Spinacia oleracea) in terms of crop yield and weed suppression. Both innovative systems increased total spinach fresh weight yield compared to SCMS, despite higher weed biomass.

40|$|AimsTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the type of crop residues on the colonization dynamic of Fusarium graminearum in soil. Methods and ResultsThe ability of F. graminearum to survive in the presence of various crop residues was assessed on Petri dishes and in microcosms. These microcosms comprised soil that had or had not been previously disinfested with or without amendment with various crop residues. The colonization dynamic of F. graminearum was monitored through real-time PCR. Fusarium graminearum development was higher in disinfested soil than in non-disinfested one. The fungal growth was enhanced to various extents according to the type of crop residues, except for mustard residues which inhibited it. The biochemical and physical properties of the residues were likely to account for the differences in the survival of F. graminearum. ConclusionsFusarium graminearum is a poor competitor in soil but it can use maize, wheat, and rape residues to ensure its survival. Conversely alfalfa, which is assimilated by micro-organisms very easily, avoids long-lasting survival of the fungus. And finally, mustard producing glucosinolates could be used as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>crop</b> to reduce the inoculum amount.

40|$|Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} disease altering wheat crops. A field experiment was conducted to better understand the saprotrophic development of Fusarium graminearum and its consequences on FHB, to characterize the relative importance of the different sources of FHB inoculum and the accumulation of mycotoxins in grains and subsequently, to determine early indicators of future disease development on ears and accumulation of mycotoxins in grains. The development of F. graminearum in the soil and crop residues was monitored in controlled conditions. The inoculum hosted by seeds and/or buried with crop residues in the topsoil had only an effect on the winter development of the disease. In contrast, the main source of inoculum causing FHB disease on ears and accumulation of mycotoxins in wheat kernels came from residues left on the soil surface. Monitoring of plant development from sowing to harvest, crop management and soil and weather conditions produced a large database. Unfortunately, the role of climate was decisive in the development of the Fusarium-host plant interaction, thus prevented the use of early indicators to accurately predict the risks of yield losses and accumulation of mycotoxins involved. F. graminearum was regulated by the soil microflora. However, crop residues provide the fungus spatial and trophic niches favourable to its development. The exploitation of these niches by F. graminearum depends on the nature (previous crop and C/N) of the residues. Maize stubbles provide a greater carrying capacity than wheat straw and rapeseed residues while mustard has a suppressive effect for the fungus. The management of crop residues is a key point to control the development of FHB. A strong emphasis should be placed on the biological decomposition of crop residues at the soil surface or/and on the use of suppressive <b>intermediate</b> <b>crops</b> such as mustard to limit the soil inoculum potential of saprotrophic F. graminearum...|$|R

Linking spatial variability in crop performance to differences in soil attributes could identify the limiting factors driving the system, since patterns of crop performance will follow the spatial variability of the underlying limiting soil attributes. The Greenseeker handheld NDVI sensor was used to determine the within-plot spatial variability of crop performance in the different management treatments of a long-term (started 1991) tillage and residue management trial. Soil quality was measured spatially in the same plots. Under zero tillage with residue removal, soil quality and crop performance followed micro-topography with higher values where elevation was lower. Under zero tillage with residue retention soil quality was high throughout the field, ensuring uniform crop growth and under conventional tillage, soil quality was <b>intermediate.</b> <b>Crop</b> performance followed the same pattern as soil moisture and the related attributes infiltration, soil structure and organic matter.

40|$|A time-series {{analysis}} of potato prices {{will be introduced}} in this study. Potatoes are the leading vegetable in the United States {{from the viewpoint of}} annual production. Compared with the other table food plants, potatoes ranks second only to wheat. Almost 81 % of the potatoes produced are used for food consumption, 5 % of the crop are used for seed and the remaining 14 % of the crop, which are the surplus consisting mostly of poor grade potatoes, go for non-food uses, such as livestock feed and industrial products, starch and alcohol. At the same time potatoes {{are one of the most}} widely grown crops in the United States. They are grown in every state and harvested during every month of the year in some sections of the country. During recent years, there has been a tendency toward more specialization in potato production. The total acreage trended downward but the yields per acre have increased rapidly. Production of potatoes is becoming concentrated in the high-yielding areas and on large commercial farms. This high specializing and commercializing tendency makes potato price analysis more important. Potato price analysis in this study is centered on Chicago and St. Louis, the two big wholesale markets of midwest potatoes, and is devoted largely to the late crop. Since the data we have cover a period of only seven years, the study will be emphasized with respect to short-time price analysis, i. e., annual and short-term cyclic price fluctuations and seasonal price variations. The main objectives of this study are three, listed in the following: To find out the effects of changes in late crop production, <b>intermediate</b> <b>crop</b> prices, and their pertinent factors on the late crop prices, i. e., to make a potato price structure analysis. To verify the hypothesis that markets adjust potato prices toward equilibrium levels, i. e., seasonal average level, - if price starts out too high or too low, that means the price is out of line and will adjust itself toward the seasonal average.

Germplasm is chosen to efficiently represent important members of larger pedigree-connected genepools. To facilitate validation of multiple QTLs, genome-wide representation of alleles is optimized for designated important breeding parents (IBPs) by estimating average allelic representation in relatives.

40|$|No-Till {{cropping}} systems have evolved rapidly {{since the early}} 1960 s and have attracted attention world-wide. The difficulty of transferring new technologies is also well established. The selection of a tillage system is a difficult management decision with long term implications. Specific constraints impede its implementation. No-Till {{has the potential to}} conserve soil and energy as well as to sustain the agricultural ecosystem, yet some soil types have high cultivation requirements to maintain optimum soil structure. Climatic factors, such as level of precipitation, can influence both plant response to soil compaction and the timing of crop establishment. Furthermore, biological constraints such as plant diseases or specific weed species can become controlling factors governing the successful adoption of No-Till. The use of an expert system is considered the best way to derive the researchers' knowledge and aid the process of choosing an appropriate tillage technique. The No-Till Expert (NOTE) System is designed to aid farmers and extension workers in their decision-making process for promoting No-Till. A prototype expert system has been developed and initially run in Pakistan under the rice-wheat and cotton-wheat rotation. A model for popularizing No-Till technology is also proposed. Over-drilling pasture, and crop establishment data from New Zealand conditions has been incorporated for possible use of this expert system in developed agriculture. The following technical, social, and economic input parameters have been incorporated in the NOTE. Users are required to input information concerning each parameters (guidance in selecting values is provided). Technical: Soil texture, soil slope, crop rotation, weed and pest management, straw residue management, seeding technology, and soil moisture condition around seed micro-environment at the time of planting. Social: The ability to carry out a particular operation correctly determines the farmer's ability to manage No-Till successfully. Therefore, the literacy level, use of knowledge for correct and timely operations is also considered under the social aspects in this study. Economic: If the cost of productions, and productivity is not likely to vary positively with the change in tillage technique, {{it would be difficult for}} extension workers to convince farmers to change their existing practices. Thus, the economic aspects of No-Till were also considered. Environmental, local legislation, residue handling, use of chemicals, and its impact on ground water contamination were the other key factors that were considered while designing NOTE. However, these were not incorporated in the final design of NOTE because of lack of the available quantitative data. NOTE interactively considers the above parameters and makes appropriate recommendations as to the acceptance/rejection of No-Till. Based on the wide range of studies on above subjects. NOTE out-rightly rejects No-Till under the following conditions: 1. If the area is affected by rice stem borer, and the requisite pesticides are not available under Pakistani condition. 2. If the soil texture is heavy and not well drained. 3. If the requisite weed control chemicals are not available. 4. For growing cereal after pasture, as sowing of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>crop</b> is recommended under New Zealand situation because of likely transfer of Argentine stem weevil. However, if farmer could afford to apply some appropriate pesticides, No-Till could be considered. 5. If farmer does not have access to a No-Till drill.

40|$|The {{harvested}} curd of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.) {{consists of}} proliferating, arrested inflorescence and floral meristems. The origins and events {{leading to the}} domestication of this important crop trait remain unclear. A similar phenotype observed in the ap 1 - 1 /cal- 1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in speculation that the orthologous genes from B. oleracea {{may be responsible for}} this characteristic trait. A recent molecular and genetic study has led to development of a genetic model based on segregation of recessive alleles at specific, mapped loci of the candidate genes BoCAL and BoAP 1. This model, although incomplete, accounts for differences in stage of arrest between cauliflower and Calabrese broccoli (B. oleracea var. italica Plenck), and predicts the intermediate stages of arrest similar to those observed in Sicilian Purple types. There appears to be a reduction in allele diversity at two key loci associated with this crop type. Surveys of ex situ genetic resource collections have demonstrated the association of alleles of BoCAL-a with curding phenotypes of B. oleracea. Strong correlations exist between specific alleles of BoCAL-a and discrete inflorescence morphologies. These complementary lines of evidence suggest that the cauliflower curd arose in southern Italy from a heading Calabrese broccoli via an <b>intermediate</b> Sicilian <b>crop</b> type. The close association of BoAP 1 -a and BoAP 1 -c with the self-incompatibility locus S {{may have contributed to the}} observed reduced number of S-alleles within the modern cauliflower gene-pool.

Objective {{of the present study}} was to recommend proper concentration of Al for maize (Al-tolerant), soybean (intermediate Al-tolerant) and sorghum (Al-sensitive). Two concentrations of Al (2. 5 and 2 0 μM AlCl 3 in 0. 2 mM CaCl 2) were used. For maize former concentration (2. 5 μM) was too light to inhibit root elongation (Al tolerance 60 - 77 %) and could not discriminate Al-tolerance among the cultivar whereas later concentration 20 μM represents better illustration of tolerances (40 - 65 %). Soybean was <b>intermediate</b> Al-tolerant <b>crop</b> and both concentration of Al could be suggested for Al-tolerance screening of this crop (40 to 79 % for low Al and 17 to 65 % for high Al). Sorghum was Al sensitive and high Al concentration made so severe inhibition of root elongation to all cultivars that Al-tolerance among the cultivars could not be differentiate well (Al tolerance 20 - 24 %). On the other hand, at low Al concentration Al-tolerance was in the range of 38 - 51 %. All crop species showed significant positive correlation (R 2 = 0. 945 *, 0. 936 ** or 0. 921 ** for sorghum, soybean and maize, respectively) between the Al tolerance from 2. 5 and from 20 μM Al. From these results it could be suggested that treatment concentration for Al tolerance screening should be conducted based on the Al tolerance level of each crop species...|$|R
40|$|Histochemical {{examination}} of rabbit, rat, guinea pig and mouse limb skeletal muscles in our laboratory {{has revealed that}} most red muscle fibers in any given muscle stain more intensely for glycogen (periodic acid-Schiff’s reaction) than white or intermediate fibers. Since most studies have concluded that white muscle has more glycogen than red muscle, this discrepancy was investigated. Eleven vastus lateralis muscles were resected from six adult male guinea pigs and cropped to yield “red, ” “moderate ” and “white ” regions. Cross-sections of each region were employed for histochemical fiber typing and the re-maining pieces for biochemical glycogen analysis. These analyses have shown the red region to have significantly more glycogen (9. 7 mg per g) and more red fibers (77 %) than the white region (7. 4 mg/g, 29 %). Having essentially eliminated <b>intermediate</b> fibers by <b>cropping,</b> these findings reflect glycogen concentration in red and white muscle fibers. The existence of significant numbers of intermediate fibers usually found in red muscles {{may be responsible for}} the frequently exhibited higher glycogen content in white muscles. The assessment of the relative glycogen content of “red ” and “white ” skeletal muscle has reveale...|$|R
60|$|I {{can answer}} these {{questions}} and objections only on the supposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists believe. The number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the countless generations of countless species which have certainly existed. The parent form of any two or more species {{would not be in}} all its characters directly intermediate between its modified offspring, any more than the rock-pigeon is directly <b>intermediate</b> in <b>crop</b> and tail between its descendants, the pouter and fantail pigeons. We should not be able to recognise a species as the parent of another and modified species, if we were to examine the two ever so closely, unless we possessed most of the intermediate links; and owing to the imperfection of the geological record, we have no just right to expect to find so many links. If two or three, or even more linking forms were discovered, they would simply be ranked by many naturalists as so many new species, more especially if found in different geological substages, let their differences be ever so slight. Numerous existing doubtful forms could be named which are probably varieties; but who will pretend that in future ages so many fossil links will be discovered, that naturalists will be able {{to decide whether or not}} these doubtful forms ought to be called varieties? Only a small portion of the world has been geologically explored. Only organic beings of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition, at least in any great number. Many species when once formed never undergo any further change but become extinct without leaving modified descendants; and the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured by years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retained the same form. It is the dominant and widely ranging species which vary most frequently and vary most, and varieties are often at first local--both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate links in any one formation less likely. Local varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are considerably modified and improved; and when they have spread, and are discovered in a geological formation, they appear as if suddenly created there, and will be simply classed as new species. Most formations have been intermittent in their accumulation; and their duration has probably been shorter than the average duration of specific forms. Successive formations are in most cases separated from each other by blank intervals of time of great length, for fossiliferous formations thick enough to resist future degradation can, as a general rule, be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed of the sea. During the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the record will generally be blank. During these latter periods there will probably be more variability in the forms of life; during periods of subsidence, more extinction.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} volcanological mapping {{has been}} carried out {{in the western part of}} the Bakony- Balaton Highland Volcanic Field (BBHVF) around Szigliget (Hungary) village. Pyroclastic rocks have been found building up the three distinct hillsides in the area. The pyroclastic rock beds in each hillside show similar north-westward dip direction and similar textural and compositional characteristics, suggestive of a complex but closely related volcanic system in the area. The pyroclastic deposits have been grouped into three units according to their textural, compositional and stratigraphic characteristics. Unit 1 which represents the lowermost stratigraphic position crops out in the southern side of the study area. It consists of coarse-grained, matrix-supported massive to weakly bedded, accidental lithic clast-rich, block-bearing lapilli tuffs / tuff breccias, extremely rich in deep-seated accidental lithic and peridotite lherzolite clasts. Unit 2 which represents an <b>intermediate</b> stratigraphic position <b>crops</b> out in the southern and north-east hilltops. It consists of coarse-grained accidental lithic clast-rich, normal graded, bedded, vitric lapilli tuffs / tuff beds. Deep-seated accidental lithic clasts are common, but large peridotite lherzolite fragments are relatively rare. Unit 3 which represents the highest stratigraphic position in the area crops out in the northwestern side. It consists of fine-to-coarse grained, bedded, accidental lithic clast-rich vitric lapilli tuff / tuff beds. Deep-seated lithic clasts as well as peridotite lherzolite fragments are rare. Accidental lithic clasts, derived from shallow prevolcanic strata (Neogene sediments), have a dominant proportion of pyroclastic rocks in this unit. In each unit the volcanic glasses are angular, non- to highly vesiculated tephrite to phono-tephrite shards. The presence of sideromelane glass shards and the large amount of accidental lithic clasts in beds from each units indicate subsurface phreatomagmatic explosive processes during formation of pyroclastic rocks at Szigliget. The pyroclastic rocks are interpreted as part of a former crater rim deposits around maar basin which subsequently subsided inward into a vent. Unit 1 is interpreted to be a lower diatreme deposit and Unit 2 and Unit 3 a series of near-vent pyroclastic density currents and fallout tephra...|$|R
