The primary test objectives were to establish basic longitudinal and lateral-directional stability and control characteristics for the IML orbiter. Additional configurations investigated were sealed elevon hingeline gaps, sealed rudder split line and hingeline gaps, larger radius leading edge on the vertical tail, and sealed speedbrake base. Aerodynamic force and moment data for the orbiter were measured in the body-axis system by an internally mounted, six-component strain gage balance. The model was sting mounted with the center of rotation located at approximately the wing trailing edge. The nominal angle of attack range was from - 4 to + 30 degrees. Yaw polars were recorded over a nominal yaw angle range from - 14 to + 14 degrees at constant angles of attack of 0, + or - 5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees...|$|E
40|$|Drastic {{changes in}} {{aircraft}} operational requirements {{and the emergence}} of new enabling technologies often occur symbiotically with advances in technology inducing new requirements and vice versa. These changes sometimes lead to the design of vehicle concepts for which no prior art exists. They lead to revolutionary concepts. In such cases the basic form of the vehicle geometry can no longer be determined through an ex ante survey of prior art as depicted by aircraft concepts in the historical domain. Ideally, baseline geometries for revolutionary concepts would be the result of exhaustive configuration space exploration and optimization. Numerous component layouts and their implications for the minimum external dimensions of the resultant vehicle would be evaluated. The dimensions of the minimum enclosing envelope for the best component layout(s) (as per the design need) would then be used as a basis for the selection of a baseline geometry. Unfortunately layout design spaces are inherently large and the key contributing analysis i. e. collision detection, can be very expensive as well. Even when an appropriate baseline geometry has been identified, another hurdle i. e. vehicle scaling has to be overcome. Through the design of a notional Cessna C- 172 R powered by a liquid hydrogen Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell, it has been demonstrated that the various forms of vehicle scaling i. e. photographic and historical-data-based scaling can result in highly sub-optimal results even for very small O(10 - 3) scale factors. There is therefore a need for higher fidelity vehicle scaling laws especially since emergent technologies tend to be volumetrically and/or gravimetrically constrained when compared to incumbents. The Configuration-space Exploration and Scaling Methodology (CESM) is postulated herein as a solution to the above-mentioned challenges. This bottom-up methodology entails the representation of component or sub-system geometries as matrices of points in 3 D space. These typically large matrices are reduced using minimal convex sets or convex hulls. This reduction leads to significant gains in collision detection speed at minimal approximation expense. (The Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm is used for collision detection purposes in this methodology.) Once the components are laid out, their collective convex hull (from here on out referred to as the super-hull) is used to approximate the <b>inner</b> <b>mold</b> <b>line</b> of the minimum enclosing envelope of the vehicle concept. A sectional slicing algorithm is used to extract the sectional dimensions of this envelope. An offset is added to these dimensions in order {{to come up with the}} sectional fuselage dimensions. Once the lift and control surfaces are added, vehicle level objective functions can be evaluated and compared to other designs. For each design, changes in the super-hull dimensions in response to perturbations in requirements can be tracked and regressed to create custom geometric scaling laws. The regressions are based on dimensionally consistent parameter groups in order to come up with dimensionally consistent and thus physically meaningful laws. CESM enables the designer to maintain design freedom by portably carrying multiple designs deeper into the design process. Also since CESM is a bottom-up approach, all proposed baseline concepts are implicitly volumetrically feasible. Furthermore the scaling laws developed from custom data for each concept are subject to less design noise than say, regression based approaches. Through these laws, key physics-based characteristics of vehicle subsystems such as energy density can be mapped onto key system level metrics such as fuselage volume or take-off gross weight. These laws can then substitute some historical-data based analyses thereby improving the fidelity of the analyses and reducing design time. Ph. D.

40|$|ABSTRACT Many {{physiological}} factors, such as spinal elongation, fluid shifts, bone atrophy, {{and muscle}} loss, occur during an {{exposure to a}} microgravity environment. Spinal elongation {{is just one of}} the factors that can also affect the safety and performance of a crewmember while in space. Spinal elongation occurs due to the lack of gravity/compression on the spinal column. This allows for the straightening of the natural spinal curve. There is a possible fluid shift in the inter-vertebral disks that may also result in changes in height. This study aims at collecting the overall change in seated height for crewmembers exposed to a microgravity environment. During previous Programs, Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) and Skylab, spinal elongation data was collected from a small number of subjects in a standing posture but were limited in scope. Data from these studies indicated a quick increase in stature during the first few days of weightlessness, after which stature growth reached a plateau resulting in up to a 3 % increase of the original measurement [1 - 5]. However, this data was collected only for crewmembers in standing posture and not in a seated posture. Seated height may have a different effect than standing height due to a change in posture as well as due to a compounded effect of wearing restraints and a potential compression of the gluteal area. Seated height was deemed as a critical measurement in the design of the Constellation Program s (CxP) Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), called Orion which is now the point-of-departure vehicle for the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Program; therefore a better understanding of the effects of microgravity on seated height is necessary. Potential changes in seated height that may not have impacted crew accommodation in previous Programs will have significant effects on crew accommodation due to the layout of seats in the Orion [...] The current and existing configuration is such that the four crewmembers are stacked two by two with the commander and pilot seats on the top and the two remaining seats underneath, thereby limiting the amount of clearance for the crewmembers seated in the bottom seat. The <b>inner</b> <b>mold</b> <b>line</b> of these types of vehicles are fixed due to other design constraints; therefore, it is essential that all seats incorporate additional clearance to account for adequate spinal growth thereby ensuring that the crew can safely ingress the seat and be strapped in prior to its return to earth. If there is not enough clearance to account for spinal growth deltas between seats then there is the potential that crewmembers will not be able to comfortably and safely fit into their seats. The crewmember in the bottom stacked seat may even have negative clearance with the seat above him or her which could lead to potential ingress/egress issues or potentially injury of the crewmember during landing. These impacts are specific to these types of vehicles with stacked seat configuration. Without proper knowledge of the amount of spinal elongation, or growth, which occurs due to microgravity and space flight, the design of future vehicle(s) or suits may cause injury, discomfort, and limit crew accommodation and crew complements. The experiment primarily aimed to collect seated height data for subjects exposed to microgravity environments, and feed new information regarding the effect of elongation of the spine forward into the design of the Orion. The data collected during the experiment included, two seated height measurement and two digital pictures of seated height pre-, in-, and post-flight. In addition to seated height, crewmembers had an optional task of collecting stature, standing height. Seated height data was obtained from 29 crewmembers that included 8 ISS increment crew (2 females and 6 males) and 21 Shuttle crew (1 female, 20 males), and whose mean age was 48 years (4 years). This study utilized the last six Shuttle flights, STS- 128 to STS- 134. The results show that partipating crewmembers experienced growth up to 6 % in seated height and up to 3 % in stature. Based on the worst case statistical analysis of the subject data, the recommended seated height growth of 6 % will be provided to the designers as the necessary seated height adjustment...|$|E
