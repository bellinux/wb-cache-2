Hence, extrapolating between genome function of teleosts and human or even between different fish species is difficult. We have sequenced and analyzed Hox <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> of the Senegal bichir (Polypterus senegalus), an extant {{representative of the}} most basal actinopterygian lineage. Bichir possesses four Hox <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> (A, B, C, D); phylogenetic analysis supports their orthology to the four Hox <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> of the gnathostome ancestor. We have generated a comprehensive database of conserved Hox noncoding sequences that include cartilaginous, lobe-finned, and ray-finned fishes (bichir and teleosts). Our analysis identified putative and known Hox cis-regulatory sequences with differing depths of conservation in Gnathostoma. We found that although bichir possesses four Hox <b>gene</b> <b>clusters,</b> its pattern of conservation of n oncoding sequences is mosaic between outgroups, such as human, coelacanth, and shark, with four Hox <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> and teleosts, such as zebrafish and pufferfish, with seven or eight Hox <b>gene</b> <b>clusters.</b> Notably, bichir Hox <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> have been invaded by DNA transposons and this trend is further exemplified in teleosts, suggesting an as yet unrecognized mechanism of genome evolution that may explain Hox cluster plasticity in actinopterygians.

5|$|The mouse {{reference}} genome has {{at least}} 21 distinct Mup genes (with open reading frames), and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with reading frames disrupted by a nonsense mutation or an incomplete gene duplication). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups, and 15 central Class B Mups. The central Class B Mup <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> formed {{through a number of}} sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means {{they are likely to be}} unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more different from each other and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> is one of the few parts of the mouse whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.|$|E

The <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> for these galactose-initiated appear to have entered S. enterica since its divergence from E. coli, but sequence comparisons show {{that much of the}} diversification occurred long before this.

In contrast the more common pattern of O-antigen diversity within a species is for there to be only a few cases of strains having related <b>gene</b> <b>clusters,</b> suggesting that diversity arose through gain of individual O-antigen <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> by lateral <b>gene</b> transfer, and under these circumstances the evolution of the diversity is not accessible.

The transcriptional expression of these genes is often cooperatively regulated by a transcription factor located inside or close to a cluster. Most of the secondary metabolism biosynthesis (SMB) <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> identified to date contain so-called core genes with distinctive sequence features, such as polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Recent efforts in sequencing fungal genomes have revealed far more SMB <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> than expected {{based on the number}} of core genes in the genomes. Several bioinformatics tools have been developed to survey SMB <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> using the sequence motif information of the core genes, including SMURF and antiSMASH. More recently, accompanied by the development of sequencing techniques allowing to obtain large-scale genomic and transcriptomic data, motif-independent prediction methods of SMB <b>gene</b> <b>clusters,</b> including MIDDAS-M, have been developed. Most these methods detect the clusters in which the genes are cooperatively regulated at transcriptional levels, thus allowing the identification of novel SMB <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> regardless of the presence of the core genes. Another type of the method, MIPS-CG, uses the characteristics of SMB genes, which are highly enriched in non-syntenic blocks (NSBs), enabling the prediction even without transcriptome data although the results have not been evaluated in detail. Considering that large portion of SMB <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> might be sufficiently expressed only in limited uncommon conditions, it seems that prediction of SMB <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> by bioinformatics and successive experimental validation is an only way to efficiently uncover hidden SMB <b>gene</b> <b>clusters.</b> Here, we describe and discuss possible novel approaches for the determination of SMB <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> that have not been identified using conventional methods...|$|R

AFLP-based studies using crosses between strains of the endophyte, Epichloë festucae, that differ in the capacity to produce lolines, show that loline production and protection of the grass, Lolium giganteum, from feeding by the aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, segregate in a Mendelian fashion. The presence of a single locus for loline production was later confirmed by the finding that loline-producing epichloae endophytes contain a <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> (LOL cluster) of at least eleven genes. The LOL genes are greatly and coordinately upregulated during loline alkaloid production, and experimental genetic tests involving manipulation of selected LOL genes by RNA interference and gene knockout have directly confirmed the involvement {{of two of the}} LOL genes in loline biosynthesis. These tests and similarities in the peptide sequences of the proteins encoded by these genes to known enzymes indicate that one gene, termed lolC, is likely required for the first step in loline biosynthesis (condensation of L-proline and L-homoserine for NACPP formation), and another gene, lolP —likely encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase—, for oxygenation of one methyl group on the C-1 amine of N-methylloline, which gives the most abundant loline in many grass–endophyte symbiota, N-formylloline.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Schmidtke {{and colleagues}} showed that isozyme {{complexity}} {{is similar in}} amphioxus and tunicates, contradicting a prediction of Ohno's hypothesis that genome duplication occurred in the common ancestor of amphioxus and vertebrates. However, this analysis did not examine vertebrates, so could say nothing about later duplication events. (Furthermore, much later molecular phylogenetics has shown that vertebrates are {{more closely related to}} tunicates than to amphioxus, thus negating the logic of this analysis.) The 2R hypothesis saw a resurgence of interest in the 1990s for two reasons. First, gene mapping data in humans and mice revealed extensive paralogy regions - sets of genes on one chromosome related to sets of genes on another chromosome in the same species, indicative of duplication events in evolution. Paralogy regions were generally in sets of four. Second, cloning of Hox genes in amphioxus revealed presence of a single Hox <b>gene</b> <b>cluster,</b> in contrast to the four clusters in humans and mice. Data from additional gene families revealed a common one-to-many rule when amphioxus and vertebrate genes were compared.
