Max Martin, who produced Spears' debut single [...] "...Baby One More Time", produced [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] for the album. The Outsyders, an Atlanta-based production team, produced the album's first single, while Fernando Garibay worked on two bonus songs for Spears. Danja reported that he worked on the tracks at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, and Spears recorded them at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank; the Canadian trio Let's Go to War co-wrote and produced the track [...] "Mmm Papi". Lil Jon, Rodney Jerkins, Sean Garrett, and Taio Cruz announced they were working with Spears, though their songs weren't included on the official track listing.|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} fifth season of The X-Files, series creator Chris Carter noted, [...] "we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be hitting these very {{dramatic}} marks {{which were the}} mythology episodes, {{and we wanted to}} lighten, or leaven, the season with quirky episodes." [...] Carter wanted to write a Frankenstein-inspired episode, but found it difficult to reconcile Mary Shelley's unbelievable tale with the style of the show. To achieve his vision, he wrote a script that blurred the real world with the X-Files reality and that had a distinct fantasy element. Carter combined elements of the original story with fairy tales and elements of folk tales. In order to make the episode [...] "as moving" [...] as possible, Carter sought to echo elements of James Whale's 1931 film version of Frankenstein. He later noted that, by [...] "using modern science, I took an old style, which is black and white, and an old approach, which is a kind of James Whale approach to science fiction, {{and came up with a}} story about a love-lorn monster".|$|E
500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, {{what they did}} that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E

500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album cover}} was {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson (with Peter Curzon and Rupert Truman) – who, {{as leader of the}} group of artists known as Hipgnosis, was best known for his cover work for Pink Floyd. [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to set this idea of the eternal flame, the graphic flame, in Lanzarote, a volcanic island, since volcanoes suited the brooding menace of Audioslave," [...] Thorgerson recalled. An unreleased version of the cover, shot elsewhere at the same location, features a naked man looking at the flame. [...] "We so nearly used it," [...] said Thorgerson, [...] "but we were not entirely sure of the nude figure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on Ulver’s evolution, Rygg said, [...] "I don't {{think anyone}} will be surprised. The shock value is gone, I think it went away with Metamorphosis. Since then, the changes haven't been {{fundamental}} at all.” Continuing, “I think the shapeshifting story {{is one that}} has been greatly exaggerated by the media. There have been a couple of twists and turns after the Blake record, that's granted, but nothing too significant. I see Ulver as having a part one and a part two. And that's a division that we already had in our minds before those first three albums were even finished. We already <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> somewhere else after Nattens madrigal. Due to logistics, we had to wait almost two years until that one got released, and in the interim we had amassed a huge array of influences. We were out of our teens and our outlook was becoming more complex." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It won't do to let 'em <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to {{look for}} a mine," [...] he explained, in private. [...] "If we did that, we'd have a crowd at our heels in no time." ...|$|R
2500|$|Alamo Drafthouse {{is famous}} for {{enforcing}} a strict policy on behavior while in the theater. Children {{under the age of}} two are not allowed except for showings on specific days which are designated [...] "Alamo For All" [...] showings where parents are encouraged to bring young children and rules around talking are relaxed. Unaccompanied minors are not allowed in showings, except for members of the Alamo Drafthouse's Victory Vanguard rewards program, which allows 15-17 year olds to attend showings unattended after their application to the rewards program has been submitted and reviewed. The application involves demonstrating an understanding of the theater's policies around talking, texting, arriving to the theater late, and basic tipping etiquette. The cinema also prohibits talking and texting during the film. Anyone who violates this policy is subject to warning and potential removal from the premises. Alamo made national headlines in 2011 when the rantings of one angry customer who was ejected for texting were included in its [...] "Don't Talk or Text" [...] PSA shown before films. [...] "When we adopted our strict no talking policy back in 1997 we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to alienate some of our patrons," [...] Tim League posted on the cinema's website. [...] "That was the plan. If you can't change your behavior and be quiet (or unilluminated) during a movie, then we don't want you at our venue." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1954 saw Aaron {{attending}} {{spring training}} {{with the major}} league club. Although {{he was on the}} roster of its farm club, Milwaukee manager Charley Grimm later stated, [...] "From the start, he did so well I <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have to carry him." [...] On March 13, 1954, Milwaukee Braves left fielder Bobby Thomson fractured his ankle while sliding into second base during a spring training game. The next day, Aaron made his first spring training start for the Braves' major league team, playing in left field and hitting a home run. This led Hank Aaron to a major league contract, signed {{on the final day of}} spring training, and a Braves uniform with the number five. On April 13, Aaron made his major league debut and was hitless in five at-bats against the Cincinnati Reds' left-hander Joe Nuxhall. In the same game, Eddie Mathews hit two home runs, the first of a record 863 home runs the pair would hit as teammates. On April 15, Aaron collected his first major league hit, a double off Cardinals' pitcher Vic Raschi. [...] Aaron hit his first major league home run on April 23, also off Raschi. Over the next 122 games, Aaron batted [...]280 with thirteen homers before he suffered a fractured ankle on September 5. He then changed his number to 44, which would turn out to look like a [...] "lucky number" [...] for the slugger. Aaron would hit 44 home runs in four different seasons, and he hit his record-breaking 715th career home run off Dodgers pitcher Al Downing, who coincidentally also wore number 44.|$|E

5000|$|From day one Ward was Hydra in {{our minds}} ... if we felt like we needed other options, we could have changed. Here's an example of changing. <b>We</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to fall in love}} with Ruth Negga the way we did as Raina. She came in for episode five but we thought 'She's cool' and so we brought her back. So what would have been {{somebody}} else became her, and as we fell in love with her character, we wrote more and more to that. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> J. Richards <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> Deathlok but <b>we</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to care about him as much as <b>we</b> did ... <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> the kind of person we wanted to bring in as The Clairvoyant and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> wanted a mislead so we brought in Victoria Hand. The fact that Bill Paxtonworked out <b>was</b> fantastic. You're <b>going</b> to write that character in a certain way because of who the actor is, so that changes, but <b>we</b> did <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to introduce The Clairvoyant, that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to introduce he was Hydra and then use that to reveal Ward. Those <b>were</b> things <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> loosely. —Jeffrey Bell, executive producer, on the evolving nature of characters and story lines throughout the season.|$|R

60|$|All this {{happened}} at night; {{when it was}} so dark, one could not see, between the spray, the storm and the hour, {{the length of the}} craft.

Looking for the channel, was out of the question; I did not know it, in the first place; and, had I been a branch-pilot, I could not find it in the dark. I never was more completely adrift, in my life, ashore or afloat. We passed a most anxious hour, or two; the schooner driving, broadside-to, I knew not whither, or to what fate. The two blacks were frightened out of their wits; and were of no assistance to me.|$|E

6000|$|About nine o'clock, on Monday morning, the [...] "Tigris" [...] came in. When we boarded her, {{which we}} did {{almost as soon as}} the stairs had been put down her side, we found that she would make a shorter stay than usual, and would go out that evening, at high tide. So {{there was no time to}} lose. After the letters had been {{delivered}} at the hotel, and we had read ours, we sent our trunks on board, and went around to finish up Nassau. We rowed over to Hog Island, opposite the town, to see, once more, the surf roll up against the high, jagged rocks; we ran down among the negro cottages and the negro cabins to get some fruit for the trip; and we rushed about to bid good-bye to some of our old friends--Poqua-dilla among them.
