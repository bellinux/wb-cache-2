40|$|Podzolation is the {{dominant}} soil forming process in chemical poor sandy soils. It iswell studied howiron concentrations of podzols are effected by translocation of active iron fromeluvial to illuvial horizons and leaching to the aquifer. Iron stocks of Podzols, in contrasts, have not been widely studied for comparison purposes of individual soil horizons or between soils. In this study we provide {{an analysis of the}} iron stocks for two buried Podzols developed in Late-Glacial aeolian coversands. Chemical analyses of the active and immobile iron fractions in each of the horizons in both profiles showthatmore iron has been involved in the podzolation process, than the amount which can be derived by chemicalweathering ofminerals in the overlying soil horizons. This deficit in endogenic iron therefore requires exogenic enrichment to explain the observed iron concentrations during podzolation. The contribution of exogenic iron was studied using micrometeorites as a proxy for atmospheric deposition. These particles of cosmic origins are part of a continuous flux of iron-rich materials into the Earth's atmosphere and they are deposited over time on every square meter of land surface. Their extraction from ectorganic <b>F</b> <b>horizon</b> of initial Podzols helped illustrate that atmospheric deposition in the form of aerosol and aeolian (e. g. Sahara) dust, micrometeorites and other hydrolysable particles are a relevant iron contribution in soil development. The requisite active iron for podzolation can therefore be derived from chemical weathering of atmospheric iron sources in the acidic soil environment...|$|E
40|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) is operationally defined as soluble/colloidal {{material}} {{passing through a}} 0. 45 mum filter paper. The importance of DOM in soils relies on its role in soil formation and weathering processes, plant and microbial assimilation and soil and water acidification. However, the scientific community studying DOM still disagrees on whether fresh or humified material is {{the major source of}} DOM within the forest floor. One of the factors that could influence the overall importance of DOM production by organic horizons is its potential for biodegradability. In addition, the interaction occurring between the nutrients (i. e. nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)) and carbon (C) substrate is believed to be of major importance. To acquire more knowledge on the production and biodegradation of dissolved C, N and P during decomposition of organic matter (OM), I performed laboratory incubations to evaluate rates of production and transformation, the influence of the degree of OM decomposition and stand type on these rates, and the stoichiometric relationships of the different quotients during the incubations. First, I performed a 30 -day incubation of coniferous and deciduous OM from 10 Canadian forest floors representing various degrees of OM decomposition and subsequently measured the amount of: dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), nitrate (NO 3 -N), ammonium (NH 4 -N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), total dissolved phosphorus (TOP) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 -C). I performed water extractions with the same set of samples to evaluate the biodegradability of DOC and DON and the transformations of TDN, NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N. Fresh material produces more DOM than humified material; material in the midpoint of decomposition (<b>F</b> <b>horizon)</b> produced the largest amount of DIN. Coniferous and deciduous samples did not display different rates of DOM production, most likely because of the overshadowing effect of OM degree of decomposition. I found strong links between the organic matter and dissolved phase C and N content and C:N quotient. The biodegradation, measured as DOC disappearance and mineralization of CO 2 -C, showed a discrepancy, reflecting the importance of increasing microbial biomass {{at the beginning of the}} incubation in response to priming effect. The sharp decrease of TDN and DON observed in the first few days of the incubation, in addition to increasing amount of dissolved inorganic N as waste products during decomposition of DON, supports this hypothesis. A better understanding of the dynamics of dissolved C, N and P in soil is essential to further understand their role in global elemental cycles, including climate change, forest management and pollution...|$|E

40|$|Ogo 4 {{observations}} of the O I (6300 -A) emissions have revealed a global pattern hitherto undetected from the ground-based observations. It is seen that the postsunset emission of O I (6300 A) in October 1967 is very asymmetrical {{with respect to the}} geomagnetic equator in certain longitude regions and shows poor correlation with the electron density measured simultaneously from the same spacecraft. This asymmetry is less marked in the UV airglow, O I (1356 A), which appears to vary as the square of the maximum electron density in the <b>F</b> region. The <b>horizon</b> scan data of the 6300 -A airglow reveal that the latitudinal asymmetry is associated with asymmetry in the height of the O I (6300 -A) emission and hence with the altitude of the F 2 peak. From the correlative studies of the airglow and the ionospheric measurements the mechanisms of the UV and the 6300 A emissions are discussed in terms of the processes involving radiative and dissociative recombination.

Nutrient cycling was assessed by examining the forms, amounts and distribution of nutrients in components of soil and plant litter and changes in supply rates of nutrients seasonally over a two year period. A novel technique, involving in situ burial of ion exchange resin membranes (IEM) was used in the study to follow changes in supply rates of nutrient in the field and laboratory.

40|$|The {{development}} of anoxic conditions in forest litter and the relation with nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production and emission rates {{are not completely}} understood. Water content {{is an important factor}} in the regulation of N 2 O production due to its effect on the {{development of}} anoxic conditions. A combination of simulation modeling and incubation experiments was used to study (1) O 2 concentrations in water and organic matter at various water saturation fractions of inter-particle pores in Douglas fir litter (<b>F</b> 2 <b>horizon),</b> (2) the relationship between N 2 O production and moisture content of litter and (3) to test whether diffusion constraints of nitrate (NO 3 ¿) could have explained measured N 2 O production rates within litter fragments. Model simulations showed that the occurrence of high N 2 O production rates in samples with extremely high water contents coincided with the development of anoxic conditions in water-filled inter-particle pores. Measured N 2 O production rates started to increase exponentially after 1 ¿ 2 days in glucose-amended samples, during which substantial microbial growth was established. For these latter samples model simulations showed that the increase in O 2 consumption due to microbial growth lead to anoxic conditions in water-filled pores at locations which were far from the O 2 saturated air-filled pores. It was concluded that anoxic conditions in water-filled pores was the crucial factor for the development of high N 2 O production rates. Diffusion limitation of NO 3 ¿ and glucose were estimated to be negligible in the highly fragmented litter material used. The occurrence of diffusion limitation depended on litter particle size, the NO 3 ¿ reduction potential and the NO 3 ¿ concentration. Therefore, diffusion limitation together with N 2 O production in litter cannot be neglected under field conditions with a low NO 3 ¿ concentration or a high NO 3 ¿ reduction potential...|$|R

On average 271 C/ha, or 62 % of carbon present before burning (excluding that contained in stumps, roots, and mineral soil), was lost to the atmosphere {{as a result of}} slash burns at the four P. radiata sites. AttheP. contorta site 33 tC/ha, or 48 % of carbon present before burning (excluding that contained in stumps, roots, and mineral soil), was lost to the atmosphere as a result of slash burning. Duff (<b>F</b> and H <b>horizons),</b> litter (L horizon), and sound woody material exceeding 7 cm in diameter were the components that contributed most to this loss. Total carbon loss in New Zealand due to burning of plantation forest logging slash was estimated to be 10 300 tonnes/year (s. e. = 1800) for P. radiata and 1600 tonnes/year (s. e. = 1160) for P. contorta. Relationships between carbon loss from individual sites and the specific codes and indices of the Canadian Fire Weather Index System were examined. The best predictor of carbon loss was the Fire Weather Index itself.

40|$|In {{some kinds}} of {{classical}} dilaton theory there exist black holes with (i) infinite horizon area A or infinite F (the coefficient at curvature in Lagrangian) and (ii) zero Hawking temperature T_H. For a generic static black hole, without an assumption about spherical symmetry, we show that infinite A is compatible with a regularity of geometry in the case T_H= 0 only. We {{also point out that}} infinite T_H is incompatible with the regularity of a horizon of a generic static black hole, both for finite or infinite A. Direct application of the standard Euclidean approach {{in the case of an}} infinite "effective" area of the horizon A_eff=AF leads to inconsistencies in the variational principle and gives for a black hole entropy S an indefinite expression, formally proportional to T_HA_eff. We show that treating a horizon as an additional boundary (that is, adding to the action some terms calculated on the horizon) may restore self-consistency of the variational procedure, if <b>F</b> near the <b>horizon</b> grows not too rapidly. We apply this approach to Brans-Dicke black holes and obtain the same answer S= 0 as for "usual" (for example, Reissner-Nordström) extreme classical black holes. We also consider the exact solution for a conformal coupling, when A is finite but F diverges and find that in the latter case both the standard and modified approach give rise to an infinite action. Thus, this solution represents a rare exception of a black hole without nontrivial thermal properties. Comment: 24 pages. Accepted for publication in Class. Quant. Gra...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDynamics of C and N {{in forest}} soils in the Nutrient Cycling and Soil Acidification Model (NUCSAM) are {{described}} by the transformation and decomposition of three organic matter compartments, litter, fermented material and humic material. These three compartments are allocated to the morphological distinguishable L, <b>F</b> and H <b>horizons</b> of the organic layer. Changes in the pools of these organic compartments are described with first order equations for decomposition and transformation. Rate constants for decomposition and transformation were derived by calibrating the model to measured organic matter pools in organic layers of a chrono-sequence of five first succession Scots pine stands between 15 and 120 years old. Simulated pools of organic matter in the organic layers were in agreement with measured pools in the five pine stands, except for the first thirty years of the H-horizon. During this period, an increase in organic matter in the H horizon was simulated while no H horizons were observed in the field. The simulated total pool of organic matter in the organic layer agreed well with values from a field inventory in 20 other Scots pine stands, but the simulated distribution over the three horizons differed from the field measurements which varied among sites. For the Scots pine stands the model was able to simulate the organic matter accumulation in the top 40 -cm of the mineral soil; derived almost completely from fine root turnover. The accumulated pool of nitrogen in the organic layer was in agreement with measured pools for the oldest Scots pine stand but was too high for the younger stands. Especially, the accumulation of N in the F-horizon was too fast, presumably due to an overestimated retention of nitrogen...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Clay veins {{are present}} in deep {{weathering}} profiles in basic and ultra-basic rock beneath glacial drift at two localities on the Island of Rhum, Inverness-shire. Veins at one section are of saponite, at the other of the serpentine mineral, lizardite, with subordinate saponite. It is suggested that the veins were substantially formed during the interglacial period of development ofthe weathering profile, and that the lizardite formed in the lower horizons is replaced by saponite in the more intensely weathered upper <b>horizons.</b> <b>F</b> IELD EV IDENCE Rhum, in the parish of the Small isles, off Mallaig, Inverness-shire, {{on the west coast}} of Scotland, is a National Nature Reserve*. During soil studies carried out on the island, deep sections were examined in weathered basic and ultra-basic igneous rock beneath glacial dr i f t at two sites. The first (Section 1), near the head of Ki lmory Glen (NM 363009), is in gabbro, the second (Section 2), {{at the site of the}} Salisbury Dam (NM 364997) near the watershed of the Kilmory, Kinloch and Harris glens, is in peridotite. The weathering profile seen in these sections is discussed elsewhere (Ball, 1964). This profile has a red central zone, more intensely weathered than those above or below. Remnants of this red horizon remain at Section 2 and it is well preserved at Section 1. Weathering was dominantly physical rather than chemical and probably took place under a relatively hot, dry climate prior to the late-stage glaciation. Post-glacial weathering of basic and ultra-basic rocks on Rhum has been less intense and no other comparable profiles have been seen. Within the weathered rock, which retains its original fabric, are veins and small lenses of clay, the veins being generally vertical although they have no precise or regular orientation.

In 2007, squares L'XXIV, M'XXIV, M'XXIH and M'XXII, which were investigated in 2005 to the horizon c, dated {{to the end of the}} 5 th and the beginning of the 6 th centuries, were completely excavated to the level of the porch of the earlier fortification of Romuliana (Plan 1). The stratigraphy of the cultural layers in these squares is as follows (Fig. 1) : Below horizon c there is a layer of construction rubble mixed with brownish-yellow, clay like, sandy soil, 50 - 75 cm thick, comprising the finds dated in the last quarter of the 4 th- 5 th centuries, layer D; The level of layer D is horizon d, where a structure destroyed in a conflagration, house 1 / 07, was discovered in squares M'XXII and M'XXIII. It could be dated, on the basis of the preserved household (pottery, metal and antler items, coins, etc.), from the last quarter of the 4 th to the middle of the 5 th century; Horizon d 1 is a mortar floor discovered beneath horizon d, which presents the earlier phase of house 1 / 07; Horizon d 2 is the earliest mortar floor inside the house 1 / 07, covered with a later mortar floor (horizon d 1) and a levelling layer of yellow sand and gravel, which comprises the finds dating also to the last quarter of the 4 th to the middle of the 5 th centuries; Layer E, 15 - 40 cm thick, is below horizon d, comprising dark brown soil with rubble and lenses of soot at the bottom, together with finds dated to the second half of the 4 th century; Horizon e is covered with layer E, and spread across all the squares which were investigated to the south and to the east of Galerius' bath, where 8 large postholes, which outlined a space 7 x 3 m large and probably some kind of porch, were found along with two furnaces and two pits; Layer F, about 30 cm thick, is the substructure of horizon e and it comprises crushed stone and pebbles mixed with lime mortar, and in places has a levelling of reddish-brown sand. Finds here were dated to the end of the 3 rd and the first half of the 4 th centuries; <b>Horizon</b> <b>f</b> is a mortar floor of the later fortification of Felix Romuliana at a level of 184. 75 m in the west and 184. 55 m in the east (an average level of 184. 64 m), which was interrupted by a trench running in an east-west direction along the southern section of squares L'-M'XXIV. The trench was filled with soot, small rubble and reddish-brown sand and comprised a large amount of artifacts, such as pottery and glass fragments, metal and bone items and coins dated to the second half of the 3 rd century (Fig. 4). Layer G consists of dark brown and yellowish-brown clay with small rubble and soot. It was a levelling layer above the intense construction rubble from the previous horizon and a substructure of <b>horizon</b> <b>f.</b> This layer comprised archaeological finds dated to the end of the 3 rd and the first half of the 4 th centuries and to the prehistoric period (Early Iron Age); Horizon g is a mortar floor of the porch of the southern and eastern rampart of the earlier fortification of Romuliana. 4 pillars of the eastern porch (pillars 1 - 4, discovered in 2004 - 2005), a corner pillar in an L-shape (pillar 5) and one pillar of the southern porch (pillar 6) have been ascertained. From this level the water and sewage canals were dug (Fig. 5). In squares K'XXII-XXIII a trench, measuring 4 x 2 m, in an east-west direction, was opened which aimed to investigate the layers beneath the Roman horizon g. The stratigraphy in this trench is as follows: - Layer G at a level of about 184. 53 m; - Layer H, about 35 cm thick, is greenish-yellow clay in which Roman canals were buried, comprising the fragments of the Early and Late Iron Age pottery and fragments of reddish rammed earth (Fig. 2); Layer I, about 20 cm thick, is greenish-brown clay, comprising the scarce fragments of the Early and Late Iron Age pottery; Virgin soil consists of yellow clay starting from a level of 184. 00 m in the west and of 183. 60 m in the east. In 2008, the remains of an earlier building were discovered beneath the floor of the apodyterium of Galerius' bath found in 2002 and below the foundation of the sudatorium and the tepidarium of the same structure, which were found in 2005. Also, for the purposes of conservation and restoration of the thermae, an apsidal room next to the west wall of the apodyterium, so called 'Galerius' dressing room', was completely filled with construction rubble, among which was found a part of an abraded vault (Fig. 6). Excavations proved that the apsidal room had been a pool with cold water, a frigidarium, which was twice renovated and was decorated with mosaic made of black, white and grey stone cubes (Fig. 7). The phases of reconstruction of the frigidarium could also be noticed in its eastern wall (Fig. 8). Also in the rubble inside the pool, glass mosaic cubes of deep blue and golden colours were discovered, indicating the decoration of the vault. In the latest phase, two pillars were constructed to carry the stairs made of stone slabs (Fig. 8). The earliest phase of this room, which had a rectangular layout and a mortar floor, could be part of the building dating back to before Galerius' bath (Plan 2). During the cleaning of the eastern wall of the frigidarium, a semicircular niche with a fresco decoration of geometrical and figural motives, painted in black, dark red, orange and blue on an ochre surface, was discovered (Fig. 3). Under Galerius' bath, a large earlier building was investigated (trenches 1 - 5 / 08). Only its foundation zone is preserved. The walls of the Imperial bath were founded on the earlier walls, which were 0. 65 m thick and had foundations which were 0. 90 m thick (Plan 2). The pilaster of the west faeade of the thermae was also founded on the earlier wall, but it destroyed a water canal (canal A discovered inside the south room of Galerius' bath in 2004), which was constructed after the earlier structure and before the Imperial bath (Fig. 9). It is interesting that the part of the earlier building to the west of the thermae was not demolished during the construction of the Imperial residence. It was adapted and incorporated into the plan of the fortified palace. The original construction was a large public building, probably theprincipia, with a row of rooms around a large courtyard, the atrium. The entrance, which had a porch and a pylon with two square towers and thresholds made of stone slabs, was in the north. (Figs. 10 - 14) Previously, this building was mistakenly dated to the 4 th- 5 th centuries, because it had been reused in Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods. (Figs. 15 - 18) However, based on the results of the new research, it could be dated to the 3 rd century. ...|$|R
