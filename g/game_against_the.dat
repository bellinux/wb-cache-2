On August 6, 2007, the Yankees cut relief pitcher Mike Myers and brought up Jim Brower. They had just completed a season sweep of the Cleveland Indians, winning all 6 <b>games</b> they played <b>against</b> them in 2007. This was a good start to the Yankees' upcoming tough schedule, where they played 17 games out of a 20-game span against playoff contenders. This included 8 <b>games</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Detroit Tigers (4 at home, 4 at Detroit), 3 <b>games</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland Indians, 3 <b>games</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and 3 <b>games</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Boston Red Sox.|$|R

5|$|After {{signing a}} one-year NHL {{contract}} with Boston in August 2005, {{he appeared in}} his first NHL training camp in September 2005.

5|$|Croyle {{started his}} first home game at Arrowhead Stadium on November 25 against the Oakland Raiders, but injured {{his back in}} the 20–17 loss. The injury sidelined Croyle for the {{following}} week's <b>game</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> San Diego Chargers, and Damon Huard started in Croyle's place. The injured quarterbacks continued to rotate playing time, and Croyle was again declared the starter for Kansas City's <b>game</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Denver Broncos on December 9. The plan, barring injury, was for Croyle to start the remaining games of the 2007 season, so that coach Herm Edwards and his staff could better evaluate him moving forward into 2008. However, Croyle bruised his hand while trying to stop a defender from running an interception in for a touchdown and Damon Huard, who was the only active quarterback on the Chiefs' roster besides Croyle, filled in {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E

5|$|Davis {{improved}} as a blocker in {{his second}} season with the Eagles. At the start of training camp in 1992, Davis vowed to refuse all requests for interviews by the media in an attempt to focus on getting better. In the season-opener against the New Orleans Saints, Davis helped the Eagles lead the NFC in rushing for the week with 186yards. Against the Washington Redskins in week seven on October 18, 1992, he suffered a knee sprain after quarterback Randall Cunningham ran into him. He was listed as doubtful before the following <b>game</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Phoenix Cardinals, and did not play in the game. He was listed as doubtful again before the <b>game</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Dallas Cowboys in week nine. Otho Davis, the team's head athletic trainer, said Davis was not working hard enough to rehabilitate his knee. Antone Davis was upgraded to questionable two days before the game, and started against the Cowboys on November 1. In the wild card playoff <b>game</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Saints on January 3, 1993, Davis gave up a sack against Rickey Jackson, which caused a Cunningham fumble. Davis started in all 15 games he played during the regular season, and started in both of the team's playoff games. Pro Football Weekly rated Davis as the 26th-best offensive tackle in the league for the season.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{completed}} {{one of five}} {{passes for}} 15yards in his first professional <b>game</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Houston Oilers after coming in for Spurrier late in the game.

In that game, Dickinson again came into the game, rushing three times for 54yards and throwing an interception that was returned by Tom Hayes for a touchdown. He did not play against the Buffalo Bills the following week, but Spurrier ended up getting injured, meaning that Dickinson was slated to possibly get his first NFL start against the Baltimore Colts. Spurrier ended up starting the game, but Dickinson did see playing time against the Colts, completing one of five passes for 12yards and throwing an interception in a 4217 loss; he attempted only one pass the following week in a <b>game</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Cincinnati Bengals.|$|E
