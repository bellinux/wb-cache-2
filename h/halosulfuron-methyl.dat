40|$|Bentazon, applied as a tankmix, {{has been}} shown to have the {{potential}} for reducing the injury from some POST herbicides. Field experiments were conducted in 2008 and 2009 at Exeter, ON and in 2009 at Ridgetown, ON to determine if the addition of bentazon reduces the injury from cloransulam-methyl or <b>halosulfuron-methyl</b> applied POST in black, cranberry, kidney and white beans. Bentazon added to cloransulam-methyl reduced the level of injury 0 to 6 % at 17. 5 g·ai·ha– 1 and 0 to 9 % at 35 g·ai·ha– 1 in dry bean. Bentazon added to <b>halosulfuron-methyl</b> reduced the level of injury as much as 4 % at 35 g·ai·ha– 1 and 6 % at the 70 g·ai·ha– 1 . Bentazon added to cloransulam-methyl increased plant height as much as 3 cm. The addition of bentazon to <b>halosulfuron-methyl</b> had no effect on the height of various market classes of dry bean. Bentazon added to cloran-sulam-methyl generally has no effect on seed moisture content in black and white bean but decreased seed moisture content of cranberry and kidney bean as much as 4 %. The addition of bentazon to <b>halosulfuron-methyl</b> caused no effect on seed moisture content of dry bean. Cloransulam-methyl caused a 7 % to 18 % reduction in dry bean yield compared to <b>halosulfuron-methyl</b> and 12 % to 21 % reduction in yield compared to bentazon. Bentazon added to cloransulam-methyl increased dry bean yield by 0. 16 and 0. 31 t·ha– 1 at Exeter (2009) and Ridgetown (2009) respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the weed management with herbicides applied in pre and postemergence on castor crop. The treatments were constituted by management systems using herbicides in pre (PRE) and postemergence (POS) : 1) S-metolachlor at 576 g ha- 1 (PRE 1) and chlorimuron-methyl at 15 g ha- 1 (POS 1); 2) PRE 1 + clomazone at 650 g ha- 1 (PRE 2) and POS 1; 3) PRE 1, POS 1 and <b>halosulfuron-methyl</b> at 112. 5 g ha- 1 (POS 2); 4) PRE 1, POS 1 and ethoxysulfuron at 60 g ha- 1 (POS 3); 5) PRE 1, POS 1 and ethoxysulfuron at 120 g ha- 1 (POS 4); 6) PRE 1 + PRE 2, POS 1 and POS 2; 7) PRE 1 + PRE 2, POS 1 and POS 3; 8) PRE 1 + PRE 2, POS 1 and POS 4; 9) hand-hoeing control and 10) non-weeded control. The experimental design was randomized blocks with four replications. The association of the herbicides in PRE combined to sequence applications of chlorimuron-ethyl and <b>halosulfuron-methyl</b> or ethoxysulfuron in POS resulted in the highest control levels of Richardia scabraand Cyperus ferax. Mild phytointoxication symptoms to the crop were more persistent with ethoxysulfuron at 120 g ha- 1. The acceptable control of the weed species and similar yield to the hand-hoeing control permitted to conclude that S-metolachlor + clomazone PRE, followed by chlorimuron-ethyl and <b>halosulfuron-methyl</b> POS {{proved to be more}} adequate as a weed management strategy on castor crop...|$|E
40|$|There are {{currently}} limited {{options for the}} control of the invasive tropical perennial sedge 'Cyperus aromaticus' (Ridley) Mattf. and Kukenth (Navua sedge). The potential for <b>halosulfuron-methyl</b> as a selective herbicide for Navua sedge control in tropical pastures was investigated by undertaking successive field and shade house experiments in North Queensland, Australia. <b>Halosulfuron-methyl</b> and adjuvant rates, and combinations with other herbicides, were examined to identify a herbicide regime that most effectively reduced Navua sedge. Our research indicated that combining halosulfuron- methyl with other herbicides did not improve efficacy for Navua sedge control. We also identified that low rates of <b>halosulfuron-methyl</b> (25 g ha- 1 a. i.) were just as effective as higher rates (73 g ha- 1 a. i.) at controlling the sedge, and that this control relied on the addition of the adjuvant Bonza at the recommended concentration (1 % of the spray volume). Pot trials in the controlled environment of the shade house achieved total mortality under these regimes. Field trials demonstrated more variable results with reductions in Navua sedge ranging between 40 - 95 % at 8 - 10 weeks after treatment. After this period (16 - 24 weeks after treatment), regrowth of sedge, either from newly germinated seed, or of small plants protected from initial treatment, indicated sedge populations can rapidly increase to levels similar to pre-application, depending on the location and climatic conditions. Such variable results highlight the need for concerted monitoring of pastures to identify optimal treatment times. Ideally, initial treatment should be done when the sedge is healthy and actively growing, with follow up-treatments applied when new seed heads are produced from regrowth...|$|E
40|$|Adequate {{weed control}} in {{pumpkins}} and squash {{is one of}} the most difficult practices for growers to obtain whether it is in a reduced-tillage system or conventional bare ground culture. Reduced-till pumpkin trials established in Albany County this year to evaluate a new post emergent herbicide called Sandea (<b>halosulfuron-methyl,</b> Gowan Company) were established. However, a poor stand of rye and high populations of perennial weeds not controlled with Round-Up applications, resulted in poor pumpkin establishment and poor annual weed control using Sandea. The cover crop trial to be established at the Valatie Research farm also had its share of problems. Due to the late funding of this IPM project, planting of spring oats was not able to be completed, the triticale plots were plowed and it was determined that there was not enough sorghum sudangrass residue to complete that treatment either. However, a bare ground winter squash trial comparing the effects of Sandea on transplant cell size, squash type and different varieties within a type was established...|$|E
40|$|Cyperus esculentus L. causes {{high yield}} losses in many crops worldwide. In Switzerland it was {{observed}} {{for the first time}} about 30 years ago. Since then it has become a serious weed in several regions - especially where vegetables are produced. Growing vegetables in heavily infested fields should be abandoned due to their low competitiveness and the lack of available, effective herbicides. Contrarily, in maize several herbicides with a partial effect on C. esculentus are registered. Thus, continuous cultivation of maize including the use of the most effective herbicides against C. esculentus could help reducing infestation levels in heavily infested fields. Field trials were carried out at two sites in maize during 2011 and 2012. Different herbicide combinations, hoeing and herbicide applications combined with hoeing were the applied treatments. Split application was compared with one single application of the same amount of product. The effect of an additional, late under leaf herbicide application was determined as well. Cyperus esculentus coverage was estimated in the fields in 2011. Plots were sampled in spring 2011, autumn 2011 and autumn 2012. The Number of C. esculentus sprouts germinated from the soil samples was determined under greenhouse conditions. The most effective herbicide combination of registered active ingredients was rimsulfuron and mesotrione. Smetolachlor was effective as well, especially if combined with mechanical weed control. <b>Halosulfuron-methyl</b> applied twice provided the best C. esculentus control. Split application tended to be more effective than a single application. Control of C. esculentus could be improved considerably with an additional herbicide application in late June (under leaf). The treatments with highest C. esculentus control determined in the field trials and combinations thereof are effective treatment options for C. esculentus control in maize. These findings indicate and confirm that maize cropped for several years with intensive weed control could successfully decrease C. esculentus infestation levels in farmers’ fields...|$|E
