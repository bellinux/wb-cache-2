50|$|Several {{approaches}} {{were applied}} in microfluidics facilitating single cell trapping for single cell analysis, {{which can be}} broadly classified into contact based approach and contact-less approach. Different cell trapping methods are hydrodynamic trapping, dielectrophoresis trapping, chemical trapping, gel trapping, magnetic trapping, acoustic trapping and laser trapping. Each method has its own merits and demerits. Mostly these process requires auxiliary facilities like a pump or a pressurecontrolling system for fluid introduction and guidance, and some need specialized electronics or optical equipment which are not common in a medical or biological laboratory and induce further obstacles for operation. The auxiliary parts occupy much space and thereby greatly lowers the area density of single-cell arrays. Design structures of many microfluidic chips are complicated due to the need <b>for</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>layers,</b> channels, and valves, which are difficult to either fabricate or manipulate. Thus the practical applications in clinics or general biological laboratories are limited due to these drawbacks. Increasing demand for trapping based on the design itself, involving unsophisticated basic laboratory instruments for single cell measurements led {{to the evolution of}} hydrodynamic trapping technique. This way, cells which may be affected due to the presence of an external field/force are preserved. Apart from the simplicity of the process, the natural state of the separated particles can be useful for many kinds research. Based on the approach used, hydrodynamic trapping can be broadly classified into the contact-based and contact-less approach. Figure 1 shows the diverse approaches involved in single cell trapping. Different principal mechanisms were used in hydrodynamic trapping as shown in Figure 2. Hydrodynamic trapping mechanism includes cross-stream migration, vortices based trapping and externally controlled signal approach.|$|E
