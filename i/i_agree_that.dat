500|$|Many {{observed}} that Burton {{was more interested}} in the Joker and the art and set production design than Batman or anything else in terms of characterization and screentime. Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering Thomas and Martha Wayne; in the comic book, Joe Chill is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm said it was Burton's idea to have the Joker murder Wayne's parents. [...] "The Writer's Strike was going on, and Tim had the other writers do that. I also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave. Fans were ticked off with that, and <b>I</b> <b>agree.</b> <b>That</b> would have been Alfred's last day of employment at Wayne Manor," [...] Hamm said.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 John Ging, head of UNRWA Gaza, had {{stated that}} he was {{disappointed}} in Linday's criticisms of UNRWA for failure to resettle refugees. Ging argued that there is [...] "no basis {{to say that it}} is UNRWA's decision because our mandate is given to us. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> it is a political failure, but we don't set up the mandate, we are only the implementers".|$|E

2500|$|Tebbit privately said of John Major on 17 November 1994: [...] "He has the mulishness of a weak {{man with}} stupidity". When asked {{what would it}} take for him to support Major, Tebbit responded: [...] "Have an entirely new department, the sole job of which would be to deal with the Brussels {{machinery}} in every aspect. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> we don't want to leave the EU, but we've got to manipulate it and block every single advance we don't like. No, no, no must be his weapon. Veto everything he disapproves of or that we disapprove of".|$|E
2500|$|Morris's {{argument}} involves {{close reading}} of the pre-NLRA administrative cases, and then the successive drafts of the NLRA. ... I was not convinced. While <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the NLRB should have required employers to meet with organizations representing {{only a fraction of}} their workforce, I do not find a clear Congressional command that requires the Board to do so. Morris shows that, at several stages in the drafting process, such clear language was briefly part of the bill, but was later deleted as part of a general process of simplifying language and delegating detail to the new NLRB. Drafters similarly rejected a proposal that would clearly have restricted the duty to bargain to majority representatives. I read this history to mean that Congress delegated this issue, along with many others, to the new NLRB.|$|E
2500|$|The {{military}} investigated Cartwright in 2009 and 2010 {{for possible}} misconduct involving a female Marine captain, and investigators recommended administrative action for [...] "failure to discipline a subordinate" [...] and [...] "fostering an unduly familiar relationship". Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, however, reviewed {{the evidence and}} found it insufficient to warrant corrective action for even the lesser offenses. [...] He stated, “I {{do not agree with}} the conclusion that General Cartwright maintained an ‘unduly familiar relationship’ with his aide. [...] Nor do <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> General Cartwright’s execution of his leadership responsibilities vis-à-vis his aide or any other member of his staff was inconsistent with the leadership requirements”. [...] "uestions about how he oversaw his staff", however, were mentioned as a reason Cartwright had fallen out as favored candidate of President Obama for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2011. Army chief Gen. Martin Dempsey was named to the post. [...] "Some Republicans ... quietly criticized Gen. Cartwright, calling him 'Obama's general,'" [...] one report at the time also said.|$|E
60|$|JUNO. No: {{that was}} what was so tame about it. I wanted to suffer. You get so sick of being happily married. It's always the happy marriages that break up. At last my wife and <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> we ought to take a holiday.|$|R

'Back then, when {{we talked}} on the phone, Kevin asked if I thought his England career had ended in the right manner {{following}} the last Ashes series in Australia. <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> nobody particularly emerged with much credit from the whole episode, particularly given his achievements for England.|$|R

5000|$|The missing {{apostrophe}} in {{the title}} is deliberate. Nearly all contractions used by R.E.M. lack apostrophes, though [...] "life's" [...] {{in this case is}} a possessive.

6000|$|He {{was still}} debating the doctor's generalization. [...] "I suppose {{it would be}} true to say that I {{think of myself as}} mankind on his planet, with very {{considerable}} possibilities and with only a limited amount of fuel at his disposal to achieve them. Yes.... <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> I think in that way.... I have not thought much before {{of the way in which}} I think about things--but <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> it is in that way. Whatever enterprises mankind attempts are limited by the sum total of that store of fuel upon the planet. That is very much in my mind. Besides that he has nothing but his annual allowance of energy from the sun." ...|$|E

And <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> a woman will always pick up a small hammer instead of a big one. But the difficulty is one of physical impossibility. No woman ever born could have smashed a man's skull out flat like that." [...] Then he added reflectively, after a pause: [...] "These people haven't grasped the whole of it. The man was actually wearing an iron helmet, and the blow scattered it like broken glass. Look at that woman. Look at her arms." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> it was, and he continued: [...] "What {{are we to}} do? We did {{not create}} the {{situation}} by any outside action of ours.

60|$|He {{told me on}} {{the phone}} that night that he had made the price two {{thousand}} pounds, because he needed the money, and what was two thousand to {{a man who had been}} fleecing the widow and the orphan for forty odd years without a break?

5000|$|Sixty {{years after}} the event, Digby mused, [...] "It was just a debate. I don't know {{what all the fuss}} was about.
