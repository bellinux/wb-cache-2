40|$|A {{technique}} using <b>fresh</b> <b>feeding</b> signs as {{an index}} of density was validated and used to survey the effects of sheep grazing on vole population densities in four upland habitats in the northern Peak District National Park, UK. In grazed areas Molinia caerulea grasslands supported most voles, Nardus stricta grasslands supported fewer and Eriophorum vaginatum and Calluna vulgaris -dominated areas supported least. There were highly significant negative relationships between vole sign density and sheep numbers in these habitats. Where sheep were excluded, these same habitats had between three and nine times higher sign densities, corresponding to between 1. 5 and 2. 5 times greater field vole densities. Population estimates of voles and predators such as short-eared owl approximately doubled under reduced grazing. Reducing sheep numbers in upland areas may therefore be critical in encouraging the recovery of predatory birds in the uplands...|$|R

HM ewes showed to prefer M. leaves to hay, but their need to balance the high protein and low NDF contents of M. leaves by eating hay also emerged.

50|$|Circular {{tanks of}} 2-5 tonnes {{capacity}} {{are used to}} rear larvae from nauplius to mysis stage. The salinity of water is maintained at around 32‰ and pH at 8.2.

50|$|The fuel is {{injected}} part-way up the shaft, producing maximum temperature at this point. The <b>fresh</b> <b>feed</b> fed {{in at the}} top is first dried then heated to 800 °C, where de-carbonation begins, and proceeds progressively faster as the temperature rises. Below the burner, the hot lime transfers heat to, and is cooled by, the combustion air. A mechanical grate withdraws the lime at the bottom. A fan draws the gases through the kiln, and the level in the kiln is kept constant by adding feed through an airlock. As with batch kilns, only large, graded stone can be used, {{in order to ensure}} uniform gas-flows through the charge. The degree of burning can be adjusted by changing the rate of withdrawal of lime. Heat consumption as low as 4 MJ/kg is possible, but 4.5 to 5 MJ/kg is more typical. Due to temperature peak at the burners up to 1200 °C in a shaft kiln conditions are ideal to produce medium and hard burned lime.|$|E

40|$|Crude {{glycerol}} {{from the}} biodiesel manufacturing process is being produced in increasing quantities {{due to the}} expanding number of biodiesel plants. It has been previously shown that, in batch mode, semi-anaerobic fermentation of crude glycerol by Enterobacter aerogenes can produce biohydrogen and bioethanol simultaneously. The present study demonstrated the possible scaling-up of this process from small batches performed in small bottles to a 3. 6 -L continuous stir tank reactor (CSTR). <b>Fresh</b> <b>feed</b> rate, liquid recycling, pH, mixing speed, glycerol concentration, and waste recycling were optimized for biohydrogen and bioethanol production. Results confirmed that E. aerogenes uses small amounts of oxygen under semi-anaerobic conditions for growth before using oxygen from decomposable salts, mainly NH 4 NO 3, under anaerobic condition to produce hydrogen and ethanol. The optimal conditions were determined to be 500 rpm, pH 6. 4, 18. 5 g/L crude glycerol (15 g/L glycerol) and 33 % liquid recycling for a <b>fresh</b> <b>feed</b> rate of 0. 44 mL/min.

Building upon a rich network of existing public photographs [...] as well as <b>fresh</b> <b>feeds</b> from surveillance footage or smart phone cameras [...] these emotion algorithms require no additional infrastructure or improvements on image quality. In order to examine the potential policy and legal remedies for emotion AI as an emerging technology, we first establish a framework of actors, collection motivations, time scales, and space considerations that differentiates emotion AI from other algorithmic lenses. Each of these elements influences available policy remedies, and should shape continuing discussions on the antecedent conditions that make emotional AI acceptable or not in particular contexts. Based on our framework of unique elements, we examine potential available policy remedies to prevent or remediate harm. Specifically, our paper looks toward the regulatory role of the Federal Trade Commission in the US, gaps in the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) allowing for emotion data collection, and precedent set by polygraph technologies in evidentiary and use restrictions set by law. We also examine the way social norms and adaptations could grow to also modulate broader use.
