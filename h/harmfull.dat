During this {{theoretical}} overview I will first deal with the characterization and definition of the concept of stress and it´s effects. I will then describe each stage the symptoms and effects of stress. In my work I will also address the question of whether stress is <b>harmfull</b> and how it can be damaging to our health, specifically the <b>harmfull</b> effects and how to prevent them. This will lead me to conclude which disease is the most commonly associated with stress. A crucial part of my bachelor thesis is devoted to strategies and procedures, how to cope with stress, manage it and especially how to prevent i...|$|E

Radiation {{is defined as}} ?energy transmitted through space as waves or particles? and also determined as ?particles or waves emitted from the nucleus of unstable radioactive atoms to become stable? Mainly two types of radiation are exist; ionising radiation and non-ionising radiation. Ionising radiation is consist of alpha, beta particules, neutrons, x rays and gamma rays. Ionising radiation which can be measured by ion chambers, geiger-Mueller detectors, Scintillation Counters, fluorescent counters etc. Has <b>harmfull</b> effects on human health in levels of molecular, cellular, tissue, organs and organ systems.

40|$|The {{exploitation}} {{of natural resources}} without considering their impermanents, is <b>harmfull</b> for both the humanity and the ecosystems within which we reside. There {{is nothing wrong with}} using resources for our needs, but in doig so we must consider our future generations and their ability to prosper in the same environment as we did. In order to minimize the negative impact on the enironment we must convey the knowledge to our students at an early age, for them to develop their own opinion about the matter. To achive optimal knowledge transfer we must first determine students' current views, ideas and understanding regarding nature. To geta n insight in to current knowledge a good method is using a Venn diagram. To asses the influence of sustainable development education we chose a sample among the students of 6 th and 9 th grade elementary schools from Zasavje. The individuals were deliberately choosen from this region, it being the most polluted due to minning and industry. The subjets were asked about their stance on environmentaly friendly or <b>harmfull</b> activity, with instructions to place 13 pictures portraying different objets in to a Venn diagram. The pictures were as follows: orange. Spraying of pesticides on trees, a child with a phone, bannanas, a ciggarette butt, invasive species. Children riding bicycles, street lights, hairdresser, book, apple, power plant and a cup. The results showed children noticing <b>harmfull</b> activities more than not, but were not willing to disscus their decision. It is our opinion that by using Venn diagrams a teacher is able to get an insight in pupils' knowledge and views towardws the environment. On the basis of found knowledge gaps we can devise a study plan to better the understanding of the environmental hazzards and theirbefore help the environment...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGrowth {{is known}} to be {{dependant}} of the qualitative as well as the qualitative values of children's diet. Among forest populations, vulnerable categories, such as pregnant and lactating women, have to respect numerous food taboos which detend symbolic as well as social functions. These taboos concern numerous species rich in protein content, such as game. This assertion had upset numerous nutritionnists of the 50 - 70 ies. Some thirty years ago, although the protein factory like tropical forest showed numerous food taboos which were respected, the rate between forbidden and allowed species was high. Nevertheless, at this time, weaning was delayed and the majority of the most frequent species of the diet was not concerned. Nowadays, game is not so abounding, due to an overexploitation related to new trading behaviours. Conversely, a great number of forbidden species is no more respected. Consequently, the protein value of the diet has declined, but this <b>harmfull</b> fact has been countered by the evolution of social behaviours, such as abandoning most taboos. That is why, one can consider that the <b>harmfull</b> effect of food taboos should be considered within the global context of feeding behaviours, in other terms the ecological and social dynamics related to food availability and food choices...|$|E

The news leaked out before the show was aired and caused a mayor debate among journalists in massmedia and among the public about the legitimacy of the interview.

40|$|Tropospheric ozone is at {{elevated}} levels <b>harmfull</b> {{for human beings}} and for the eco-system. For the protection of crops and forests guidelines have been introduced {{in the form of}} Accumulated exposure Over Threshold- AOT- with a threshold of 40 ppb. This means that below 40 ppb no <b>harmfull</b> effects are expected. It should be noted that this level of 40 ppb is relatively close to the assumed natural, pre-industrial, ozone concentration at ground level which is about 10 - 15 ppb. (Volz,A and D. Kley, 1988). At the moment the ozone level in the free troposphere and the background level over the oceans is in summertime about 40 ppb (see for example Roelofs e. a. 1997). This directly means that exceedances of this threshold can be expected over large areas in Europe. The guideline for crops, AOTc, is defined over the 3 month period of may-july during daytime (defined as global radiation above 50 Wim 2, which effectively means from sunrise to sunset), with 3000 ppbh as the critical level. The guideline for forests, AOTf, is defined over the 6 month period of april-september during daytime, with 10000 ppbh as critical level. For the protection of human beings the threshold value is 60 ppb. The AOT 60 is defined as the maximum of a floating 8 -hour mean value over a day, which should not be exceeded at any time over a full year period (for more information, see EU, 1996) ...|$|E

This chemical improvement of the water is easily obtained by a continuous neutralization of the dissolved C 0 2 by CaC 0 3 with formation of Ca (HC 0 3) 2 which dissolves into the water and increases the calcium rate. There are some indications that the difficulties would come from the acidity rather than from the low calcium content.

Futher, whether or not it will be useful to optimize the oxydation process and economize the daily cost of tannery wastewater treatment. The data of sulpides content monitored during 12 hours oxidation period showed that there was significant difference between the curve (sulpides vs time) with Mn++ and the curve without Mn++ treated as the control. When a foamy oxydated wastewater appeared such as liming waste it would be a problem and the foam should be removed in such a way that not to be <b>harmfull</b> to the oxidation and other chemical processes. However, anti foam substance must be provided or introduced to clean Technology in the system. The experiment, observation and chemical tests data of this study gives proves the advantages of adding Mn++ in sulphides oxidation system. The catalist adding based on the sulphides content can be considered realistic...|$|E
