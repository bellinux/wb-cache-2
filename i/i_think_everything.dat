To return to that stupendous New World, which makes you almost guiddy [...] because of its immencity, [...] its noise, its striving, its fearful impetuous [...] to get on, to do always more, always bigger, quicker, more astonishingly a restless, flaring great world, where <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> can be realised... I know, as long as I live, breathe and think, the love for America will beautify my life and thoughts... Perhaps Fate will allow me one day {{to go back to}} America." ...|$|E
2500|$|Al Jazeera's Patty Culhane, said Obama's speech {{set a new}} {{marker for}} how {{politics}} is carried out {{during the rest of}} his presidency. [...] "From here on out <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> he does will be measured by the pundits against this incredible speech he gave here tonight," [...] she said. [...] "We've moments in the past where mass tragedies have led to legislation but we haven't seen a change in the tone in Washington.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Kelis debuted her sauce line, [...] "Feast", at the Beverly Hills Food & Wine Festival. The line went {{on general}} sale in 2015 {{under the new}} name of [...] "Bounty & Full". Kelis has {{described}} sauce as [...] "what accessories are to a woman’s outfit. Sauce defines where the dish is from and who’s making it [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> is better smothered, poured, or dipped." [...] In 2014, the Cooking Channel aired a cooking TV series starring Kelis, Saucy and Sweet, and the same year she set up a food truck to cook for attendees of the American music festival SXSW. Her first cookbook, My Life on a Plate, was released on September 28, 2015; Kelis describes it as [...] "an exploration of tastes and cultures, and my experience as a chef, musician, mother and wife".|$|E
5000|$|In July 2014, it was {{revealed}} that Freddie had killed villain Fraser. It was reported that Freddie would try framing brother Joe for the murder. Clapham said about the storyline [...] "As far as setting up Joe, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything's</b> going a little bit too smoothly. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> old Fred could do with a pair of eyes {{in the back of his}} head at this time." [...] It was also said about Freddie was going to frame Sam Lomax after her death for Fraser's murder by leaving a signed confession.|$|R

When we heard {{there was a}} very pretty young woman, {{apparently}} with plenty of money, living at the Hong Kong Hotel on very familiar terms with a lot of naval fellows, it became our business to make enquiries. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>everything</b> there is against you.|$|R
50|$|I call Henry Miller the {{greatest}} living author because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he is. <b>I</b> {{do not call}} him a poet because he has never written a poem; he even dislikes poetry, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> But <b>everything</b> he has written is a poem in the best {{as well as in}} the broadest sense of the word.|$|R

6000|$|... "What I {{think of}} America. It's the same {{inevitable}} question. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> of it. It's the stepping-off place. I've come here at last, because it matters most." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have not}} been quite exchanging salutes, Sir Gervaise," [...] {{answered}} Captain Foley; [...] "but the ship is ready for service again. Should the wind moderate a little, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> would stand to carry sail hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pretty well, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> in <b>everything</b> but the geometry. I don't {{know whether}} I passed in {{it or not}} and I have a creepy, crawly presentiment that I didn't. Oh, how good {{it is to be}} back! Green Gables is the dearest, loveliest spot in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is queer, Sam, and I {{must say}} I don't like it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{this is a}} case where no news is bad news. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> if <b>everything</b> was going along all right in New York, Dick would surely let us know. I am afraid he is having a good deal of trouble in {{straightening}} out Dad's business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Feemy, it's not {{two hours}} or more since I've {{received}} the letter; of course <b>I</b> couldn't <b>think</b> of <b>everything</b> at once. Tell me; {{what do you think}} best yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> {{was given}} up. If this thing had been of value I should, perhaps, {{have told the}} sheik; but as it was only written papers, and of no use to anyone, I did not trouble to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I shall {{want you}} to joke me, too. You must satirise me. It does more to show me my faults than {{anything}} else, and it will show other people how perfectly submissive I am, and how <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> you do is just right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. The {{uniform and}} the tent are both ready. I have a cork bed, and {{waterproof}} sheet to lay under it; and, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>everything</b> that I can possibly require.

6000|$|... "Don't {{take any}} notice of {{anything}} I say tonight," [...] she murmured softly. [...] "I {{am a little}} mad. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>everything</b> is going against me! I know that you haven't a grain of sympathy for me--that you would rather see me suffer than not, and yet you see I give myself away entirely. Why shouldn't I? Part of it is through you in a way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} money sewn in a small bag round my neck. We may as well take our knives with us. They will help us to tackle the boatmen. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is <b>everything.</b> Now, we will be off." ...|$|R

Still, as I told Monsieur Philip, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> has been against you; and I do hope, now that this English gentleman has given you a chance, that you {{will take advantage of}} it." ...|$|E

60|$|I feel {{inclined}} to Relativity myself. I {{think there is}} no one absolute principle in the universe. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> is relative. But I also feel, most strongly, that in itself each individual living creature is absolute: in its own being. And that all things in the universe are just relative to the individual living creature. And that individual living creatures are relative to each other.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2013, Idris was {{initially}} reportedly {{driven out of}} his headquarters in northern Syria by the Islamic Front into exile in Doha, Qatar, but U.S. officials later {{said he was in}} Turkey throughout the incursion. However, the FSA has denied that Idris has left Syria. A few days later, Syrian National Coalition (SNC) Chief of Staff Monzer Akbik said that Idris [...] "has failed to make an institution, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> can continue in the same way." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You are dreadfully inquisitive," [...] said Miss Annie, [...] "but to {{tell you}} the simple truth, Mr Croft, I don't believe Aunt Keswick takes any further {{interest}} in you, now that Roberta has gone. She had set her heart on making a match between you two, and doing it here without delay; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>everything</b> going wrong about this has put her into the state of mind she is in now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will find your things well arranged. All your clothes are in these two drawers; the coats in the bottom one, and your linen in those above. You will not perhaps {{be able to find}} your pocket-handkerchiefs at first. They are in this sachet; my sister made it herself. Mr. Rodney says you are to be called at eight o'clock and breakfast at nine. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> is right. Good-night, Mr. Endymion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is fortunate, indeed," [...] Geoffrey went on. [...] "No {{doubt she}} is {{intended}} for the transport of your daughter. Her crew consists of a captain and five men, but at present they are living ashore; and as we shall be going backwards and forwards to her, {{we ought to have}} little difficulty in getting on board and hiding away in the hold before she starts. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> promises well for the success of our scheme." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. How should I? I only don't {{like being}} laughed at about them. It hurts; {{and when one}} can't see.... I don't want to seem silly," [...] her chin quivered like a child's as she spoke, [...] "but we blindies have only one skin, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>Everything</b> outside hits {{straight}} at our souls. It's different with you. You've such good defences in your eyes--looking out-- before anyone can really pain you in your soul. People forget that with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't torment {{me as much}} as {{you would}} like," [...] she {{presently}} went on, [...] "because you think of nothing that I haven't a thousand times thought of, and because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>everything</b> that you never will. It would all," [...] she recognised, [...] "have been grave if it hadn't all been right. You can't make out," [...] she contended, [...] "that we got to Rome before the end of February." ...|$|R
60|$|If I {{might make}} a {{suggestion}} to historical students of leisure, it is this. The Life of the Old Chevalier (James III.) has never been written, and is well worth writing. My own studies, alas! prove that Prince Charles's character was incapable of enduring misfortune. His father, less brilliant and less popular, {{was a very different}} man, and, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> has <b>everything</b> to gain from an unprejudiced examination of his career. He has certainly nothing to lose.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Tonight, Rihanna explained the tour's title. She stated, [...] "I {{like to think about}} myself as 'The Last Girl on Earth' because sometimes people make decisions based on the outlook of others and, you know, to me, my life is my life. It's my world, and I'm going to live it the way I want to. That's how <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about <b>everything,</b> that way I'm focused on me, and my work. It's a really narrow space, a focus." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now it's {{quite clear}} that {{something}} very odd has just happened in this place. The chances are ten to one, it seems to me, that it had something specially {{to do with this}} place. Probably he came here because he could do it only here; it doesn't seem very inviting otherwise. But the man knew it of old; they say it belonged to his family, so that altogether, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>everything</b> points to something {{in the construction of the}} tower itself." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everything</b> {{was said}} and settled then, for as they stood {{together}} quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down protectingly over the light one, Amy felt {{that no one could}} comfort and sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only woman in the world who could fill Jo's place and make him happy. He did not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.|$|E
6000|$|I {{attend to}} her studies myself; has {{she told you}} that? Yes, I am her school-master, and she makes pretty good progress, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>everything</b> considered. Everything considered--being translated-- means holidays. But the fact is, she was not born for study, and it comes hard. Hard for me, too; it hurts me like a {{physical}} pain to see that free spirit {{of the air and}} the sunshine laboring and grieving over a book; and sometimes when I find her gazing far away towards the plain and the blue mountains with the longing in her eyes, I have to throw open the prison doors; I can't help it. A quaint little scholar she is, and makes plenty of blunders. Once I put the question: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>everything</b> {{is in its}} place," [...] Hilda said at last, [...] "and really {{they make}} two very pretty little rooms. I can't say that {{the one in the}} bow is pretty, but at any rate it is {{thoroughly}} comfortable, and I have no doubt that Joshua will be as pleased with it as the Nibsons are with theirs. Oh, dear, how dusty one gets! and we never thought of getting water on board for the jugs." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jones {{reflects}} on her medal win with Kelly stating: [...] "This {{is so much}} better because when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>everything</b> KK (Katie Kelly) has been through and to be able of doing everything she’s done in such short amount of time,” she said. “To me this is the best thing that I’ve ever done.” Jones expresses further explaining [...] "Disability doesn't define you, it's what you do with it that does" [...] She was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2017.|$|R

Of course, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that about <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> hear him play, whether it's jazz, blues, country, pop or rock and roll. And perhaps, as someone once said, he plays that way {{just because he}} can!" [...] [...] [...] [...] Duane Eddy ...|$|R
