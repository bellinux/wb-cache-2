To answer this deficiency, the Navy commissioned development of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.

25|$|Henriques further {{argues that}} {{developing}} {{such a system}} for integrating knowledge <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge {{can be seen as}} one of the most pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the notes}} {{prepared}} by Herbert Weinstock for the concerts arranged by Chávez in New York (1940), the program then included a work called Huapangos by Gerónimo Baqueiro Foster. [...] This piece was in reality an orchestral arrangement of several popular dances {{from the eastern}} state of Veracruz. In the 1941 program Chávez replaced Baqueiro's Huapangos with a new work called Huapango, written by Moncayo (a huapango {{is a type of}} Mexican dance). The difference is that Moncayo's Huapango <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> arrangement but a legitimate work inspired by the popular music of Veracruz ("El Siquisiri", [...] "El Balajú" [...] and [...] "El Gavilancito").

2500|$|The second {{controversy}} {{came when}} the 1983 prize went in part to William Alfred Fowler [...] "for his theoretical and experimental studies of the nuclear reactions of importance {{in the formation of}} the chemical elements in the universe." [...] The controversy arose because Hoyle had been the inventor of the theory of nucleosynthesis in the stars with two research papers published shortly after WWII. So some suspicion arose that Hoyle was denied the third share of this prize because of his earlier public disagreement with the 1974 award. British scientist Harry Kroto later said that the Nobel Prize <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> award for a piece of work, but a recognition of a scientist's overall reputation and Hoyle's championing many disreputable and disproven ideas may have invalidated him. In Nature, editor John Maddox called it [...] "shameful" [...] that Fowler had been rewarded with a Nobel prize and Hoyle had not.|$|E

2500|$|In late November, WikiLeaks {{released}} confidential State Department cables, {{selections of}} which were then published by several major newspapers around the world. The leak of the cables led to a crisis atmosphere in the State Department, as blunt statements and assessments by U.S. and foreign diplomats became public. Clinton led the damage control effort for the U.S. abroad, and also sought to bolster the morale of shocked Foreign Service officers. In {{the days leading up}} to the publication of the cables, Clinton called officials in Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Afghanistan, Canada, and China to alert them to the pending disclosures. She did note that some foreign leaders were accepting of the frank language of the cables, with one telling her, [...] "Don't worry about it. You should see what we say about you." [...] She harshly criticized WikiLeaks, saying: [...] "Let's be clear: This disclosure <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> attack on America's foreign policy interests. It is an attack on the international community – the alliances and partnerships, the conversations and negotiations that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity." [...] The State Department went into immediate [...] "war room" [...] mode in order to deal with the effects of the disclosures, and began implementing measures to try to prevent another such leak from happening in the future.|$|E
2500|$|Most emphatically in The Sickness Unto Death, Kierkegaard's author {{argues that}} the human self is a {{composition}} of various aspects that must be brought into conscious balance: the finite, the infinite, a consciousness of the [...] "relationship of the two to itself," [...] and a consciousness of [...] "the power that posited" [...] the self. The finite (limitations such as those imposed by one's body or one's concrete circumstances) and the infinite (those capacities that free us from limitations such as imagination) always exist {{in a state of}} tension. That tension between two aspects of the [...] "self" [...] that must be brought into balance. When the self is out of balance, i.e., has the wrong understanding of who it is because it conceives itself too much in terms of its own limiting circumstances (and thus fails to recognize its own freedom to determine what it will be) or too much in terms of what it would like to be, (thus ignoring its own circumstances), the person {{is in a state of}} despair. Notably, Anti-Climacus says one can be in despair even if one feels perfectly happy. Despair <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> emotion, in a deeper sense it is the loss of self, i.e., it describes the state when one has the wrong conception of oneself.|$|E
2500|$|Kunle Afolayan {{wanted a}} story {{set in a}} small community; he had writers submit scripts before he got to meet Tunde Babalola who {{eventually}} wrote the script for the film. The script was initially submitted with the title Dust, mainly because the story {{is set in a}} very dusty town. Even though Afolayan didn't want to do big budget projects at the time, he knew he had no choice, as he wanted to interpret the writer's vision adequately because it is a [...] "national film with a universal appeal". He expressed that he liked the story of October 1 because it is a period piece, which he had never done before and [...] "it is also significant to the present state of Nigeria". As a result, he decided to explore the film by adding his own ideas to the subsequent drafts of the script. In an interview, Afolayan pointed out that October 1 <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> entertainment film, but also informative: [...] "For the older generation, especially those who were part of independence, {{they will be able to}} see themselves in this film. For the younger generation it's a platform for many of them who don't know the story of Nigeria". He also stated that: [...] "We want the younger generation to know where we are coming from and the older generation to see if we are moving in the right direction".|$|E

In 2010, Bieber met Sam and John Shahidi, {{and he helped}} them develop the photo sharing app Shots. Shots was intended as an anti-bullying app, {{in which it was}} not possible to comment on others' pictures or to see how many [...] "likes" [...] another had received. Bieber was an investor in Shots. Boxer Floyd Mayweather also invested, and Bieber and Mayweather became friends through their business with Shots. At its peak, Shots had over 10 million users; Twitter tried to buy the app for US$150 million. With users dropping in 2016, Shahidi decided to change focus and rebrand Shots to Shots Studios, a talent agency and production company for online videos. Bieber is also an investor and active business partner in Shots Studios; Shahidi said that [...] "Justin <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> investor, he's a partner (...) So he's got to be on the same page as Sam and I. He's got to really like the person. He's got to appreciate their art, whether it's comedy or music, and also like them as a person as well". In June 2015, Bieber teamed up with StarShop, a new shopping app launched by Kevin Harrington. He has bandwagoned four fragrances as of 2014. He launched his debut fragrance, Someday, in 2011; it grossed more than three million US dollars in sales, at Macy's, in just under three weeks, which industry experts regard as a successful celebrity-led launch. On the heels of that 2011 best-seller, he launched his second fragrance, Girlfriend, in June 2012. His third fragrance, The Key, was launched in July 2013, and his latest fragrance, Justin Bieber Collector's Edition, launched in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{published}} as The Secret Ascension by Tor Books in 1987 (but subsequently reprinted with the author's preferred title), {{this work is}} an homage to writer Philip K. Dick, a pastiche of his style, and includes an alternate reality version of Dick as a character. [...] The novel {{is set in a}} world in which Richard Milrose Nixon, in his fourth term as president, holds fascistic control over America, and the science fiction works of Philip K. Dick remain unpublished, distributed underground as samizdat, while his realist fiction titles are the ones that are celebrated as masterpieces. Author and reviewer Orson Scott Card writes that [...] "the climax <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> inward epiphany for a character… he world changes in wonderful strange ways, and the audience can read the book passionately, with sweating fingers, eager to see what happens next, yet reluctant to leave the present moment. Imagine: A writer who is already one of the best, taking risks and finding ways to be better." [...] Card does take Bishop to task for the author's characterization of Richard Nixon, calling it a [...] "caricature" [...] and a [...] "stock character of a madman." [...] Locus reviewer Tom Whitmore calls the book [...] "a masterful pastiche" [...] and [...] "…the closest thing to a classic Dick sf novel anyone has ever done." [...] Gerald Jonas in the New York Times writes [...] "Mr. Bishop is a solid, serious writer whose reach (in his previous work) has always seemed to me to exceed his grasp. Here, he catches some of Dick's fire, especially in the early chapters… Then a lot happens very quickly (as in some of Dick's own novels), and the satire, which should hold things together, turns predictable. But…the ending (starring Philip K. Dick) approaches sublimity." [...] The novel was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1989.|$|E
