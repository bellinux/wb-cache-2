In Tyneside he began an investigation of protective gear for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution at the instigation of Charles Merz and Bernard Price. While thus engaged his attention was directed to improvement of high-voltage switchgear. At the time, switchgear was prone to catching fire, making switchrooms a dangerous place to work. It was largely due to Clothier's work and initiative that both the Merz-Price protective-gear and the metal-clad switchgear, which controlled arcing on open-type <b>electric</b> <b>switchboards,</b> became not only technically but commercially practicable.|$|E

However, Sara visits Alison at her job during [...] "Do Not Disturb" [...] and apologizes for lying under oath in order to reduce her criminal sentence, stating that she saw Charlotte as an older sister and mentor. Aria and Spencer break into her room at The Radley and find out that she's living in what was once Charlotte's old room while growing up in the infamous sanitarium. They then find a hole in the closet that leads to an underground floor with <b>electric</b> <b>switchboards.</b> The girls deduce those devices were used to torture Charlotte at Radley. They further investigate the alley, which in turn leads out of the Radley. A few days later, Alison, Emily and Hanna head to Sara's hotel room to investigate it as well, only to find out that the hole in the wall had been sealed.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, NASA's Space Nuclear Propulsion Officehttp://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/N/NERVA.html, in {{conjunction}} with the Atomic Energy Commission, jointly awarded Aerojet General Corporation the prime contract for its Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application NERVA Program, with a significant subcontract to WANL for development of the reactor itself. With the award, WANL selected the Large site as the base for operations and moved its personnel to the facility. Originally authorized in May 1959, WANL officially became a Westinghouse division on July 26, 1959 under the leadership of John Wistar Simpson. Cornell University physicist Sidney Krasik served as the first technical director and Frank Cotter was the first marketing director. Born in 1914, Simpson graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1937 and earned an MS from the University of Pittsburgh in 1941. Working in the switchgear division of Westinghouse's East Pittsburgh plant, Simpson helped develop the <b>electric</b> <b>switchboards</b> that could survive the extreme impacts experienced by naval vessels in the Pacific Theater during World War II. In 1946, he took a leave of absence to work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to familiarize himself with atomic power. Upon his return, he became assistant manager in the engineering department of the Westinghouse Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory. He subsequently managed the construction of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in 1954, the first commercial nuclear power plant in the United States. Promoted the next year to general manager of the Bettis Laboratory, he was elected a Westinghouse vice president in 1958 and by 1959 was eager to take on the new challenge of developing nuclear rocket engines to enable the exploration of the solar system.|$|E

30|$|Death due to {{electrocution}} demands {{close attention}} {{not only to}} document the true cause of death of the unfortunate victim but also to detect defective conditions which should prevent future electrocution. Usually, such deaths are accidental which can be avoided if proper safety measures are adopted. Caution should be advised while using malfunctioned equipment, uninsulated wiring, damaged appliances etc. Children should be prevented from using electrical appliances or gadgets which they cannot handle. <b>Electric</b> <b>switchboard</b> should always be kept away from the reach of children. In our study, water coolers {{were found to be}} a growing electrical hazard. This can be easily prevented by adopting proper earthing to it. Also, while filling water in the water cooler, one should remove the plugs and keep it in off mode. People residing near high-tension wires or persons climbing {{on the roof of the}} railway bogie are at particularly high risk of getting electrocuted. So, such contact should be avoided. At the end, if one can practise safety measures for handling electrical instruments, one can remain safe.|$|R
5000|$|Sinopoulo was a Greek {{immigrant}} {{who wanted to}} build a stylish amusement complex that held a uniting theme throughout a park setting. He used an elaborate Art Nouveau styling that blended blissfully with the surrounding woods and river. The interior of the Delmar Garden Theater was designed in intricate Victorian gingerbread, with Art Nouveau accents. Orchestra seating held leather upholstered opera chairs, box seats contained comfortable wicker chairs and love-seats, and three horseshoe shaped balconies were equipped with steep pitch bleachers. While the auditorium had soft gas lighting, the heavily draped stage was brilliantly illuminated by <b>electric</b> <b>switchboard</b> lighting. Built to be a vaudeville house, Delmar Garden Theater also installed film equipment in 1903 to feature The Great Train Robbery, which ran for eleven weeks. Regardless of the fact that film showings at the Delmar proved to be successful, management preferred to continue mainly as a two-a-day vaudeville venue, with only an occasional movie thrown in {{at the end of a}} weak vaudeville program.

50|$|Governor Frank Merriam piloted {{the first}} (ceremonial) {{electric}} train {{across the bridge}} on , although regular service did not commence until January 1939, after the terminal was complete. Trains were controlled with a custom <b>electric</b> <b>switchboard,</b> which was considerably simpler than the typical mechanical lever system then in use. A loop was built so trains could {{turn around and go}} back across the bridge. Even after rail service ended, the loop continued to be used by AC Transit, Thruway Motorcoach and Greyhound buses until the station closed. Surprisingly, a track was never made to connect to the Southern Pacific's Third and Townsend Depot so trains could go further south. There were eight tracks (counting the ones owned by Muni). By November 1940, the Interurban Electric Company was seeking permission to abandon East Bay service, prompting Director Clark to consider proposals for the state to assume operation of trains across the bridge. The SP and Sacramento Northern trains ceased service across the Bay in 1941 only two years after the Terminal was completed. Interurban stated they were forced to discontinue service, citing falling passenger counts, revenues, and a failed proposed consolidation with the Key System. After Interurban was granted permission to discontinue service, Sacramento Northern also applied to discontinue service in 1941. Sacramento Northern carried only a minuscule fraction (less than 1%) of the total rail traffic over the Bay Bridge, which meant Sacramento Northern likely also operated at a loss. Trains carried 37,334,000 passengers across the Bay Bridge at peak ridership in 1945, driven in part by gasoline rationing, but ridership declined precipitously, managing to move only 6,113,000 passengers in 1957. The Key System successfully petitioned the Public Utilities Commission to discontinue service across the Bay Bridge in 1955 due to falling revenues, after failing to discontinue service in an unsuccessful 1953 petition. The Oakland City Planning Commission reported that since 1945, all the petitions from the Key System had invariably asked for cuts to service and increased fares, which also contributed to declining ridership. The last train crossed the bridge on , less than twenty years after service was inaugurated in 1939, despite the vital role the trains played. There have been several attempts to restore rail service across the bridge (though not necessarily into the Transbay Terminal), but none have been successful.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the firm's founding, {{electric}} lighting for the stage was in its infancy. Held finds no catalog of stage lighting equipment earlier than Kliegl's catalog of 1898. as cited in Rubin. Indeed, it may be inferred that the use of [...] "Electric" [...] in the company's name was intended to distinguish its products from the illuminating gas or acetylene fueled equipment they would replace. Many of what became common devices, such as the stage [...] "shoe" [...] or thrust plug and the disappearing footlight were patented by the Kliegls, and many others were developed into the forms still familiar todayInitially they continued the Myerhofer business as [...] "contractors and manufacturers", as noted in their Catalog G of 1913. In 1903 they furnished and installed the complete stage lighting system for the Metropolitan Opera Company's new home on West 37th Street (John was at the time an electrician for the Met). In 1933 they would be again called to provide a complete new stage lighting system, although not as installers. Catalog G also displayed the carbon arc floodlight, developed by the firm in 1911, as the iconic Klieglight. A diverse assortment of lighting and electrical products were also cataloged, such as exit signs, backup batteries, dimmer boards, connectors, effect projectors, chandeliers, marquee lights (and complete marquees), charging outlets for <b>electric</b> cars, <b>switchboards,</b> etc. Featured was a [...] "Skyrocket" [...] sign for Tilyou's Steeplechase Park in Coney Island.The development of electrical standards was spurred, in part, by the Iroquois Theatre fire of 1903.
