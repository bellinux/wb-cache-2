Giuseppe Giannuzzi, prosecutor of the hijacking incident, said to The Associated Press in an interview that the hijacker will remain in jail {{until the end of the}} trial which will presumably take two years after inception.

25|$|There {{has been}} much debate in Australia over whether the F-35 is the most {{suitable}} aircraft for the RAAF. It has been claimed that the F-35's performance is inferior to Russian-built fighters operated by countries near Australia (such as the Su-27 and Su-30 in Indonesia), that it cannot meet the RAAF's long-range strike requirement, and that further delays to the F-35 program may result in the RAAF experiencing a shortage of combat aircraft. The RAAF has stated that it believes that the F-35 will meet Australia's needs, and both of Australia's major political parties currently support the development and purchase of the aircraft (though differences remain on the deadline {{and the number of}} aircraft).

25|$|However, Switzerland did {{not want}} to be seen as an {{obstacle}} to closer tax cooperation among EU-member states and decided to support the international efforts to adequately tax cross-border investment income. The retention tax agreed with the European Union (EU) in the taxation of savings income agreement is a suitable and efficient means of doing so. The EU is committed to eliminating existing loopholes in the system of taxation of savings income. Switzerland has expressed to the EU its willingness in principle to correspondingly adjust the taxation of savings income. Here it should be noted that Switzerland has adopted the OECD standard on administrative assistance and that the Federal Council rejects the automatic exchange of information. Since July 1, 2005, Switzerland <b>has</b> <b>charged</b> a withholding tax on all interest earned in the personal Swiss accounts of European Union residents.|$|E
25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, <b>has</b> <b>charged</b> that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E

500|$|Brundage's {{concerns}} proved prophetic. The IOC <b>has</b> <b>charged</b> {{more for}} television broadcast rights at each successive Games. [...] At the 1998 Nagano Games American broadcaster CBS paid $375million, whereas the 2006 Turin Games cost NBC $613million to broadcast. The more television companies have paid to televise the Games, the greater their persuasive {{power has been}} with the IOC. For example, the television lobby has influenced the Olympic programme by dictating when event finals are held, so that they appear in prime time for television audiences. They have pressured the IOC to include new events, such as snowboarding, that appeal to broader television audiences. This has been done to boost ratings, which were slowly declining until the 2010 Games.|$|E
500|$|Its treble panel {{diaphragm}} {{is further}} subdivided into midrange and tweeter sections, achieved by clamping it {{on each side}} of its centre. Both midrange and tweeter sections are driven separately, and the entire treble unit operates at substantially lower voltages – operating voltages are said to be 6000V for the bass and 1500V for the treble. The speaker needs to be plugged into the mains and must be charged prior to use. This is because the diaphragm operates in a [...] "constant charge" [...] mode, and it takes time for the charge to build up. In practice, the speaker is usable after charging for less than half a minute, but the sound gradually improves as the charge builds up. Best performance is achieved when the speaker <b>has</b> <b>charged</b> fully, which can take up to an hour. The electricity is only to charge the diaphragm, so consumption is negligible.|$|E
