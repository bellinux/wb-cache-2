30|$|Two {{different}} treatments were implemented: DI beneficiaries in the “high” {{seed capital}} treatment receive CHF 18, 000 for each pension reduction by one quarter, while beneficiaries in the “low” seed capital treatment receive CHF 9, 000 for each pension reduction by one quarter. Thus, a DI beneficiary {{with a full}} pension who completely exits the DI programme receives CHF 72, 000 in the high seed capital treatment and CHF 36, 000 in the low seed capital treatment. The former amount {{is comparable to the}} average income of a Swiss household, while the latter amount corresponds to the minimum yearly income guaranteed by means-tested benefits. The lump-sum payment is split into four <b>equal</b> <b>tranches,</b> paid bi-annually over two years. Once an individual falls back to a higher pension, the DI system stops the payment of outstanding seed capital tranches. Already paid tranches {{do not have to be}} reimbursed.|$|E
5000|$|For the 2013-2017 [...] "rate {{rebasing}} process" [...] {{the companies}} had requested price increases. However, in September 2013, the regulator MWSS ordered both companies {{to reduce their}} tariff. Manila Water and Maynilad were ordered to reduce tariffs by 29.47 percent and 4.82 percent respectively in five <b>equal</b> annual <b>tranches</b> {{over a period of}} five years, because [...] "the utilities were unable to justify the need for higher rates based on their business and investment plans". The companies appealed against the decision at the International Chamber of Commerce which reversed the order against Maynilad in December 2014, allowing its tariffs to increase by 9.8 percent from 31.28 pesos (69 U.S. cents) per cubic meter, much less than the 28.3% increase initially requested by the company. Furthermore, there is disagreement about whether the companies can pass corporate income tax on to their customers. The companies claim that the government allowed them to do so back in 1997. However, the regulator MWSS blocked this part of the tariff increase and brought the issue to the Supreme Court of the Philippines for a final decision. oel Yu, chief regulator at MWSS, says that Manila Water’s return on equity is [...] "in the region of 20%", while Maynilad’s is [...] "in the region of 40%".|$|R
