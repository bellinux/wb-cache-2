5|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} to the ships by five electricity plants. <b>Each</b> <b>plant</b> consisted of four diesel generators and eight turbo-generators. The four diesel generators {{were divided into}} pairs: two provided 150kilowatts each and two supplied 300kW each. The eight turbo-generators were also of mixed capacity; six ran supplied 460kW each and the remaining two provided 230kW each. Total power output was 4,120kW at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, the {{production}} filmed scenes {{set in a}} pig farm, where a young boy is confronted and attacked by three perpetrators. A night later, the crew shot the film's opening sequence, in which the three civil rights workers are murdered. From March 14 to March 18, the crew filmed the burning of several more churches, as well as scenes set in a farm. On March 22, the crew filmed scenes set in a morgue that was located inside the University of Mississippi Medical Center, exactly the same location where the bodies of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were transported. A day later, Parker and the crew filmed a scene set in a cotton field. The art department had to dress <b>each</b> <b>plant</b> with layers of cotton, as the cotton plants had not fully bloomed. The crew also filmed the abduction of Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey) and his subsequent interrogation by FBI agent Monk (Badja Djola). On March 24, {{the production}} moved to Raymond, Mississippi, where the crew filmed a scene at the John Bell Williams Airport. Depicting Monk's departure, the scene was choreographed by Parker and the cast members {{so that it could}} be filmed in one take.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{some other}} red dyes {{obtained}} from scale insects, the red coloring is derived from carminic acid with traces of kermesic acid. The Polish cochineal carminic acid content is approximately 0.6% of the insect's dried body weight. The insects were harvested shortly before the female larvae reached maturity, i.e. in late June, usually around Saint John the Baptist's day (June 24), hence the dye's folk name, Saint John's blood. The harvesting process involved uprooting the host plant and picking the female larvae, averaging approximately ten insects from <b>each</b> <b>plant.</b> In Poland, including present-day Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe, plantations were operated {{in order to deal}} with the high toll on the host plants. The larvae were killed with boiling water or vinegar and dried in the sun or in an oven, ground, and dissolved in sourdough or in light rye beer called kvass in order to remove fat. The extract could then be used for dyeing silk, wool, cotton, or linen. The dyeing process requires roughly 3-4oz of dye per pound (180-250g per kilogram) of silk and one pound of dye to color almost 20pounds (50g per kilogram) of wool.|$|E

5|$|The seeds {{maintain}} their germinative powers for decades, up {{to a hundred}} years, according to some studies. Because of this, and because the plant is an extremely prolific seed bearer (<b>each</b> <b>plant</b> produces hundreds of capsules, each containing up to 700+ seeds, with a total up to 180,000 or 240,000 seeds), it remains in the soil seed bank for extended periods of time, and can sprout from apparently bare ground, or shortly after forest fires long after previous plants have died. Its population pattern typically consists of an ephemeral adult population followed by {{a long period of}} dormancy as seeds. Great mullein rarely establishes on new grounds without human intervention because its seeds do not disperse very far. Seed dispersion requires the stem to be moved by wind or animal movement; 75% of the seeds fall within 1 m of the parent plant, and 93% fall within 5 m.|$|E
5|$|Webs are {{typically}} established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation {{such as the}} native Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) or the introduced marram grass (Ammophila arenaria). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such as empty tin cans or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so {{on the underside of}} a plant overhanging open sand. It has been found that these patches of open sand are necessary for katipo to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic plants like kikuyu or buffalo grass, create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipo therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pingao plants as this plants growth pattern leaves patches of sand between <b>each</b> <b>plant.</b> The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these gaps and into the web. Marram grass has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pingao in many areas. Because marram grass grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this makes it difficult for the katipo to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.|$|E

50|$|Isolation valves {{consist of}} 2 safety-related valves in series. One is an inboard valve, {{the other is}} an {{outboard}} valve. The inboard is located inside the containment, and the outboard is located just outside the containment. This provides redundancy as well as making the system immune to the single failure of any inboard or outboard valve operator or isolation signal. When an isolation signal is given to a group, both the inboard and outboard valves stroke closed. Tests of isolation logic must be performed regularly and {{is a part of}} <b>each</b> <b>plant's</b> technical specifications. The timing of these valves to stroke closed is a component of <b>each</b> <b>plant's</b> safety analysis and failure to close in the analyzed time is a reportable event.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of tree spacing or planting distance on tree growth characteristic and several physical and mechanical properties of fast growing teak (Tectona grandis) wood from a plantation area in West Java. Growth characteristics of all trees within the plot of <b>each</b> <b>planting</b> distance were evaluated, while physical-mechanical properties were represented by 6 selected trees of <b>each</b> <b>planting</b> distance. The results showed that growth characteristics were significantly influenced by tree spacing, while wood properties were not. The wider spacing (3 by 3 m) tends to produce bigger stem diameter, but shorter tree height, shorter clear bole height, and greater branches. Although tree spacing of 3 by 3 m is more favored by the farmers since it provides more space for agroforestry activity, such spacing is not recommended to be applied in order to produce the best timber from teak plantation...|$|R

25|$|So {{infectious}} was {{the interest}} that George Loddiges and fellow nurserymen created {{during the early}} nineteenth century in the splendour of new ferns, trees, palms - indeed plants of all kinds - that he was prompted to begin marketing a series of volumes containing coloured engravings of the many new species and varieties. Entitled The Botanical Cabinet it ran to twenty volumes and 2,000 plates. Facing <b>each</b> <b>plant</b> portrait, George Loddiges added a few lines of text outlining the source of the seeds and invariably adding a religious perspective. Many of the drawings for the publications were made by George himself, his daughter Jane and the young Edward Cooke who became a leading Victorian artist, and whose father, George Cooke, engraved a number of the plates.|$|E

Ford of Brazil produces a pick-up truck version of the Fiesta, the Courier, which is also produced in South Africa as the Ford Bantam in right hand drive versions.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of its}} history, a {{connection}} was assumed between Chardonnay and Pinot noir or Pinot blanc. In addition to being found in the same region of France for centuries, ampelographers noted that the leaves of <b>each</b> <b>plant</b> have near-identical shape and structure. Pierre Galet disagreed with this assessment, believing that Chardonnay {{was not related to}} any other major grape variety. Viticulturalists Maynard Amerine and Harold Olmo proposed a descendency from a wild Vitis vinifera vine that was a step removed from white Muscat. Chardonnay's true origins were further obscured by vineyard owners in Lebanon and Syria, who claimed that the grape's ancestry could be traced to the Middle East, from where it was introduced to Europe by returning Crusaders, though little external evidence supports that theory. Another theory stated that it originated from an ancient indigenous vine found in Cyprus.|$|E
