5|$|When he played, Bates {{stood at}} , {{something}} that teammates taunted him about: in Milwaukee spring training camp, players threw {{a cap on}} the ground and addressed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a 100-yard race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but about halfway through the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it went after the hat; Bates won the race. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lives in Houston and works for an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry. He also coaches his daughter's softball team outside of work.|$|E
25|$|The party seeking title by adverse {{possession}} {{may be called}} the disseisor, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an {{adverse possession}} claim are different in each state, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect {{the title of the}} disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, {{in a manner that is}} open and notorious, keep out others, and use <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were his own. Some states impose additional requirements.|$|E
25|$|Because all saxophones use {{the same}} key {{arrangement}} and fingering to produce a given notated pitch, {{it is not difficult}} for a competent player to switch among the various sizes when the music has been suitably transposed, and many do so. Since the baritone and alto are pitched in E, players can read concert pitch music notated in the bass clef by reading <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were treble clef and adding three sharps to the key signature. This process, referred to as clef substitution, makes it possible for the Eb instruments to play from parts written for baritone horn, bassoon, euphonium, string bass, trombone, or tuba. This can be useful if a band or orchestra lacks one of those instruments.|$|E

500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} {{for this}} episode, director Brian Grant and actor Bruno Langley refer to an additional motivation for Adam's actions. Apparently, in earlier drafts of the script, Adam's father {{suffered from a}} disease that was incurable in his time (2012) and he hoped to learn about a cure which had been discovered between that year and 200,000. In the shooting script, the condition is arthritis. No trace of this motivation remains in the finished programme, although Grant discusses <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were still present. Langley and Grant also reveal that the [...] "frozen vomit" [...] that Adam spits out in one scene {{was in fact a}} [...] "kiwi and orange ice cube".|$|E

Casting director Mary Jo Slater loaded the film with as many Hollywood stars as the production could afford, including a minor appearance by Christian Slater, her son, as an Excelsior officer; Cinefantastique considered the cameo a likely attempt to lure younger audiences. Meyer was interested in casting actors who could project and articulate feelings, even through alien makeup. Producer Ralph Winter said, [...] "We were not {{looking for someone to}} say 'Okay, I'll do it', but people who were excited by the material [...] and would treat <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was the biggest picture ever being made." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{introduces}} {{a vehicle that}} has been compared with the Batplane and the Batcopter, dubbed [...] "the Bat". In designing the Bat, Nathan Crowley approached <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were an actual military project, emphasising the need for it to [...] "fit into the same family" [...] as the Tumbler and the Batpod. The {{final version of the}} Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache. Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery. In order to make the Bat [...] "fly", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.|$|E
500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was our baby, and though {{there was a sense that}} we were standing on the shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E

Markham was {{attached}} to the force's headquarters staff, with responsibility for general survey work and in particular the selection of the route to Magdala, the king's mountain stronghold. Markham also acted as the party's naturalist, reporting on the species of wildlife encountered during the [...] march southward from the coast. He accompanied Napier to the walls of Magdala, which was stormed on [...] 1868. As the king's forces charged down the mountain to meet Napier's advancing troops Markham recorded: [...] "The Snider rifles kept up a fire no Abyssinian troops could stand. They were mown down in lines... the most heroic struggle could do nothing {{in the face of such}} vast inequality of arms." [...] After the discovery of the king's body the victorious troops, according to Markham, [...] "gave three cheers over <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been a dead fox." [...] Markham added that although the king's misdeeds had been numerous and his cruelties horrible, he had finally died as a hero.|$|E

500|$|Having {{started his}} career as a remixer, Pettibone built the basic music of the Erotica songs in the style of his remixes for which Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics. According to Pettibone in an article [...] "Erotica Diaries" [...] {{published}} on Madonna's Icon magazine, he began with a tape of three tracks for Madonna to listen to, before he traveled to Chicago, where she was filming A League of Their Own. She listened to the songs and liked all of them. After filming was complete, Madonna met Pettibone in New York City to start working on demos in his apartment in October 1991. Their schedule was sporadic in the beginning. Madonna and Pettibone were in the studio for a week and then she would work with Steven Meisel on Sex, for two weeks. Occasionally, Madonna also would meet André Betts. At first, Madonna did not like the first group of songs she had recorded. She wanted Erotica to have a raw edge to <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were recorded in an alley in Harlem, and not a light glossy production to permeate her sound, according to Pettibone. [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] was not working for Madonna. Pettibone said they tried different bridges and changes, but in the end, Madonna wanted the middle of the song to have a flamenco guitar.|$|E
500|$|Andy's bandmates {{during the}} rock show scene were played by Mark Rivers (drums), Andrew Burlinson (guitar) and Alan Yang (bass). All four actors {{performed}} their own instruments live during the filming. Originally, {{they planned to}} pre-record the songs and pantomime them for the episode, but after practicing a few times around the extras, they decided to shoot it live. The band performed each song twice, and Schur said he tried to shoot and direct <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were a music video. Yang is a writer with Parks and Recreation, and wrote the previous first season episode, [...] "Boys' Club". Rivers is a composer {{who has worked on}} the sketch comedy show Human Giant, which starred Parks star Aziz Ansari. Rivers wrote the songs performed in [...] "Rock Show", which Pratt said took him only [...] "about fifteen minutes". [...] Hiscock wrote the lyrics for [...] "The Pit" [...] in the initial outline for the episode and they were handed to Rivers who then fleshed them out. [...] The songs were designed to resemble the music of the American rock band Hootie & the Blowfish. The only song not written by Rivers was [...] "Ann", a romantic ballad Andy played for Ann, which was written by Pratt himself. [...] "Ann" [...] first appeared in [...] "Boys' Club".|$|E
500|$|Born Villain was {{released}} worldwide from April 30, {{with a cover}} of Carly Simon's [...] "You're So Vain" [...] included on all editions as a bonus track. This cover was recorded after the album had been completed, and features Johnny Depp performing guitar. The pair were introduced when Manson appeared as an extra on 21 Jump Street when he was 19, although [...] "You're So Vain" [...] is their first musical collaboration. The cover originated from a jam session, with Manson explaining that they [...] "started playing old blues songs and I said, 'My record's done, but we should really do a song {{to add to the}} end of <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were a movie.'" [...] He described the cover's placement on the album as: [...] "It's like the movie's over, and this is playing at the end title credits." [...] It was later included on the soundtrack to the documentary West of Memphis. Dean Karr, who served as the photographer on Manson's cover shoot for the March 2012 issue of Revolver, was commissioned to create the album's cover art. He had previously worked on the artwork accompanying Antichrist Superstar. However, the cover image would later be revealed to be the work of photographer Lindsay Usich, with Karr's photography being used for the album's first single, [...] "No Reflection".|$|E

500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Rock Show" [...] were improvised by the actors. Paul Schneider made up his own {{dialogue}} during the scene in which he and Poehler sit next to the pit and he talks about <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is already a park. Poehler's laughter at his jokes in this scene is her genuine reaction. Pratt also improvised much of his own dialogue, including his rationale to Ann for why he lied about his leg casts: [...] "I really, really like it when you serve me food." [...] Pratt also changed the reaction his character had to Mark falling into the pit. The script originally called for Andy to be serious and concerned, but Pratt changed it so his character thought the fall was funny. Pratt also improvised the songs he sang during an early scene in the episode, in which Andy makes up songs about random items in Ann's living room out of boredom from wearing the casts for so long. One of the songs he sings is about a lamp, and included the lyrics, [...] "I wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched." [...] Pratt thought of the song because he had recently gotten such a lamp as a gift from a friend.|$|E
500|$|Conrad {{first met}} MacFarlane while {{recording}} a [...] clip {{for the season}} five episode [...] "Prick Up Your Ears". She had watched Family Guy for years and considered Stewie her favorite character. Conrad stuck to the script and did not do any improvisation while recording for this episode. In an interview with People, she revealed that she has no plans on getting into acting, and even calls herself an [...] "awful actor" [...] and admits that she cannot memorize lines. However, she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines. Even though she enjoyed the experience, she said that [...] " [...] not really something I'm interested in." [...] She {{had to do a}} lot of research before recording, because [...] "there were a lot of facts and a lot of big words" [...] and she [...] "had to say <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was coming to [...] very easily." [...] Her acting coach advised her to learn the lines ahead of time so that she would [...] "really understood what [...] was talking about, it would come through a little more true." [...] MacFarlane commented on this, saying, [...] "She made an effort , so let me just put it that way." [...] He ultimately praised her performance, calling it [...] "surprisingly fantastic", and said: [...] "She came in, and she'd prepared before she even arrived. She hired an acting coach, with her own money, and she nailed it. She never once complained, and it was a long session. There was a lot of dialog. Her stamina was astonishing." ...|$|E
