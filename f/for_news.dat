In late 2002 he was dismissed from his job as the supervisor of a group home for at-risk youth in Seattle, after one of the residents accused him of hugging her and holding her hand. In a 2013 retrospective he penned <b>for</b> <b>news</b> portal Rappler, Ahn contended that her allegations were false; made in retaliation for his sanctioning her with loss of privileges for illegal possession of a controlled substance.

5|$|Both Schicchi and Buoso Donati were {{historical}} characters. Dante's verses, and the opera, {{are based}} on an actual incident {{that took place in}} 13th century Florence. Dante had several reasons for his harsh treatment of Schicchi: Dante's wife, Gemma, was of the Donati family; the poet himself was of pure Florentine descent. He despised members of the peasant class such as Schicchi. Dante's class prejudice displays itself in several episodes in the Inferno: in one, three noble Florentines, who have died and gone to Hell, ask Dante <b>for</b> <b>news</b> of their home city. A disgusted Dante tells them that the city is now dominated by the nouveau riche.|$|E
5|$|By 27 April, Berlin was cut {{off from}} the rest of Germany. Secure radio {{communications}} with defending units had been lost; the command staff in the bunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders and on public radio <b>for</b> <b>news</b> and information. On 28 April, a BBC report originating from Reuters was picked up; a copy of the message was given to Hitler. The report stated that Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies; the offer had been declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the authority to negotiate a surrender; Hitler considered this treason. During the afternoon his anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against Himmler. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin) shot.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her passengers and cargo, De Soto also acted as a conduit <b>for</b> <b>news</b> between Cuba and the United States. Most of the news conveyed by De Soto was of a mundane characterfor example, reports of activity on the Havana sugar marketbut sometimes it was of more interest. In October 1860 for instance, De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves. The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore {{and could not be}} retrieved.|$|E

5|$|In places closely {{associated}} with Titanic, the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699crew members and also home {{to many of the}} passengers. Crowds of weeping women– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew– gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton <b>for</b> <b>news</b> of their loved ones. Most of them were among the 549Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built Titanic came to feel they had been responsible in some way for her loss.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1793, the French Republic {{declared}} war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, extending the already existing French Revolutionary Wars. It took several months <b>for</b> <b>news</b> of the outbreak of war to reach British India, messages arriving at Calcutta from Consul George Baldwin at Alexandria on 11 June. The Royal Navy commander in the region, Commodore William Cornwallis, immediately set about demanding the surrender of the French trading posts in India. Most fell within a few days, but the major port of Pondicherry refused, and was besieged from 1 August. The siege lasted {{a month before the}} French commander capitulated under bombardment from British land and naval forces. With the French presence eliminated from India, Cornwallis was ordered to return to Europe, leaving minimal naval forces in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Altgens was {{scheduled}} {{to work in the}} AP offices in Dallas as the wirephoto editor. He asked instead to go to the railroad overpass (the bridge under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets converge at the west end of Dealey Plaza) to photograph the motorcade that was to take President Kennedy from Love Field to his scheduled appearance at the Dallas Trade Mart. Altgens was not assigned to work in the field that day, so he took his personal single-lens reflex camera rather than the motor-driven equipment normally used <b>for</b> <b>news</b> events.|$|E

5|$|Retrieving his boats, Corbet {{determined}} to sail to Île Bourbon directly. By 04:00 on 12 September {{he had arrived}} at Saint-Denis and there landed his wounded and came ashore <b>for</b> <b>news,</b> learning that two French frigates were just offshore, blockading the port. The French ships had spotted Africaine in the harbour and despatched the small brig Entreprenant to Isle de France with information of her whereabouts, although Corbet had raised flags that successfully deceived the French into believing that his frigate was Rowley's flagship HMS Boadicea. The French ships were Astrée, commanded by Pierre Bouvet, and Iphigénie, formerly one of the British frigates captured at Grand Port, under René Lemarant de Kerdaniel.|$|E
5|$|The Ashvamedhika Parva narrates Uttanka's {{meeting with}} the god Krishna. As Krishna was {{returning}} to his kingdom Dwarka, he noticed the wandering ascetic Uttanka. Uttanka met Krishna and asked <b>for</b> <b>news.</b> Krishna told about the devastation in the Kurukshetra War. Uttanka was agitated {{and was about to}} curse Krishna for not bringing about a compromise between the warring cousins Pandavas and Kauravas. Krishna explained the necessity of war for restoration of dharma and revealed his Vishvarupa form to Uttanka. The sage bowed to Krishna. Krishna told Uttanka to ask for a boon. Uttanka asked Krishna to grant him the boon of finding water whenever he was thirsty. Krishna granted the boon to Uttanka. Uttanka was the only other person other than Arjuna and Bhishma to get a divine vision of Krishna.|$|E
5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait <b>for</b> <b>news</b> of Pliny the Elder.|$|E

5|$|The public's thirst <b>for</b> <b>news</b> and {{information}} {{was in part}} satisfied by news magazines, which were dedicated to reporting the war. They included amongst others The War Illustrated, The Illustrated War News, and The War Pictorial, and were lavishly filled with photographs and illustrations, regardless of their target audience. Magazines were produced for all classes, and ranged both in price and tone. Many otherwise famous writers contributed towards these publications, of which H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling were three examples. Editorial guidelines varied; in cheaper publications especially it was considered more important {{to create a sense}} of patriotism than to relay up-to-the-minutes news of developments of the front. Stories of German atrocities were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, {{following}} {{the revelation that}} the News of the World had paid private investigators to hack into the phones of Milly Dowler, {{as well as the}} families of murder victims and deceased servicemen, Miliband called <b>for</b> <b>News</b> International chief executive Rebekah Brooks to resign, urged David Cameron to establish a public, judge-led inquiry into the scandal, and announced that he would force a Commons vote on whether to block the News International bid for a controlling stake in BSkyB. He also called for the Press Complaints Commission to be abolished – a call later echoed by Cameron and Nick Clegg – and called into question Cameron's judgement in hiring former News of the World editor Andy Coulson to be his director of communications. Cameron later took the unusual step of saying that the government would back Miliband's motion that the BSkyB bid be dropped, and an hour before Miliband's motion was due to be debated, News International announced that it would withdraw the bid.|$|E
5|$|In late 2004, the National Annenberg Election Survey at the University of Pennsylvania ran a {{study of}} American {{television}} viewers and found that fans of The Daily Show had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the 2004 presidential election than most others, including those who primarily got their news through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers. However, in a 2004 campaign {{survey conducted by the}} Pew Research Center those who cited comedy shows such as The Daily Show as a source <b>for</b> <b>news</b> were among the least informed on campaign events and key aspects of the candidates' backgrounds while those who cited the Internet, National Public Radio, and news magazines were the most informed. Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the Internet were still found to be the most informed, while those who learned from comedy shows were the least informed.|$|E
