In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v.

Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.|$|E

The report predicted that if a coup was to occur, the objective would probably be to force Nhu and his wife out of positions of power and allow Diệm to continue to lead the country with reduced power, should he be willing to do so.

2500|$|The {{separation}} of powers principle is particularly noteworthy {{in regard to the}} Congress. The Constitution declares that the Congress may exercise only those legislative powers [...] "herein granted" [...] within Article I (as later limited by the Tenth Amendment). It also, by implied extension, prohibits Congress from delegating its legislative authority to either of the other branches of government, a rule known as the nondelegation doctrine. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress does have latitude to delegate regulatory powers to executive agencies as long as it provides an [...] "intelligible principle" [...] which governs the agency's exercise of the delegated regulatory authority. That the power assigned to each branch must remain with that branch, and may be expressed only by that branch, is central to the theory. The nondelegation doctrine is primarily used now as a way of interpreting a congressional <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> narrowly, in that the courts presume Congress intended only to delegate that which it certainly could have, unless it clearly demonstrates it intended to [...] "test the waters" [...] of what the courts would allow it to do.|$|E
2500|$|The {{funding of}} {{renewable}} energy (RE) projects {{is dependent on the}} credibility of the institutions developing and implementing RE policy. [...] This places a particular burden on the energy regulators in Africa—whose professional staff may be few in number and who have track records of only a decade or so. [...] Rules (micro policies) made by regulators are subsidiary to overall government RE policy and depend on some <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> from the state. [...] Nevertheless, there are instances when the sector regulator can pro-active on behalf of customer and utility concerns—providing facts, reports, and public statements that build a case for care in the design of public policy towards RE. Clean and renewable energy is likely to be of concern to a number of organizations. Interaction between multiple authorities requires coordination to align policies, incentives, and administrative processes (including licensing and permitting). [...] Of course, the making of policy by regulators is incidental to and inherent in their duty to decide specific cases or disputes. This micro policy making role is derived from the fact that macro RE policy cannot reasonably be expected to anticipate all aspects of policy that will have to evolve for the regulatory process to be fully functional. This point is particularly important in the area {{of renewable energy}}, with its rapidly changing technologies and ever-changing public (and political) attitudes. [...] Gaps will have to be filled and it is the regulators, with their functional responsibilities, technical expertise, and hands-on experience that are best positioned to accomplish that task in developing countries. Thus, for designing auctions for purchased power, for establishing Feed-in Tariffs, or other instruments promoting RE, the energy sector regulator has {{a significant impact on the}} penetration of RE in Africa and other regions.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the younger}} Agnelli's first steps after gaining control of Fiat {{was a massive}} {{reorganization}} of the company management, which had previously been highly centralized, with little provision for the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> and decision-making. Such a system was effective in the past, but lacked the responsiveness and flexibility needed by Fiat's steady expansion, {{and the growth of}} its international operations in the 1960s. The company was reorganized on a product-line basis, with two main product groups—one for passenger cars, the other for trucks and tractors—and a number of semi-independent division and subsidiaries. Top management, freed from responsibility for day-by-day operations of the company, was able to devote its efforts to more far-reaching goals. In 1967, Fiat made its first acquisition when it purchased Autobianchi; with sales amounting to $1.7billion, it outstripped Volkswagen, its main European competitor, and in 1968 produced some 1,750,000 vehicles while its sales volume climbed to $2.1billion. According to Newsweek in 1968, Fiat was [...] "the most dynamic automaker in Europe... may come closest to challenging the worldwide supremacy of Detroit." [...] Then, in 1969, it purchased controlling interests in Ferrari and Lancia. At the time, Fiat was a conglomerate, owning Alitalia, toll highways, a typewriter and office machine manufacturer, electronics and electrical equipment firms, a paint company, a civil engineering firm, and an international construction company. [...] Following up on an agreement Valletta had made with Soviet officials in 1966, Agnelli constructed the AvtoVAZ plant in the new city of Togliattigrad on the Volga. This began operation in 1970, producing a local version of the Fiat 124 as the Lada. On his initiative, Fiat automobile and truck plants were also constructed in industrial centers of Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania. [...] In 1973, Fiat established Comau, an industrial automation company out of the various suppliers which had equipped the AvtoVAZ plant in Russia. [...] Comau became an industry pioneer in the use of Robotics for vehicle assembly – a technology with which Fiat would become synonymous for in the 1970s, with its [...] "Robogate" [...] system for bodyshell manufacture, and the later FIRE family of robot-assembled engines in the 1980s.|$|E

[...] I do not read that phrase as abrogating existing sovereignties in Africa. What is contemplated is a <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b> Every one should know, though unhappily the badness of our history teaching makes it doubtful if every one does know, that the Federal Government of the United States of America did not begin as a sovereign Government, and has now only a very questionable sovereignty. Each State was sovereign, and each State delegated certain powers to Washington. That was the initial idea of the union. Only later did the idea of a people of the States as a whole emerge. In the same way I understand the Labour proposal as meaning that we should delegate to an African Commission the middle African Customs, the regulation of inter-State trade, inter-State railways and waterways, quarantine and health generally, and the establishment of a Supreme Court for middle African affairs. One or two minor matters, such as the preservation of rare animals, might very well fall under the same authority.|$|E
60|$|Morton {{accompanied}} {{him to a}} sequestered grassplot, where their colleagues awaited them. In this <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> the two principal factions which divided the tumultuary army had each taken care to send three of their own number. On {{the part of the}} Cameronians, were Burley, Macbriar, and Kettledrummle; and on that of the moderate party, Poundtext, Henry Morton, and a small proprietor, called the Laird of Langcale. Thus the two parties were equally balanced by their representatives in the committee of management, although it seemed likely that those of the most violent opinions were, as is usual in such cases, to possess and exert the greater degree of energy. Their debate, however, was conducted more like men of this world than could have been expected from their conduct on the preceding evening. After maturely considering their means and situation, and the probable increase of their numbers, they agreed that they would keep their position for that day, in order to refresh their men, and give time to reinforcements to join them, and that, on the next morning, they would direct their march towards Tillietudlem, and summon that stronghold, as they expressed it, of malignancy. If it was not surrendered to their summons, they resolved to try the effect of a brisk assault; and, should that miscarry, it was settled that they should leave a part of their number to blockade the place, and reduce it, if possible, by famine, while their main body should march forward to drive Claverhouse and Lord Ross from the town of Glasgow. Such was the determination of the council of management; and thus Morton's first enterprise in active life was likely to be the attack of a castle belonging to the parent of his mistress, and defended by her relative, Major Bellenden, to whom he personally owed many obligations! He felt fully the embarrassment of his situation, yet consoled himself with the reflection, that his newly-acquired power in the insurgent army would give him, at all events, the means of extending to the inmates of Tillietudlem a protection which no other circumstance could have afforded them; and he was not without hope that {{he might be able to}} mediate such an accommodation betwixt them and the presbyterian army, as should secure them a safe neutrality during the war which was about to ensue.|$|E
