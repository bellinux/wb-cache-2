40|$|Mutants of the Salmonella phage P 22 which, as prophages, do {{not prevent}} {{the growth of}} superinfecting virulent P 22 phage were isolated. These mutants, called sieA-, retain some ability to exclude the <b>heteroimmune</b> phages L and MG 178. Prophages {{carrying}} mutations at another locus, sieB, lose entirely the ability to exclude the <b>heteroimmune</b> phages. The sic- mutants of Rao (1968) were shown to be sieA-sieB-double mutants. The sieA and sieB loci are located on the P 22 genetic map near the imm 1 and immC regions. The exclusion properties of sieA and sieB alleles are independent of the immunity specificity of the prophage. The A exclusion system (defined by sieA- mutants) appears to be nonspecific and excludes phages P 22, MG 178, or L. The A exclusion system is entirely responsible for the exclusion of generalized transducing particles by P 22 lysogens. The B system, on the other hand, acts only on the <b>heteroimmune</b> phages. The two exclusion systems appear to act independently...|$|E
40|$|Superinfection of Corynebacterium diphtheriae C 7 (beta) by <b>heteroimmune</b> phage gamma is productive, whereas {{superinfection}} by gamma-bin mutants is for {{the most}} part nonproductive. Exclusion of gamma-bin phage occurred after its DNA had penetrated and was partially expressed in the <b>heteroimmune</b> lysogen. All of the infected cells were killed, and lysis was observed. The beta inhibitor causing exclusion was produced during the prophage state and appeared to be distinct from immune repressor. The ability of gamma-bin phage to superinfect C 7 (beta) productively could be restored by recombination with beta phage, indicating that both beta and gamma phages contain either indentical or similar alleles of the bin gene. The bin gene was mapped by vegetative and prophage crosses and found to be located in the region of the phage genome concerned with regulation. Both beta and gamma wild-type phages induced the resident prophage in a significant fraction of superinfeted <b>heteroimmune</b> lysogens. This, coupled with the fact that induction of C 7 (beta) abolished exclusion, suggests that the bin gene product acts as antirepressor, i. e., it reduces the level of <b>heteroimmune</b> repressor either directly or indirectly. The gamma-bin mutants either failed to produce antirepressor or did so with reduced efficiency. Antirepressor activity was negatively controlled by homoimmune repressor. The isolation of beta mutants that appeared bin-like suggests that beta and gamma phages contain homologous systems of exclusion and antiexclusion. Exclusion of gamm-bin by beta phage in gram-positive C. diphtheriae exhibited striking parallels to the sieB exclusion described for phages P 22 and lambda in gram-negative organisms. The extended similarities of these coryngephages to lambda bacteriophage is noted...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} mutants {{derived from the}} {{temperate}} corynebacteriophages βtox+, γtox−, and Ltox+ was isolated and characterized. In three-factor crosses between mutant β phages the relative map order of the genetic markers determining extended host ranges (h and h′) and loss of ability to lysogenize (c) {{was found to be}} h [...] c [...] h′. Recombination between markers was observed in matings between phage β and the <b>heteroimmune</b> corynebacteriophages γ and L. In such matings between <b>heteroimmune</b> phages the c markers of phages β and γ failed to segregate from the imm markers which determine the specificity of lysogenic immunity in these phages. The factor which directs the synthesis of diphtherial toxin during infection of appropriate corynebacterial hosts by toxinogenic corynebacteriophages is designated tox+. It was possible to show that the tox+ determinant of phage β behaves as a single genetic element which occupies a position between the loci h and imm on the genetic map of this phage. Genetic recombination between mutants of phage β occurred at very low frequencies in biparental matings performed by mixed infection of Corynebacterium diphtheriae C 7 s(−) tox−. Considerably higher recombination frequencies were observed when lysogenic bacterial strains carrying one parental phage as prophage were induced by ultraviolet irradiation and then superinfected by the second parental phage. Maximal stimulation of genetic recombination between mutant β phages was detected when superinfection followed ultraviolet irradiation of the lysogenic cells within a limited period of time. In matings between phages with incomplete genetic homology, the stimulation of recombination by ultraviolet radiation was much less effective...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type beta and gamma corynebacteriophages are <b>heteroimmune</b> and infect lysogens of {{each other}} productively. Unlike their {{wild-type}} counterparts, the bin mutants of each phage are excluded in lysogens carrying the <b>heteroimmune</b> phage. The wild-type phages overcome exclusion {{by means of the}} bin gene product which appears to act as an antirepressor. When repression is lifted, exclusion of bin mutants is abolished (N. Groman and M. Rabin, J. Virol. 28 : 28 - 33, 1978; J. Virol. 36 : 526 - 532, 1980). It has not been clear whether the excluding compound is the immune repressor itself or one whose synthesis is positively regulated by repressor. We have isolated beta exclusion mutants (xcl) that as prophage exhibited normal immune repression but no longer excluded gamma-bin mutants. Furthermore, we have shown that an xcl phage with an active immune repressor acted in trans to continue the positive regulation of exclusion by a second xcl+ prophage whose immune repressor was inactivated. From these results it was concluded that there is a gene distinct from the imm gene which is directly or indirectly responsible for exclusion. The xcl gene, mapped in prophage crosses, was located between imm and bin, that is, in the regulatory region of the phage genome. The simplest hypothesis compatible with the established observations is that beta immune repressor regulates the expression of the xcl and bin genes, the former positively and the latter negatively. It is likely that an analogous regulatory model applies to gamma phage since it has already been shown that both beta and gamma have bin alleles...|$|E

SPO 2 lysogenic strains can be grown for many generations in SPO 2 antiserum and remain lysogenic. Phage SPO 2 plates on φ 105 lysogens and phage φ 105 plates on SPO 2 lysogens; this indicates that SPO 2 and φ 105 are <b>heteroimmune.</b> Phage φ 105 plates on an SPO 2 -resistant strain; this indicates that SPO 2 and φ 105 adsorb to different receptor sites on the bacterial surface...|$|E
40|$|A mutant of {{bacteriophage}} P 1 {{that made}} an altered c 1 repressor is described. The mutant c 1 product had two configurations: in lysogens, at high temperatures, it permitted constitutive {{expression of the}} normally repressed DNA replication function ban and was insensitive to the action of ant, a product expressed by the virulent mutant P 1 virs and by the <b>heteroimmune</b> phage P 7 (formerly phiamp+) and normally able to overcome c 1 repression; in mutant lysogens at low temperatures, the mutant repressor was apparently normal (able to repress ban and sensitive to ant action). Genetic studies of this mutant led to the isolation of a derivative that formed unstable lysogens. These studies suggested that the ban product was normally under c 1 control; they further showed that ant overcame c 1 repression by inactivating c 1 rather than by creating a bypass of repressor activity...|$|E
40|$|A {{prophage}} map for corynebacteriophage beta {{consisting of}} seven markers has been constructed and {{compared with the}} vegetative map. The mapping system utilizes <b>heteroimmune</b> double lysogens and capitalizes {{on the fact that}} these double lysogens are very unstable and throw off monolysogenic segregants. The prophage map, produced by characterizing the recombinant phage in these monolysogenic segregants, appears to be a cyclic permutation of the vegetative map with the gene for toxin {{at one end of the}} prophage map and the gene for phage immunity at the other. This permutation is in accord with the Campbell model for insertion of lambda phage if a site between the toxin and immunity genes in the vegetative map is designated as the phage attachment site. The position of the gene for toxin in the prophage map suggests that converting phages may have originated as specialized transducing phages for this gene...|$|E
40|$|The rheumatic disease autoantigen, Ro/SSA, was {{immunogenic}} to {{a rabbit}} host. The <b>heteroimmune</b> rabbit serum bound the Ro/SSA particle in immunoblots {{and in an}} ELISA. Both the rabbit anti-Ro/SSA and a human prototype anti-Ro/SSA serum also bound IgG; and moreover, IgG inhibited both rabbit and human anti-Ro/SSA activity. Anti-IgG activity of the rabbit and human anti-Ro/SSA sera bound Ro/SSA by Western blot and solid-phase assays. In addition, purified Ro/SSA inhibited the anti-IgG activity of the anti-Ro/SSA sera from rabbit and man. Affinity purification of the IgG- and Ro/SSA-binding fractions of the rabbit anti-Ro/SSA demonstrated that both the anti-Ro/SSA and anti-IgG activities were concentrated in these fractions. These data show that Ro/SSA and IgG share epitopes that are bound by anti-Ro/SSA antibody.

40|$|AbstractRetronphage φR 73 {{exhibits}} extensive {{sequence homology}} to the satellite bacteriophage P 4. Bacteriophage P 4 superinfection immunity is elicited {{by a small}} RNA (CI RNA) that causes premature transcription termination within the operon coding for the P 4 replication functions. This control is exerted via interaction of the CI RNA with two complementary target sites on the untranslated leader RNA of the replication operon. We found that φR 73 is endowed with a similar immunity system but is <b>heteroimmune</b> to P 4. The heteroimmunity is due to six base differences in the CI RNA and to compensatory base substitutions in the target sequences. The sequence differences in the CI RNA are all located in single-stranded regions, which appear to play a predominant role in the interaction with the target sites. Analysis of phage carrying a hybrid immunity system indicates that, although two target sequences are required {{for the establishment of}} lysogeny, a single site is sufficient to make a phage sensitive to the prophage immunity...|$|E

Bxb 1 gp 69 is 41 % identical to the L 5 repressor (gp 71) and binds to repressor binding sites that conform to a similar, but distinct, 13 bp asymmetric consensus sequence to that for the L 5 gp 71 binding sites. The two phage repressors have a strong preference for their cognate binding sites, thus accounting for their immunity phenotypes. The Bxb 1 genome contains 34 putative repressor binding sites located throughout the genome, but situated within short intergenic spaces and orientated in only one direction relative to the direction of transcription. Comparison with the locations of repressor binding sites within the L 5 genome provides insights into how these unusual regulatory systems evolve...|$|E
40|$|Defective mutants {{from several}} cistrons of {{bacteriophage}} λ give a normal or subnormal burst following infection of a bacterial strain lysogenic for a closely related but hetero-immune bacteriophage, whereas {{there is no}} phage production on the corresponding, non-lysogenic, strain. This effect ("prophage complementation") results from the induction of prophage genes following the <b>heteroimmune</b> super-infection. Since the control exerted by immunity on these genes can thus be by-passed in trans, one has to conclude that these genes are not directly blocked by immunity; rather, the immunity repressor prevents the synthesis of a diffusible substance which normally operates as an inducer of these genes. The results suggest that gene N has the key role of producing the early inducer. The immunity represser prevents N from operating and thence indirectly blocks the other functions. From a more general viewpoint, the situation described here offers concrete examples of the mechanisms which {{may be involved in}} the orderly expression of a developmental process.

Among the population of survivors, clones were identified that exhibited normal lambda immunity at 30 degrees C, as shown by their ability to prevent the plating of lambda wild type and to support the plating of a nearly identical <b>heteroimmune</b> bacteriophage lambda imm 434. However, when placed at 42 degrees C to inactivate the cIts 857 repressor, these survivor isolates excluded the plating of both lambda wild-type and lambda imm 434 phages, a phenotype designated nonimmune exclusion (Nie). Spontaneous mutants of lambda wild type were isolated that overcame the Nie phenotype and would plaque at 42 degrees C on cell lawns of these isolates. The acquired lambda se mutations suppressed nonimmune exclusion, prevented lysogenization by interrupting repressor expression from PRM, and made the phage insensitive to replicative inhibition.

The cryoglobulins were thus demonstrated to be immune complexes of polyclonal IgG-antilipoprotein-autoantibody and both alpha- and beta-lipoproteins. A part of the lipoprotein-autoantibody immune complexes was not cryoprecipitable. Antigenic determinants for the autoantibody existed in the lipid moieties of lipoproteins, {{in contrast to the}} apoproteins which determined the specificity to <b>heteroimmune</b> antilipoprotein antibody. The presence of more than nine different antigenic determinants against the autoantibody indicated that lipoproteins were immunologically heterogeneous depending upon the lipid moieties. Lipoproteins reactive with the autoantibody varied quantitatively in normal individuals and were not detected in a primary hyper-beta-lipoproteinaemia patient and in a primary biliary liver cirrhosis patient with much lipoprotein-X.

Thirdly, it is the first mycobacteriophage to be described that forms a large prominent halo around plaques on a lawn of M. smegmatis. The sequence of the Bxb 1 genome shows that it possesses a similar overall organization to the genomes of L 5 and D 29 and shares weak but detectable DNA sequence similarity to these phages within the structural genes.

Approximately 1 % of the cells lysogenized by D 108, as with Mu, acquired new auxotrophic mutations. D 108 -induced mutations were nonreverting and were most probably the result of insertion of the D 108 genome into regions of genetic function. D 108 and Mu shared many similar properties but were <b>heteroimmune</b> and had different host ranges. Lytic infections of Mu lysogens with D 108 and D 108 lysogens with Mu resulted in 100 -fold increases in release of phage with prophage markers over those due to spontaneous induction. Phenotypic mixing was common, with most phage carrying the prophage immunity being packaged in particles with the host range of the superinfecting phage. A fraction of the superinfecting phage genomes were, however, packaged in particles with the prophage-specified host range. Although 10 % of the prophage progeny were D 108 -Mu genetic hybrids, superinfecting phage-induced release of the prophage with reciprocal phenotypic mixing occurred in recA hosts, in which the frequency of D 108 -Mu genetic hybrids was reduced 100 -fold...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriophages P 2 and WΦ are <b>heteroimmune</b> {{members of}} the P 2 -like family of {{temperate}} Escherichia coli phages. Temperate phages can grow lytically or form lysogeny after infection. A transcriptional switch that contains two con-vergent promoters, Pe and Pc, and two repressors regulate what life mode to enter. The immunity repressor C is the first gene of the lysogenic operon, and it blocks the early Pe promoter. In this work, some characteristics of the C proteins of P 2 and WΦ are compared. An in vivo genetic analysis shows that WΦ C, like P 2 [*]C, has a strong dimerization activity {{in the absence of}} its DNA target. Both C proteins recognize two directly repeated sequences, termed half-sites and a strong bending is induced in the respective DNA target upon binding. P 2 [*]C is unable to bind to one half-site as opposed to WΦ, but both half-sites are required for repression of WΦ Pe. A reduction from three to two helical turns between the centers of the half-sites in WΦ has no significant effect on the capacity to repress Pe. However, the protein–DNA complexes formed differ, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift experiments. A difference in spontaneous phage production is observed in isogenic lysogens...|$|E

Furthermore, the operators, which contain two directly repeated sequences, vary in sequence, length, location relative to the promoter and spacing between the direct repeats. We have compared the in vivo effects of the wild type and mutated operators on gene expression with the complexes formed between the repressors and their wild type or mutated operators using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and real-time kinetics of the protein–DNA interactions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Using EMSA, the repressors formed different protein–DNA complexes, and only WΦ was significantly affected by point mutations. However, SPR analysis showed a reduced association rate constant and an increased dissociation rate constant for P 2 and WΦ operator mutants. The association rate constants of P 2 Hy dis was too fast to be determined. The P 2 Hy dis dissociation response curves were shown to be triphasic, while both P 2 and WΦ C were biphasic.

The efficiency of plating and prophage induction of the <b>heteroimmune</b> P. aeruginosa phage F 116 L were not affected {{by the presence of}} the cloned c 1 gene of D 3. When the D 3 DNA fragment containing c 1 was subcloned into pBR 322 and introduced into Escherichia coli, it was shown to specifically inhibit the plating of phage lambda and the induction of the lambda prophage by mitomycin C. The plating of lambda imm 434 phage was not affected. Analysis in minicells indicated that these effects correspond to the presence of a plasmid-encoded protein of 36, 000 molecular weight. These data suggest the possibility that coliphage lambda and the P. aeruginosa phage D 3 evolved from a common ancestor. The conservation of the functional similarities of their repressors may have occurred because of the advantage to these temperate phages of capitalizing on the potential of the evolutionarily conserved RecA protein to monitor the level of damage to the host genome...|$|E
40|$|CTXφ is a lysogenic, {{filamentous}} bacteriophage. Its genome {{includes the}} genes encoding cholera toxin (ctxAB), {{one of the}} principal virulence factors of Vibrio cholerae; consequently, nonpathogenic strains of V. cholerae can be converted into toxigenic strains by CTXφ infection. O 139 Calcutta strains of V. cholerae, which were linked to cholera outbreaks in Calcutta, India, in 1996, are novel pathogenic strains that carry two distinct CTX prophages integrated in tandem: CTXET, the prophage previously characterized within El Tor strains, and a new CTX Calcutta prophage (CTXcalc). We found that the CTXcalc prophage gives rise to infectious virions; thus, CTXETφ is no longer the only known vector for transmission of ctxAB. The most functionally significant differences between the nucleotide sequences of CTXcalcφ and CTXETφ are located within the phages’ repressor genes (rstRcalc and rstRET, respectively) and their RstR operators. RstRcalc is a novel, allele-specific repressor that regulates replication of CTXcalcφ by inhibiting the activity of the rstAcalc promoter. RstRcalc has no inhibitory effect upon the classical and El Tor rstA promoters, which are instead regulated by their cognate RstRs. Consequently, production of RstRcalc renders a CTXcalc lysogen immune to superinfection by CTXcalcφ but susceptible (<b>heteroimmune)</b> to infection by CTXETφ. Analysis of the prophage arrays generated by sequentially integrated CTX phages revealed that pathogenic V. cholerae O 139 Calcutta probably arose via infection of an O 139 CTXETφ lysogen by CTXcalcφ...|$|E

RP 2 and RP 3 are of similar shape with flexible tails and contain double-stranded DNA of about 70 % G + C with cohesive ends (group B 1 of bacteriophage classification). The two phages also have identical, very slow, growth kinetics in S. rimosus, with a latent phase of about 6 h and a rise period of about 4 h.

The restriction maps of the two phages are completely different, and hybridization experiments showed only one short region of sequence similarity (less than 430 bp); the two phages are thus essentially unrelated. Both phages lysogenize their hosts by recombination via defined attachment (aft) sites.

40|$|The {{bacteriophage}} P 2 ogr gene encodes an 8. 3 -kDa {{protein that}} is a positive effector of P 2 late gene transcription. The ogr gene is preceded by a promoter sequence (Pogr) resembling a normal Escherichia coli promoter and is located just downstream of a late transcription unit. We analyzed the kinetics and regulation of ogr gene transcription by using an ogr-specific antisense RNA probe in an S 1 mapping assay. During a normal P 2 infection, ogr gene transcription starts from Pogr at an intermediate time between the onset of early and late transcription. At late times after infection the ogr gene is cotranscribed with the late FETUD operon; the ogr gene product thus positively regulates its own synthesis from the P 2 late promoter PF. Expression of the P 2 late genes also requires P 2 DNA replication. Complementation experiments and transcriptional analysis show that a nonreplicating P 2 phage expresses the ogr gene from Pogr but is unable to transcribe the late genes. A P 2 ogr-defective phage makes an increased level of ogr mRNA, consistent with autogenous control from Pogr. Transcription of the ogr gene in the prophage of a P 2 <b>heteroimmune</b> lysogen is stimulated after infection with P 2, suggesting that Pogr is under indirect immunity control and is activated by a yet-unidentified P 2 early gene product during infection...|$|E

Phages mEp 213, mEp 237, and mEp 410 were unable to grow in mEp 167 lysogenic cells, presumably due to an exclusion mechanism expressed constitutively by the mEp 167 repressed prophage. In this work, to analyze the exclusion phenomenon, we constructed a genomic library from mEp 167 phage in a pPROEX derivative plasmid. A DNA fragment containing an open reading frame for a 77 amino acid polypeptide was selected by its ability to confer resistance to <b>heteroimmune</b> phage infection. This ORF shows high amino acid sequence identity with putative Cor proteins of phages HK 022, φ 80 and N 15. Cells expressing the mEp 167 cor gene from a plasmid (Cor+ phenotype) excluded 13 of 20 phages from different infection immunity groups. This exclusion was observed in both tonB− and tonB+ cells. Lambdoid mEp phages that were excluded in these cells were unable to infect cells defective in the outer membrane FhuA receptor (fhuA−). Thus, Cor-mediated exclusion was only observed in fhuA+ cells. Phage production after DNA transfection or the spontaneous induction of mEp prophage in Cor+ cells was not blocked. In addition, ferrichrome uptake, which is mediated by FhuA, was inhibited in Cor+ cells. Our results show that not only phage infection via FhuA but also a FhuA transport activity (ferrichrome uptake) are inhibited by Cor, presumably by inactivation of FhuA...|$|E

Cells containing R factors are sensitive to these phages. Furthermore, R(fi+) factors do not repress the F factor φII restriction system in cells containing both an R(fi+) factor and an F factor. R factors and F factors are <b>heteroimmune</b> episomes. In addition, an R(fi+) factor in cells containing both an R factor and an F factor does not fully repress the expression of F-factor immunity to an incoming second F factor. R-factor and F-factor replication systems are not identical. Wild-type F-factor replication genes will complement the mutant Fts 114 lac+ replication genes in cells containing two F factors. The Fts 114 lac+ episome is retained when these cells are grown at 42 C; however, cells containing an R(fi+) factor and Fts 114 lac+ lose the Fts 114 lac+ when grown at 42 C, {{at the same rate as}} cells containing only the Fts 114 lac+. The replication system of the R(fi+) factor will not complement the mutant Fts 114 lac+ replication system...|$|E
40|$|Many {{species of}} {{bacteria}} harbor multiple prophages in their genomes. Prophages often carry genes that confer a selective {{advantage to the}} bacterium, typically during host colonization. Prophages can convert to infectious viruses through {{a process known as}} induction, which is relevant to the spread of bacterial virulence genes. The paradigm of prophage induction, as set by the phage Lambda model, sees the process initiated by the RecA-stimulated self-proteolysis of the phage repressor. Here we show that a large family of lambdoid prophages found in Salmonella genomes employs an alternative induction strategy. The repressors of these phages are not cleaved upon induction; rather, they are inactivated by the binding of small antirepressor proteins. Formation of the complex causes the repressor to dissociate from DNA. The antirepressor genes lie outside the immunity region and are under direct control of the LexA repressor, thus plugging prophage induction directly into the SOS response. GfoA and GfhA, the antirepressors of Salmonella prophages Gifsy- 1 and Gifsy- 3, each target both of these phages ’ repressors, GfoR and GfhR, even though the latter proteins recognize different operator sites and the two phages are <b>heteroimmune.</b> In contrast, the Gifsy- 2 phage repressor, GtgR, is insensitive to GfoA and GfhA, but is inactivated by an antirepressor from the unrelated Fels- 1 prophage (FsoA). This response is all the more surprising as FsoA is {{under the control of the}} Fels- 1 repressor, not LexA, and plays no apparent role in Fels- 1 induction, which occurs via a Lambda CI-like repressor cleavage mechanism. The ability of antirepressors t...|$|E
40|$|By {{use of the}} Bacillus subtilis {{bacteriophage}} {{cloning vehicle}} phi 105 J 23, B. subtilis chromosomal MboI fragments have been cloned that alleviate the pleiotropic effects of the recE 4 mutation. The recombinant bacteriophages phi 105 Rec phi 1 (3. 85 -kilobase insert) and phi 105 Rec phi 4 (3. 3 -kilobase insert) both conferred on the recE 4 strain YB 1015 resistance to ethylmethane sulfonate, methylmethane sulfonate, mitomycin C, and UV irradiation comparable with the resistance observed in recE+ strains. While strain YB 1015 (recE 4) and its derivatives lysogenized with bacteriophage phi 105 J 23 were not transformed to prototrophy by B. subtilis chromosomal DNA, strain YB 1015 lysogenized with either phi 105 Rec phi 1 or phi 105 Rec phi 4 was susceptible to transformation with homologous B. subtilis chromosomal DNA. The <b>heteroimmune</b> prophages phi 105 and SPO 2 were essentially uninducible in strain YB 1015. Significantly, both recombinant prophages phi 105 Rec phi 1 and phi 105 Rec phi 4 were fully inducible and allowed the spontaneous and mitomycin C-dependent induction of a coresident SPO 2 prophage in a recE 4 host. The presence of the recombinant prophages also restored the ability of din genes to be induced in strains carrying the recE 4 mutation. Finally, both recombinant bacteriophages elaborated a mitomycin C-inducible, 45 -kilodalton protein that was immunoreactive with Escherichia coli recA+ gene product antibodies. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the recE+ gene has been cloned and that this gene elaborates the 45 -kilodalton protein that is involved in SOB induction and homologous recombination...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} actinophages, φS and φL, were {{isolated}} from soil samples by using Streptomyces scabies MR 13, a potato scab pathogen, {{as an indicator}} strain. The phages were partially characterized according to their physicochemical properties, plaques and particles morphology and their host-range. The host-range of these phages was narrow for φS and wide for φL. The adsorption rate constants of the φS and φL were 3. 44 × 10 − 9 and 3. 18 × 10 − 9 ml/min, and their burst sizes were 1. 61 and 3. 75 virions, respectively. One-step growth indicated that φS and φL have a latent period of 30 min followed by a rise period of 30 min. The temperate character of these phages was tested in other isolates of Streptomyces. Four of the phages (φSS 3, φSS 12, φSS 13 and φSS 17) were identified as temperate phages, since {{they were able to}} lysogenize SS 3, SS 12, SS 13 and SS 17. φSS 3, φSS 12 and φSS 13 were homoimmune, and they were <b>heteroimmune</b> with respect to φSS 17. The restriction barriers of lysogenic isolates (SS 12, SS 13 and SS 17) interfered with the blockage of plaques formation by phages (φSS 12, φSS 13 or φSS 17) propagated on them, about 75 % of lysogenic isolates had restriction systems. The exposure of the lysogenic isolates (SS 12, SS 13 and SS 17) to UV-irradiation prevented the possible restriction barriers of these isolates, and these barriers could be overcome...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus subtilis group III {{temperate}} phages do not {{all share}} the same superinfection immunity specificity, thereafter, two main homoimmunity subgroups can be recognized: subgroup I, including SP#beta#, SPR, Z, IG 1, IG 3, IG 4, H 2 and E, and subgroup II, formed by #TETA# 3 T and rho 11. All possible crosses were performed and supported this classification as well as demonstrated <b>heteroimmune</b> reciprocity, in constatnt with previous reports. Transfection/maker rescue assay suggested a gross immunity region mapping in a 23 kb long strech of the arnbitrary left part of #TETA# 3 T genome, 11 kb from the end (Pstl-D,E, Sacl-C, I, K). #TETA# 3 T DNA random conning into a #rho#AM#beta# 1 -derived vector, followed by B. subtilis protoplast transformation and immunity screening, yield a positive clone (#rho#BT 100). Physical mapping and delection analysis narrowed the immunity determination to the arbitrary right one-third part of #rho#BT 100. Phage DNA/plasmid heteroduplex and Southern analyses located the immunity region {{in the middle of}} the left half of #TEA# 3 T (matchnig the previous mapping), rho 11 and SP#beta#physical maps. In addition, since only the right one-third portion hybridized with #TETA# 3 T DNA and the remaing with subgrouyp I phage genomes, we surmise that #rho#BT 100 should have resulted from and in vivo recombination event between the phage DNA and the SP#beta# homologous regions in the bacterial chromosome. Complementation studies, using SP#beta#c 1 and c 2 mutants, proved that the functions(s) encoded in #rho#BT 100 right insert part can totally substitute the c gene product pf SP#beta#(defined as therepressor of lytic pathway) in the maintenance of lysogenyAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Five newly {{isolated}} mycobacteriophages -Angelica, CrimD, Adephagia, Anaya, and Pixie - {{have similar}} genomic architectures to mycobacteriophage TM 4, a previously characterized phage that {{is widely used}} in mycobacterial genetics. The nucleotide sequence similarities warrant grouping these into Cluster K, with subdivision into three subclusters: K 1, K 2, and K 3. Although the overall genome architectures of these phages are similar, TM 4 appears to have lost at least two segments of its genome, a central region containing the integration apparatus, and a segment at the right end. This suggests that TM 4 is a recent derivative of a temperate parent, resolving a long-standing conundrum about its biology, {{in that it was}} reportedly recovered from a lysogenic strain of Mycobacterium avium, but it is not capable of forming lysogens in any mycobacterial host. Like TM 4, all of the Cluster K phages infect both fast- and slow-growing mycobacteria, and all of them - with the exception of TM 4 - form stable lysogens in both Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis; immunity assays show that all five of these phages share the same immune specificity. TM 4 infects these lysogens suggesting that it was either derived from a <b>heteroimmune</b> temperate parent or that it has acquired a virulent phenotype. We have also characterized a widely-used conditionally replicating derivative of TM 4 and identified mutations conferring the temperature-sensitive phenotype. All of the Cluster K phages contain a series of well conserved 13 bp repeats associated with the translation initiation sites of a subset of the genes; approximately one half of these contain an additional sequence feature composed of imperfectly conserved 17 bp inverted repeats separated by a variable spacer. The K 1 phages integrate into the host tmRNA and the Cluster K phages represent potential new tools for the genetics of M. tuberculosis and related species. © 2011 Pope et al...|$|E
