40|$|Responding {{to studies}} on {{prejudice}} in the Greco-Roman world, E. Gruen argues that <b>Greeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romans</b> had more nuanced and complex opinions about foreigners than often recognized. G. observes that the <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romans</b> could discover or invent links with these other societies through cultural appropriations of the past. These connections, G. contends, {{show that the}} <b>Greeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romans</b> cannot be ‘blanketed’ with xenophobia, ethnocentrism, and “let alone racism” (p. 3). G. argues that the <b>Greeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Romans</b> {{were more interested in}} drawing connections with the other through cultural appropriation. G. contends that this approach reveals a positive outlook which does not reject or degrade the foreign other. Rezension zu: Erich S. Gruen, Rethinking the Other in Antiquity (Princeton 2011). ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, Neoclassical {{architectural}} elements {{began to appear in}} the federal style row homes, such as iconic columns in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows.

5|$|In {{the late}} centuries BCE, {{the worship of}} Isis spread from Egypt across the Mediterranean world, and she {{became one of the}} most popular deities in the region. Although this new, {{multicultural}} form of Isis absorbed characteristics from many other deities, her original mythological nature as a wife and mother was key to her appeal. Horus and Osiris, being central figures in her story, spread along with her. The <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> <b>Roman</b> cult of Isis developed a series of initiation rites dedicated to Isis and Osiris, based on earlier Greco-Roman mystery rites but colored by Egyptian afterlife beliefs. The initiate went through an experience that simulated descent into the underworld. Elements of this ritual resemble Osiris's merging with the sun in Egyptian funerary texts. Isis's <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> <b>Roman</b> devotees, like the Egyptians, believed that she protected the dead in the afterlife as she had done for Osiris, and they said that undergoing the initiation guaranteed to them a blessed afterlife. It was to a Greek priestess of Isis that Plutarch wrote his account of the myth of Osiris.|$|E

5|$|Early monasteries {{throughout}} Europe helped preserve <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> <b>Roman</b> classical civilisation. The Church {{eventually became}} the dominant influence in Western civilisation {{into the modern}} age. Many Renaissance figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the Church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the Protestant Reformation, {{as well as in}} the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the Church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.|$|E
5|$|Parts of {{the myth}} appear {{in a wide variety}} of Egyptian texts, from funerary texts and magical spells to short stories. The story is, therefore, more {{detailed}} and more cohesive than any other ancient Egyptian myth. Yet no Egyptian source gives a full account {{of the myth}}, and the sources vary widely in their versions of events. <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> <b>Roman</b> writings, particularly De Iside et Osiride by Plutarch, provide more information but may not always accurately reflect Egyptian beliefs. Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.|$|E
5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along {{with one of his}} reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to argue for the creation of new designs. They brought along classic <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> <b>Roman</b> coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of al-Azhar is {{closely tied to}} the history of Cairo. Materials taken from multiple periods of Egyptian history, from the Ancient Egyptians, through <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> <b>Roman</b> rule, to the Coptic Christian era, were used in the early mosque structure, which drew on other Fatimid structures in Ifriqiya. Later additions from the different rulers of Egypt likewise show influences from both within and outside of Egypt. Sections of the mosque show many of these influences blended together while others show a single inspiration, such as domes from the Ottoman period and minarets built by the Mamluks.|$|E

Of particular note is the entrance hall, which resembles a Roman atrium with marbled columns and a painted ceiling copied from Robert Wood's Ruins of Palmyra.|$|E

5|$|Through {{contact with}} {{neighboring}} civilizations, the Egyptians also adopted foreign deities.

Building on the legacy of ancient <b>Greek</b> <b>and</b> <b>Roman</b> historical writings about Ethiopia, medieval European chroniclers made attempts to describe Ethiopia, its people, and religious faith in connection to the mythical Prester John, who {{was viewed as a}} potential ally against Islamic powers. Ethiopian history and its peoples were also mentioned in works of medieval Islamic historiography and even Chinese encyclopedias, travel literature, and official histories.|$|E
