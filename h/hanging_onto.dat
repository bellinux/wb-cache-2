5|$|Red {{follows a}} {{familiar}} scent and is reunited with her sister, {{a single mother}} with three chicks. The two hunt together and bring food back to the nest for the young. A white pterosaur, one Red has seen since she hatched, helps the two by finding carrion and prey {{in exchange for a}} helping of meat. On one hunting expedition, when the two adult Utahraptor are stalking a herd of Iguanodon, Red spies a young male Utahraptor that is watching their prey. He begins a courtship dance for Red, but Red's sister chases him off, hissing. Her growls agitate the Iguanodon, who stampede; the male hastily leaves. After climbing into a tree to escape a flash flood, Red encounters the male raptor again, who performs a courtship dance while <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> the tree branches. Red's sister begrudgingly allows the male to stay with them, provided he steers clear of her chicks.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} operatic début in 1920 as Faust at the Poltava theatre, where he sang until 1923. He {{followed}} this with engagements at the Kharkiv opera in 1923-4, and the Yekaterinburg (then called Sverdlovsk) opera theatre in 1924-6, before {{becoming one of}} the leading tenors at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow from 1926 to 1954. He had a memorable audition at the Bolshoi in 1924, reportedly reaching the highest notes of the register with ease (throughout his career, he developed a reputation for singing the highest note possible and <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> it for the added adulation). At the Bolshoi, he came under the mentorship of Leonid Sobinov, the leading Russian tenor at the time. Kozlovsky went on to sing in over 50 operas as the leading tenor of the Bolshoi.|$|E
25|$|On 29 October, after James Tien of the pro-Beijing Liberal Party urged Leung to {{consider}} resigning {{in a public}} interview on 24 October, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee convened to discuss Tien's removal from the body as a move to whip the pro-establishment camp into supporting Leung and the country. Tien, a long-time critic of Leung, said that Leung's position was no longer tenable as Hong Kong people no longer trusted his administration, and that his <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> office would only exacerbate the divisions in society. Tien stepped down from his position {{as the leader of}} the Liberal Party after the removal. Lester Shum refused bail extension based on conditions imposed after his arrest on 26 September, and was released unconditionally by police. That day was also the day of the Umbrella Ultra Marathon event.|$|E

Not being able to board the train, the guard outside the train, <b>hanging</b> grimly <b>onto</b> the {{carriage}} door, in imminent danger of being crushed {{on the side of}} the Railway Bridge as it passed under it. The train was stopped in time and the guard was not injured. During WW2 a plane crashed onto the railway line close to the station and the train coming from Camelford had to be stopped before a collision took place.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{cases of}} {{epilepsy}} and of madness were identified due to physical or moral persecutions undergone in the camps.

500|$|Percussionist Shawn Crahan {{said the}} band {{made an effort}} to pay more {{attention}} to detail than usual during the tour, noting, [...] "when you've got a microphone <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> your every note, you tend to give maybe 115 percent instead of 110 percent". The album begins with a staged vocal introduction which was recorded before a concert, informing the audience that the band would not be performing, in an effort to incite anger in the crowd. 9.0: Live includes tracks from the band's first three studio albums, and the banned track [...] "Purity" [...] which was removed from the band's debut album, Slipknot, due to copyright issues.

500|$|In {{the second}} main event, Hiroshi Tanahashi defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Kazuchika Okada. The {{challenger}} controlled the early match with a <b>hanging</b> DDT <b>onto</b> the floor, a [...] Heavy Rain (Death Valley driver) on the entrance ramp, and the D.I.D. submission. After they battled {{on the top}} rope, Tanahashi missed a High Fly Flow but countered Okada's Rainmaker. The momentum shifted to Tanahashi as he performed a dragon screw legwhip and continued attacking Okada's leg. Tanahashi later dove off the top rope and over the guard rail with a High Fly Flow crossbody to Okada on the floor outside of the ring. After Tanahashi tried another High Fly Flow crossbody back in the ring, Okada rolled through for a Tombstone piledriver, which Tanahashi countered with his own Tombstone. Although Tanahashi landed a High Fly Flow to Okada's back and a traditional High Fly Flow frog splash, Okada kicked out at two for a nearfall.|$|R
50|$|The Detour was {{a choice}} between Relic or Ripe. In Relic, teams {{traveled}} to a nearby rainforest, Manuel Antonio National Park, where they had to search for four Mayan relics on six road bridges. Once they delivered each of these relics to an archaeologist, they would receive the next clue. In Ripe, teams traveled to the Frutas Selectas del Tropico banana plantation, where they had to gather 15 bushels of bananas and load them <b>onto</b> <b>hanging</b> tracks. Teams then had to use a local pulling-system to haul the fruit to the distribution center. Once delivered, the foreman would give them their next clue.|$|R
5000|$|The fault was studied {{again in}} the late 1990s in the Loma Alta Park near Millard Canyon where a fault scarp larger than 2 m was {{accessible}} along a (late quaternary) elevated stream terrace. The clearly defined fault was exposed in the trench and emerged as a [...]5 m band of coarse gravels lining the hanging wall. By studying the truncated rocks and a wedge-shaped accumulation of gravel and soil, {{it was possible to}} visually reconstruct the original geometry of the rock prior to the thrust and eventual and partial collapse of the <b>hanging</b> wall back <b>onto</b> the footwall. An estimate for the maximum slip of the event was given as 3.8 - 4 m.|$|R
500|$|An {{alternative}} ending {{was made}} for the special which was never broadcast, but was put as an extra on the DVD. In {{this version of the}} ending, when Mac sees Caroline floating away, he runs down the stairs and out of the castle to save her. Caroline begins to descend, and both Mac and Guy grab hold of one her legs to bring her down, but instead they are lifted into the air with her. While the three fly away Caroline exclaims [...] "We're all going to die!", to which Mac quite sternly says [...] "Caroline, there's something I've been meaning to tell you", opening the possibility that Mac is not going to die. Meanwhile, Alan and Joanna, after walking into the sea, are last seen <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> a buoy waiting to drown. They are still talking and waiting for the ocean to drown them.|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} {{years of her}} time in the soap, Pauline changes from a caring mother into a more {{inflexible}} battle-axe. Pauline's relationship with Martin is often shown to be strained by Pauline's refusal to release control over his life. Though initially a teenage delinquent, following Mark's death in 2004, Martin becomes Pauline's [...] "dutiful son", forced to put his mother's wishes above those of his wife—a recurring theme within the serial. Eventually, this causes a rift between the two characters. When Martin goes against his mother's wishes in 2006 and rekindles a romance with his adulterous ex-wife Sonia, Pauline cuts him out of her life. Television personality Paul O'Grady addressed Pauline's refusal to [...] "share her son like a normal mother", commenting, [...] "she's suspicious of anybody that comes into the family who wants to take her son away from her. She has already lost one son; she has lost her husband, so she's <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> the last [...] like a mother tiger with her cub." ...|$|E
500|$|The famous Glen Rose {{trackway}} {{on display}} in New York City includes theropod footprints belonging to several individuals which moved {{in the same direction}} as up to twelve sauropod dinosaurs. The theropod prints are sometimes found on top of the sauropod footprints, indicating that they were formed later. This has been put forth as evidence that a small pack of Acrocanthosaurus was stalking a herd of sauropods. While interesting and plausible, this hypothesis is difficult to prove and other explanations exist. For example, several solitary theropods may have moved through in the same direction at different times after the sauropods had passed, creating the appearance of a pack stalking its prey. The same can be said for the purported [...] "herd" [...] of sauropods, who also may or may not have been moving as a group. At a point where it crosses the path of one of the sauropods, one of the theropod trackways is missing a footprint, which has been cited as evidence of an attack. However, other scientists doubt the validity of this interpretation because the sauropod did not change gait, as would be expected if a large predator were <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> its side.|$|E
40|$|A {{selective}} {{and sensitive}} method for determination of copper in blood by adsorptive differential pulse cathodic stripping voltammetry is presented. The method {{is based on}} adsorptive accumulation of the complexes of Cu (II) ions with benzenesulfonyl hydrazide <b>onto</b> <b>hanging</b> mercury drop electrode (HMDE), followed by {{the reduction of the}} adsorbed species by differential pulse cathodic stripping voltammetry. The effect of various parameters such as supporting electrolyte, concentration of benzenesulfonyl hydrazide, accumulation potential, accumulation time and stirring rate on the selectivity and sensitivity were studied. The optimum conditions for determination of copper include perchloric acid 0. 03 M, concentration of benzenesulfonyl hydrazide 7. 5 × 10 - 5 M, the accumulation potential of - 350 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl), the accumulation time of 50 s, and the scan rate of 50 mV s- 1. Under optimized conditions, linear calibration curves were established for the concentration of Cu (II) in the range of 0. 62 - 275 ng mL- 1, with detection limit of 0. 186 ng mL- 1 for Cu (II). The procedure was successfully applied to the determination of copper ion in whole blood samples. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{salinity}} on {{the release of}} copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) in tailing sediment have been studied by stripping voltammetry. The purpose of the research is to know the effect of salinity on the release of metals with certain pH, conductivity and variety of metals. Simultaneous determination of copper, lead and zinc in tailing was done by Differential Pulse Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (DPASV) <b>onto</b> <b>hanging</b> mercury drop electrode (HMDE) and nitric acid 65 % as support electrolyte. The limit of detection for this method 0. 60 µg/L, 0. 150 µg/L and 0. 238 µg/L for copper, lead and iMc respectively. The stripping solution of 300 / 00 salinity with pH= 7. 85, conductivity= 46. 62 mS/cm gives the amounts of released metals as follows : 14. 867 µg/L Cu, 0. 976 µg/L Pb and 6. 224 µg/L Zn. These results are higher {{as compared with the}} results from 15 0 / 00 salinity with pH= 7. 66, conductivity= 23. 22 mS/cm that give released metals of Cu= 7. 988 µg/L, Pb= 0. 311 µg/L and Zn= 4. 699 µg/L. the results from ANOVA suggest that this is due to different in salinity of the solution. It also found that the conductivity does not give any effect. It can be concluded that the higher salinity will that give higher concentration or released metals...|$|R
500|$|Asked {{to assess}} his {{personal}} performance {{after the loss}} to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, [...] "I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said {{he did not want to}} hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> the ball.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Renner, {{who played}} the film's adult Hansel, has stated that his initial {{attraction}} came from a one sheet he was given even before seeing the script, showing Hansel and Gretel walking away and a witch burning at {{a stake in the}} background, which he found [...] "incredibly interesting" [...] (this scene was included in the finished film). He added, [...] "When I read the script, my first thought was, 'I can’t believe this hasn’t been done yet.' It’s such a great idea with so much potential. That dynamic was definitely a big thing, I loved that what Tommy [...] wrote left so much room for character." [...] Wirkola said he wanted Renner in the role after seeing him in The Hurt Locker. Wirkola, who described Hansel as the [...] "loose cannon" [...] of the duo, gave him an additional character flaw of diabetes, in addition to the psychological scars that Hansel shares with his sister (in the original idea for the short film, Gretel was also suffering from eating disorder). Renner said it was a great escape for him [...] "as this was a fairytale with no stress like the other action movies I'd done recently. I was having so much fun hanging on a wire like Peter Pan, <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> a broom and doing other crazy stuff." [...] He stated, [...] "That {{was one of the most}} fun jobs I’ve ever had because there’s something magical about that old world, fantasy thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The harvest {{window for}} the grape {{tends to be}} very short once it reaches peak ripeness, with acidity rapidly falling and the grapes soon desiccating and {{developing}} [...] "prune-y" [...] flavors.

2500|$|Miller also purged the {{executive}} board that had been appointed under the Boyle administration. Miller dismissed 20 of the 24 board members, then named 13 {{of his own and}} seven of Yablonski's supporters to the board. Miller believed he had given himself a solid majority on the board, but to his dismay Boyle cronies still dominated the board. [...] Miller assumed that miners who had won election in 1972 were MFD supporters. But many were actually Boyle men who had been elected by the rank-and-file merely because they were better known than the MFD candidates. They had supported MFD as a means of <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> power, not because they supported Miller or the democracy movement.

2500|$|Eventually, {{with only}} one Spanish soldier {{remaining}} unhurt, the captain practically unconscious, and the aggression of the Indians only increasing, they decided then that their only recourse was to form a close phalanx and break out of their encirclement {{in the direction of}} the launches, and to return to board them [...] leaving behind the water jugs [...] and get back to the ships. Fortunately for them, the Indians hadn't concerned themselves to take away the boats or to render them useless, as they might easily have done. When attacking the retreating boats with arrows, stones, and pikes they made a particular effort to interfere with their balance by weight and impact, and ended up dumping some of the Spaniards into the water.

2500|$|King {{called an}} {{election}} in 1925, in which the Conservatives won the most seats, but not {{a majority in the}} House of Commons. King held onto power {{with the support of the}} Progressives. A corruption scandal discovered late in his first term involved misdeeds around the expansion of the Beauharnois Canal in Quebec; this led to extensive inquiries and eventually a Royal Commission, which exposed the Beauharnois Scandal. The resulting press coverage damaged King's party in the election. Early in his second term, another corruption scandal, this time in the Department of Customs, was revealed, which led to more support for the Conservatives and Progressives, and the possibility that King would be forced to resign, if he lost sufficient support in the Commons. King had no personal connection to this scandal, although one of his own appointees was at the heart of it. Opposition leader Meighen unleashed his fierce invective towards King, stating he was <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> power [...] "like a lobster with lockjaw".` ...|$|E
2500|$|Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was {{particularly}} keen to recruit Grace and, in 1869, {{he became a}} member after being proposed by the treasurer, Thomas Burgoyne, and seconded by the secretary, Robert Allan Fitzgerald. One of the ongoing issues of 1860s cricket was a dispute between the northern professionals, led by George Parr, and Surrey, such that they refused to play at The Oval. There were even fears that the professionals would break away and form their own cricket organisation, rather as happened in rugby football in the 1890s. Grace was already the greatest attraction cricket had ever known and large crowds attended every match he played in. MCC feared the loss of its authority should Grace [...] "throw in his lot with the professionals" [...] so it was considered vital {{for them and their}} interests to get him onside.

The company agreed to build a number of full-scale prototypes, and Young moved to Buffalo. With the main Bell factories immersed in war production, and to ensure a research and development program that was sufficiently private and free of distractions, Young and his team moved to the Buffalo suburb of Gardenville (West Seneca). The Ship 1 prototype's first serious mishap occurred near {{the very end of}} 1942 in captive testing, when a Bell corporate pilot asked to try the Ship 1, while not using a seat belt and <b>hanging</b> <b>onto</b> the controls instead to stay in the open cockpit - this captive flight attempt resulted in the rotor system [...] "going through resonance" [...] as designer Arthur Young had warned about, resulting in a [...] "bucking" [...] instability and accident which cracked the rotor blades loose.
