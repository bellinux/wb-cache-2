5|$|Making {{landfall}} {{near the}} border between Mexico and British Honduras, the latter colony's Corozal and Orange Walk districts, containing a population of 15,500at the time, experienced severe devastation from Janet. Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across British Honduras, particularly in the Freshwater Creek <b>Forest</b> <b>Preserve.</b> There, an estimated 30%of all trees had been damaged, especially mahogany and sapodilla trees. Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631million in damages. Fruit trees, maize, and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage. Sugar cane was {{expected to have a}} 20%decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. Pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the Belize District and several of British Honduras' offshore cayes. Similar to Corozal and Orange Walk Districts, corn, trees, and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop.|$|E
5|$|NY373 exists entirely {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of Adirondack Park, a protected area maintained by the State of New York. Adirondack Park was created in the 1880s after concerns arose about logging trees in the area. The logging was a substantial part of New York's economy, but protests were lodged by The New York Times and others against the clearing of entire mountains and wilderness areas of trees. Public opinion turned firmly against the loggers by the 1880s, and the park was created in 1885. It was the first State <b>Forest</b> <b>Preserve</b> in America. The park was further protected in 1894 when a clause was added to the New York State constitution which banned the selling of timber from state parks.|$|E

The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing.

Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the state {{replaced}} the 1918 cabin {{with the current}} one. Unlike older observer's cabins in the <b>Forest</b> <b>Preserve,</b> the one on Balsam Lake lacks a porch. This was the most significant change to any aspect of the fire tower complex after {{the construction of the}} current tower. During that time the observers were busy. A drought in 1962 led to many fires, and similar conditions the following year resulted in Governor Nelson Rockefeller ordering the closing of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Preserve</b> in 1963 and again for short periods the following year.|$|E
25|$|George Profous, a {{forester}} {{for what}} had by then become the state's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) wrote in an early 1990s planning document that the aged, deteriorating tower should be dismantled and removed, not only due to its age but because, out of use, {{it was no longer}} permitted on state-owned <b>Forest</b> <b>Preserve</b> land, which New York's constitution requires be kept forever wild. Worried residents of Denning and the nearby hamlet of Claryville contacted the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, a regional advocacy group, to see what they could do to save it, a development Profous had been hoping for. DEC's guidelines governing the use of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Preserve</b> do allow the retention of otherwise incompatible structures within it if they enhance the public's understanding of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Preserve,</b> and many visitors and past observers wrote about how seeing the vastness of the Catskill wildlands at once helped them appreciate the importance of protecting it.|$|E

25|$|Despite being closed after fire lookouts were {{no longer}} needed in 1990, its {{staircase}} and cab remained easily accessible to visitors and it was frequently climbed to provide a 360-degree view not normally found in the Catskills. Later, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), which administers the <b>Forest</b> <b>Preserve,</b> decided that instead of tearing it down matching funds should be raised from the nearby communities to renovate and reopen it, {{along with the other}} four remaining towers in the Catskills, to educate the public and enhance its understanding of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Preserve.</b> In 1997 it was further protected when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and after renovations it was reopened to the public in 2000.

In 2008 an updated Catskill State Land Master Plan combined the North Mountain, Windham High Peak and Blackhead Range Wild Forests into one new unit, the Windham-Blackhead Range Wilderness.
