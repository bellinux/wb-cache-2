50|$|The mind {{must always}} be {{in the state of}} 'flowing,' for when it stops {{anywhere}} that means the flow is interrupted and it is this interruption that is injurious to the well-being of the mind. In the case of the swordsman, it means death. When the swordsman stands against his opponent, he is not to think of the opponent, nor of himself, nor of his enemy's sword movements. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> with his sword which, forgetful of all technique, is ready only to follow the dictates of the subconscious. The man has effaced himself as the wielder of the sword. When he strikes, it is not the man but the sword in the hand of the man's subconscious that strikes.|$|R
50|$|While at school, a bully named Carl Rudnick {{makes fun of}} Andrew {{because he}} only stands on the side during recess and does not talk to the other children. During a game of baseball, when another child hits the ball in Andrew's direction, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> and lets the ball {{fall to the ground}} and roll away. This makes Carl furious and he yells at Andrew, who {{responds}} by urinating on Carl. The principal calls both Gail and Carl's mother. Mrs. Rudnick calls Andrew a freak and says that he should not be in public school, even yelling at Andrew after he apologizes. After Carl and his mother leave, Gail has a discussion with the principal. He wants to hold Andrew back, but she refuses and takes him out of the school.|$|R
60|$|At {{any rate}} he calmed down Aunt Dahlia, the nearest {{thing to a}} {{charging}} rhinoceros, in under five seconds. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> looking respectful, and though I didn't time the thing--not having a stop-watch on me--I should say it wasn't more than three seconds and a quarter before her whole manner underwent an astounding change for the better. She melted before one's eyes.|$|E

You'd never have taken him for the little white-headed snipe that the girls used to order about and make fun of. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> for a minute, looking at Myra with a {{peculiar}} little smile on his face; {{and then he says}} to her, slow, and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth: ...|$|E
60|$|Dale divined {{what he had}} suspected. Helen's {{sister had}} been carried off. Yet, while his quick mind grasped Helen's broken spirit--the {{unbalance}} that was reason for this marvelous and glorious act--he did not take other meaning of the embrace to himself. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> transported, charged like a tree struck by lightning, making sure with all his keen senses, {{so that he could}} feel forever, how she was clinging round his neck, her face over his bursting heart, her quivering form close pressed to his.|$|E
6000|$|Gertrude Oliver {{looked at}} him from her corner and shivered again. She had enjoyed the party herself, after all, for she had foregathered with a Charlottetown {{acquaintance}} who, being a stranger and much older {{than most of the}} guests, felt himself rather out of it, and had been glad to fall in with this clever girl who could talk of world doings and outside events with the zest and vigour of a man. In the pleasure of his society she had forgotten some of her misgivings of the day. Now they suddenly returned to her. What news did Jack Elliott bring? Lines from an old poem flashed unbidden into her mind--"there was a sound of revelry by night"--"Hush! Hark! A deep sound strikes like a rising knell"--why should she think of that now? Why didn't Jack Elliott speak--if he had anything to tell? Why did <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there,</b> glowering importantly? ...|$|R
50|$|Known by {{the late}} 1960s {{primarily}} as a young theorist, publishing articles in New Left Notes and other movement publications, {{he went on to}} play an organizing role in the April-May 1968 Columbia student strike. On April 4, 1968 Gilbert had his first arrest after walking into a police riot where 6 officers were beating a kid. <b>He</b> could not <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> and allow it to continue so police turned on him. His charge was assaulting a police officer (apparently the officer scraped his hand when he tried to hit Gilbert in the head with his baton). His lawyer advised him to take a plea bargain because going to trial would mean the word of six officers against his. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was fined $50.|$|R
6000|$|... "Akut!" [...] he thought. [...] "Good! Tantor knew Akut well. He {{would let}} him approach." [...] Raising his voice Korak replied to {{the call of the}} ape; but he let Tantor move off with him through the jungle; it would do no harm to try the other plan. They had come to a {{clearing}} and plainly Korak smelled water. Here was a good place and a good excuse. He ordered Tantor to lay him down, and go and fetch him water in his trunk. The big beast deposited him upon the grass {{in the center of the}} clearing, then he stood with cocked ears and attentive trunk, searching for the slightest indication of danger--there seemed to be none and he moved away in the direction of the little brook that Korak knew was some two or three hundred yards away. The ape-man could scarce help smiling as he thought how cleverly he had tricked his friend; but well as he knew Tantor he little guessed the guile of his cunning brain. The animal ambled off across the clearing and disappeared in the jungle beyond in the direction of the stream; but scarce had his great bulk been screened by the dense foliage than he wheeled about and came cautiously back to the edge of the clearing where he could see without being seen. Tantor, by nature, is suspicious. Now he still feared the return of the she Tarmangani who had attempted to attack his Korak. <b>He</b> would <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> for a moment and assure himself that all was well before he continued on toward the water. Ah! It was well that he did! There she was now dropping from the branches of a tree across the clearing and running swiftly toward the ape-man. Tantor waited. He would let her reach Korak before he charged--that would ensure that she had no chance of escape. His little eyes blazed savagely. His tail was elevated stiffly. He could scarce restrain a desire to trumpet forth his rage to the world. Meriem was almost at Korak's side when Tantor saw the long knife in her hand, and then he broke forth from the jungle, bellowing horribly, and charged down upon the frail girl.|$|R
6000|$|Kennicott was suspicious, but Aunt Bessie, {{serving the}} {{floating}} island pudding, agreed, [...] "Yes, it is wonderful. Folks {{can get away}} with all sorts of meannesses and sins in these terrible cities, but they can't here. I was noticing this tailor fellow this morning, and when Mrs. Riggs offered to share her hymn-book with him, he shook his head, and all the while we was singing <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> like a bump on a log and never opened his mouth. Everybody says he's got an idea that he's got so much better manners and all than what the rest of us have, but if that's what he calls good manners, I want to know!" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, if Wilton had had any {{inductive}} {{reasoning in}} his composition at all, {{he would have}} been tremendously elated. A girl does not creep out to a distant cove at Marois Bay unless she is unhappy; and if Mary Campbell was unhappy she must be unhappy about him; and if she was unhappy about him {{all he had to do}} was to show a bit of determination and get the whole thing straightened out. But Wilton, whom grief had reduced to the mental level of an oyster, did not reason this out; and the sight of her deprived him of practically all his faculties, including speech. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> and yammered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Billie emphatically. [...] "I {{think the}} most terrible {{thing in the world}} is a man who tries to {{entertain}} when he can't. Did I tell you about the man on board ship, father, at the ship's concert? Oh, it was the most awful thing you ever saw. Everybody was talking about it!" [...] She beamed round the table, and there was a note of fresh girlish gaiety in her voice. [...] "This man got up to do an imitation of somebody--nobody knows to this day who it was meant to be--and he came into the saloon and directly he saw the audience he got stage fright. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> gurgling and not saying a word, and then suddenly his nerve failed him altogether and he turned and tore out of the room like a rabbit. He absolutely ran! And he hadn't said a word! It was the most ridiculous exhibition I've ever seen!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{uttered a}} little sound which had pain in it, {{and she felt}} a real pang of compunction. He had gripped {{the back of a}} chair; his face had lost its heaviness. A dull flush {{coloured}} his cheeks. Noel had a feeling, {{as if she had been}} convicted of treachery. It was his silence, the curious look of an impersonal pain beyond power of words; she felt in him something much deeper than mere disapproval--something which echoed within herself. She walked quickly past him and escaped. She ran upstairs and threw herself on her bed. He was nothing: it was not that! It was in herself, the awful feeling, for the first time developed and poignant, that she had betrayed her caste, forfeited the right to be thought a lady, betrayed her secret reserve and refinement, repaid with black ingratitude the love lavished on her up bringing, by behaving like any uncared-for common girl. She had never felt this before--not even when Gratian first heard of it, and they had stood one at each end of the hearth, unable to speak. Then she still had her passion, and her grief for the dead. That was gone now as if it had never been; and she had no defence, nothing between her and this crushing humiliation and chagrin. She had been mad! She must have been mad! The Belgian Barra was right: [...] "All a little mad" [...] in this [...] "forcing-house" [...] of a war! She buried her face deep in the pillow, till it almost stopped her power of breathing; her head and cheeks and ears seemed to be on fire. If only he had shown disgust, done something which roused her temper, her sense of justice, her feeling that Fate had been too cruel to her; but <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> bewilderment incarnate, like a creature with some very deep illusion shattered. It was horrible! Then, feeling that she could not stay still, must walk, run, get away somehow from this feeling of treachery and betrayal, she sprang up. All was quiet below, and she slipped downstairs and out, speeding along with no knowledge of direction, taking the way she had taken day after day to her hospital. It was the last of April, trees and shrubs were luscious with blossom and leaf; the dogs ran gaily; people had almost happy faces in the sunshine. 'If I could get away from myself, I wouldn't care,' she thought. Easy to get away from people, from London, even from England perhaps; but from oneself--impossible! She passed her hospital; and looked at it dully, at the Red Cross flag against its stucco wall, and a soldier in his blue slops and red tie, coming out. She had spent many miserable hours there, but none quite so miserable as this. She passed the church opposite to the flats where Leila lived, and running suddenly into a tall man coming round the corner, saw Fort. She bent her head, and tried to hurry past. But his hand was held out, she could not help putting hers into it; and looking up hardily, she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, {{all through}} the circus they done the most {{astonishing}} things; {{and all the time}} that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever COULD think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn't noway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year. And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring--said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, [...] "Knock him down! throw him out!" [...] and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy. It warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire too. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> up <b>there,</b> a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his life--and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum--and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.|$|R

6000|$|... "I was {{standing}} on the platform waiting for the people to let me into the car, and this beast, this conductor, hollered at me, 'Come on, you, move up!' Why, I've never had anybody speak to me that way in all my life! I was so astonished I just turned to him and said--I thought there must be some mistake, and so I said to him, perfectly pleasant, 'Were you speaking to me?' and he went on and bellowed at me, 'Yes, I was! You're keeping the whole car from starting!' he said, and then I saw he was one of these dirty ill-bred hogs that kindness is wasted on, and so I stopped and looked right at him, and I said, 'I--beg--your--pardon, I am not doing anything of the kind,' I said, 'it's the people ahead of me, who won't move up,' I said, 'and furthermore, let me tell you, young man, that you're a low-down, foul-mouthed, impertinent skunk,' I said, 'and you're no gentleman! I certainly intend to report you, and we'll see,' I said, 'whether a lady is to be insulted by any drunken bum that chooses to put on a ragged uniform, and I'd thank you,' I said, 'to keep your filthy abuse to yourself.' And then I waited for Paul to show he was half a man and come to my defense, and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> and pretended he hadn't heard a word, and so I said to him, 'Well,' I said--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think he}} could do more than perhaps look upon that {{straight}} path. He {{seemed to have been}} puzzled by what he saw, for he interrupted himself in his narrative more than once to exclaim, [...] "He nearly slipped from me there. I could not make him out. Who was he?" [...] And after glaring at me wildly he would go on, jubilating and sneering. To me the conversation of these two across the creek appears now as the deadliest kind of duel on which Fate looked on with her cold-eyed knowledge of the end. No, he didn't turn Jim's soul inside out, but I am much mistaken if the spirit so utterly out of his reach had not been made to taste to the full the bitterness of that contest. These were the emissaries with whom the world he had renounced was pursuing him in his retreat--white men from [...] "out there" [...] where he did not think himself good enough to live. This was all that came to him--a menace, a shock, a danger to his work. I suppose it is this sad, half-resentful, half-resigned feeling, piercing through the few words Jim said now and then, that puzzled Brown so much in the reading of his character. Some great men owe most of their greatness to the ability of detecting in those they destine for their tools the exact quality of strength that matters for their work; and Brown, as though he had been really great, had a satanic gift of finding out the best and the weakest spot in his victims. He admitted to me that Jim wasn't of the sort that can be got over by truckling, and accordingly he took care to show himself as a man confronting without dismay ill-luck, censure, and disaster. The smuggling of a few guns was no great crime, he pointed out. As to coming to Patusan, who had the right to say he hadn't come to beg? The infernal people here let loose at him from both banks without staying to ask questions. He made the point brazenly, for, in truth, Dain Waris's energetic action had prevented the greatest calamities; because Brown told me distinctly that, perceiving the size of the place, he had resolved instantly in his mind that as soon as he had gained a footing he would set fire right and left, and begin by shooting down everything living in sight, in order to cow and terrify the population. The disproportion of forces was so great that this was the only way giving him the slightest chance of attaining his ends--he argued in a fit of coughing. But he didn't tell Jim this. As to the hardships and starvation they had gone through, these had been very real; it was enough to look at his band. He made, at the sound of a shrill whistle, all his men appear standing in a row on the logs in full view, so that Jim could see them. For the killing of the man, it had been done--well, it had--but was not this war, bloody war--in a corner? and the fellow had been killed cleanly, shot through the chest, not like that poor devil of his lying now in the creek. They had to listen to him dying for six hours, with his entrails torn with slugs. At any rate this was a life for a life. [...] . And all this was said with the weariness, with the recklessness of a man spurred on and on by ill-luck till he cares not where he runs. When he asked Jim, with a sort of brusque despairing frankness, whether he himself--straight now--didn't understand that when [...] "it came to saving one's life in the dark, one didn't care who else went--three, thirty, three hundred people"--it was as if a demon had been whispering advice in his ear. [...] "I made him wince," [...] boasted Brown to me. [...] "He very soon left off coming the righteous over me. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> with nothing to say, and looking as black as thunder--not at me--on the ground." [...] He asked Jim whether he had nothing fishy in his life to remember that he was so damnedly hard upon a man {{trying to get out of}} a deadly hole by the first means that came to hand--and so on, and so on. And there ran through the rough talk a vein of subtle reference to their common blood, an assumption of common experience; a sickening suggestion of common guilt, of secret knowledge that was like a bond of their minds and of their hearts.|$|E
