5000|$|The American elm {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to Dutch elm disease (DED) and elm yellows. In north America, {{there are three}} species of <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> beetles; one native: Hylurgopinus rufipes ("native <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> beetle"), and two invasive: Scolytus multistriatus ("smaller <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> beetle") and Scolytus schevyrewi ("banded <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> beetle"). Although intensive feeding by <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> can kill weakened trees, [...] their main impact is as vectors of DED.|$|R

50|$|Scolytus multistriatus, the <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> {{or smaller}} <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a bark beetle {{species in the}} genus Scolytus. In Europe, while S. multistriatus acts as vector of the Dutch elm disease, caused by the Ascomycota Ophiostoma ulmi, it is much less {{effective}} than the large elm bark beetle, S. scolytus.|$|E
50|$|Scolytus scolytus, {{the larger}} <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> or large elm bark beetle, is a 3.5-6 mm long bark beetle species. It is of {{significant}} importance in Eurasia as a vector of Dutch elm disease.|$|E
50|$|Scolytus is a genus of {{bark beetles}} (subfamily Scolytinae). It {{includes}} several species notorious for destroying {{trees in the}} forests. The Dutch elm disease is spread in North America by two species : the native elm bark beetle, Hylurgopinus rufipes, and the <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> Scolytus multistriatus. In Europe, while the aforementioned Scolytus multistriatus again acts as vector for infection, it is much less effective than the large elm bark beetle Scolytus scolytus.|$|E

5000|$|Hylurgopinus rufipes, {{known as}} the native <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a species of <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> in the tribe Hylesinini (crenulate <b>bark</b> <b>beetles).</b> It is found in Canada and USA. It is of {{particular}} importance as a vector of Dutch elm disease. It is brownish-red in color and its size ranges from 2.34 mm to 2.9 mm.|$|R
50|$|The {{compound}} {{exists in}} several diastereomic forms, {{depending on the}} positions of the methyl groups. Only the natural stereoisomer, α-multistriatin, attracts the <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Scolytus schevyrewi, the banded elm {{bark beetle}}, is a 3-4 mm long elm bark beetle {{species in the}} genus Scolytus native from Asia and accidentally {{introduced}} to North America. It is a vector of the Dutch elm disease, caused by the Ascomycota Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi. In North America, it is displacing both the native elm bark beetle and the previously introduced smaller <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> which are becoming less common in their range with the expansion of S. schevyrewi.|$|E
50|$|Bark beetles (family Scolytidae) are {{important}} symbiotic partners of ascomycetes. The female beetles transport fungal spores to new hosts in characteristic tucks in their skin, the mycetangia. The beetle tunnels {{into the wood}} and into large chambers in which they lay their eggs. Spores released from the mycetangia germinate into hyphae, which can break down the wood. The beetle larvae then feed on the fungal mycelium, and, on reaching maturity, carry new spores with them to renew the cycle of infection. A well-known {{example of this is}} Dutch elm disease, caused by Ophiostoma ulmi, which is carried by the <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> Scolytus multistriatus.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} of American elm trees {{planted on the}} Mall and its surrounding areas {{in accordance with the}} McMillan Plan has remained intact for the past 70 years because of disease management and immediate tree replacement. Dutch elm disease (DED) first appeared on the Mall during the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1970s. The NPS has used a number of methods to control this fungal epidemic, including sanitation, pruning, injecting trees with fungicide, replanting with DED-resistant American elm cultivars and combatting the disease's local insect vector, the smaller <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Scolytus multistriatus), by trapping and by spraying with insecticides. Soil compaction and root damage by crowds and construction projects also adversely affect the elms.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{reported}} DED vectors include Scolytus sulcifrons, S. pygmaeus, S. laevis, Pteleobius vittatus and Р. kraatzi. Other <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> {{species are}} also likely vectors.|$|R

5000|$|A {{bark beetle}} {{is one of}} about 220 genera with 6,000 species of beetles in the {{subfamily}} Scolytinae. Traditionally, this was considered a distinct family Scolytidae, but is now understood to be very specialized members of the [...] "true weevil" [...] family (Curculionidae). Well-known species {{are members of the}} type genus Scolytus, namely the <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> S. multistriatus and the large elm bark beetle S. scolytus, which like the American elm bark beetle Hylurgopinus rufipes, transmit Dutch elm disease fungi (Ophiostoma). The mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae, southern pine beetle Dendroctonus frontalis, and their near relatives are major pests of conifer forests in North America. A similarly aggressive species in Europe is the spruce ips Ips typographus. A tiny bark beetle, the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei is a major pest on coffee plantations around the world.|$|E

5000|$|In Belgium, elm {{die-back}} {{and death}} {{was observed in}} 1836 and 1896 in Brussels, and in 1885-6 in Ghent. In the later outbreaks the die-back was attributed to the <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle.</b>|$|R

40|$|From {{the larvae}} and adults of the <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> Scolytus scolytus F. Ceratostomella ulmi could nearly always be isolated. The mite Pseudotarsonemo_des innumerabilis, {{living on the}} <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles,</b> was transported by them to the newly cut egg tunnels in the tree, from where the mites transported the spores of C. ulmi through the larval tunnels to the pupal cells, where they disseminated the spores {{in such a way}} that these form a typical sward of coremia. In the absence of mites this was always lacking in the pupal cells. The {{dispersal}} of elm disease by other insects proved improbable. The exact relation between the quantity of <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> and the occurrence of new outbreaks of elm disease could be established. The different feeding techniques of S. scolytus were studied both in field and laboratory trials. The generations of these beetles were compared for different meteorological conditions. The number of generations varied greatly. Both 4 generations and (as a rule) 1 generation a year were observed. They always overlapped, so there were no periods without beetles. Breeding material had to satisfy special requirements. These requirements and the way, in which a pile of wood was attacked, were fully discussed. After explaining that control of the fungus was not possible, Fransen concluded that the only way to combat the elm disease was to destroy <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> Control measures tested by Fransen were fully described. <p/...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Scolytus schevyrewi Semenov, the banded elm bark beetle, and S. multistriatus Marsham, {{the smaller}} <b>European</b> <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> are {{morphological}}ly similar. Reliance on adult ex-ternal morphological characters for identification can be problematic because of wide within-species variability {{and the need}} for good-quality specimens. The inability to identify developmental stages can also hamper early-detection programs. Using two character identification systems, geni-talic (aedeagus) morphology, and DNA markers (random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR)) to distinguish S. schevyrewi from S. multistriatus, we examined spec-imens from geographically distinct populations of both species collected from infested host trees or semiochemical-baited funnel traps. We found that aedeagus morphology can be used to identify the two species. The use of two oligonucleotide primers in the RAPD-PCR analysis yielded distinct DNA banding patterns for the two species. Species identification using RAPD-PCR analysis was validated by a blind test and used to make species identifications of larval specimens. These tools improve the ability to differentiate between S. schevyrewi and S. multistriatus at immature and adult stages, and could be developed and used for other scolytines as well.

40|$|In 2003, an Asian <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> Scolytus schevyrewi Semenov (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), the banded <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> was {{detected}} {{for the first}} time in North America. This paper modifies the Wood (1982) key to the species of Scolytus Geoffroy to enable identification of S. schevyrewi in North and Central America. Variation of diagnostic characters in S. schevyrewi is discussed...|$|R
50|$|In Europe, while S. multistriatus still {{acts as a}} vector for infection, it is {{much less}} {{effective}} than the large <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> S. scolytus. H. rufipes can be a vector for the disease, but is inefficient {{compared to the other}} vectors. S. schevyrewi was found in 2003 in Colorado and Utah.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{countries}} that have elm trees, Australia {{has not yet been}} subjected to Dutch Elm Disease, although the vector of the disease, the <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> was first officially recorded in Melbourne in 1974. The City of Melbourne and the Victorian State Government have jointly developed a Dutch elm disease contingency plan in case of an outbreak.|$|R
50|$|Xanthogaleruca luteola is {{a serious}} pest of the elm. Both the adults and larvae feed on the {{emergent}} leaves of the elm. Repeated heavy infestation rarely kills the tree outright but weakens it, rendering it vulnerable to disease. Falling branches encourage <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> to proliferate; the beetles are vectors of Dutch elm disease. However, elm leaf beetles do not transmit the disease.|$|R
50|$|Scolytus jacobsoni is an <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> {{occurring}} in forests of mixed broad-leaves with elm trees in Asia. In southeastern Russia, during years of outbreaks S. jacobsoni often attacks healthy trees along forest edges or standing alone along roads and in fields and gardens, {{making it an}} important pest for elm trees there. Reported hosts include Ulmus davidiana, Ulmus japonica, Ulmus laciniata, Ulmus propinqua, Carpinus betulus, and Pyrus ussuriensis.|$|R
40|$|Dutch Elm Disease (DED) forms {{a complex}} system of three {{elements}} closely interacting: a host, a pathogen and an insect vector. Elm breeding programmes for resistance to DED have been exclusively based on selecting or obtaining pathogen-resistant trees, thus stressing only the host–pathogen {{side of the}} interaction and missing the vector compo-nent. Resistance against the <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> vectors would involve mechanisms other than those implicated in fungus re-sistance. As a consequence the search for resistance to the vectors would offer {{more than just a}} different way of ob-taining resistant elms as it would allow incorporation of a new type of resistance into pathogen-resistant trees. Suppressing twig crotch feeding by <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> would greatly reduce infection on healthy elms. Evidence of pre-ferences by <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> among different <b>elm</b> species has been documented in the field and in controlled experi-ments, demonstrating that U. minor is preferred over U. laevis and U. glabra, whereas intraspecific preferences among individual elms or clones remain largely unexplored. The selection of an individual plant by an insect is a two-step process that involves finding and accepting the host. Plant chemicals can {{play a key role in}} both of these steps, acting either as long-range stimuli, such as attractants or repellents, or as close-range contact cues, such as feeding stimu-lants and deterrents, operating after landing on the plant surface. Research on the chemical aspects of <b>elm</b> selection by <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> is here reviewed, and prospects for the future are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Dutch elm disease (DED) {{is caused}} by the fungal {{pathogen}} Ophiostoma novoulmi which is transmitted by the native <b>elm</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> Hylurgopinus rufipes. We have found that four semiochemicals [(-) -P-pinene, (-) -a-cubebene, (+) -spiroaxa- 5, 7 -diene and (+) -&cadinenel from diseased American elms, Ulmus americana, synergistically attract H. rufipes, and that their emission is up-regulated in elm trees inoculated with 0. novo-ulmi. The fungus thus manipulates host trees to enhance their apparency to foraging beetles, a strategy that increases the probability of transportation of the pathogen to new hosts...|$|R
