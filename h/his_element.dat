5|$|Boisbaudran named <b>his</b> <b>element</b> samaria {{after the}} mineral samarskite, {{which in turn}} honored Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870). Samarsky-Bykhovets, as the Chief of Staff of the Russian Corps of Mining Engineers, had granted access for two German mineralogists, the {{brothers}} Gustav Rose and Heinrich Rose, to study the mineral samples from the Urals. In this sense samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a person. Later the name samaria used by Boisbaudran was transformed into samarium, to conform with other element names, and samaria nowadays is sometimes {{used to refer to}} samarium oxide, by analogy with yttria, zirconia, alumina, ceria, holmia, etc. The symbol Sm was suggested for samarium; however an alternative Sa was frequently used instead until the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|On June 13, while {{flying in}} a flight led by his {{squadron}} commander, Major Francis Gabreski, Johnson shot down his first German aircraft (of 10 Staffel, JG 26). The 56th had scored its first confirmed kill just the day before, but had missed {{an opportunity to}} achieve a larger victory. As a result, Johnson and <b>his</b> <b>element</b> leader agreed that the pilot spotting the enemy should immediately attack and be supported by the other, regardless of who was leading. Johnson achieved his kill, over an Fw 190, doing just that, but discovered that <b>his</b> <b>element</b> leader had not covered him as agreed. Johnson was reprimanded by Zemke, Gabreski, and Jerry Johnson for breaking formation when the other pilot denied his concurrence. Even so, the kill was confirmed, {{one of the very}} first among the novice 8th Fighter Command pilots. Johnson received a bottle of Scotch whisky from Major General Carl Spaatz, commanding the 8th Air Force, to mark the occasion.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{began to}} reach Nader of Koprulu Pasha's {{departure}} from Kars {{with the intent}} of engaging the Persian army. Nader who at this point was all to eager to leave the slow-going siege and take to the field where he would be in <b>his</b> <b>element</b> once more, welcomed this opportunity to seek out the Ottoman relief force and crush it. Having invested his troops round Tiflis and Yerevan also Nader took the remainder of his men and marched west. An Ottoman army of perhaps 130,000 men (according to Astarabadi, Nader's court historian) under Koprulu Pasha was decimated by Nader's advance guard of only 15,000 or so men.|$|E

25|$|On August 1, 1943, Kane, by then a colonel, led the 98th in Operation Tidal Wave, a low-altitude bombing mission against oil {{refineries}} in Ploieşti, Romania. The 98th {{was one of}} five bomb groups {{taking part in the}} attack. En route to the target, which called for a round-trip flight of over 2,400 miles, <b>his</b> <b>element</b> became separated from the leading portion of the massed formation while avoiding dense cloud conditions over mountainous terrain. Rather than turn back from such a vital mission, he elected to proceed to the target. Upon arrival it was discovered that another group had missed its target and then bombed the area assigned to the 98th. Despite the fully warned defenses, intensive anti-aircraft fire, enemy fighter planes, and hazards from delayed-action bombs dropped by the earlier element, oil fires, and dense smoke over the target area, he elected to lead his formation against the {{oil refineries}}.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon did {{not expect}} the Austrians to declare war, but when {{it became obvious that}} war was imminent, he {{believed}} that hostilities would start after 15 April. From Paris, Napoleon ordered Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier to form the Grande Armée d'Allemagne (Grand Army of Germany) from French and Allied units located on the Danube front. To Berthier he sent orders to concentrate at Regensburg if the Austrians invaded Bavaria after 15 April. If, however, his enemies attacked before the deadline, the army was to assemble farther west at Donauwörth. By misfortune, an order that Napoleon sent on 10 April did not arrive until the 16th. A second order, elaborating on the first order, arrived late on the 13th. Berthier was an excellent chief of staff to Napoleon, but as an army commander he was out of <b>his</b> <b>element.</b> In the confusion, he misinterpreted the out-of-sequence instructions and ordered a forward concentration at Regensburg.|$|E
25|$|In {{place of}} these, Gowen {{proposed}} his own reorganization plan based, one more time, upon optimistic earnings estimates {{and his ability}} to attract new money into the company. Also, one more time, his oration carried the audience into great enthusiasm. Such was the momentum generated by Gowen's overall campaign that Keim conceded the January 1886 presidential election in advance; Gowen and his Board of Managers slate were elected unanimously and adopted a resolution calling for a change in the receivership. Notwithstanding the optimistic reorganization plan Gowen rode back into the presidency, shareholder enthusiasm and a board resolution were insufficient to remove the Reading from its deeply troubled circumstance. Before Gowen was able to mobilize any of the money required to take action, Morgan reentered the arena, this time heading a syndicate that offered to return peace and prosperity to the company through a different means. An anonymous member of Morgan's syndicate described a central element of the proposed peace:In order to do this it has been found necessary to get rid of Mr. Gowen. We have all combined {{to get him out of}} railroad management, just as all the powers of Europe combined to crush Napoleon, and there will be no peace until Mr. Gowen is in St. Helena. He is an able and brilliant man and in some respects a veritable Napoleon, but he is no railroad manager.... The trouble with Mr. Gowen is that he wants to be fighting all the time. When he was after the Molly Maguires he was in <b>his</b> <b>element,</b> but as a railroad manager he is a failure.|$|E

He began work on his translation of Sophocles's Women of Trachis and Electra, and continued work on The Cantos. It reached the point where he refused to discuss any attempt to have him released. Olga Rudge visited him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955, and was unable to convince him to be more assertive about his release.

500|$|In mid-1885, at a mine near Freiberg, Saxony, a new mineral was {{discovered}} and named argyrodite {{because of the}} high silver content. The chemist Clemens Winkler analyzed this new mineral, which proved to be a combination of silver, sulfur, and a new element. Winkler was able to isolate the new element in 1886 and found it similar to antimony. Before Winkler published his results on the new element, he decided that he would name <b>his</b> <b>element</b> neptunium, since the recent discovery of planet Neptune in 1846 had been preceded by mathematical predictions of its existence. However, the name [...] "neptunium" [...] had already been given to another proposed chemical element (though not the element that today bears the name neptunium, which {{was discovered}} in 1940). So instead, Winkler named the new element germanium (from the Latin word, Germania, for Germany) in honor of his homeland. Argyrodite proved empirically to be Ag8GeS6.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, {{after making}} Leo McCarey's romantic comedy Good Sam, Cooper sold his company to Universal Studios {{and signed a}} {{long-term}} contract with Warner Bros. that gave him script and director approval and a guaranteed $295,000 per picture. His first film under the new contract was King Vidor's drama The Fountainhead (1949) with Patricia Neal and Raymond Massey. In the film, Cooper plays an idealistic and uncompromising architect who struggles to maintain his integrity and individualism {{in the face of}} societal pressures to conform to popular standards. Based on the novel by Ayn Rand who also wrote the screenplay, the film reflects her Objectivist philosophy and attacks the concepts of altruism and collectivism while promoting the virtues of selfishness and individualism. For most critics, Cooper was hopelessly miscast in the role of Howard Roark. In his review for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther concluded he was [...] "Mr. Deeds out of his element". Cooper returned to <b>his</b> <b>element</b> in Delmer Daves' war drama Task Force (1949), about a retiring rear admiral who reminisces about his long career as a naval aviator and his {{role in the development of}} aircraft carriers. Cooper's performance and the Technicolor newsreel footage supplied by the United States Navy made the film one of Cooper's most popular during this period. In the next two years, Cooper made four poorly received films: Michael Curtiz' period drama Bright Leaf (1950), Stuart Heisler's Western melodrama Dallas (1950), Henry Hathaway's wartime comedy You're in the Navy Now (1951), and Raoul Walsh's Western action film Distant Drums (1951).|$|E
500|$|Under {{the heading}} [...] "Transcendental Mediocrity", Jim Miller of Rolling Stone called Dark Horse a [...] "disastrous album" [...] {{to match the}} [...] "disastrous tour", and a [...] "shoddy piece of work". According to Miller, the musicians were [...] "merely {{competent}} studio pros" [...] and Harrison's guitar playing was [...] "rudimentary". In contrast with the praise that the same publication had lavished on Harrison for Living in the Material World the year before, Rolling Stones reviewer described Dark Horse as a [...] "chronicle of a performer out of <b>his</b> <b>element,</b> working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver new 'LP product'", and stated: [...] "In plain point of fact, George Harrison {{has never been a}} great artist... the question becomes whether he will ever again become a competent entertainer." [...] The NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Harrison's songwriting, production and vocals, particularly on two tracks dealing with his troubled personal life, [...] "Simply Shady" [...] and [...] "So Sad". Woffinden concluded: [...] "I find Dark Horse the product of a complete egoist – no one, you see, is in my tree – someone whose universe is confined to himself. And his guru... I'll repeat that this album is totally colourless. Just stuff and nonsense." [...] Writing in The Village Voice in January 1975, Robert Christgau bemoaned the album's [...] "transubstantiations" [...] and particularly derided the lyrics to [...] "Māya Love", [...] "in which 'window-pane' becomes 'window brain.'

500|$|In 1918 Admiral Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya became {{rear admiral}} of the fleet, and he {{determined}} {{to use the}} fleet to attack the Otranto Barrage. On 8 June 1918 he took Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen south with a small supporting flotilla; {{on the evening of}} 9 June, Szent István and Tegetthoff followed. In trying to make maximum speed in order to catch up, Szent Istváns turbines started to overheat and speed had to be reduced to [...] When an attempt was made to raise more steam in order to increase to [...] Szent István produced an excess of smoke, attracting the attention of a pair of patrolling Italian torpedo boats at 3.20a.m. on 10 June. MAS-21 attacked Tegetthoff, but one of her torpedoes failed to leave the launch tube and the other failed to explode. MAS-15 however hit Szent István with two torpedoes at 3:31a.m. Tegetthoff returned to the scene to take Szent István in tow. An attempt to beach the ship on nearby Molat Island (northwest of Zara) was considered, but the ship was taking on too much water. At 6:12am, with the pumps unequal to the task, Szent István capsized, taking 89 of her crew with her. The last half-hour of the sinking was filmed in stages from Tegetthoff .

500|$|Usher and will.i.am {{shot the}} video {{the weekend of}} March 6, 2010. The video was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. In an interview with Rap-Up, Mandler said about {{the concept of the}} video: [...] "...The video is a spectacle. It really emphasizes what we love about Usher and the character and the icon that he is, and most importantly, it’s really a video that showcases his superstardom". The video was released on March 30, 2010, on VEVO and AMTV. According to Mandler, the original idea for the video was citing Max Headroom, a fictional artificial intelligence character from 1980s British television and film. The reference is made when Usher is seen on a flickering television {{at the beginning of the}} video. Mandler specified, commenting, [...] "Max Headroom was always in his room," [...] he continued, [...] "this unidentifiable room, '80s shapes. I used that for inspiration." [...] Usher stated that he wanted to do something theatrical and fun, and that while will.i.am. brought the international sound, he wanted to bring the producer into his world, [...] "working off of each other and playing off of each other as artists, but the cinematography would be artistic and incredible." [...] Mandler described the visuals in the clip as [...] "Hitchcock-ian", as well as simply capturing Usher in <b>his</b> <b>element,</b> as he said he wanted the R singer's talent to take over. He further explained, stating, [...] "The concept was to create a world where we put Usher in a space where he does what I think he does better than anyone else in the world, which is perform at a level and magnitude of a superstar and take us, the viewer, whether audible or visually, on a journey, not a ride. And, in that, I wanted to create an unpredictability, so one set leads to another and another, and you never know what's gonna happen. Along the way, Usher becomes our guide. We're so focused on him, we don't notice the change. The thing is unfolding little by little, and you can't quite see far enough ahead to know what's gonna come next." ...|$|E
