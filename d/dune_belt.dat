40|$|Quantification {{of water}} table {{dynamics}} {{is an essential}} part of eco-hydrological characterisation as they are a controlling factor for vegetation and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. This is often done using the concept of groundwater depth classes, which are defined based on mean high winter and mean low summer water levels. However, this concept does not consider inter-yearly variability of groundwater levels. Also, groundwater depth classes can depend strongly on local topography, which is specially the case in <b>dune</b> <b>belts</b> in coastal regions. In this paper, the relation between groundwater depth classes and the size of seasonal and inter-yearly variations is investigated in a dune region along the Belgian coast, which has the special hydrological and ecological feature of including a dune river. The spatial pattern of the seasonal fluctuations and inter-yearly variability here is much simpler than the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater depth classes.

40|$|The {{relation}} of present Martian winds to large latitudinally zoned sediment deposits {{has been investigated}} using global wind streak data and mapping of large sand and dust deposits. Dune sand deposits occur primarily in three latitude belts: north polar (74 - 85 degrees North), low latitude (5 degrees North- 20 degrees South), and south polar (40 - 80 degrees South). Comparison with wind streak data shows the high-latitude dunes to be in areas of seasonally reversing winds. The present winds can form latitudinal <b>dune</b> <b>belts</b> {{from a variety of}} initial dune distributions, including uniform distribution and a polar source. The presence of dune sand within the polar layered deposits, the erosional state of the deposits, and the present surface wind flow away from the poles indicate that both polar dune concentrations have been derived from erosion of the layered deposits. The low-latitude dunes are topographically confined in canyons and craters; they are probably subject to long-term reversal of orientations with climate cycles...|$|R

Wherever the beach is sandy, dunes are in process of formation, {{from the head of}} the lake in northwestern Indiana along the entire eastern shore of Lake Michigan to the Straits of Mackinac. The longest uninterrupted stretches are between the mouths of Kalamazoo and White rivers in Michigan and from the vicinity of St. Joseph, Michigan, southwestward past Michigan City, Indiana, {{to the head of the}} lake.

40|$|The Belgian {{coastline}} extends {{for some}} 67 km along the North Sea. The coastal region has an almost continuous <b>dune</b> <b>belt</b> of 1 to 2 km width, separating inland lying polders {{from the beach}} slope.

This coastal aquifer is on average around 30 m thick and forms an important source for water supply {{in this part of}} the country. For this purpose it has already been used for decades. In natural conditions the <b>dune</b> <b>belt</b> acts as a groundwater divide which separates two groundwater flow systems, one to the sea and one inland to the polder region.

40|$|Until the 1970 's, {{the coastal}} zone of Goa was largely pristine. However, {{the advent of}} tourism and the {{resultant}} construction boom along the coastline have induced large scale changes in the geological and ecological set up of the coast. It is observed that the sand dune ecosystems of Goa which are over 6000 years old have borne the maximum brunt of this "development". The beach- dune environment is a highly organized system. Sand dunes which generally back wide beaches, are features of extreme fragility and sensitive to anthropogenic stress. Sand dunes are Nature's line of defense from {{the forces of the}} ocean.

40|$|We {{present results}} of an {{experiment}} aimed at detecting possible displacements due to subsidence in the coastal area of the Tavoliere plain, Puglia Region, in Southern Italy, through analysis of remotely sensed data. The Tavoliere is the second largest Italian plain. Its coastal area, between the urban centers of Manfredonia and Barletta, is composed of a 50 km long sandy beach (Manfredonia gulf), linking the Gargano massif at north with the Murge plateau in the south-east. Both areas belong to the carbonate Mesozoic Apulian platform. The current configuration of the Gulf was reached recently, {{as a consequence of}} the Holocene sea level rise. During the Neolithic age the plain was occupied by an elongated lagoon (Salpi Lagoon) [1]. During the 2 nd century B. C., alluvial deposition caused the lagoon to be separated into two basins: the so-called Salpi lake at south and the Salso lake at north. To cope with the increasing demand of arable lands and with the necessity to make unhealthy areas accessible to humans, some reclaims were accomplished by diverting and channelling the rivers crossing the Tavoliere plain, and by levelling <b>dune</b> <b>belts.</b> At present, the beach is separated by low artificial dunes from the areas already reclaimed and intensely cultivated or exploited as evaporation basin for salt production. In the last decades, the coastal area has been retreating due to a reduction in sediment input necessary for coastal equilibrium.

Archaeological data and previous radiocarbon results suggest three aeolian morphogenetic phases. The first phase corresponds {{to the end of}} the rapid post-glacial transgression (7. 0 - 6. 0 ka BP); the second to the aeolian sand deposition during the "Greek-Roman" period (2. 5 - 1. 9 ka BP); and the most recent phase occurred in the period from the Middle Ages to the present time. The reconstruction of the sequence of the morphogenetic phases was mainly based on radiocarbon analyses carried out on both terrestrial gastropods and marine bivalves. The reliability of the radiocarbon analyses on terrestrial gastropod shells has been questioned by several Authors and a closer understanding of the carbon uptake mechanism in this kind of organisms is needed. A systematic study was carried out by performing Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) C- 14 dating on the shells of terrestrial gastropods sampled alive in different geomorphological settings along the Adriatic and Ionian coasts of Southern Italy. The results show significant anomalies in the radiocarbon content and in the carbon stable isotopic ratio.

Small diameter (0. 4 m) footprint lidar was applied to derive the canopy height by analyzing the first and last pulse returns simultaneously. The investigation focused on whether the height of low-canopy ecosystems Could be mapped with adequate accuracy. An error analysis was performed first on flat terrain (i. e., tennis court and parking lot) and then on vegetation canopy. The mapping of coastal dune vegetation is necessary to establish the strength of the <b>dune</b> <b>belt.</b> Dune vegetation fixes the sand dunes, protecting them from erosion and from possible breakthroughs threatening the historically reclaimed land (polders) situated inland from the dunes. Next, multispectral data was acquired from a digital camera with Visual and near infrared channels. The digital camera overflight was not conducted on the same platform as the lidar. After ortho-rectification of the multispectral image, the data of both sources were fused. The limited spectral information delivered by the digital camera was not able to provide a sufficiently detailed and accurate vegetation map.

40|$|The geomorphological {{analysis}} of cliff coast stretching {{to the north}} of Otranto (southern Apulia, Italy) was integrated by penetrometer tests and geophysical survey aiming to reconstruct its late Holocene evolution. In particular, the study focuses on the inactive cliff of Torre dell'Orso inlet which hosts a 150  m - wide beach and a high <b>dune</b> <b>belt.</b> The survey detected the cliff/wave-cut platform junction at about 3. 8  m below m. s. l. The platform is covered by a dune/beach sedimentary cover about 7  m thick. The collated data along with the available local sea level curves allow to reconstruct Otranto's cliff evolution as the result of late Holocene relative sea-level change due to eustasy and land motions. Cliff development was promoted by a sea still-stand level at about 3. 5  m below present mean sea level occurred between 3400 and 2400 years BP. A rapid sea level rise followed so that several tracts of cliffs were partly drowned becoming plunging cliffs. Cliff recession followed fast sea level rise only along preferential groundwater flow lines where hyperkarst process, due to fresh/salt water mixing, produced deep notches in the calcarenite bedrock inducing rock falls and cliff recession. This process is responsible for the indentation of present shoreline. Finally, during the last four centuries a wide beach and a high <b>dune</b> <b>belt</b> formed at Torre dell'Orso inlet {{as a result of the}} increased carry load of Ofanto River, so that the plunging cliff has been separated by shoreline becoming an inactive cliff. Finally, comparing the reconstructed local sea level history during the late Holocene with the available sea level curves produced by glacio-hydro-isostastic models, a yo-yoing land motion with a period of about 4500 years and amplitude of about 2 m can be inferred for the eastern coast of Salento peninsula...|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{morphological}} development of the Wadden Sea barrier island system, with emphasis on West and East Frisian islands on several temporal and spatial scales. In addition, it integrates the insights for management purposes. Barrier island management is addressed with respect to morphology, sediment budgets, safety and natural values. We show {{that each of these}} issues is determined to some extent to various spatio-temporal scales and that the management of a barrier island has to be considered in terms of interactions on various spatial and temporal scales. Morphology of some of the barrier islands is determined by the pre-existing Pleistocene relief to a fair extent, either directly due to erosion-resistant outcrops on or near the islands, or indirectly by determining the locations where inlet systems or estuaries could develop. Where this is not the case, the larger part of the sediments are locally reworked Pleistocene or Holocene deposits eroded at the North Sea coasts of the barrier chain and deposited in the back-barrier area and on the islands as a response to sea-level rise. Hardly any sand is coming in from outside the area. In order to keep up with sea-level rise sand has thus to be nourished if coastal retreat is not allowed. During the long Holocene evolution islands and ebb-tidal deltas have been lined up during their coastward migration, forming a more or less uninterrupted barrier chain along the Frisian coasts. The present-day approach of mainly focusing on the fixation of the inhabited parts of the chain will most likely result in a de-alignment of the various parts of the chain, resulting in increasing erosion of the promontories. An inlet system is a sediment-sharing system with a tidal inlet, the ebb-tidal delta, adjacent barrier islands and the tidal basin with channels, shoals, tidal flats and salt marshes. The sand balance of a barrier island is thus directly linked to tidal inlet system development. A natural change or an intervention in the sediment-sharing system by man may thus have repercussions for the island’s development. Sediment redistribution in the coastal zone may also depend on climate, as is illustrated by the rapid growth of the islands after the demise of the Little Ice Age. On the barrier islands themselves many measures were taken during the past two centuries to ensure coastal safety. The successful attempts to stabilize the coasts and dunes of the barrier islands resulted in a reduction of sand transport from and along the shoreface to the beach and onto the islands. To some extent this has been restored by applying sand nourishments. However, vertical accretion of the islands is still largely impossible due to all the older coastal protection measures still present. On the long run sedimentary dynamics are essential if the island is to accrete vertically with sea-level rise, which forms a robust and sustainable strategy to guarantee safety during the next centuries. Massive stabilization also reduced the opportunities for pioneer vegetation. <b>Dune</b> <b>belts</b> and tidal marshes have experienced a fast succession resulting in a climax vegetation and the loss of the characteristic open landscape...|$|R

These deposits are evidence of highly active alluvial phases on the plain, more vigorous than any since. Slightly higher in the sequence (typically 10 - 20 m depth) is a thick (2 - 15 m), laterally extensive (up to 10 km wide) mixed-load sequence (the new Duderbang member), which is stratigraphically disconnected from the deeper sanddominated units. Near-surface palaeochannel deposits, which consist of less extensive (up to 3 km wide) coarse sandy alluvium at depth and a combination of mixed- and bedload sequences closer to the surface, make up the youngest palaeochannel deposits in the area. The size and extent of reserved palaeochannel sequences beneath the study area have decreased markedly since what is interpreted as the mid Quaternary and is probably symptomatic of declining fluvial activity on the Riverine Plain through to the present. The development of source-bordering <b>dunes</b> associated with <b>belts</b> of palaeochannel material in the area was examined using shallow geophysics (GPR), topographic surveys, laser particle size analysis and thermoluminescence dating. Dune building in Contents the area occurred in conjunction with channel activity during the Kerarbury (55 - 35 ka) and Coleambally (105 - 80 ka) palaeochannel phases (Page et al., 1996) when sediment supply conditions were favourable, probably due to strongly seasonal discharges draining the southeastern highlands. The presence of stabilising vegetation on the channel margins is believed to have played a key role in the development of dunes in the area, which show poorly developed internal structure. The increased precipitation that enhanced channel discharges must also have sustained dune vegetation. Increased aridity and reduced vegetation approaching and during the LGM appears to have caused the widespread remobilization of dune crests. The complex alluvial and aeolian stratigraphy of the Shepparton Formation strongly influences groundwater movement in the Coleambally district. Piezometric levels show that deeper, highly permeable units (e. g. Ugobit member) in the northern part of the study area act as conduits for the discharge of groundwater, helping to maintain much lower watertables in the north as well as induce groundwater flow from the CIA. ‘Sediment vs depth’ analysis demonstrates that there is limited vertical connection through the thick, clay-dominated sequence of the Lower Shepparton Formation to the highly transmissive sands and gravels of the underlying Calivil Formation. The tendency of the Lower Shepparton Formation to restrict downward leakage is likely to both contribute to the problem of shallow irrigation-induced watertables in the CIA as well as impede efforts to lower watertables by pumping from deeper aquifers. The upper 3 metres of the Shepparton Formation are clay-dominated with a low water storage capacity, causing near-surface watertables to be highly responsive to recharge by surface water. The available data indicate that when piezometric levels fall below this clay-rich zone they are able to absorb short-term increases in recharge due to the higher proportion permeable alluvium in the unsaturated zone...|$|R
