30|$|As the {{utilization}} rate of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment</b> is still low, {{the analysis of}} the influence of intelligent power consumption technologies on {{the utilization}} rate of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment</b> is essential. Several intelligent power consumption technologies and measures are reviewed and their specific influences on the utilization rate of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment</b> are summarized in this paper.|$|R
30|$|The {{economy of}} {{distribution}} networks largely {{depends on the}} utilization rate of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment.</b> Most of the emerging intelligent power consumption technologies {{have a positive effect}} on equipment utilization and their use can save investment of distribution networks. In this paper, the influence of intelligent power consumption technologies on the utilization rate of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment</b> is reviewed. The evaluation methods and indexes are assessed first and then intelligent power consumption equipment with energy storage function, vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) technology and time-of-use (TOU) tariff are reviewed respectively. It is concluded that these intelligent power consumption technologies and measures have great potential to improve utilization rate of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment</b> because of their effective improvement to power load. Meanwhile, recommendations on how to utilize these intelligent power consumption technologies to improve utilization rate of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment</b> are proposed.|$|R
30|$|The {{utilization}} rate of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment</b> {{is closely related}} to the economy of distribution network construction. It depends on the load rate, burden rate and life expectancy rate of the equipment. Intelligent power consumption technologies {{play a significant role in}} improving the {{utilization rate}} of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment</b> which can reduce the construction and investment cost of distribution networks. The influence of intelligent power consumption technologies on the utilization rate of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment</b> is affected by a variety of factors. The key to improve the utilization rate of equipment is to take the problems of supply side and demand side into consideration comprehensively, and to make use of the intelligent power consumption technologies rationally. The corresponding evaluation indexes and their application scope are described in this paper, and the influences of intelligent power equipment with energy storage function, V 2 G technology and TOU tariff on the utilization rate of <b>distribution</b> network <b>equipment</b> have also been reviewed.|$|R
25|$|In {{metropolitan}} areas, {{stray voltage}} issues {{have become a}} major concern. Many of these areas have large amounts of aging underground and aboveground electrical <b>distribution</b> <b>equipment</b> in crowded public spaces. Even a low rate of insulation failures or current leakage can result in hazardous exposure of the general public.|$|E
25|$|Fukushima II {{was also}} {{struck by the}} tsunami. However, it had {{incorporated}} design changes that improved its resistance to flooding, reducing flood damage. Generators and related electrical <b>distribution</b> <b>equipment</b> were located in the watertight reactor building, so that power from the electricity grid was being used by midnight. Seawater pumps for cooling were protected from flooding, and although 3 of 4 initially failed, they were restored to operation.|$|E
25|$|The convenience, low cost, and {{mobility}} {{of this method}} distinguish it from conventional testing and are the primary reasons for its growing popularity. The method is convenient because all required sound system, power generation and distribution and data acquisition and control equipment is brought to the test site. Equipment is usually leased for each test event. There is no large investment in a facility, equipment or personnel required {{on the part of}} the customer. A diesel generator is the preferred power source, therefore providing clean on-site electrical power in a consistent configuration for connection to the MSI power <b>distribution</b> <b>equipment.</b> This removes the demand for large quantities of power from the test facility. In addition, testing can be performed at a much lower cost per test compared to the installation, operation and maintenance of a more standard high intensity reverberant acoustic chamber system. Finally, mobility allows this test method to be performed at almost any time and place in the normal test article integration and test flow. The test equipment is completely portable and no special facility or infrastructure is required.|$|E

500|$|Since the 1970s, Weston has {{suffered}} a decline in popularity as a holiday destination, as have most British seaside resorts, due to the advent of cheap foreign holidays and {{the demise of the}} traditional [...] "works holidays" [...] of heavy and manufacturing industries elsewhere in UK. The town had become a centre of industries such as helicopter production, and maintenance at the GKN Westland factory until its closure in 2002, however the company still retains a design office under the name GKN Aerospace Engineering Services at the Winterstoke Road site. Road transport links were improved with the M5 motorway running close by, and the town now supports light industries and distribution depots, including Lidl's distribution centre for its southern based stores, and is also a dormitory town for Bristol. [...] Vutrix, one of the largest semiconductor and video/audio <b>distribution</b> <b>equipment</b> companies in the television broadcasting industry, is based in the town.

2500|$|In field {{installations}} {{of electrical}} power <b>distribution</b> <b>equipment,</b> capacitor bank fault tolerance is often improved by connecting multiple capacitors in parallel, each protected with an {{internal or external}} fuse. [...] Should an individual capacitor develop an internal short, the resulting fault current (augmented by capacitive discharge from neighboring capacitors) blows the fuse, thus isolating the failed capacitor from the remaining devices. [...] This technique {{is analogous to the}} [...] "T metallization" [...] technique described above, but operating at a larger physical scale. More-complex series and parallel arrangements of capacitor banks are also used to allow continuity of service despite individual capacitor failures at this larger scale.|$|E
