5|$|Jones had {{previously}} developed a gruesome game called Go to Hell. In an interview Jones {{stated that he}} developed the game for his own amusement; he enjoyed the reactions people gave to the game. The original, pre-release, version of the game featured more grisly images. Reviewers praised the game's graphics but had mixed <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> the scenes actually depicted by the graphics. Some reviewers criticized the game's gameplay as repetitive but praised as being fun and akin to a horror movie by others.|$|E
5|$|Shooting on Edge of Darkness {{began on}} 9 July 1984 {{and ran for}} five months until 5 December 1984. Location filming took place in London (including the Barbican Arts Centre, BBC Television Centre and the Hilton International Kensington), Yorkshire (including the {{headquarters}} of the West Yorkshire Police in Bradford, the Middleton Railway, the headquarters of Systime Computers (now the O2 building) in Leeds where Craven hacks into the MI5 computer and at Westwood Cottage, Ilkley for Craven's home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan's Reykjavík policy was formulated) and Wales (including Clogau Gold Mine and Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog doubling as Northmoor with the hot cell a set constructed at a factory in Penygroes). Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as Magnox; the title Dark Forces was briefly considered before the serial was renamed Edge of Darkness in April 1985. As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, “I think we knew when we were making it {{that it was a good}} piece of work” while Kennedy Martin told reporters “I haven't had this <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> something for 20 years. It's wonderful, after all this time, to get something that actually works”.|$|E

40|$|Four studies {{support the}} {{development}} and validation of a framework for understanding the range of social psychological outcomes valued subjectively as consequences of negotiations. Study 1 inductively elicited and coded elements of subjective value among students, community members, and practitioners, revealing 20 categories that theorists in Study 2 sorted into 4 underlying subconstructs: <b>Feelings</b> <b>About</b> the Instrumental Outcome, <b>Feelings</b> <b>About</b> the Self, <b>Feelings</b> <b>About</b> the Negotiation Process, and <b>Feelings</b> <b>About</b> the Relationship. Study 3 proposed a new Subjective Value Inventory (SVI) and confirmed its 4 -factor structure. Study 4 presents convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity data for the SVI. Indeed, subjective value was a better predictor than economic outcomes of future negotiation decisions. Results suggest the SVI is a promising tool to systematize and encourage research on subjective outcomes of negotiation...|$|R

25|$|From feminists' perspectives, sexology, {{which is}} the study of human {{sexuality}} and sexual relationship, relates to the intersectionality of gender, race and sexuality. Men have dominant power and control over women in the relationship, and women are expected to hide their true <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> sexual behaviors. Women of color face even more sexual violence in the society. Some countries in Africa and Asia even practice female genital cutting, controlling women's sexual desire and limiting their sexual behavior. Moreover, Bunch, the women's and human rights activist, states that the society used to see lesbianism as a threat to male supremacy and to the political relationships between men and women. Therefore, in the past, people viewed being a lesbian as a sin and made it death penalty. Even today, many people still discriminate homosexuals. Many lesbians hide their sexuality and face even more sexual oppression.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} children's <b>feelings</b> <b>about</b> home, and how a child gets its good or bad <b>feelings</b> <b>about</b> its own home. The methods used were a questionnaire survey of children in upper classes at two elementary schools in Kagoshima-city. The questionnaire sheets were collected from 350 children (178 boys, and 171 girls). The collection ratio was 98. 0 %. The results of this questionnaire survey indicated that: (1) The mothers were more influential in bringing up their children than other members of their families. (2) In the boys there was a tendency that boys were getting more independence from their families than girls were. (3) Of the children 13. 5 % who bad <b>feelings</b> <b>about</b> their own home. There was no significant difference in this between boys and girls. The children who had bad <b>feelings</b> <b>about</b> their home had poor concern with their families' member, and they also had poorer communication with their families in comparison with the children who had good <b>feelings</b> <b>about</b> their home. The children with good feelings had a stronger drive to communicate with their families...|$|R
25|$|While {{dealing with}} crisis, both {{personal}} and societal, there are five basic principles outlined for intervention. Victims are initially {{at high risk for}} maladaptive coping or immobilization. Intervening as quickly as possible is imperative. Resource mobilization should be immediately enacted in order to provide victims with the tools they need to return to some sort of order and normalcy, in addition to enable eventual independent functioning. The next step is to facilitate understanding of the event by processing the situation or trauma. This is done in order to help the victim {{gain a better understanding of}} what has occurred and allowing him or her to express <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> the experience. Additionally, the counselor should assist the victim(s) in problem solving within the context of their situation and feelings. This is necessary for developing self-efficacy and self-reliance. Helping the victim get back to being able to function independently by actively facilitating problem solving, assisting in developing appropriate strategies for addressing those concerns, and in helping putting those strategies into action. This is done in hopes of assisting the victim to become self-reliant.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that he felt like he was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, De Ravin {{was cast}} to portray Claire Littleton {{on the hit}} ABC drama Lost. Speaking about the success of Lost, she said: [...] "It's sort of hard to say.

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Shadows" [...] was rated a C+, with the episode being called [...] "exceedingly awkward", while the political context {{was seen as a}} weak point.

He felt that the episode's plot worked well, though the supernatural elements seemed [...] "a little corny".

Supervising producer Josh Singer later noted how [...] "August" [...] helped them write the rest of the season, [...] "There was one episode, 'August', which was all about the Observers, that I feel was mythology without being mythology. And somehow, in working that episode, we sort of found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related to everything else we did. But I feel like it sort of opened us up in terms of how we were <b>feeling</b> <b>about</b> the year".|$|E
