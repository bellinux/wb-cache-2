6000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1868,--before the affair of Beverley, which, as being the first direct result of my {{resignation}} of office, has been brought in {{a little out of}} its turn,--I was requested to go over to the United States and make a postal treaty at Washington. This, as I had left the service, I regarded as a compliment, and of course I went. It was my third visit to America, and I have made two since. As far as the Post Office work was concerned, it was very far from being agreeable. I found myself located at Washington, a place I do not love, and was harassed by delays, annoyed by incompetence, and opposed by what I felt to be personal and not national views. I had to deal with two men,--with one who was a working officer of the American Post Office, than whom I have never met a more zealous, or, as far as I could judge, a more honest public servant. He had his views and I had mine, each of us having at heart the welfare of the service in regard to his own country,--each of us also having certain orders which we were bound to obey. But the other gentleman, who was in rank the superior,--whose executive position was dependent on his official status, {{as is the case with}} our own Ministers,--did not recommend himself to me equally. He would make appointments with me and then not keep them, which at last offended me so grievously, that I declared at the Washington Post Office that if this treatment were continued, I would write home to say that any further action on my part was impossible. I think I should have done so had it not occurred to me that I might in this way serve his purpose rather than my own, or the purposes of those who had sent me. The treaty, however, was at last made,--the purport of which was, that everything possible should be done, at a heavy expenditure on the part of England, to <b>expedite</b> the <b>mails</b> from England to America, and that nothing should be done by America to <b>expedite</b> the <b>mails</b> from thence to us. The expedition I believe to be now equal both ways; but it could not be maintained as it is without the payment of a heavy subsidy from Great Britain, whereas no subsidy is paid by the States. [Footnote: This was a state of things which may probably have appeared to American politicians to be exactly that which they should try to obtain. The whole arrangement has again been altered since the time of which I have spoken.] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Our group {{recently}} completed a randomized controlled trial, evaluating the efficacy of providing 5  weeks of free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; {{in the form of}} the nicotine patch) by <b>expedited</b> postal <b>mail</b> without behavioral assistance to regular adult smokers interested in receiving it. The findings revealed that mailed provision of nicotine patches resulted in more than a doubling of quit rates at a six-month follow-up compared to a no intervention control group. While this trial provided evidence for the effectiveness of mailed nicotine patches in promoting cessation, the findings speak only to the short term effectiveness of this approach. As relapse to smoking is known to occur beyond the 6  month period, it is important to evaluate whether the net benefit of NRT in naturalistic settings can be maintained long-term. The present study aims to perform a 5 -year follow-up survey of participants in the original trial to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of mailed NRT. Methods/Design Trained interviewers will contact participants in the randomized controlled trial 5  years post-enrollment. A total of 924 participants will be eligible to be contacted. Interviewers will first assess participants’ smoking status and their level of nicotine dependence. Participants reporting not currently smoking will be asked whether they have smoked tobacco, even a puff, in the last 30  days (primary outcome measure: 30 -day point prevalence abstinence), past 6  months (secondary outcome measure: prolonged 6 -month abstinence), and since the 8 -week follow-up survey (secondary outcome measure: > 4  year continuous abstinence). Interviewers will be blind to experimental condition at the time the primary outcome measure will be assessed. It is hypothesized that participants who received nicotine patches at baseline will display significantly higher quit rates at the 5 -year follow-up as compared to participants who did not receive nicotine patches at baseline. Discussion If the study finds that the mailed distribution of free NRT is effective at promoting long-term cessation, it would provide further evidence to move forward with policies designed to make NRT treatment readily and freely available to smokers who request it.

60|$|It {{gives me}} {{pleasure}} {{to report a}} decided improvement in the financial condition of the Post-Office Department as compared with several preceding years. The receipts {{for the fiscal year}} 1861 amounted to $8,349,296.40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so-called seceded States during the last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $8,299,820.90, being only $50,000 less than was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous year. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount expended in 1861 was $13,606,759.11. For the last year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364.13, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the expenditures as compared with the preceding year, and about $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal year 1860. The deficiency in the Department for the previous year was $4,551,966.98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814.57. These favorable results are in part owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that Department in the interest of economy. The efficiency of the postal service, it is believed, has also been much improved. The Postmaster-General has also opened a correspondence through the Department of State with foreign governments proposing a convention of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage and to <b>expedite</b> the foreign <b>mails.</b> This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens and to the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained and agreed to by all the governments from whom replies have been received.|$|R
40|$|Potency {{testing of}} most human and {{veterinary}} rabies vaccines requires vaccination of mice {{followed by a}} challenge test using an intracerebral injection of live rabies virus. The National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM), the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), and their international partners organized an international workshop to review the availability and validation status of alternative methods that might reduce, refine, or replace the use of animals for rabies vaccine potency testing, and to identify priority research and development efforts necessary to further advance alternative methods. Workshop participants agreed that rabies vaccine potency testing using the mouse challenge test should use general anesthesia for intracerebral virus injections, and that humane endpoints should be used routinely {{as the basis for}} euthanizing animals to minimize pain and distress. Workshop participants recommended that a near term priority should be to replace the mouse challenge with a test validated to ensure potency, such as the mouse antibody serum neutralization test (SNT) for adjuvanted veterinary rabies vaccines for which an international collaborative study was recently completed. The workshop recommended that an in vitro antigen quantification test should be a high priority for product-specific validation of non-adjuvanted human and veterinary rabies vaccines. Finally, workshop participants recommended greater <b>international</b> cooperation to <b>expedite</b> development, validation, regulatory acceptance, and implementation of alternative test methods for rabies vaccine potency testing.

40|$|Background: An {{epidemic}} of Ebola virus disease (EVD) from 2013 - 16 posed a serious risk of global spread during its early growth phase. A post-epidemic {{evaluation of the}} effectiveness of travel restrictions has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions in reducing the risk of importation from mid-August to September, 2014, using a simple hazard-based statistical model. Methodology/Principal Findings: The hazard rate was modeled as an inverse function of the effective distance, an excellent predictor of disease spread, which was calculated from the airline transportation network. By analyzing datasets of the date of EVD case importation from the 15 th of July to the 15 th of September 2014, and assuming that the network structure changed from the 8 th of August 2014 because of travel restrictions, parameters that characterized the hazard rate were estimated. The absolute risk reduction and relative risk reductions due to travel restrictions were estimated to be less than 1 % and about 20 %, respectively, for all models tested. Effectiveness estimates among African countries were greater than those for other countries outside Africa. Conclusions: The travel restrictions were not effective enough to expect the prevention of global spread of Ebola virus disease. It is more efficient to control the spread of disease locally during an early phase of an epidemic than to attempt to control the epidemic at international borders. Capacity building for local containment and coordinated and <b>expedited</b> <b>international</b> cooperation are essential {{to reduce the risk of}} global transmission...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{current study}} was {{conducted}} to <b>expedite</b> <b>international</b> standardized reporting of bone marrow disease in children with neuroblastoma and to improve equivalence of care. METHODS: A multidisciplinary International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria Bone Marrow Working Group was convened by the US National Cancer Institute in January 2012 with representation from Europe, North America, and Australia. Practical transferable recommendations to standardize the reporting of bone marrow disease were developed. RESULTS: To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first to comprehensively present consensus criteria for the collection, analysis, and reporting of the percentage area of bone marrow parenchyma occupied by tumor cells in trephine-biopsies. The quantitative analysis of neuroblastoma content in bone marrow aspirates by immunocytology and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction are revised. The inclusion of paired-like homeobox 2 b (PHOX 2 B) for immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction is recommended. Recommendations for recording bone marrow response are provided. The authors endorse the quantitative assessment of neuroblastoma cell content in bilateral core needle biopsies-trephines and aspirates in all children with neuroblastoma, with the exception of infants, in whom the evaluation of aspirates alone is advised. It {{is interesting to note that}} 5 % disease is accepted as an internationally achievable level for disease assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative assessment of neuroblastoma cells is recommended to provide data from which evidence-based numerical criteria for the reporting of bone marrow response can be realized. This is particularly important in the minimal disease setting and when neuroblastoma detection in bone marrow is intermittent, where clinical impact has yet to be validated. The wide adoption of these harmonized criteria will enhance the ability to compare outcomes from different trials and facilitate collaborative trial design...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} undertakes {{an attempt}} to balance the effect of AGENDA 21 with respect to realizing and promoting the principle of sustainability. The representation confines itself to Germany and fundamentally distinguishes between political activities, concepts of firm and practical realizations of sustainable development initiated by individuals or informal groups. The paper initially reflects the fundamental methodological problem: a proof of an effect of AGENDA 21 is burdened by the omission of any commission or control experiment. Any evidence of a positive effect {{does not include the}} contradiction of "no effect without AGENDA 21 ". The number of realizations of sustainable developments being limited from a negative answer of the one-sided question - excluding the possibility of negative effects of AGENDA 21 - would definitely confirm the lack of success of AGENDA 21. Chapter 1 reflects the fundamental aspects necessary to the future sustainable development. There is no way of infinitely increasing all parameters, e. g. energy and water consumption, CO 2 - Emission etc. in a finite earth. Some short historical comments are dedicated to the late 70 &# 65533;s when the German party &# 65533;DIE GRÜNEN&# 65533; was founded against the whole political establishment during this decade. Furthermore the author shows the reluctant acceptance of "sustainable development" by academic sociology. Chapter 2 explains goals and strategies of AGENDA 21 and lists the German agencies responsible for the realization, it reflects the difficulty in spreading the idea of sustainable development due to its rather complicated background and complexity. Chapter 3 traces the political activities with respect to supporting the transmission of the idea of sustainable development by the German Central government down to local parliaments of districts. Chapter 4 covers the &# 65533;Corporate Identity&# 65533; of the Pharmaceutical Company Schering. An international study conducted in Germany, Italy and USA about the sustainable development within the Pharmaceutical Industry recognizes the concept of sustainable development as the triple bottom line "economy, ecology and social responsibility". Chapter 5 summarizes the main conclusion: (1) the German central- and local governments definitely met the requirements concerning sustainable development projects. Several local governments however couldn't even spend the money available for those projects as there were either none or not enough applications. (2) The German Agenda-Transfer published a database containing 419 "best practice" projects that were realized since publication of AGENDA 21. On closer inspection, most of these projects don't even meet the formal requirements of the triple bottom line "economy, ecology and social responsibility" while some others referring to routine activities in communities had been redefined to at least formally meet the requirements without having been initiated by AGENDA 21. Insofar AGENDA 21 as a concept of spreading the idea of sustainable development by initiating many "local AGENDA 21 " around the world definitely failed in Germany. (3) A completely different picture could be drawn of Corporate Organizations, where sustainability is a well known reflected and respected concept which was routinely included in business reports. Corporate organizations are obtaining certificates for their effort towards sustainability as an important argument in the marketplace. There are several indices in the stock exchange that are based on selected companies "best in sustainability" within their organization. (4) Finally, the author arrives at the conclusion that progress towards inescapable sustainable development will be solely encouraged and promoted by large <b>international</b> organizations, <b>expedited</b> by continued globalisation and the realization of the importance by the global organizations. They are well advanced and ahead of the national political active bodies. </table...|$|R
