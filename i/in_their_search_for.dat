40|$|Downturns in the {{construction}} and finance sectors {{played a significant role}} in the recent recession. A stock-market-based measure that captures sectoral shocks shows that these disturbances are important for explaining long-duration unemployment. This is consistent with the intuition that sectoral shocks cause workers to engage in time-consuming moves across industries <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>searches</b> <b>for</b> work. It also suggests that it will take a while before the more than 1. 8 million unemployed construction workers and close to a half million unemployed finance and insurance workers find jobs.

Harry meets an attractive but judgmental divorcee through a dating service, and this leads to some conflict between the two main characters.

5|$|Cave Story {{takes place}} within the {{cavernous}} interior of a floating island. The island is populated by Mimigas, a race of sentient, rabbit-like creatures. A particular species of red flower that grows in the island causes the normally peaceful Mimigas to fall into a violent frenzy when ingested. The island also conceals an artifact called the Demon Crown, which has vast magical powers. An army of robot soldiers {{was sent to the}} floating island on a military expedition, seeking to harness the Demon Crown as a weapon for wars on the surface world. These robots slaughtered Mimigas indiscriminately <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> the crown, but were defeated when the Mimigas decided to eat the red flowers as a last resort. Shortly before the game begins, Professor Booster, the Sakamoto family, and various assistants formed a scientific party to research the island, but they became stranded when their medical doctor managed to acquire the Crown: he then forced the expedition to search for the red flowers.|$|E

5|$|The February Revolution was {{positively}} {{accepted by the}} Armenians because it ended the autocratic rule of Nicholas II. The Special Transcaucasian Committee (known as OZAKOM) {{was set up in}} the South Caucasus by the Russian Provisional Government. In April 1917, Andranik initiated the publication of the newspaper Hayastan (Armenia) in Tiflis. Vahan Totovents became the editor of this non-partisan, Ottoman Armenian-orientated newspaper. Until December 1917, Andranik remained in the South Caucasus where he sought to help the Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> basic needs.

5|$|HMS Monmouth was {{the lead}} ship of her class of 10 {{armoured}} cruisers built for the Royal Navy {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century. She was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet upon completion in 1903. She was transferred to the China Station in 1906, and remained there until she returned home in 1913 and was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet. When World War I began in August 1914, the ship was recommissioned and assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron in the Central Atlantic to search for German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping. She was detached upon arrival to patrol the Brazilian coast for German ships, and was later ordered to the South Atlantic to join Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock's squadron <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> the German East Asia Squadron. He found the German squadron on 1 November off the coast of Chile.

40|$|The Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson was {{predicted}} by theorists in the 1960 s {{during the development}} of the electroweak theory. Prior to the startup of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), experimental searches found no evidence of the Higgs boson. In July 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC reported the discovery of a new boson <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>searches</b> <b>for</b> the SM Higgs boson. Subsequent experimental studies have revealed the spin- 0 nature of this new boson and found its couplings to SM particles consistent to those of a Higgs boson. These measurements confirmed the newly discovered boson is indeed a Higgs boson. More measurements will be performed to compare the properties of the Higgs boson with the SM predictions...|$|R

5|$|In {{the summer}} of that year, the German anarchist Augustin Souchy was invited by the Castro {{government}} to survey the agrarian sector. He was not impressed with what he found, and declared in his pamphlet Testimonios sobre la Revolución Cubana that the system {{was too close to}} the Soviet model. Three days after Souchy departed Cuba, the entire print run was seized by the government, and destroyed. However, an Argentinian anarchist publisher republished the pamphlet the following December. Around the same time, the ALC, alarmed at the movement of the Castro government towards a Marxist–Leninist form of rule, issued a declaration, under the name Grupo de Sindicalistas Libertarios to prevent reaction against the ALC's membership. The document declared opposition to the centralism, authoritarian tendencies, and militarism of the new government.
