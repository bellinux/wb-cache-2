25|$|Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, {{in which}} {{friction}} pads are compressed against the wheel rims; <b>hub</b> <b>brakes,</b> where the mechanism is {{contained within the}} wheel <b>hub,</b> or disc <b>brakes,</b> where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some use disk brakes. Disc brakes are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and complexity.|$|R

50|$|The 1st {{downhill}} time-trial race {{took place}} in Fairfax, California on October 21, 1976 on a fireroad now referred to as Repack Road, due {{to the need to}} repack the <b>hub</b> <b>brake</b> after each descent. The bikes used were based on cruiser bicycles that had a drum or coaster brake that worked by pedalling backwards. The mechanism operated with a conical brake shoe being wound on a thread in a metal hub. To prevent the brake from seizing it was kept filled with grease. Heavy use during the descent would cause the brake to over heat, softening the grease and causing it to drain from the hub, requiring frequent repacking. Ten riders descended 1300 ft of Repack road in about 5 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Other, usually older bicycle speedometers are cable {{driven from}} one or other wheel, as in the {{motorcycle}} speedometers described above. These do not require battery power, but can be relatively bulky and heavy, and may be less accurate. The turning force at the wheel may be provided either from a gearing system at the hub (making use {{of the presence of}} e.g. a <b>hub</b> <b>brake,</b> cylinder gear or dynamo) as per a typical motorcycle, or with a friction wheel device that pushes against {{the outer edge of the}} rim (same position as rim brakes, but on the opposite edge of the fork) or the sidewall of the tyre itself. The former type are quite reliable and low maintenance but need a gauge and hub gearing properly matched to the rim and tyre size, whereas the latter require little or no calibration for a moderately accurate readout (with standard tyres, the [...] "distance" [...] covered in each wheel rotation by a friction wheel set against the rim should scale fairly linearly with wheel size, almost as if it were rolling along the ground itself) but are unsuitable for off-road use, and must be kept properly tensioned and clean of road dirt to avoid slipping or jamming.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were several}} groups of riders in {{different}} areas of the U.S.A. who can make valid claims to playing a part in the birth of the sport. Riders in Crested Butte, Colorado and Cupertino, California tinkered with bikes and adapted them to the rigors of off-road riding. Modified heavy cruiser bicycles, old 1930s and '40s Schwinn bicycles retrofitted with better brakes and fat tires, were used for freewheeling down mountain trails in Marin County, California in the mid-to-late 1970s. At the time, there were no mountain bikes. The earliest ancestors of modern mountain bikes were based around frames from cruiser bicycles such as those made by Schwinn. The Schwinn Excelsior was the frame of choice due to its geometry. Riders used balloon-tired cruisers and modified them with gears and motocross or BMX-style handlebars, creating [...] "klunkers". The term would also be used as a verb since the term [...] "mountain biking" [...] was not yet in use. Riders would race down mountain fireroads, causing the <b>hub</b> <b>brake</b> to burn the grease inside, requiring the riders to repack the bearings. These were called [...] "Repack Races" [...] and triggered the first innovations in mountain bike technology as well as the initial interest of the public (on Mt. Tamalpais in Marin CA, there is still a trail titled [...] "Repack"- in reference to these early competitions). The sport originated in California on Marin County's Mount Tamalpais.|$|E

5000|$|Spoking {{patterns}} may be [...] or semi-tangential. For {{a normal}} wheel size and spoke count, only {{the latter is}} suitable for a wheel that has to transmit torque from the hub to the rim, as with rear wheels or <b>hub</b> <b>brakes.</b> This rule is occasionally broken where {{a very large number}} of spokes is used or the wheel is unusually small in diameter, either of which reduces the amount of increased tensile stress on each radial spoke to an acceptable degree; some BMX bicycles and low-riders use radial spoking for both wheels. Rear wheels may also incorporate radial spoking on the non-drive side and semi-tangential spoking on the drive side. At least one example, the Mavic Ksyrium, has radial spoking on the drive side of the rear wheel.|$|R

50|$|By {{the later}} 1950s the small Standards were losing {{out in the}} UK market to more modern {{competitor}} designs, and the Triumph name {{was believed to be}} more marketable; hence the 1959 replacement for the Eight, Ten and Pennant was badged as the Triumph Herald; with substantial mechanical components carried over from the small Standards. Despite the separate chassis and independent rear suspension, the differential, <b>hubs,</b> <b>brakes,</b> engine and gearbox were all common to the last Standard Pennants. In order to build the Herald the company invested £ million in a new assembly hall extension at the Canley plant which Standard had acquired in 1916. The builders of the three-storey building excavated 250,000 tons of soil and rock. Inside the building were three 1300 ft assembly lines equipped {{to be one of the}} most modern car assembly plants in the world. This turned out to be the company's last investment on such a scale at Canley: investment decisions after the merger with Rover would favour the newer plant at Solihull.|$|R

Because the wheel, <b>hub</b> and <b>brake</b> are fitted as a unit, {{it is possible to}} verify the fatigue strength under operational stresses only by testing this unit on a test rig. Reverification of the fatigue strength under operational stresses for wheels intended for use with disc brakes was carried out on a two-axial roller test rig...|$|R
50|$|The offset, {{measured}} in millimeters, can be negative or positive, {{and is the}} distance from the hub-mounting surface to the rim's true centerline. A positive offset means the hub-mounting surface is closer to the outside edge of the wheel, i.e. the wheel wraps around the <b>hub</b> and <b>brake</b> hardware more deeply; a negative offset means the hub-mounting surface is closer to the inside edge of the wheel and wheel sticks outwards more than inwards.|$|R
5000|$|The frames were {{initially}} available with AMC and Norton telescopic front forks and British <b>Hub</b> Co. (Motoloy) <b>brakes</b> front and rear. The pivoting rear-forks on all models were fitted with Silentbloc bushes. A later option was Metal Profiles (REH) front forks.|$|R
50|$|Wire spokes can be radial to the hub but {{are more}} often mounted {{tangentially}} to the hub. Tangential spoking allows for the transfer of torque between the rim and the hub. Tangential spokes are thus necessary for the drive wheel, which has torque at the hub from pedalling, and any wheels using hub-mounted brakes such as disk or band brakes, which transfer torque from the rim to the brake in the opposite direction—(via the <b>hub)</b> when <b>braking.</b>|$|R
25|$|Either type could {{potentially}} fixed by ensuring a clean mounting surface {{on either side}} of the brake disc between the wheel <b>hub</b> and <b>brake</b> disc <b>hub</b> before usage and paying attention to imprinting after extended usage by leaving the brake pedal heavily depressed at the end of heavy usage. Sometimes a bed in procedure can clean and minimize DTV and lay a new even transfer layer between the pad and brake disc. However it will not eliminate hot spots or excessive run out.|$|R
