High fluxes of cold polar molecules are efficiently produced by electric guiding and velocity filtering. Here, we investigate different aspects of the beam formation. Variations of the source parameters such as density and temperature result in characteristic changes in the <b>guided</b> <b>beam.</b> These are observed in the velocity distribution of the guided molecules {{as well as in the}} dependence of the signal of guided molecules on the trapping electric field. A model taking into account velocitydependent collisional losses of cold molecules in the region close to the nozzle accurately reproduces this behavior. This clarifies an open question on the parameter dependence of the detected signal and gives a more detailed understanding of the velocity filtering and guiding process.

40|$|For a {{light rail}} system, smooth {{contact between the}} vehicle and the <b>guide</b> <b>beam</b> is {{critical}} for reducing the friction and the vibration of an operating vehicle. Therefore, the shape of guide beams needs to be controlled with mm-level accuracy during the construction. Currently, most methods for detecting shape defects of guide beams, such as experimental run of vehicles, are costly and tedious. In addition, these methods can only identify defects {{after the completion of}} the construction, and cause reworks and delays of defects fixings. From dense point clouds collected by laser scanners, inspectors can manually extract geometric features and conduct virtual inspections of guide beams. However, the manual geometric feature extraction process impedes effective utilization of point clouds for the shape analysis of guide beams. Aiming at improving the efficiency of utilizing laser scanning technology for <b>guide</b> <b>beam</b> quality control, this research developed a semi-automatic approach for simultaneously extracting the axis parameters (e. g., radius) and cross-section features (e. g., width) of a <b>guide</b> <b>beam</b> using a Hough-Transform based approach, and discusses factors (e. g., data density) influencing the performance of this approach...|$|E

The dispersive material improvements to the FDTD approach include the linear Lorentz, the nonlinear Raman, and the instantaneous Kerr models. Incorporation of the Lorentz dispersion model allowed us to model scattering from good conductors such as the noble metals (Au, Ag, Cu) in the optical regime.

40|$|Beam {{search is}} {{commonly}} used to help maintain tractability in large search spaces {{at the expense of}} completeness and optimality. Here we study supervised learning of linear ranking functions for controlling beam search. The goal is to learn ranking functions that allow for beam search to perform nearly as well as unconstrained search, and hence gain computational efficiency without seriously sacrificing optimality. In this paper, we develop theoretical aspects of this learning problem and investigate the application of this framework to learning in the context of automated planning. We first study the computational complexity of the learning problem, showing that even for exponentially large search spaces the general consistency problem is in NP. We also identify tractable and intractable subclasses of the learning problem, giving insight into the problem structure. Next, we analyze the convergence of recently proposed and modified online learning algorithms, where we introduce several notions of problem margin that imply convergence for the various algorithms. Finally, we present empirical results in automated planning, where ranking functions are learned to <b>guide</b> <b>beam</b> search in a number of benchmark planning domains.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} of the thermal issues related to the National Ignition Facility. In particular, the influences of the HVAC system and lighting fixtures on the operational performance of the laser <b>guide</b> <b>beam</b> tubes are reviewed and discussed. An analytical model of the oscillating HVAC air temperatures in the NIF switchyard and target bay will cause significant amounts of beam distortion. However, these negative effects can be drastically reduced by adding thermal insulation to the outside of the beam tubes. A computational fluid dynamics model and an analytical investigation found that the light-fixture to beam-tube separation distance must be on the order of 5. 7 m (18. 7 ft) to maintain acceptable beam operating performance in the current NIF design. By reducing the fluorescent light fixture power by 33 % this separation distance can be reduced to 3. 5 m (11. 5 ft). If in addition, thermal insulation with a reflective aluminum foil covering is added to the outside of the beam tubes, the separation distance can be reduced further to 1. 6 m (5. 2 ft). A 1. 27 cm (0. 5 in.) rigid foam insulation sheet with aluminum foil covering will provide adequate insulation for the beam tubes in the NIF switchyards and target bay.

The influence of heat sources such as lighting fixtures, electronics racks, and pre-amplifier modules (PAMs) on the operational performance of the laser <b>guide</b> <b>beam</b> tubes and optical alignment hardware in the NE laser bays were investigated with experiments and numerical models.
