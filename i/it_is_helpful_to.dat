25|$|To {{relate the}} memristor to the resistor, capacitor, and inductor, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> isolate the term M(q), which characterizes the device, and write it as a {{differential}} equation.|$|E
25|$|To plot other points, whose angles are {{not such}} round numbers as 60° and 50°, one must {{visually}} interpolate between the nearest grid lines. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> have a net with finer spacing than 10°. Spacings of 2° are common.|$|E
30|$|We {{wanted to}} see whether the score could be used to predict ease of correction. From experience, we had learned that an older child {{requires}} more casting and we agreed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important to incorporate a multiplier variable according to the age of the child into our final score. As all elements are made stiffer with age, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> multiply the combined elements by this factor.|$|R

25|$|All real fluids (except superfluids) {{offer some}} {{resistance}} to shearing and therefore are viscous. For teaching and explanatory purposes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> use {{the concept of an}} inviscid fluid or an ideal fluid which offers no {{resistance to shearing}} and so is not viscous.|$|E
25|$|Since Usher {{syndrome}} is incurable at present, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> diagnose children well before they develop the characteristic night blindness. Some preliminary {{studies have suggested}} as many as 10% of congenitally deaf children may have Usher syndrome. However, a misdiagnosis can have bad consequences.|$|E
25|$|In the night, or in a ship without windows, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> simply close one's eyes, or if possible, take a nap. This {{resolves}} {{the input}} {{conflict between the}} eyes and the inner ear. Napping also helps prevent psychogenic effects (i.e. the effect of sickness being magnified by thinking about it).|$|E

25|$|To capture what {{is special}} about Francis’ {{theology}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> let him speak {{in his own}} words: the specialty is often watered down in generalizations. His statements have been well described as “snarky” and “stunners”. The fervor of his determination to turn around the church appears in his way of expressing himself.|$|E
25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the propagation of}} action potentials along axons and their termination at the synaptic knobs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> consider the methods by which action potentials can be initiated at the axon hillock. The basic requirement is that the membrane voltage at the hillock be raised above the threshold for firing. There are several ways in which this depolarization can occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience. So <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate how {{it applies to}} more easily understood physical situations. Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the {{uncertainty principle}}. The wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formulates {{it in a way}} that generalizes more easily.|$|E

25|$|He used {{traditional}} terms {{as much as}} possible, though consistently redefining them. Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> understand what he means by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.|$|E
25|$|Fracture {{toughness}} {{is required}} to alter the crack propagation in ceramics. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the serviceability, performance and long term clinical success of biomaterials. It is reported that the high fracture toughness material improved clinical performance and reliability as compare to low fracture toughness. It can be measured by many methods e.g. indentation fracture, indentation strength, single edge notched beam, single edge pre cracked beam and double cantilever beam.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{approaches are}} applied by interpreters {{specifically to the}} book of Revelation, but Revelation occupies such a central place in Christian eschatology that it is worth mentioning them in this, more general, overview. Parallel approaches {{can also be used}} in the interpretation of other prophetic passages. These approaches are by no means mutually exclusive and are usually combined to form a more complete and coherent interpretation. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> have a conceptual understanding of them.|$|E

25|$|To achieve {{high-resolution}} in electron microscopes {{and other}} electron beam instruments (such {{as those used}} for electron beam lithography), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> start with an electron source that is small, optically bright and stable. Sources based on the geometry of a Mueller emitter qualify well {{on the first two}} criteria. The first electron microscope (EM) observation of an individual atom was made by Crewe, Wall and Langmore in 1970, using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an early field emission gun.|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} also is {{a direct}} consequence of the linearity of Maxwell's equations. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> associate changing electric currents with a build-up or decrease of magnetic field energy. The corresponding energy transfer requires or generates a voltage. A mechanical analogy in the K=1 case with magnetic field energy (1/2)Li2 is a body with mass M, velocity u and kinetic energy (1/2)Mu2. The rate of change of velocity (current) multiplied with mass (inductance) requires or generates a force (an electrical voltage).|$|E
25|$|Another {{closely related}} {{manifold}} {{is the real}} projective plane. If a circular disk is {{cut out of the}} real projective plane, what is left is a Möbius strip. Going in the other direction, if one glues a disk to a Möbius strip by identifying their boundaries, the result is the projective plane. To visualize this, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>helpful</b> <b>to</b> deform the Möbius strip so that its boundary is an ordinary circle (see above). The real projective plane, like the Klein bottle, cannot be embedded in three-dimensions without self-intersections.|$|E
