5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting <b>each</b> <b>component</b> while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E

5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in <b>each</b> <b>component.</b> A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|In {{these early}} days we {{explored}} {{all sorts of}} power reactors, comparing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each type. The number of possibilities was enormous, since there are many possibilities for <b>each</b> <b>component</b> of a reactor—fuel, coolant, moderator. The fissile material may be 233U, 235U, or 239Pu; the coolant may be: water, heavy water, gas, or liquid metal; the moderator may be: water, heavy water, beryllium, graphite—or, in a fast- neutron reactor, no moderator. I have calculated that, if one counted all the combinations of fuel, coolant, and moderator, one could identify about a thousand distinct reactors. Thus, at the very beginning of nuclear power, we had to choose which possibilities to pursue, which to ignore.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibiotic}} rifaximin may be {{recommended in}} addition to lactulose for those with recurrent disease. It is a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the rifamycin class. This is thought {{to work in a}} similar way to other antibiotics, but without the complications attached to neomycin or metronidazole. Due to the long history and lower cost of lactulose use, rifaximin is generally only used as a second-line treatment if lactulose is poorly tolerated or not effective. When rifaximin is added to lactulose, the combination of the two may be more effective than <b>each</b> <b>component</b> separately. Rifaximin is more expensive than lactulose, but the cost may be offset by reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy.|$|E

5|$|The {{definition}} {{would have}} considered {{a pair of}} objects to be a double planet system if <b>each</b> <b>component</b> independently satisfied the planetary criteria and the common center of gravity of the system (known as the barycenter) was located outside of both bodies. Pluto and Charon {{would have been the}} only known double planet in the Solar System. Other planetary satellites (like Earth and its moon) might be in hydrostatic equilibrium, but would still not have been defined as a component of a double planet, since the barycenter of the system lies within the more massive celestial body (the Earth).|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes of}} the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were {{combinations}} of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to {{be integrated into the}} shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, <b>each</b> <b>component</b> was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1930s {{the number}} of active {{personnel}} remained low and out of necessity training opportunities were limited. After 1936, however, the Army attempted to improve the conditions of service for its members and to reinvigorate the training program, while individual units began to undertake their own recruiting campaigns. Nevertheless, {{it was not until}} 1938, as tensions grew in Europe and the prospect of war became more likely, that an attempt was made to expand the establishment of the Militia. At this time an effort was made to determine the readiness of the Militia to expand if mobilised. During the continuous training camps undertaken throughout 1938, <b>each</b> <b>component</b> unit was assessed with mixed results. The following year, 1939, saw further expansion {{and by the end of}} April of that year, the division's posted strength had grown to 9,589 personnel. As a part of this expansion, the divisional artillery was expanded by the re-raising of the batteries that had been disbanded in 1922.|$|E

30|$|Most of {{the tidal}} {{dissipation}} {{that causes the}} recession of the Moon occurs in the oceans. The pattern of <b>each</b> tidal <b>component</b> is complicated; see Coughenur et al. [15] and Poliakow [16] for examples. <b>Each</b> tidal <b>component</b> has an individual period, and for each the pattern of local tide heights and phases depends on location. The combination of tidal components also depends on location, a complication {{for the analysis of}} rhythmites. The pattern for <b>each</b> tidal <b>component</b> can be combined into a global series of spherical harmonic functions. In a global sense, energy dissipation causes <b>each</b> tidal <b>component</b> to shift orientation with respect to the Moon’s attraction. This phase-shifted part of <b>each</b> tidal <b>component</b> causes lunar tidal acceleration, semimajor axis rate, and eccentricity rate. Plate motion changes the shapes and locations of the oceans, and this causes substantial variations in the tidal acceleration over ~ 108  yr time scales [16]. Although the tidal acceleration varies over these long time scales, the Moon continues to move outward.|$|R
