5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> in love with my radio and my music. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} {{going out to}} bat at 5pm and Andy Roberts had just taken the second new ball. I had a really close lbw decision when I had scored about five. I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, knew that I hit it. But thankfully he gave me not out. I went into lunch {{the next day at}} 99 not out and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> happy to get a century with my parents and friends watching.|$|E

25|$|Umar I {{had ordered}} that nobody should {{adulterate}} milk by mixing water into it. Once, while patrolling about {{at night to}} inquire into the condition of people, he heard a woman asker her daughter to mix water into the milk before the day-break. The girl refused by reminding her mother of the order given by the Caliph. When the mother retorted {{by saying that the}} Caliph was not present and he would not know of it, the daughter replied that God is Omniscient even if Caliph was not present. Umar <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> pleased with the reply that he asked his son Asim to marry the girl, saying that he hoped that she will give birth to a man who would rule over Arabia. Umar II was the son of Asim's daughter from this marriage (Abdul Hakam, pp 17-18).|$|E

500|$|At the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha, Ballard {{won gold}} medals in the Women's 200m T53 in a {{championship}} record time of 29.33 and the Women's 400m T53. After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This is the one I wanted. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> nervous coming in, you try and tell yourself that {{the worst thing that}} can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is that}} this matters so much. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I’ve just worked so hard for this for so long." [...] She also won a bronze medal in the Women's 800mm T54 behind gold medallist Madison de Rozario.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And shall <b>be</b> <b>so,</b> my own. Doubt not my word, {{all will}} go right. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> sorry, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> miserable, that <b>I</b> made you unhappy to-night.

6000|$|The warm-hearted {{little woman}} was all tears and smiles. 'Oh! dear Mrs. Frost, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> sorry, {{and yet it}} <b>is</b> selfish. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> happy! but where shall we find such another neighbour?' ...|$|R

He later said that [...] "We have no word for downhill in Senegalese because we have no mountains. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> afraid I almost threw up. I have fully tested the safety measures and can tell you that they work." ...|$|E
500|$|... "After that, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{depressed}} I just wasn't {{able to do}} anything. I {{stayed at}} home, away from everyone, completely in my own world. I {{wanted to make the}} album with Tore—that was the plan. After he died I just didn't think I had the heart. But then I thought, 'Right, you're really depressed now but you have to make this album. Tore would be quite pissed off if you just stopped doing anything.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Marlett, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> very unhappy!" [...] {{the girl}} sobbed. Somehow she was {{kneeling}} now, {{with her head}} buried in the elder lady's lap. [...] "I have been horrid to you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> wretched!" ...|$|R

500|$|... "That record {{saved my}} life. I {{was in such}} a dark space in New York. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> depressed, always in a bar. I got on a plane to LA to do my music and was given one shot to write the song that would change my life and I did. I never went back. I left behind my boyfriend, my apartment. I still haven't been back. My mother went in and cleared it for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Amid {{frequent}} court appearances battling {{to stay in}} the United States, Lennon became stressed, {{a situation}} that was only worsened by constant surveillance by the FBI, due to his political activism. Lennon said, [...] "I just couldn't function, you know? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> paranoid from them tappin' the phone and followin' me." [...] All this combined made Lennon begin to feel emotionally withdrawn. Lennon put his suffering aside to write the songs for Mind Games, writing all the songs for it in a week.|$|E
500|$|Distrustful of {{the press}} since her husband's 1992 presidential {{campaign}} and her early days as First Lady, she imposed limits on her availability to the press van following her. [...] Associated Press reporter Beth Harpaz later recounted a typical day from this time: [...] "But we'd been told there'd be no 'avail' today, and we'd accepted it. That didn't prevent me from feeling slightly humiliated. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> worn down and so exasperated {{by the lack of}} access and the lack of news in this campaign that I'd given up fighting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> {{miserable and}} so lonely," [...] she cried. [...] "What have I done that <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>so</b> unhappy? Why should <b>I</b> <b>be</b> taken to this horrible, horrible place?" ...|$|R

500|$|Ideas for casting guest voices {{often come}} from the writers and {{executive}} producer, said Sarah Noonan, vice president of talent and casting for Nickelodeon. Steven Banks told [...] "But the harder part was for Sebastian. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> pleased that he really could sound like a pimple-faced, snotty teenager." [...] Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson said [...] "We're happy {{to have such a}} talented and eclectic group of celebrities lend their voices to this SpongeBob special Victoria , John [...] and Sebastian [...] truly brought Bikini Bottom's royal family to life." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 1957, Rice's father married Dorothy Van Bever. On {{the subject}} of the couple's first meeting, Rice recalled, [...] "My father wrote her a formal letter {{inviting}} her to lunch which I hand-delivered to her house ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> nervous. In the note he enclosed a pin which she was to wear if she accepted the invitation. The next day she had the pin on."

Rice first met her future husband, Stan Rice, in a journalism class while they were both students at Richardson High School.|$|E
500|$|... "My Back Pages" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Bob Dylan and {{included}} on his 1964 album Another Side of Bob Dylan. [...] It is stylistically similar to his earlier folk protest songs and features Dylan's voice with an acoustic guitar accompaniment. [...] However, its lyrics—in particular the refrain [...] "Ah, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much older then/I'm younger than that now"—have been interpreted as a rejection of Dylan's earlier personal and political idealism, illustrating his growing disillusionment with the 1960's folk protest movement with which he was associated, and his desire to move in a new direction. Although Dylan wrote the song in 1964, he did not perform it live until 1988.|$|E
5000|$|In the album's liner notes, Paisley writes:"People {{have been}} asking for years when Keith and I would do {{something}} like this. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> honored to get to finally pick and sing with one of my favorite players in the world. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>so</b> humbled by his talent." ...|$|R

I do not cut anything, except, perhaps, capers. <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>so</b> to speak, a jongleur." ...|$|R
500|$|Cameron Thor had {{previously}} worked with Spielberg on Hook, and initially auditioned {{for the role}} of Malcolm, before trying out {{for the role of}} Dodgson. Thor said about casting, [...] "It just said 'shaving-cream can' in the script, so I spent endless time in a drug store to find the most photogenic. I went with Barbasol, which ended up in the movie. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> broke that I took the can home after the audition to use it." [...] Laura Dern was Spielberg's first choice for the role of Ellie Sattler. Spielberg chose to cast Wayne Knight after seeing his acting performance in Basic Instinct, saying, [...] "I waited for the credits to roll and wrote his name down".|$|E
500|$|Charity Wakefield {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Marianne Dashwood. The actress revealed, [...] "Marianne is the embodiment of youth and hope. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> excited to be offered the part because I felt that it was a role which I could really attack. I understand her character and feel that we have lots in common." [...] Dan Stevens was chosen to play Edward Ferrars, Elinor's love interest. The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character. Stevens became ill with tonsillitis during the shoot, and quipped that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series.|$|E
