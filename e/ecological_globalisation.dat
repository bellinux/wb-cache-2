40|$|Purpose – China {{has become}} a most {{dominant}} player {{in the global economy}} with immense political repercussions, for instance in Africa. The extremely rapid Chinese economic transformation has been accomplished through strong globalisation with, for example, entrance into the WTO framework. Now it faces the challenges of accepting {{the other side of the}} globalisation coin, namely institutional transparency, ecological sustainability and foreign policy integration into the international community. The purpose of this paper is to explore this. Design/methodology/approach – Macro approach using country indicators on economic growth, institutional transparency, rule of law and ecology pressure. It relates these index scores to the overall social transformation of the country. Findings – China has performed well on economic globalisation but lags on political modernisation, i. e. institutional transparency as well as on ecological sustainability for a post-modern society Research limitations/implications – China must address the challenges of the post-modern society with its call for transparency, sustainability and peaceful accommodation with neighbours. Social implications – Modernisation has two sides, not only economic growth. As China is set to become the world leader economically, it will embark upon the post-modern society, with its demands for peace, rule of law and environmental protection. Originality/value – The paper puts economic globalisation against political modernisation and <b>ecological</b> <b>globalisation</b> in a clear manner for China.

40|$|Globalisation’ usually {{conjures up}} images of {{corporate}} icons and fervent protestors. Paradoxically, it implies inclusiveness yet promotes divisiveness: rich versus poor, north versus south, power versus powerless, black versus white, good versus evil. Social and <b>ecological</b> change with <b>globalisation</b> is occurring on unprecedented scale, reshaping the ways we interact with our environment, perhaps most profoundly through transforming patterns of health and disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} paper/roundtable {{discussion}} is to expose and discuss our experience with an alternative pedagogic method of post-graduate (management) education: a field trip, which combines student-led, inquiry-based learning approach with a critical collaborative reflection {{on the theme of}} ‘environmental degradation as a business opportunity in a contemporary global context’. The Bristol MBA programme has an established tradition of integrating into its curriculum a non-compulsory study-trip based activity where students are given the opportunity to engage with “live cases” related to various aspects of <b>ecological</b> crisis, <b>globalisation</b> and development (Cicmil, 2013). This year, it was the visit to The Eden Project in Cornwall, with an added unique feature - cohort diversity and multidisciplinary background of the academic team. The participating students came from two UWE programmes - Bristol MBA and MSc Sustainable Development in Practice while the research interests of the teaching team spanned the areas of organisational ethnography, complex projects, environmental agenda, financial sustainability, critical pedagogy in management education, participatory research and community development. The presentation will outline the new insights that have emerged from this adventure from both pedagogic and strategic angle. The former will address the issue of student engagement – or lack of it – a hot topic for UK business schools and universities (Page and Gaggiotti, 2013) The latter will particularly highlight challenges and surprises related to innovating and enhancing a business school curriculum by changing the rules of engagement in teaching (ibid.); the tensions between staying practical and business oriented vs experiencing controversial topics (e. g. sustainability) which might otherwise remain outside the MBA framed learning about organisations...|$|R
40|$|Globalisation is an {{expansive}} process, capable of changing social, economic, political, and cultural structures. The large-scale transformations involved globalisation {{have been noted}} as influencing {{a wide range of}} human illnesses and causes of death. The aims of this study were to examine whether globalisation has an influence on male and female suicide rates, as measured across time and between countries. A globalisation 'index' was developed to measure the level of globalisation in 35 countries from the year 1980 onwards. Time-series cross-country data (from 1980 onwards) was used to estimate the relationship between <b>globalisation,</b> <b>ecological</b> risk and protective factors, and age-standardised suicide rates in 35 countries. Data was obtained from the WHO Statistical Information System, the United Nations Data Service (UN Data), the World Development, Indicators (WDI), the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics (UNESCO), and the International Labour Organization (ILO). Results of a fixed-effect regression analysis found that globalisation was directly related to male suicide rates, but had no significant effect on female suicide rates. The widespread changes associated with globalisation may have unsettled societies around the world by altering economic, social, and cultural regulatory mechanisms. The loss of these protective influences may increase the risk of suicide by creating a sense of insecurity, uncertainty, and 'anomie'. It appears that men are more affected by the societal changes associated with the globalisation process than women. These findings suggest that global social processes need to be included in population-level strategies for suicide prevention.
