40|$|The {{domain of}} {{artificial}} neural networks has evolved rapidly {{during the last}} decade, and many research groups are presently working on new neuronal algorithms and investigating their potential for technological applications. The idea to use biologically inspired models to implement intelligent systems is issue {{from the fact that}} animals, through their adaptation to the environment, have evolved towards robust and reliable structures, well adapted to the imperfections or even the destruction of some of their cells. In addition, these structures are particularly well adapted to perception tasks. These properties arise from the large redundancy inherent to their massive parallelism. Many models have been validated with computers, but the sequential operation of the latter leads to prohibitive computing time. The implementation of new architectures, leading to hardware that is better suited to the parallelism of the models, is slowed both by the complexity of some digital operators, and by the huge number of <b>interconnexions</b> between cells in the analogue and digital domains. The goal of this thesis is the implementation of a neural network, using analogue integrated technologies, to evaluate the potential and the weaknesses of such implementations. The Kohonen network has been chosen as a basis for this exploratory work because of its relative simplicity. As a matter of fact, this is a non-supervised network, which greatly simplifies the interfaces with the outside world. Furthermore, methods for limiting the number of <b>interconnexions</b> were known, thus overcoming the inherent limitations of intrinsically two-dimensional VLSI technologies. The study begins with a brief recall of the Kohonen algorithm, followed by the description of an architecture adapted to the integration of the network by means of standard CMOS analogue VLSI technologies. Before looking at the design of circuits needed to implement the network, the effects of some inaccuracies inherent to analogue circuits on the behaviour of the algorithm are analysed qualitatively by means of simulations. This analysis is needed to set up the specifications of the circuits, which may sometimes be quite different from the specifications that are encountered in more classical domains of analogue electronics. Then, the various circuits used in the implementation of the network are described. A nonlinear network, made of transistors connecting the nearest neighbour cells, defies the topology of the network and is used to generate the learning neighbourhood. A Winner-Take-All circuit is used to select the neuron whose synaptic vector is closest to the input vector. The most important element is certainly the synapse. The latter memorizes and updates, according to the learning rule, the elementary information called synaptic weight. Long term storage of an analogue value requires special technologies (EEPROM) and the update of this value is slow and badly controlled. To overcome this drawback, a medium term memory has been developed that has a leakage corresponding to 0. 1 % of full scale per second. This retention time is sufficient to operate the network under continuous learning, and also sufficient to periodically read the synaptic weights. All the proposed circuits are analysed with respect to the requirements of the network, and most of them have been integrated and measured. In particular, measurements of the synapse, made on several chips, are in good accordance with the analytical previsions. Finally, an evaluation chip, including four neurons with three synapses each, has been integrated. This chip can be used to build a complete network containing up to a hundred or so neurons. Measurements of single chips demonstrate the feasibility of the system, despite some tactical errors that can be easily corrected for an eventual redesign of the chip...|$|R
40|$|The nerve {{supply and}} {{conducting}} system were studied in a stage 23 human embryo of exceptional histological quality. The nerves {{on the right}} side arose from cervical sympathetic and from cervical and thoracic vagal filaments. Out of their <b>interconnexions</b> vagoxympathetic nerves emerged, which (1) sent a branch in front of the trachea to the aorticopulmonary ganglion, thereby supplying arterial and venous structures, and (2) formed the right sinal nerve, which supplied the sinu-atrial node, and gave filaments to the interatrial septum which could be traced to the atrioventricular node and pulmonary veins. The nerves on the left side arose similarly from cervical sympathetic and from cervical and thoracic vagal filaments. These formed several descending, ganglionated, vagosympathetic filaments that descended {{to the right of the}} arch of the aorta and entered the aorticopulmonary ganglion. Filaments leaving the ganglion supplied the pulmonary trunk, ascending aorta, interatrial septum, pulmonary veins, and, as the left sinal nerve, the fold of the left vena cava. The thoracic vagal filaments descended to the left of the arch of the aorta and supplied chiefly the arterial end of the heart. No thoracic sympathetic cardiac filaments were found. The sinu-atrial node began as a crescentic mass in front of the lower part of the superior vena cava. It gradually extended on each side of the superior vena cava and came to form its posterior wall at a more caudal level. The atrial myocardium that formed the septum spurium, venous valves, and interatrial septum could be traced from the sinu-atrial to the atrioventricular node. Myocardium also encircled the atrial aspects of the atrioventricular orifices, and could be traced caudally to the atrioventricular nde. The atrioventricular node was a conspicuous mass in the anterior and lower part of the interatrial septum, from which a clearly defined bundle left to enter the interventricular septum.

The orientation of the larva is such that view is of the larval ventral surface and larval anterior is on the left in each image. Since the images were reflected by the IX 81 inverted microscope, the images should be reflected to obtain the correct left-right view. The images are tif images saved in sequence into one folder. Each tif image can be viewed individually or the series of tif images contained in the folder can be analysed by image analysis software such as ImageJ available from the National Institutes of Health site ([URL] Scale bar 100 µm. The Z stack in this archive is representative of a late brachiolaria larva of P. exigua recorded in the Olympus FluoView 1000 laser scanning system. It is from a study of the morphology of the coeloms and their <b>interconnexions</b> in a pre-metamorphic brachiolaria larva. The data of the Z stack show the coelom on the left and right sides of the larva linked anteriorly, over the head of the archenteron, by a common anterior coelom. The asymmetry of the larger left and the smaller right larval coeloms translates into the oral and aboral coeloms of the juvenile sea star. The morphology of the coeloms in a late brachiolaria larva of an asteroid has application in the search for morphological homology between the echinoderm classes and the deuterostome phyla. ***** Late brachiolaria larvae of P. exigua were fixed seven days after fertilization in 2. 5 % (v/v) glutaraldehyde in filtered sea water for 1 - 2 hours, dehydrated in an ethanol series to 100 % ethanol, then cleared in 2 : 1 (v/v) benzyl benzoate/benzyl alcohol.

40|$|In South America, the Holocene is {{characterized}} by a high climate variability linked to the <b>interconnexions</b> between insolation, interannual Pacific and interdecadal Pacific and Atlantic variability. The phenomenon of waters upwelling is extremely important on climatic and ecological points of view. They may have a large retroactive influence on both the climatic environment developed close to the coasts, and the nutrient enrichment of the water column: a key factor that supports the regional fisheries activity. Upwelling zones, more frequent and intense on the western margins of continents, may also occur on some eastern margins. The Mejillones Bay (Chile, 23 °S, 70. 5 °W) contains one of the more productive zones of the oceans due to the presence of a permanent upwelling system. Located on the western Pacific margin, this bay presents a specific geographical setting and a peculiar local current system, which induce an anoxic water-sediment interface. Therefore, laminated organic-rich sediments accumulate due to high productivity combined with a minimum disturbance and weak oxic degradation. The close continental arid climate drastically inhibits terrigenous inputs to the bay, so that the only sedimentary detrital fraction is related to wind-driven processes. Although less intense than other areas in the world, the Cabo Frio (Brazil, 23 °S, 42 °W) coastal upwelling cell is controlled by three main factors: 1) the topography and the orientation of the coastline, 2) the position of the Brazilian Stream axes and 3) the wind pattern. The upwelling events of this region have a strong seasonal signature, which is concentrated during austral spring and summer, mostly associated with NE-ENE winds. The topic of this project is to compare the sedimentary records of both permanent and seasonal resurgences submitted to different wind and climate systems {{in order to determine the}} large-scale processes that may affect the complex relationship between SACZ variability, cold fronts displacements and El Nino events. In this study, organic matter which is a good sedimentary marker for reconstructing upwelling variability will be determined through C, N and S contents, Rock-Eval parameters (TOC, HI), palynofacies composition, stable isotope analysis and alkenones. For this, a high-resolution sampling of the Holocene sediments was firstly realized on the continental shelf of Cabo Frio, collected at depths shallower than 150 m using Kullenberg piston cores. Additionnal coring in Mejillones bay will be performed during Spring 2004. First results show that conversely to Mejillones, the sediment is an homogeneous clay in which organic matter presents a variability in content and quality. The occurrence of humid climatic conditions on the continent drainage output not far from cape may be inducing an additional organic supply deriving from higher plants, which is superimposed to the marine organic matter.

40|$|Le Rio Desaguadero relie le lac Titicaca (alt. 3 810 m) au lac Poopo (alt. 3 670 m) dans le bassin endoréique de l'Altiplano, en Bolivie, (fig. 1). Le bassin versant est constitué de terrains sédimentaires et volcaniques, avec une végétation steppique et aucune source de {{pollution}} organique. Le climat très variable présente d'une alternance de saisons humide et sèche. Le Rio Mauri fournit 90 % du flux de MES estimé à 6, 6. 106 t an- 1 (d'après GUYOT et al., 1990). Des analyses de COT et d'autres paramètres chimiques ont été réalisées sur 15 stations en 3 campagnes (fig. 2 et tableau 1). Une ACP (fig. 3) révèle une corrélation entre COT et MES, correspondant à deux épisodes de crues (déc. 87 et fév. 88) (tableau 2). Des hypothèses concernant l'origine du carbone organique et les flux sont avancées (tableau 3). Un flux de base, principalement du COD provenant du lac Titicaca, représenterait 18 000 t an- 1. Mais le COP, quoique fortement corrélé aux MES, n'a pas la même origine que celles-ci (fig. 4); il proviendrait principalement des zones connexes au Rio Desaguadero riches en végétation aquatique. La contribution de ces flux aux bilans du carbone organique paraît négligeable pour le lac Titicaca et peu importante pour le lac Poopo. Mais le maintien des <b>interconnexions</b> entre le Rio Desaguadero et ses zones humides doit être intégré dans les projets d'aménagement. The Rio Desaguadero is {{the outlet}} of Lake Titicaca and flows into Lake Poopo in the endorheic watershed of the Altiplano in Bolivia (alt. 3 650 m); its main tributary is the Rio Mauri (fig. 1). The transport of dissolved and suspended solids has been recently evaluated by GUYOT et al. (1990). The data on Total Organic Carbon {{obtained for the}} first time in this hydrosystem allow to complement this investigation with an estimation of the organic carbon transport. The Altiplano is a basin filed with tertiary and quaternary sediments. The Eastern cordillera is constituted of primary rocks; the Rio Mauri flow from a tertiary volcanic watershed. The climate is rather cold, semi-arid (700 to 400 mm yr- 1) and the vegetation is steppe-like with extensive pastures (sheep, lamas). The rainy season lasts from December to March. No direct pollution source can affect the TOC. The hydrology is very variable (see GUYOT et al., 1990). The base flow issues from Lake Titicaca and depends on the water level in the lake. The Total Suspended Solids (TSS) content is very high during floods. The annual flux of TSS is 6. 6 106 t yr- 1 at Ulloma, 90 % of transported sediment coming from the Rio Mauri. TOC was measured during 3 sampling series at 15 different stations (table 1). The 25 ml samples were acidified (pH 1) with H 3 PO 4 and sent to Lyon (France) to be analysed with a Dohrmann DC 80. In February 1988, Dissolved Organic Carbon was measured on filtered samples (Whatman GF/C decarbonated at 550 °C). The major elements were analysed in La Paz (Bolivia). Raw TOC data are presented (fig. 2), with a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for 9 parameters on all the samples (fig. 3). The first axis (52 % of total variance) is a scale of mineralization; it reveals a progressive concentration of dissolved elements in the Lake Poopo outlet (fig. 3 B first cluster). The mineralization of these samples seems to be inversely correlated to the discharge flowing from Lake Titicaca for the corresponding series. The second axis (23 % of total variance) shows a correlation between the TOC and the TSS (fig. 3 B, 4 th cluster). This correlation is obvious for the samples of Dec. 87 and Feb. 88 (table 2), when TSS concentrations are high due to flash floods of some effluents. Equation (1) gives the hast regression of TOC vs TSS. The organic Carbon transported is constituted of dissolved (DOC) or Particulate Organic Carbon (POC). Estimation presented for DOC and POC transport at the three gauging stations (table 3) are based on the following hypotheses :In the Rio Desaguadero, DOC concentrations seam relatively stable (fig. 2 D). Upstream of the Rio Mauri, the TOC transported at an average concentration of 11 mg. l- 1 is assumed to be mainly DOC flowing out from Lake Titicaca. DOC transport may constitute a relatively constant base flow of organic carbon. Estimation of POC transport is much more difficult. During floods from tributaries, the rise in TOC concentrations correlated with an increase of TSS seems to be essentially due to the POC. Following a classical method (MEYBECK, 1982), a non-linear regression of percentages of POC In TSS vs TSS was calculed (equation 2), using the samples with high TSS concentrations (fig. 4 A). Then, the POC fluxes were estimated using daily data of TSS for the gauging stations CA and UL. As most of the TSS come from the Rio Mauri results from this estimation that the flow rate of TOC from this stream would reach 7 t km- 2 yr- 1. But this value according to MEYBECK (1982) is close to the export of a tropical rainforest. Thus, this hypothesis of a POC transport directly linked to the TSS flux must be rejected. POC and TSS, although correlated, have distinct origins. This is shown by the tact that the percentages of POC in TSS in the samples used to calculate equation (2) are much higher than those given by MEYBECK (1982) for world rivers (fig. 4 B). A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the POC could come from Rio Desaguadero Borders and wetlands, often rich in aquatic vegetation, and very extensive in some places (especially upstream of Nazacara and downstream of Eucaliptus). This particulate carbon might be flushed into the mainstream during rainy periods, while at the same time TSS flow down from tributaries. Hypotheses on POC transport (table 3) in the Rio Desaguadero are thus based on a POC/TSS correlation (equation (2)) valid only for the mainstream, the contribution of Rio Mauri to the total flux being estimated on the basis of e TOC export rate of 0. 5 t km- 2 yr- 1. Contribution of these fluxes to organic carbon budgets seems to be negligible for Lake Titicaca, whose phytoplanctonic primary production is estimated at 4 106 t C yr- 1 (RICHERSON et al., 1977). When considering only the labile fraction of TOC (ITTEKOT, 1988), the readily matabolizable organic carbon input in Lake Poopo hydrosystem could be evaluated to 36 000 t yr- 1, corresponding to about 13 g C m- 2 yr- 1; that might be unimportant for this presumably highly productive lake system. In conclusion, these preliminary data lead to hypotheses which consider the Rio Desaguadero as a very particular hydrosystem in organic carbon transport. If most of the particulate carbon comes from margins, the necessity for maintaining <b>interconnexions</b> between the main Carmel and the wetlands fn future regulation projects must be emphasized...|$|R
