25|$|As power {{dissipation}} of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A heat sink design must fulfill both its thermal {{as well as}} its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in thermal contact with its heat sink with reasonable shock and vibration. The heat sink could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate heat sink mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy, wire-form z clips, <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> clips, standoff spacers, and push pins with ends that expand after installing.|$|E

50|$|In {{one type}} of microswitch, {{internally}} there are two conductive springs. A long <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> is hinged {{at one end of}} the switch (the left, in the photograph) and has electrical contacts on the other. A small curved spring, preloaded (i.e., compressed during assembly) so it attempts to extend itself (at the top, just right of center in the photo), is connected between the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> near the contacts and a fulcrum near the midpoint of the <b>flat</b> <b>spring.</b> An actuator nub presses on the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> near its hinge point.|$|E
5000|$|As the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> moves {{downward}} {{the upward}} {{force of the}} curved spring reduces causing the motion to accelerate {{even in the absence}} of further motion of the actuator until the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> impacts the normally-open contact. Even though the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> unflexes as it moves downward, the switch is designed so the net effect is acceleration. This [...] "over-center" [...] action produces a very distinctive clicking sound and a very crisp feel.|$|E
40|$|In {{oil palm}} harvesting, falling fruit bunches have a {{considerable}} potential energy, {{which can be}} captured and used to power the wheelbarrow in evacuating the fruit bunches. This {{study was conducted to}} design a mechanism of oil palm fresh fruit bunches catchment and its potential energy utilization. The potential energy of falling fruit bunches during oil palm harvesting that stored in the <b>flat</b> spiral <b>spring,</b> and used to drive the wheelbarrow. The actual energy potential and torque performance of <b>flat</b> spiral <b>spring</b> was measured by using a torque and potential energy measuring apparatus. The results showed that the potential energy from falling fruit bunches could store in the <b>flat</b> spiral <b>spring</b> mechanism, with storage efficiency of 39. 39 %. By means of 1. 5 rotation of <b>flat</b> spiral <b>spring,</b> the maximum torque of the <b>flat</b> spiral <b>spring</b> was 53. 35 Nm. The utilization of potential energy that stored in the <b>flat</b> spiral <b>spring</b> has been successfully used to drive the wheelbarrow, with utilization efficiency of 80. 39 %. By using the potential energy of 38. 64 J, wheelbarrow could move as far as 0. 41 m to evacuate 48 kg of total weight loads...|$|R

40|$|A new {{suspension}} technique uses <b>flat</b> <b>springs</b> in Euler buckling mode. This {{numerical analysis}} of the basic lever constrained configuration identifies {{the effect of the}} main geometrical parameters, and suitable values for obtaining the most useful force-displacement characteristic.

5000|$|Because the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> is {{anchored}} and strong in tension the curved spring cannot {{move it to}} the right. The curved spring presses, or pulls, the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> upward, that is away, from the anchor point. Owing to the geometry, the upward force {{is proportional to the}} displacement which decreases as the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> moves downward. (Actually, the force is proportional to the sine of the angle, which is approximately proportional to the angle for small angles.) ...|$|E
50|$|As the {{actuator}} depresses it flexes the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> {{while the}} curved spring keeps the electrical contacts touching. When the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> is flexed enough {{it will provide}} sufficient force to compress the curved spring and the contacts will begin to move.|$|E
50|$|In the {{actuated}} position the curved spring provides some upward force. If the actuator is released this will move the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> upward. As the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> moves, the force from the curved spring increases. This results in acceleration until the normally-closed contacts are hit. Just {{as in the}} downward direction, the switch is designed so that the curved spring {{is strong enough to}} move the contacts, even if the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> must flex, because the actuator does not move during the changeover.|$|E

25|$|Most keys have needle springs made of {{phosphor}} bronze, stainless steel, beryllium copper, or a gold alloy. The B thumb keys {{typically have}} <b>flat</b> <b>springs.</b> Phosphor bronze {{is by far}} the most common material for needle springs because it is relatively inexpensive, makes a good spring, and is resistant to corrosion. Unfortunately, it is prone to metal fatigue. Stainless steel also makes a good spring and is resistant to corrosion. Gold springs are found mostly in high-end flutes because of gold's cost.|$|R

50|$|After {{years with}} very little {{innovations}} as the Swiss lever escapement is used in almost all mechanical watches, watchmakers have designed several new types of escapements {{since the beginning of}} the 21st century; Parmigiani Fleurier with its Genequand escapement or Ulysse Nardin with its Ulysse Anchor escapement have taken advantage of the properties of silicon <b>flat</b> <b>springs.</b> The independent watchmaker, De Bethune, has developed a concept where a magnet makes a resonator vibrate at high frequency, replacing the traditional balance spring.|$|R

5000|$|The {{bolt head}} of the Model 110 is a [...] "floating" [...] design: A <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> located behind the front baffle and bolt head {{assembly}} gives the assembly {{a small amount of}} free movement lateral to the bore axis. This motion assures that the locking lugs fully contact the receiver and so headspace is held to a minimum every time the bolt is locked. This feature is a major factor contributing to the accuracy of the rifle.|$|E
50|$|The 1st Issue of the Model 1 was {{the first}} major {{iteration}} (and the least common), with approximately 12,000 produced over a three year period. The features that easily distinguish the 1st issue are the flared, square cornered shaped grip (also seen in the 2nd Issue), the small round side plate, the round profile of the frame between the back of the cylinder and the grip, a split articulated hammer, and the <b>flat</b> <b>spring</b> barrel latch seen in some early variants.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} of the 2nd Issue guns. Variants between serial numbers 12,000 through to about 20,000 involve {{the shape of the}} side plate ("straight" [...] or [...] "round"), the design of the trigger spring (<b>flat</b> <b>spring,</b> V spring or coil spring), and the number of patent dates on the cylinder (two or three).

5000|$|An {{evolution}} of the Model 36 rifle, the Model 336 is easily distinguished from its predecessors by its open ejection port machined {{into the side of}} the receiver. Design improvements include a stronger and simpler round-profile chrome-plated breech bolt, a redesigned cartridge carrier, an improved extractor, and coil-type main and trigger springs in place of the <b>flat</b> <b>springs</b> used in earlier Marlin rifles. [...] Like its predecessors, the receiver and all major working parts of the Model 336 are constructed of steel forgings.|$|R
5000|$|The Brögger System is {{a unique}} key {{mechanism}} which does not use the traditional key and mounting rod system of other flute manufacturers. Miyazawa claims it [...] "features an innovative pinless mechanism allowing precise adjustments and balance of the spring tension of each individual key, resulting in a more even, efortless feel for the flutist." [...] Unlike the Brögger System, traditional flutes need to use <b>flat</b> <b>springs</b> which contact {{the body of the}} flute causing friction and wear.

5000|$|Notwithstanding {{its lack}} of {{commercial}} success the Sharps-Borchardt is admired for its strength and accuracy: reputed {{to be one of}} the strongest if not the strongest rifle action ever built before the latter 20th century. The gun was revolutionary at its time for its use of coil springs as opposed to <b>flat</b> <b>springs.</b> [...] These guns were popular among long-range shooters and Creedmore Match competitors. Many were rechambered for use as small bore varmint rifles. Surviving guns are highly prized by collectors, especially unmodified examples chambered for heavy [...]45 and [...]50-caliber Sharps big-game cartridges.|$|R
