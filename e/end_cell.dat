He abandoned the idea and left the United Kingdom by ferry, eventually resurfacing in Belgium. Fry has attempted suicide on a number of occasions, most recently in 2012.

40|$|The {{cylindrical}} {{shape of}} the fission yeast cell is generated by linear polarized growth from its <b>cell</b> <b>ends.</b> Using immunofluorescence and live imaging microscopy, we have investigated {{the roles of the}} <b>cell</b> <b>end</b> marker tea 1 p in generating linear polarized growth. We found that tea 1 p is primarily transported on plus ends of microtubules from the vicinity of the nucleus to the <b>cell</b> <b>ends,</b> and that its movement near the nucleus is independent of the kinesin tea 2 p. Deletion analysis identified a coiled-coil domain in tea 1 p essential for its retention at <b>cell</b> <b>ends,</b> and demonstrated that tea 1 p exerts different functions dependent on its location. On the tips of microtubules, tea 1 p prevents the curling of microtubules around the <b>cell</b> <b>ends,</b> whereas it is required for maintaining linear cell growth and for retention of polarity factors such as the Dyrk kinase pom 1 p, the CLIP 170 -like tip 1 p, and tea 2 p at the <b>cell</b> <b>ends.</b> We propose that tea 1 p has roles in organizing the microtubule cytoskeleton on the tips of microtubules, and in the retention of factors at the <b>cell</b> <b>ends</b> necessary for the cell to grow in a straight line...|$|R

50|$|Males of Photinus pyralis locate females by {{a series}} of light flashes, to which females respond with a coded delay flash. The light organ of P. pyralis is {{composed}} of two layers; a layer of refractile cells on the dorsal side and a photic layer with light-producing cells on the ventral side. The light organ (specifically the photogenic layer) is supplied with numerous tracheal branches, which are thought to provide the required oxygen for light production. The light-producing enzyme is luciferase, and is found within cells of the lantern. Luciferases require oxygen, luciferin and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to catalyze a chemical reaction that produces bioluminescence in these insects. It has been shown that the glow is not controlled by the tracheal <b>end</b> <b>cells</b> (which were thought to contain valves) nor by central nerve impulses through studies involving low oxygen conditions. Pupae of these beetles have different light organs than the adult. They do not have the characteristic tracheal <b>end</b> <b>cells</b> of the flashing adults, and whereas the adults emit bright flashes, pupae emit low intensity glowing.|$|R

40|$|The {{comparative}} susceptibility of lymphocyte subsets, monocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) {{to killing}} by murine perforin {{was measured using}} physical separation techniques, cell-surface phenotyping and scatter characteristics to isolate cell types, together with propidium iodide (PI) uptake {{as a measure of}} cell death. In the majority of individuals, PMN were more resistant to perforin than other peripheral blood cells including natural killer (NK) cells and CD 8 + lymphocytes. Among the lymphocytes, CD 4 + cells were the most susceptible subset, followed by CD 19 +, CD 8 + and CD 56 + lymphocytes respectively. The human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, HL- 60, and the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line, U 937, were readily killed by perforin. When HL- 60 were differentiated to either macrophage- or neutrophil-like <b>end</b> <b>cells,</b> and U 937 differentiated to macrophage-like <b>end</b> <b>cells,</b> {{there was no difference between}} differentiated and undifferentiated cells in their relative susceptibility to perforin.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} transmembrane potential {{changes at}} the ends of isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes during defibrillation-strength shocks given in the cellular refractory period. The myocytes were stimulated (Si pulse) to produce an action potential. Then a constant-field shock (S 2 pulse) with an electric field of 20 or 40 V/cm was given at an S 1 -S 2 interval of 50 msec. The cells were stained with potentiometric dye (di- 4 -ANEPPS), and the <b>cell</b> <b>end</b> facing the S 2 anode or cathode was illuminated with a laser while the fluorescence was recorded. During S 2, the <b>cell</b> <b>end</b> facing the S 2 cathode became more positive intracellu-larly, whereas the <b>cell</b> <b>end</b> facing the S 2 anode became more negative intracellularly. The S 2 -induced transmembrane potential change at the <b>cell</b> <b>end</b> (AVm) was determined relative to the amplitude of the Si-induced action potential (APA) in each recording (i. e., AVm/APA). In Tyrode's solution containing 4. 5 mM potassium, AVm/APA for 40 -V/cm S 2 was 1. 36 + 0. 34 at the <b>cell</b> <b>end</b> facing the S 2 cathode and- 1. 65 + 0. 61 at the <b>cell</b> <b>end</b> facing the S 2 anode (n= 9). For the 20 -V/cm S 2, AVMAPA was 0. 61 i 0. 33 at the <b>cell</b> <b>end</b> facing the S 2 cathode and- 0. 71 i 0. 33 at the <b>cell</b> <b>end</b> facing the S 2 anode (n= 6). The AVm/APA was not significantly influenced by 20 mM diacetyl monoxime. These results indicate that large AVm values occurred at the <b>ends</b> of the <b>cells</b> during S 2. The calculated values of AVm, assuming a nominal APA of 130 mV, were 177 and- 214 mV for the 40 -V/cm S 2 and 79 and- 93 mV for the 20 -V/cm S 2.
