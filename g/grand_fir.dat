5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, <b>grand</b> <b>fir</b> and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. <b>Grand</b> <b>fir</b> is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, <b>grand</b> <b>fir</b> is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{important}} trees species and specimens; a <b>Grand</b> <b>Fir</b> in Argyll is the tallest tree in the United Kingdom and the Fortingall Yew may be the oldest tree in Europe. The Arran Whitebeams, Shetland Mouse-ear and Scottish Primrose are endemic flowering plants and there {{are a variety}} of endemic mosses and lichens. Conservation of the natural environment is well developed and various organisations play an important role in the stewardship of the country's flora. Numerous references to the country's flora appear in folklore, song and poetry.|$|E

50|$|The Oregon Giant {{earthworm}} is {{endemic to}} Oregon {{and has been}} found at 15 sites in the Willamette Valley and one additional site within the Oregon Coast Range. Like Oregon’s other indigenous worms, this species has a narrow range of tolerance for soil conditions, favoring fine textured soils rich in clay. It appears to prefer well drained soils (fine-grained, clay to silt loams) that are near subsurface water, often where the water table is reachable but the soil is not waterlogged. This species is associated with deep, little-disturbed soils in moist mixed forest of Douglas <b>firs,</b> <b>grand</b> <b>firs,</b> and bigleaf maples and is also known from pure Douglas-fir woodlots and occasionally from oak-ash woods. It is apparently tolerant of the acidic soil found under coniferous forests.|$|R
5|$|The flora of {{the country}} is varied {{incorporating}} both deciduous and coniferous woodland and moorland and tundra species. However, large scale commercial tree planting and the management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and commercial field sport activities impacts upon the distribution of indigenous plants and animals. The UK's tallest tree is a <b>grand</b> <b>fir</b> planted beside Loch Fyne, Argyll in the 1870s, and the Fortingall Yew may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in Europe. Although the number of native vascular plants is low by world standards, Scotland's substantial bryophyte flora is of global importance.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{is part of}} the Fuels Planning: Science Synthesis and Integration Project, a pilot project initiated by the USDA Forest Service to respond to the need for tools and information useful for planning site-specific fuel (vegetation) treatment projects. The information addresses fuel and forest conditions of the dry inland forests of the Western United States: those dominated by ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, dry <b>grand</b> fir/white <b>fir,</b> and dry lodgepole pine potential vegetation types. Information was developed primarily for application at the stand level and is intended to be useful within this forest type regardless of ownership. Portions of the information also will be directly applicable to the pinyon pine/juniper potential vegetation types. Many of the concepts and tools developed by the project will be useful for planning fuel projects in other forest types. In particular, many of the social science findings would have direct applicability to fuel planning activity for forests throughout the United States. As is the case in the use of all models and information developed for specific purposes, our tools should be used with a full understanding of their limitations and applicability.

25|$|Extensive logging of redwoods {{began in}} the early nineteenth century. The trees were felled by ax and saw onto beds of tree limbs and shrubs to cushion their fall. Stripped of their bark, the logs were transported to mills or {{waterways}} by oxen or horse. Loggers then burned the accumulated tree limbs, shrubs, and bark. The repeated fires favored secondary forests of primarily redwoods as redwood seedlings sprout readily in burned areas. The introduction of steam engines allowed logs to be dragged through long skid trails to nearby railroads, furthering the reach of loggers beyond the land nearby rivers previously used to transport trees. This method of harvesting, however, disturbed large amounts of soil, producing secondary-growth forests of species other than redwood such as Douglas-fir, <b>grand</b> <b>fir,</b> and western hemlock. After World War II, trucks and tractors gradually replaced steam engines, giving rise to two harvesting approaches: clearcutting and selection harvesting. Clearcutting involved felling all the trees in a particular area and was encouraged by tax law which exempted all standing timber from taxation if 70% of trees in the area were harvested. Selection logging, by contrast, called for the removal 25% to 50% of mature trees in the hopes that the remaining trees would allow for future growth and reseeding. This method, however, encouraged growth of other tree species, converting redwood forests into mixed forests of redwood, <b>grand</b> <b>fir,</b> Sitka spruce, and western hemlock. Moreover, the trees left standing were often felled by windthrow; that is, they were often blown over by the wind.|$|E

60|$|You may see her now, as {{she walks}} down the {{favorite}} turning and enters the Deeps by a narrow path through a group of Scotch firs, her tall figure and old lavender gown visible through an hereditary black silk shawl of some wide-meshed net-like material; and now she is sure of being unseen she takes off her bonnet and ties it over her arm. One would certainly suppose her to be farther on in life than her seventeenth year--perhaps because of the slow resigned sadness of the glance from which all search and unrest seem to have departed; perhaps because her broad-chested figure has the mould of early womanhood. Youth and health have withstood well the involuntary and voluntary hardships of her lot, and the nights in which she has lain on the hard floor for a penance have left no obvious trace; the eyes are liquid, the brown cheek is firm and round, the full lips are red. With her dark coloring and jet crown surmounting her tall figure, {{she seems to have}} a sort of kinship with the <b>grand</b> Scotch <b>firs,</b> at which she is looking up as if she loved them well. Yet one has a sense of uneasiness in looking at her,--a sense of opposing elements, of which a fierce collision is imminent; surely there is a hushed expression, such as one often sees in older faces under borderless caps, out of keeping with the resistant youth, which one expects to flash out in a sudden, passionate glance, that will dissipate all the quietude, like a damp fire leaping out again when all seemed safe.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a pretty}} scene outside the house: the farmers and their {{families}} were moving about the lawn, among the flowers and shrubs, or along the broad straight road leading from the east front, where a carpet of mossy grass spread on each side, studded here and there with a dark flat-boughed cedar, or a <b>grand</b> pyramidal <b>fir</b> sweeping the ground with its branches, all tipped with a fringe of paler green. The groups of cottagers in the park were gradually diminishing, the young ones being attracted towards the lights that were beginning to gleam from {{the windows of the}} gallery in the abbey, which was to be their dancing-room, and some of the sober elder ones thinking it time to go home quietly. One of these was Lisbeth Bede, and Seth went with her--not from filial attention only, for his conscience would not let him join in dancing. It had been rather a melancholy day to Seth: Dinah had never been more constantly present with him than in this scene, where everything was so unlike her. He saw her all the more vividly after looking at the thoughtless faces and gay-coloured dresses of the young women--just as one feels the beauty and the greatness of a pictured Madonna the more when it has been for a moment screened from us by a vulgar head in a bonnet. But this presence of Dinah in his mind only helped him to bear the better with his mother's mood, which had been becoming more and more querulous for the last hour. Poor Lisbeth was suffering from a strange conflict of feelings. Her joy and pride in the honour paid to her darling son Adam was beginning to be worsted in the conflict with the jealousy and fretfulness which had revived when Adam came to tell her that Captain Donnithorne desired him to join the dancers in the hall. Adam was getting more and more out of her reach; she wished all the old troubles back again, for then it mattered more to Adam what his mother said and did.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to his teaching, Grand conducted research {{on a variety of}} mycological areas. Grand did research on ectomycorrhizal fungi {{on a wide variety of}} plants including conifers and ericaceous plants. His PhD work focused on the genus Suillus, which is an ectomycorrhizal fungus that associates with a variety of conifers. Grand did not describe many species, but he resurrected the name Suillus americanus var. reticulipes, which later was redacted to S. americanus. He did some research with ectomycorrhizae fungi associated with ericaceous hosts, which led to a patent for a method of lyophilizing ericoid mycorrhizae fungi for horticulture application. In addition, he studied the biology of ectomycorrhizal trees and the resiliency of trees when grown in suboptimal environments, such as high air pollutants. His passion was for wood decay fungi, and this was highlighted in his research on this group of fungi. Several projects were related to the biogeography of poroid wood decay fungi, and were in part possible due to his participation in the All Taxon Biodiversity Inventory Project of the Great Smoky Mountains. These projects resulted in expanding geographic distribution ranges, ecological niches, and hosts of numerous species of wood decay fungi. This research showed that North Carolina and the Southern Appalachia region is a center of biodiversity of wood decay fungi and a transition for temperate and subtropical species of wood decay fungi. Grand's work on wood decay fungi in this area was greatly important, and will continue to be cited as geographic ranges expand due to climate change. Grand served as the fungal inventory biologist for the North Carolina Parks Service. Lastly, he was involved with research that was related to plant pathogenic fungi, including work with powdery mildew on several hosts, Honeylocust canker, Fusiform rust, and Phytophthora root rot of Frasier <b>Fir.</b> <b>Grand</b> was highly published in journals to include Phytopathology, Mycologia, Mycotaxon and Plant Disease to name a few.
