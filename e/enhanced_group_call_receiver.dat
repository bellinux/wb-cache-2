5000|$|In {{telecommunication}} {{and computer}} engineering, the queuing delay or queueing delay {{is the time}} a job waits in a queue until it can be executed. It is {{a key component of}} network delay. In a switched network, queuing delay is the time between the completion of signaling by the call originator and the arrival of a ringing signal at the <b>call</b> <b>receiver.</b> Queues may be caused by delays at the originating switch, intermediate switches, or the <b>call</b> <b>receiver</b> servicing switch. In a data network, queuing delay is the sum of the delays between the request for service and the establishment of a circuit to the called data terminal equipment (DTE). In a packet-switched network, queuing delay is the sum of the delays encountered by a packet between the time of insertion into the network and the time of delivery to the addressee.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 Study Objective: Early {{recognition}} of CPR is crucial given the large burden of out-of –hospital cardiac arrest {{events in the}} US and bystander CPR increases patient survival. Limited English proficiency can delay and prevent timely emergency response. This study examines and compares the possible barriers of communication between limited English proficient callers and non-limited English proficient callers and 9 - 1 - 1 <b>call</b> <b>receivers</b> (CR) resulting in delays in telephone-assisted CPR (T-CPR) during cardiac arrest calls. Methods: The cohort of this study consisted of 112 out –of-hospital confirmed cardiac arrest calls, where the <b>call</b> <b>receiver</b> (CR) identified the need for T-CPR, in King County, Washington between 2010 and 2012. The CPR delays related the CRs {{recognition of}} need for CPR {{and the start of}} T-CPR were examined in limited English and non-limited English proficient callers. In addition, the reasons why CPR was delayed or not performed were also examined. Results: Fifty-eight out of 60 (97 %) limited English proficiency calls and 34 out of 52 calls (69. 4 %) of non-LEP calls included delays in performing CPR. Limited English proficient calls had more delays associated with the reporting party (RP) (85 % (51 / 60) LEP vs 51. 9 % (27 / 52) non-LEP, p< 0. 01). The RP-related delays in the recognition of need of CRP were due to ambiguous responses to <b>call</b> <b>receiver’s</b> questions (20 % (12 / 60) LEP vs 1. 92 % (1 / 52) non LEP, p< 0. 01). Three reasons were associated with overall CPR being delayed or not initiated: RP language barrier (p< 0. 01), RP not at scene (p= 0. 01) and RP confusion about patient consciousness state (p< 0. 01). Reporting party delays in the start of T-CPR were observed for more non-LEP calls (40 % (12 / 30) vs 25 % (9 / 36) than LEP calls. Conclusion: Limited English callers experienced more delays than non-LEP callers related to communication barriers between the RP and 9 - 1 - 1 <b>call</b> <b>receiver</b> Identifying the delays associated with the implementation of bystander T-CPR may provide training opportunities for telecommunicators and help tailor CPR training and 9 - 1 - 1 education in limited English proficient communities...|$|R

The detector principle {{is based on the}} measurement of changes of capacitances between electrodes, which are affected by the location of a human-body. For the purpose of rapid evaluation of the features of the system, based on several simplifications and assumptions a draft model has been developed. Three-signal auto-calibration technique is applied to eliminate drift, gain and offset errors of the electronics. Furthermore, overall system calibration is applied to eliminate environmental effects...|$|R
