40|$|<b>Ebrotidine</b> {{is a new}} H 2 -receptor {{antagonist}} that, {{in addition}} to its antisecretory activity, exhibits a remarkable ability for gastric mu-cosal protection and acts as a potent inhibitor of protease and lipase enzymes elaborated by Helicobacter pylon. To study the metabolism of <b>ebrotidine</b> in human urine, HPLC/MS with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface and simultaneous UV detection was conducted. HPLC/MS sepa-ration of the reference compounds was performed, and positive and negative APCI mass spectra were obtained. Compounds of low molecular weight (M < 300) showed predominantly the quasi-molecular ion. Intermediate size compounds (300 < M < 400) gave a different type of spectra, depending on the ion mode: the positive mass spectra showed only the protonated molecular ion, whereas in the negative mass spectra many fragments appeared in addition to the deprotonated molecular ion.

40|$|Ranitidine {{may cause}} liver {{injuries}} ranging from transient, subclinical serum transaminases increase every 100 - 1, 000 treated patients to cholestatic hepatitis {{in less than}} 1 / 100, 000. Other H 2 -receptor antagonists are more dangerous: 11 toxic hepatitis cases have been reported as adverse effect after 1 year of marketed <b>ebrotidine.</b> A 75 -year-old male with ischemic cardiopathy history was started on an 8 days treatment of oral ranitidine due to pirosis, without any other changes of therapy; 48 h after drug withdrawal, light-coloured stools, dark urine and icteric scleras developed. On hospital admission, 10 days later, physical examination showed slight hepatomegaly and severe jaundice with skin excoriations followed by serum mixed bilirubin further increase and aminotransferases activities mild rise. Total bilirubin peaked at 381. 33 mmol/l (5. 1 - 17. 1) and progressively returned to normal, after discharge home, in 3 months and now, 1 year later, {{there is no sign}} of liver disease. Ultrasonographic biliary anomalies and the most frequent causes of liver damage were excluded. Liver biopsy confirmed ranitidine as the most likely cause of liver toxicity since histological and ultramicroscopical study revealed a drug-induced picture. We report a rare case of intrahepatic cholestasis jaundice related to ranitidine, a widely used drug. Diagnosis would need an ethically unacceptable rechallange test...|$|E
