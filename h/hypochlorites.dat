5|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} (Cl2O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) {{which may}} be obtained by reacting chlorine gas with yellow mercury(II) oxide. It is very soluble in water, {{in which it is}} in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which it is the anhydride of. It is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make <b>hypochlorites.</b> It explodes on heating or sparking or in the presence of ammonia gas.|$|E
25|$|Chloramine {{is used as}} a {{disinfectant}} {{for water}} because it is less aggressive than chlorine and more stable against light than <b>hypochlorites.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{reactions}} are usually {{carried out at}} room temperature or below. Methylene chloride is commonly employed, although in catalytic systems employing highly polar chlorites or <b>hypochlorites,</b> a two-phase aqueous-organic system must be used. The pH of the reaction medium should be carefully controlled; for nitroxide-catalyzed reactions the pH is usually maintained between 8 and 11.|$|E
50|$|Shock {{chlorination}} is {{a process}} used in many swimming pools, water wells, springs, and other water sources to reduce the bacterial and algal residue in the water. Shock chlorination is performed by mixing {{a large amount of}} <b>hypochlorite</b> into the water. The <b>hypochlorite</b> can be {{in the form of a}} powder or a liquid such as chlorine bleach (solution of sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> or calcium <b>hypochlorite</b> in water). Water that is being shock chlorinated should not be swum in or drunk until the sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> count in the water goes down to three parts per million (PPM) or until the calcium <b>hypochlorite</b> count goes down to 0.2 to 0.35 PPM.|$|R

50|$|Stability is the {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} formation of <b>hypochlorite</b> salts and many simply cannot be formed. Only lithium <b>hypochlorite</b> LiOCl, calcium <b>hypochlorite</b> Ca(OCl)2 and barium <b>hypochlorite</b> Ba(ClO)2 have been isolated as pure anhydrous compounds, all of which are solids. A wider variety of compounds exist in aqueous solution and in general the greater the dilution the greater their stability.|$|R
25|$|The use of {{chlorites}} {{as terminal}} oxidants {{in conjunction with}} both <b>hypochlorites</b> and TEMPO gives carboxylic acids without chlorination side products. The reaction is usually carried out in two steps in the same pot: partial oxidation is effected with TEMPO and hypochlorite, then chlorite is added to complete the oxidation. Only primary alcohol oxidation is observed. In conjunction with Sharpless dihydroxylation, this method {{can be used to}} generate enantiopure α-hydroxy acids.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline <b>hypochlorites</b> (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole, fluconazole or itraconazole). Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as chlorhexidine is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E
500|$|Labarraque's {{research}} {{resulted in}} the use of chlorides and <b>hypochlorites</b> of lime (calcium hypochlorite) and of sodium (sodium hypochlorite) in the boyauderies. [...] The same chemicals were found to be useful in the routine disinfection and deodorization of latrines, sewers, markets, abattoirs, anatomical theatres, and morgues. They were successful in hospitals, lazarets, prisons, infirmaries (both on land and at sea), magnaneries, stables, cattle-sheds, etc.; and they were beneficial during exhumations, embalming, outbreaks of epidemic disease, fever, and blackleg in cattle.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} route for mono-oxygenation is via the [...] "peroxide shunt" [...] (path [...] "S" [...] in figure).

5000|$|Bleaching powder is any {{of various}} {{mixtures}} of calcium <b>hypochlorite,</b> lime (calcium hydroxide), and calcium chloride. Also known as [...] "chlorinated lime", {{it is used}} {{in many of the}} same applications as sodium <b>hypochlorite,</b> but is more stable and contains more available chlorine. It is usually a white powder. A purer, more stable form of calcium <b>hypochlorite</b> is called HTH or high test <b>hypochlorite.</b> Bleaching tablets contain calcium <b>hypochlorite</b> and other ingredients to prevent the tablets from crumbling. A supposedly more stable mixture of calcium <b>hypochlorite</b> and quicklime (calcium oxide) is known as [...] "tropical bleach".

40|$|Fourteen {{disinfectants}} {{were tested}} in vitro for activity against soil bacteria and fungi attached to a boot worn in New Zealand, and then eight were further evaluated on three types of field-worn footwear. From in vitro tests sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> (Janola™), calcium <b>hypochlorite</b> (Haz-Tab™) and a quaternary ammonium product (Trimove®) gave almost complete kill of bacteria. Four disinfectants (sodium <b>hypochlorite,</b> phenols (Prephen™), hypochlorous acid plus hypobromous acid (Nylate™) and calcium <b>hypochlorite)</b> also gave complete kill of fungi. Field tests showed that five disinfectants (sodium <b>hypochlorite,</b> calcium <b>hypochlorite,</b> formaldehyde, hypochlorous acid plus hypobromous acid, and the quaternary ammonium product) were as effective as dipotassium peroxodisulphate (Virkon® – a standard biosecurity treatment for disinfecting footwear).

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>hypochlorite</b> {{treatment}} on the layer thickness and conductivity of a state-of-the-art high conducting poly(3, 4 - ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is investigated {{as a function}} of exposure time and <b>hypochlorite</b> concentration. Because of overoxidation by the <b>hypochlorite</b> the PEDOT:PSS conductivity is decreased by 10 orders of magnitude. Comparison of thickness and conductivity {{as a function of}} time shows that a residual insulating layer remains on the substrate upon treatment. Going from a low (0. 1 %) <b>hypochlorite</b> concentration the interaction between PEDOT:PSS and <b>hypochlorite</b> changes from reaction- to diffusion limited. The decrease in conductivity can be interpreted in terms of the interruption of percolating conductive pathways by the reaction between PEDOT and <b>hypochlorite.</b> © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> {{solution}} as {{a cleaning}} reagent is common practice among many laboratories for contamination minimisation purposes. Whilst its effectiveness in the decontamination of tools and surfaces has been verified at specific concentrations, {{it has not yet}} been established whether any residual sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> potentially remaining on tools/surfaces following cleaning has a detrimental effect if direct contact is made with an exhibit containing DNA. To investigate the effect of residual <b>hypochlorite,</b> surfaces were treated with 10 % <b>hypochlorite</b> (air-dried or wiped dry), 1 % <b>hypochlorite</b> (air-dried or wiped dry), or 1 % <b>hypochlorite</b> (wiped dry) followed by the application of water (wiped dry). Treated surfaces came into contact with surfaces carrying 200. ng of DNA within 100. μL, or 20. ng within 20. μL. To observe the potential degrading effects of sodium <b>hypochlorite,</b> {{the quantity and quality of}} DNA within DNA deposits following contact with treated and untreated surfaces were compared. Overall, no degrading effect on DNA quantity/quality was observed, with the exception of DNA deposits that came into contact with surfaces treated with 10 % <b>hypochlorite</b> and air-dried.
