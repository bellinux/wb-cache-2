5|$|Although {{his poor}} batting meant his form as an all-rounder was disappointing, {{he had a}} very good season as a bowler. Nevertheless, <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> to tour Australia that winter with the MCC team {{surprised}} commentators.|$|E
5|$|Chosen for the Gentlemen v Players, Fender had {{his first}} success in the fixture, hitting 50 in 40 minutes, the highest score for the Gentlemen in the match; it may have {{influenced}} <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> for the MCC team to tour Australia. Some sections of the press suggested Fender should captain that team, but Reginald Spooner was initially appointed by the MCC; when he was unavailable, J.W.H.T.Douglas became captain. Fender {{was included in the}} team, and the press regarded <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> as a formality.|$|E
5|$|Favre's {{milestone}} 2007 season culminated with <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> to the 2008 Pro Bowl as {{the starting}} quarterback for the NFC, but an ankle injury forced him {{to withdraw from the}} game.|$|E

50|$|All of the {{original}} poetry books by Kiarostami alongside <b>his</b> <b>selections</b> from Persian classic and contemporary poets including Nima, Hafez, Rumi and Saadi were translated into English by Iman Tavassoly and Paul Cronin in 2015 and were published as bilingual (Persian/English) editions in New York City. Kiarostami has two other poetry books which are anthologies entitled Night with <b>his</b> <b>selections</b> {{from a variety of}} classical and contemporary Persian poets on the topic of Night which were translated into English as well.|$|R
5|$|Illingworth was {{selected}} to make his first-class début for Victoria against Tasmania at Kardinia Park in Geelong in February 1962. <b>His</b> <b>selection</b> had generated controversy since he had twice been no-balled for throwing by two different umpires in Melbourne district cricket in the two seasons prior to <b>his</b> <b>selection.</b> One of the occasions in district cricket, he had been no-balled three times in one over. At the time, Tasmania {{were not in the}} Sheffield Shield competition, so it was a one-off match.|$|E
5|$|Ben Tudhope (born 13 December 1999) is an Australian Paralympian who {{competed in}} para-snowboard cross at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi. <b>His</b> <b>selection</b> {{at the age}} of 14 meant that he became Australia's {{youngest}} Winter Paralympian, replacing Michael Milton. He was the youngest competitor at the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games from any country.|$|E
5|$|Leopold I was crowned on 21 July 1831, {{replacing}} Baron Surlet de Chokier, who {{had served}} as regent since February. Before <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> by the National Congress, Leopold had been Duke of the minor German state of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. He had pursued a distinguished military career fighting for the Russian Empire during the Napoleonic Wars and was well connected to other European monarchies.|$|E
5000|$|P. Schuyler Miller {{noted that}} Greenberg had limited <b>his</b> <b>selections</b> to [...] "largely if not entirely unanthologized stories," [...] {{limiting}} the contents to lesser if less familiar {{stories on the}} central theme.|$|R
50|$|Afro is Loda’s {{term for}} 1. <b>his</b> <b>selections</b> from African-influenced disco, soul, funk, and jazz fusion genres; 2. <b>his</b> <b>selections</b> of {{alternative}} and experimental dance music that typically comprised {{the first hour}} of his sets; 3. his general mixing style; and 4. a 1982-1984 series of his mix tapes. In recent interviews, he has suggested a preference for the term freestyle rather than Afro, and he makes a distinction between Cosmic and his style, claiming that Cosmic music {{is the sound of}} mid-1980s and later pretenders, is a misnomer popular only outside of Italy, and isn’t even a real genre.|$|R

5|$|Whoever Cuthbert was {{prior to}} his {{election}} to Canterbury, he probably owed <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> as archbishop {{to the influence of}} Æthelbald, King of Mercia. A number of Mercians were appointed to Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, which suggests that Mercian authority was expanding into Kent.|$|E
5|$|Wulfhelm (died 12 February 941) was Bishop of Wells {{before being}} {{promoted}} to the Archbishopric of Canterbury about 926. Nothing is known about his time at Wells, but as archbishop he helped codify royal law codes and gave lands to monasteries. He went to Rome soon after <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> as archbishop. Two religious books that he gave to his cathedral are still extant.|$|E
5|$|After <b>his</b> <b>selection,</b> Hextall {{remained}} with Brandon for two further seasons. He played 44games in 1982–83, recording a GAA of 5.77 during {{a season in}} which the Wheat Kings did not qualify for the playoffs. The following year was his most successful in the WHL: a GAA of 4.29 across his 46regular season games, which included 29wins – {{more than in the}} previous two seasons combined. He played in ten of the twelve playoff games, recording five wins and five losses, with a GAA of 3.75. During the 1983–84 season, Hextall set a record for the most penalty minutes accumulated by a goaltender, being assessed for 117 minutes during the regular season.|$|E

5000|$|The {{dominance}} of Ivy League players on Camp's All-America teams led to criticism {{over the years}} that <b>his</b> <b>selections</b> were biased against players from the leading Western universities, including Chicago, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Notre Dame.|$|R
50|$|In 1916, Dick Jemison picked Bill Folger out of North Carolina as a halfback for his All-Southern team. Jemison {{said had}} he {{constrained}} <b>his</b> <b>selections</b> to the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association, Wortham {{would have taken}} his spot.|$|R
5|$|Brown's form {{started to}} {{deteriorate}} in 1937–38; he scored only 400 runs at 36.36 for the season. Queensland played five matches under his watch, losing three, and went without victory. Of the two draws, one was washed out {{and in the}} other, Queensland hung on with two wickets in hand when time ran out. Although Brown compiled two centuries, he was only twelfth in the aggregates during an Australian season with no international tours. As a result, <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> for the 1938 tour to England was criticised in some quarters.|$|E
5|$|Darin Erstad won a Gold Glove as a {{first baseman}} in 2004 after winning two awards in the outfield (2000, 2002), making him the only player to win the award as an infielder and an outfielder. In 1999, Palmeiro won the Gold Glove with the Texas Rangers while only {{appearing}} in 28 games {{as a first}} baseman; he appeared in 135 games as a designated hitter that season, resulting in some controversy over <b>his</b> <b>selection.</b>|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble {{endured a}} period where {{he was not able}} to take wickets consistently. With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.|$|E

50|$|In February 2004 he was {{appointed}} Head Coach for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. The Lions lost the test series 3-0. Woodward's management was criticised by many commentators and players for <b>his</b> initial squad <b>selection,</b> <b>his</b> coaching methods, {{his handling of the}} players and the media, <b>his</b> <b>selections</b> on tour - particularly for keeping faith with the England players he knew well - and for not allowing the test team any time to play together before the test series began. He returned from New Zealand with his reputation within rugby severely tarnished.|$|R
5|$|Establishing {{an early}} {{reputation}} {{playing for the}} Shannon Club in Trinidad, St Hill was selected for Trinidad in 1912 and played in every Inter-Colonial Tournament until 1930. Although he missed selection for the 1923 tour of England, he played for representative West Indian sides in 1926 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and scored a century against the tourists for Trinidad. Success in trial matches led to <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> for the 1928 tour of England where he failed badly. In 1930, he hit another century for Trinidad against MCC and was chosen for one final Test, after {{which he did not}} play any further first-class cricket.|$|E
5|$|For <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> {{of sailing}} master, Hall first turned to Sidney O. Budington, then to George Tyson, who both {{initially}} declined due to prior whaling commitments. When those commitments fell through, Hall named Budington as sailing master and Tyson assistant navigator. Budington and Tyson had decades of experience between them captaining whaling vessels. In effect, the Polaris now had three captains, a fact which would weigh {{heavily on the}} fate of the expedition. Further complicating matters, in 1863 Budington and Hall had quarrelled because Budington had denied permission for Hall to bring his Inuit guides, Joseph Ebierbing and Tookoolito, with him on an expedition {{at a time when they}} were ill and in Budington's care.|$|E
5|$|His non-selection in {{previous}} years was widely debated in the media. Bure was often compared with Cam Neely, a player who also waited six years for induction; he recorded similar goals-per-game numbers in a career that was also shortened to 700-plus games. It had been often rumoured that Pat Quinn, Bure's former head coach and general manager in Vancouver, who became co-chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame's selection committee, opposed Bure's induction. However, {{in a conference call}} following <b>his</b> <b>selection,</b> Quinn was among the most prominent figures he thanked. Quinn criticized the Canucks organization for not yet retiring Bure's jersey.|$|E

50|$|The {{edition of}} Wuthering Heights hit the best-seller list, {{and by the}} end of the first year Pocket Books had sold more than 1.5 million units.

5000|$|The court {{stated that}} the {{condition}} precedent for the sharing of the prize is that Pando’s “piety and prayer would cause heavenly intervention so that <b>his</b> <b>selections</b> would win,” and then asked the question “how can plaintiff prove on a trial that ‘St. Eleggua made my selection of Lottery numbers win?’” ...|$|R
5|$|However, {{both he and}} Australia {{suffered}} a surprising string of poor results in the 2006–07 Commonwealth Bank Series, Gilchrist managing an average of only 22.20 during the tournament. Australia won seven of their eight qualifying matches, but England won with two finals victories over the Australians. Gilchrist scored 60 and 61 {{in the first two}} matches but did not pass 30 thereafter. He was then rested for Australia's winless three-match ODI tour of New Zealand, before <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Having previously indicated that it was highly likely that he would retire after the 2007 World Cup, he then stated a desire to play on aftwerwards.|$|E
5|$|Hud premiered at the Venice International Film Festival, {{and was a}} {{critical}} and commercial success at its general release. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning three; Patricia Neal won Best Actress, Melvyn Douglas won Best Supporting Actor and James Wong Howe the Academy Award for Best Black and White Cinematography. Howe's use of contrast to create space and <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> of black-and-white was favored by critics. In later reviews, the film received additional praise.|$|E
5|$|Hunt {{made his}} debut for the Brisbane Broncos in the National Rugby League (NRL) in 2004 and played every game that season, winning the Dally M Rookie of the Year award. Pimarily a fullback, {{he played for}} Brisbane until 2009 and {{was part of the}} Broncos team which won the Grand Final in 2006. In a {{controversial}} move, Hunt chose to play for Australia instead of his native New Zealand, citing a lifelong dream of playing for Queensland in the State of Origin. Hunt's performance in the 2006 NRL season resulted in <b>his</b> <b>selection</b> for Queensland and Australia (the Kangaroos) in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1875, in {{a letter}} to the Commissioner for Crown Lands for West Moreton, Steven {{requested}} that <b>his</b> homestead <b>selection</b> be transferred to a conditional purchase, as [...] "it is most likely that other arrangements may soon interfere with my personal residence on the land". In April 1876 a letter to the Commissioner from Steven stated that, as he had spent so much money on one selection at Monsildale (Portion 1), it could be argued that he had met the requirements of the 1868 Act for improving <b>his</b> surrounding <b>selections.</b> <b>His</b> <b>selections</b> were inspected in April 1877, and a report on his fulfilment of the selection conditions regarding Portion 1 was issued in July 1877. In this report Steven's occupation was listed as [...] "Grazier". Steven applied to purchase in November 1877, and a Deed of Grant was issued in February 1878.|$|R
50|$|College {{football}} historian Parke H. Davis is {{the only}} selector considered by the NCAA to have primarily used research in <b>his</b> <b>selections.</b> Davis did all of his work in 1933, naming retroactive national champions {{for most of the}} years from 1869 to 1932 while naming Michigan and Princeton (his alma mater) co-champions {{at the end of the}} 1933 season.|$|R
