Willis had complained that his magazine writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, Paul Fane, which was published a year later. The character Bosh Blivins, who served as comic relief in the novel, may {{have been based on}} painter Chester Harding. His final work was The Convalescent (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with Washington Irving at Sunnyside.|$|E

5|$|The Millennium Group's role as {{an investigative}} {{organization}} {{was based on the}} real-life Academy Group, a society of retired law enforcement agents in the United States. The presentation of the Group varied as the series progressed, with its role changing from that of a benevolent investigative group to an antagonistic mystic sect. The Millennium Group <b>has</b> <b>met</b> with negative responses, with its vacillating depiction being a focus of criticism both from critics and from series star Lance Henriksen.|$|E

He <b>has</b> <b>met</b> only one of the four in Davis Cup play: he lost to Djokovic in the 2013 semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} moves {{were also}} made in other global markets during 2012. The African market saw a new agreement with Grand Parade Investments of South Africa to enter Africa's largest economy, with restaurants opening in 2013. In Europe, Burger King {{returned to the}} French market in 2012 with an agreement with multinational operator Autogrill, a move that <b>has</b> <b>met</b> with some excitement in the country. The chain left the country in 1997, closing its 22 franchised and 17 corporate locations after a poorly executed entry into the market that left it unable to compete against McDonald's and local chain Quick. The partnership with Autogrill is a move to consolidate Burger King's presence in travel plazas along major highways in France, Italy, Poland and other European nations.|$|E

5|$|In {{the process}} of {{destroying}} NESTS, he becomes allied with Maxima, a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death. While Maxima sees K' as a friend and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, who it is revealed is a clone of his sister, Seirah. Even though Whip reveals her identity to K', he ignores this, saying he will do what he pleases. Although he hates The King of Fighters tournaments, he commonly enters them, being asked by someone, or to find NESTS. The participants often criticize him for being antisocial. After destroying NESTS, K' starts recovering his memories, but he suspects he could forget all the people he <b>has</b> <b>met.</b> He also becomes determined to prove he is better than Kyo, instead of being only a clone.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{elephants}} in zoos <b>has</b> <b>met</b> with some controversy. Proponents of zoos {{argue that they}} offer researchers {{easy access to the}} animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.|$|E
