50|$|The Relic Hall is a rustic-style {{building}} {{constructed in}} 1937. The Civilian Conservation Corps built the structure, and its design exhibits the typical log architecture {{used by the}} CCC; this design consists of a stone <b>foundation,</b> <b>log</b> walls, and a shingle roof with exposed rafters. The building houses a variety of historical collections; while the Idaho State Historical Society owns the building, the collections are administered by the Idaho Pioneer Association.|$|E
50|$|The Elizabeth Parker hut {{has seen}} {{substantial}} renovations and upkeep over the years. It {{has had a}} new floor, a new roof, new timbers and new <b>foundation</b> <b>logs,</b> as well as completely new interior furnishings. The outhouses are new, a stove {{was added to the}} Wiwaxy cabin, and the entire meadow around the hut has been rehabilitated and reseeded. The Alpine Club has worked very hard to restore the appearance of the hut as closely as possible to its original state.The Canadian government designated the Elizabeth Parker hut as a Federal Heritage Building in 1997.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} by James Weir around 1830 as a two-story single-pen log structure, {{consisting}} of American chestnut logs on a limestone <b>foundation.</b> The <b>log</b> frame is covered with siding.|$|R

50|$|Chicken Coop: The {{chicken coop}} {{was built in}} 1934. It is a frame, {{horizontal}} flushboarded building with a shallow-pitched gabled roof and <b>log</b> <b>foundation.</b> It contains a plank door and several windows.|$|R
50|$|Guyana's Parliament Building, {{designed}} by Joseph Hadfield, {{was built on}} a <b>foundation</b> of greenheart <b>logs.</b> The <b>foundation</b> stone was laid in 1829 and, in April 1834, the structure, stuccoed to resemble stone blocks, was completed.|$|R
50|$|The {{dance hall}} is of {{primarily}} log construction {{with an open}} log-truss roof. It measures about 40 ft by 67.5 ft on a stone and concrete <b>foundation.</b> The <b>logs</b> are shaped to fit closely, without chinking. The roof is a clipped gable, with a porch extension to the front over the large double entry doors. The dance floor was designed to float on 24 box car springs to optimize it for rhythmic group dancing.|$|R

5000|$|Following the Revolutionary War, Arthur Noble II (son of Arthur Noble) {{purchased}} 80,000 acre in {{the present}} town of Ohio, and called it [...] "Nobleboro". He built a saw mill there to export lumber to Ireland. In 1790 Noble got a road built to Nobleboro {{so that he could}} ride to his saw mill in a coach-and-four. Some logging occurred at Nobleboro before the Civil War, but by the late 1800s a new call for lumber and paper caused new activity in the woods of the region. Pulp and paper mills were built at Hinkley, with saw mills and a debarking mill at Nobleboro. The vast forests to the north were still in private ownership and they supplied these industries for decades. Each spring logs and pulpwood were flushed downstream on the wave of snowmelt and Nobleboro was an important staging area for these <b>log</b> drives. The <b>foundation</b> <b>logs</b> of the river drive dam that controlled water flow can still be seen at the river's edge. Log drives continued on the West Canada Creek until 1949. Since then the land here has healed nearly hiding the once-thriving industrial complex once known as [...] "Nobleboro, the gateway to the great north woods".|$|R

40|$|This paper gives a <b>foundation</b> of <b>log</b> smooth {{deformation}} theory. We {{study the}} infinitesimal liftings of log smooth morphisms {{and show that}} the log smooth deformation functor has a representable hull. This deformation theory gives, for example, the following two types of deformations: (1) relative deformations {{of a certain kind}} of a pair of an algebraic variety and a divisor of it, and (2) global smoothings of normal crossing varieties. The former is a generalization of the relative deformation theory introduced by Makio, and the latter coincides with the logarithmic deformation theory introduced by Kawamata and Namikawa. ...|$|R
50|$|The Rangers' Club is a U-shaped wood frame structure, 2-1/2 stories high, {{centering}} {{on a massive}} stone chimney {{in the center of}} the U. The interior is clad in redwood shingles, with board-and-batten siding on the gable ends. The building rests on a granite rubblestone <b>foundation.</b> Peeled <b>log</b> pilasters emphasize the corners of the frame building, originally extending through the roof.

50|$|The American Legion Post No. 121 is a {{historic}} social hall on Legion Hut Road in southern Paris, Arkansas. It is a single-story L-shaped structure, built out of notched logs on a stone <b>foundation.</b> The <b>logs</b> are painted brown, and are mortared with white cement. It has a gabled roof with exposed rafter ends. A gabled porch shelters the front entrance, supported by square posts set on concrete piers faced in stone. The building was constructed in 1934 with work crews funded by the Works Progress Administration, and is the best local example of WPA Rustic architecture.|$|R
40|$|Photo of {{interior}} of Fitzgerald root cellar, facing north. The cellar is oriented toward the south. It was constructed approximately {{in the first}} decade of the twentieth century by the Fitzgerald family. It was used to store produce grown in family gardens in and around Keels. Its construction was of local stone, turf, and local wood. The cellar was passed down to Anne by her grandfather, Michael Fitzgerald, b. 1890. It was used up until ca. 2000 to store vegetables, but is no longer used. Notice stone <b>foundation</b> and <b>log</b> support beams.

50|$|John Casper Stoever Log House is a {{historic}} home located at New Holland, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. It was built about 1740, and is a 1 1/2-story, 36 feet 6 inches by 22 feet, log dwelling. It has corner posts, to which the logs are attached with mortise and tenon joints. It had a gable roof with dormers and sat on a stone <b>foundation.</b> The <b>log</b> structure was covered with asbestos shingles over novelty siding. A one-story, rear addition {{was built in the}} 1880s and a glass entryway in the 1920s. Its builder, Rev.

50|$|The {{cabin was}} a day's hike from the Leigh Lake Ranger Patrol Cabin {{to the south}} and the Colter Canyon cabin to the north. Located in a remote portion of the park, the cabin was used for winter ranger patrols. The one story cabin was built on a stone <b>foundation.</b> The <b>log</b> walls were saddle-notched at the corners. The roof was {{sheathed}} with cedar shingles and had exposed log purlin structure on the interior, which is a single room. The site features a view of Jackson Lake's Moran Bay, and is at present usually accessed by boat from the lake. The cabin was reconstructed in 1995, and destroyed in a forest fire in 2000.|$|R

5000|$|While {{documentary}} {{evidence for the}} physical development of Taabinga is non-existent, Hector Munro, who {{was the son of}} George Munro, onetime manager of Boondooma station, and who was a friend of the Haly family, described the first structure at Taabinga as a hut:"built with bark, then perpendicular slabs with a ground floor and bark roof. The house known as the Boss's residence was built with pit saw and timber <b>foundation</b> <b>logs</b> of wood, squared on one side with walls of horizontal slabs and floor in boards of pit saw and roof shingles".From these rudimentary structures the homestead site gained more permanent buildings. It is claimed that {{the first part of the}} main residence, which still stands today, was constructed during the 1840s and was developed through to the 1850s. According to the Alford family, who later acquired Taabinga and whose papers have been published as Alford Family Notes, Charles Haly began residing at Taabinga with his family in the late 1850s, just prior to becoming sole lessee of the property. An article in The Queenslander in 1924 indicates the continued development of the homestead site in this period: [...] "Sixty-seven years ago where now stands this beautiful, and complete home, was little better than wild, crude bush". The freeholding of a portion of the Taabinga run by Charles Haly in 1863 would seem to indicate the existence of the main residence by this time. Its western wall is built from locally quarried sandstone and the cedar was obtained from the Bunya Mountains while the timber for the hardwood floors was taken from the property itself. At much the same time that the main residence was being constructed it is believed that the Halys also built the stockyards and stables. The stables, which remain well preserved, are located on an adjoining lot, however the stockyards were damaged in a fire during the 1950s.|$|R
25|$|William Mahone (1826‚Äì95), an 1847 {{engineering}} {{graduate of the}} Virginia Military Institute (VMI), was employed by Francis Mallory to build the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad (N) and eventually became its president in the pre-Civil War era. Construction of N began in 1853. Mahone's innovative corduroy roadbed through the Great Dismal Swamp near Norfolk, Virginia, employed a <b>log</b> <b>foundation</b> laid at right angles {{beneath the surface of}} the swamp. It is still in use 150 years later and it withstands immense tonnages of coal traffic.|$|R
60|$|The beaver's {{house is}} {{generally}} {{the last thing}} attended to. He likes to build this when the nights grow cold enough to freeze his mortar soon after it is laid. Two or three tunnels are dug {{from the bottom of}} the beaver pond up through the bank, coming to the surface together at the point where the center of the house is to be. Around this he lays solid <b>foundations</b> of <b>log</b> and stone in a circle from six to fifteen feet in diameter, according to the number of beavers to occupy the house. On these foundations he rears a thick mass of sticks and grass, which are held together by plenty of mud. The top is roofed by stout sticks arranged as in an Indian wigwam, and the whole domed over with grass, stones, sticks, and mud. Once this is solidly frozen, the beaver sleeps in peace; his house is burglar proof.|$|R
50|$|As better tools became {{available}} the Colonial builders became adept at working the extremely hard and durable timber {{of the native}} hardwood forests. The majority of houses were built of split logs rather than sawn timber. The technique employed {{for the construction of}} a wall was to chisel out a deep groove in a straight log, preferably of the local termite-resistant Cyprus pine which became the <b>foundation.</b> Split <b>logs</b> that had been adzed flat at the ends were then stood in the groove and another groove log was placed on top and slotted into place in a circular corner post. The gaps between the split logs were either packed with clay and animal hair or had narrow strips of metal cut from kerosene tins tacked over them. The interior could be plastered with clay, lined with paperbark or papered with newspaper, wrapping paper or calico. Cards, photographs, news clippings and commemorative items were often stuck directly onto the walls.|$|R
50|$|Following World War II, Arnold {{worked as}} a logging {{operator}} for the New Hampshire Forestry <b>Foundation.</b> He managed <b>logging</b> jobs throughout central New Hampshire. During the winter spanning 1947 and 1948, Arnold taught botany at New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire, and {{he worked for the}} New Hampshire Department of Transportation. In 1948, Arnold moved to Michigan to teach at Michigan State University's Forestry Summer Camp. He also began working {{as the director of the}} university's Russ Forest operations. Overseeing the forest nursery, Arnold expanded tree development from 400,000 trees per year to 3,500,000. He also conducted forestry research.|$|R

60|$|It {{was near}} {{the setting of the}} sun, on a clear, cold day in December, when a sleigh was moving slowly up one of the {{mountains}} in the district we have described. The day had been fine for the season, and but two or three large clouds, whose color seemed brightened by the light reflected from the mass of snow that covered the earth, floated in a sky of the purest blue. The road wound along the brow of a precipice, and on one side was upheld by a <b>foundation</b> of <b>logs</b> piled one upon the other, while a narrow excavation in the mountain in the opposite direction had made a passage of sufficient width for the ordinary travelling of that day. But logs, excavation, and every thing that did not reach several feet above the earth lay alike buried beneath the snow. A single track, barely wide enough to receive the sleigh, * denoted the route of the highway, and this was sunk nearly two feet below the surrounding surface.|$|R
50|$|Rossiter-Little House is {{generally}} considered the oldest house in Sparta. The present structure was built onto and around a log cabin (1797). The structure {{was built on the}} highest point in Sparta and used initially as a fort. Beneath the crawlspace of the present house, the original structure of the <b>log</b> <b>foundation</b> is still in place. The Rossiter-Little House was probably built about 1798 when Timothy Wells Rossiter, a Revolutionary war surgeon from Connecticut, bought the northeast corner lot at Broad and Miles Streets or the year after that when he bought the adjoining lot to the east. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1974, due to its architectural significance.|$|R
5000|$|Members of Holy Family Church quickly {{began to}} {{organize}} their congregation, completing a log church {{by the end}} of 1846; after it burned in 1848, another log church was built. [...] At the same time, the members of St. Remy's Church were beginning to build a church, and competition began to arise between the two parishes. Ultimately, a wager was agreed upon of two gallons of whisky, to be given to the first parish to lay the <b>log</b> <b>foundation</b> for their churches; Holy Family won the prize. [...] As more French settlers continued to arrive in the 1850s and early 1860s, the church became too small, and the members decided to erect a larger brick structure.|$|R
6000|$|... ‚ÄúIn {{order to}} avoid the danger, the enemy‚Äôs ten men-of-war struck their topmasts and got all their sails on deck, his four frigates alone {{remaining}} in sailing order. These were placed half a mile in front of the men-of-war, and lay in shelter of an immense boom, specially designed to arrest the approach of an enemy at night. In addition to the fire-ships, Cochrane had prepared two or three vessels as what he called explosion-ships. These were intended not so much to damage the enemy as to terrify them, and to prevent their sending boats to divert the course of the fire-ships. A solid <b>foundation</b> of <b>logs</b> had been first laid on the keel, so as to form an extremely solid floor and to give the explosion an upward tendency. On these were placed a large number of empty spirit and water casks set on end. Into these fifteen hundred barrels of powder were emptied; the space around them was filled in with timber and sand, so as to form a solid mass, and over the powder casks were laid several hundred shells and some three thousand hand-grenades.|$|R
50|$|Mengarini {{was chosen}} for {{the mission of the}} upper Missouri, partly on account of his voice and {{knowledge}} of music - valued in Indian mission work. On 24 April 1841, Father de Smet, Mengarini, and Nicolas Point, with the lay brothers Specht, Huett, and Classens, and nine other companions, began the long journey by river and overland trail to Fort Hall, Idaho, then a trading post, where they arrived on the feast of the Assumption (15 August) and found a party of Flatheads waiting to conduct them to their final destination. It was nearly a month later when they arrived at the chosen site on St. Mary's River, Montana, in the Flathead country, and began the <b>foundations</b> of the <b>log</b> mission.|$|R
50|$|The {{roundhouse}} {{was taken}} into use in 1910 and the workshop in 1912. Following {{the expansion of the}} line to Treungen in 1912, the freight house was made 9 m longer, another outhouse was built and the workshop expanded. Two additional tracks were also laid at the station. The original station building had an insufficient <b>foundation,</b> as a <b>log</b> raft had been used. By the late 1920s, the building had sunk 70 cm. In 1929 and 1930, the station building and the outhouse was demolished and rebuilt with a new foundation, this time using piles to create a deep foundation. The new station building was designed by Gudmund Hoel of NSB Arkitektselskap and used the old building's materials as far as possible, and had the same dimensions.|$|R
50|$|The St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church is a {{historic}} Russian Orthodox church near Kwethluk, Alaska, United States, on the Lower Kuskokwim River. It is a wood-frame structure, resting on a <b>log</b> <b>foundation,</b> and is completely built out of cedar. It is rectangular in plan, with a gable roof which sported two small onion domes with crosses, but these were blown off by high winds and stored. The {{western side of the}} building has the vestibule area, above which rises a modest square belltower. It was built in 1935 as a replacement for an earlier church that was built around 1900, and is the oldest structure standing in the Kwethluk area. It was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1991.|$|R
5000|$|Early Elkmont was {{a typical}} {{temporary}} logging camp. These camps bore a resemblance to later Depression-era shanty towns. Shanty houses (or [...] "set off" [...] houses), a post office, a transient hotel, a commissary, and sheds critical to railroad maintenance were the town's only buildings. Many loggers lived in boarding houses, and some crossed Sugarland Mountain via a trail connecting Elkmont to the Sugarlands. [...] As logging operations progressed, it became necessary to move the camp higher up the mountain slopes to the south. The company managed this by loading the shanties onto railroad flatcars and moving them to pre-constructed <b>foundations</b> using a <b>logging</b> crane. Although the logging camps moved, Elkmont remained the company's primary base of operations in the upper Little River valley.|$|R
