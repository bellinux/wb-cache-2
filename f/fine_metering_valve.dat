40|$|The {{majority}} of hydraulic systems are controlled using a <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> {{or the use}} of variable displacement pumps. <b>Metering</b> <b>valve</b> control is compact and has a high control bandwidth, but it is energy inefficient due to throttling losses. Variable displacement pumps are far more efficient as the pump only produces the required flow, but comes with the cost of additional bulk, sluggish response, and added cost. In a previous paper [1], a hydromechanical analog of an electronic switch-mode power supply was proposed to create the functional equivalent of a variable displacement pump. This approach combines a fixed displacement pump with a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) on/off valve, a check valve, and an accumulator. The effective pump displacement can be varied by adjusting the PWM duty ratio. Since on/off valves exhibit low loss when fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is potentially more energy efficient than <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> control, while achieving this efficiency without many of the shortcomings of traditional variable displacement pumps. The system also allows for a host of programmable features that can be implemented via control of the PWM duty ratio. This paper presents initial experimental validation of the concept as well as an investigation of the system efficiency. The experimental apparatus was built using available off-the-shelf components and uses a linear proportional spindle valve as the PWM valve. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can achieve variable control function more efficiently than a valve controlled system, and that by increasing the PWM frequency and adding closed-loop control can decrease syste...|$|R

40|$|In industries,flow of any fluid varies over a {{very wide}} range. It ranges from very low to very high velocity. Because of this variation, various types of flow {{measurement}} elements have been developed. Out of all these, hot wire anemometer, orifice meter and rotameter are widely used. Responses of fluids with different densities and sensors with different diameters have been studied. Since these components are delicate to heat exchange between the component and its composition, temperature and environment, their responses vary with conditions provided. Using hot-element sensor we also measured the concentration of gas components {{in a mixture of}} two known gases. This method is based on thermal conductivity of mixture. Thermal conductivity of mixture depends on individual thermal conductivities of gases of mixture and individual fractional concentration of that gases. Taking different types of probes and different types of fluid we compare the behavior of sensor so that we can determine the best conditions for measurements of properties like velocity and composition of fluids.

40|$|As {{intelligent}} {{hydraulic systems}} with embedded sensors become more ubiquitous, the real or perceived reliability challenge associated with sensors {{must be addressed}} to encourage their adoption. In this paper, a fault-tolerant control strategy for an intelligent independent <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> that allows continued operation if a sensor fails is described. The twin-spool valve example utilizes position sensors to stabilize the spool positions and eliminate hysteresis, and pressure sensors to provide digital pressure compensation, electronic load sensing, and other features. An independent <b>metering</b> <b>valve</b> has redundancy provided by four sensors working together to control the flow {{into and out of}} a single actuator. Although two sensors are needed to control the flow through a spool, the controller can be reconfigured to ensure the flow is always controlled on the spool with both sensors working. To accomplish this, the concept of cross-port pressure control is introduced that uses the faulty side of the valve to maintain constant pressure on the non-faulty side. By maintaining a constant pressure, the flow {{in and out of the}} actuator are balanced. Experimental results on the boom of a backhoe demonstrate the operation of the fault tolerant control strategy...|$|R

The enlargement of the operating space was accomplished with an additional variable displacement unit. This unit also expands the number of operating modes from four to 26. These modes were tested for validity via simulations with actual velocity and load data collected from a test fixture. Also, the foundation of a real time control system are explained, while some of the components of this system were tested. The results indicated that all of the 26 operating modes were valid and feasible, while some of the techniques of the control system need further refinement.
