50|$|The APS is a straight-blowback, select-fire, magazine-fed machine pistol. The {{weapon is}} fed through 20-round double-stack double-feed {{detachable}} steel box magazines. The APS shares common features with the Makarov service pistol, {{such as a}} heel-mounted magazine release, slide-mounted safety lever, and field-strip procedure. The rear sight is adjustable from 25, 50, 100 to 200 meters through an eccentric rotating drum/dial. The serrated front sight may be drifted for windage. The slide featured a textured strip on top to reduce aim-disturbing glare. The chrome-lined barrel serves as the recoil spring guide. The slide stop lever also acts as an <b>ejector</b> <b>blade.</b> The trigger guard pivots down for stripping and detents in position through a spring-loaded plunger. The checkered or serrated grips panels are made from wood (early models), reddish-brown bakelite or black plastic.|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{formation}} of spiral vortex and application of liquid aerators. Visually, the new method has been applied for three structures of the stream ejector. The paper shows that under the same traffic flow, the venturi tube with blade cup liquid creates maximum ejected liquid contact surface. It has been noticed that the flared shape of the <b>ejector</b> <b>blade</b> that {{is close to the}} form of the spiral vortex, creates improvements in a pulsation flow and thus increases the solubility of oxygen in the liquid.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} water {{aeration}} process {{with the aid}} of different in design jet ejectors. It is established that vortex flow ejectors ensure sufficient increase of the concentration of dissolved air in the water as compared with conventional Venturi tube ejectors. It is obtained that <b>blade</b> <b>ejector</b> creates optimal conditions for aeration of the fluid. It is established that air solubility ratio of this ejector is reached a level 0. 76 : 1...|$|R
50|$|The M77 was {{retooled}} {{almost entirely}} and reintroduced in 1991 as the Mark II. The safety, bolt, and trigger were completely redesigned. The claw extractor was retained, but the bolt face was {{opened up to}} allow controlled-round feeding. The plunger ejector was replaced with a Mauser style <b>blade</b> <b>ejector.</b> Finally, a three-position safety allowed the bolt to be operated while the gun was still on safe, making unloading of the rifle less hazardous. Ruger also eliminated the adjustable trigger that came stock on the original M77.|$|R
5000|$|Like the 1898 Mauser rifle, the 1891 Mosin uses two front-locking lugs {{to lock up}} the action. However, the Mosin's lugs lock in the {{horizontal}} position, whereas the Mauser locks vertically. The Mosin bolt body is multi-piece whereas the Mauser is one piece. The Mosin uses interchangeable bolt heads like the Lee-Enfield. Unlike the Mauser, which uses a [...] "controlled feed" [...] bolt head in which the cartridge base snaps up under the fixed extractor as the cartridge is fed from the magazine, the Mosin has a [...] "push feed" [...] recessed bolt head in which the spring-loaded extractor snaps over the cartridge base as the bolt is finally closed similar to the Gewehr 88 and M91 Carcano or modern sporting rifles like the Remington 700. Like the Mauser, the Mosin uses a <b>blade</b> <b>ejector</b> mounted in the receiver. The Mosin bolt is removed by simply pulling it fully {{to the rear of}} the receiver and squeezing the trigger, while the Mauser has a bolt stop lever separate from the trigger.|$|R
