40|$|Abstract—Lechuguilla Cave is a hypogene cave {{formed by}} {{oxidation}} of ascending hydrogen sulfide from the Delaware Basin. A unique sediment deposit with characteristics suggesting derivation {{from the land}} surface, some 285 m above, was investigated. At this location, the observed stratigraphy (oldest to youn-gest) was: bedrock floor (limestone), cave clouds (secondary calcite), calcite-cemented silstone, <b>finely</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>clay,</b> and calcite rafts. Grain-size analysis indicates that the laminated clay deposits are com-posed of 59 – 82 % clay-size minerals. The major minerals of the clay were determined by X-ray diffraction analysis and consist of interstratified illite-smectite, kaolinite, illite, goethite, and quartz. Scanning electron microscopy observations show {{that most of the}} clay deposit is composed of densely packed irregular-shaped clay-size flakes. One sample {{from the top of the}} deposit was detrital, containing well-rounded, silt-size particles. Surface soils are probably the source of the clay minerals. The small amount of sand- and silt-size particles suggests that detrital particles were transported in suspension. The lack of endellite and alunite is evidence that the clays were emplaced after the sulfuric-acid dissolution stage of cave formation. Fossil evidence also suggests a previously existing link to the surface...|$|E
50|$|The 10 meter thick Lower Hamstead Member follows {{directly}} {{upon the}} Bembridge Marls Member with a 40 centimetre thick, olive to black seam, the Black Band. This layer is very rich in organic matter and was deposited under freshwater conditions. At its base it carries calcrete nodules and rootlets. The Black Band is overlain by roughly 4 metres of a greenish-greyish clay-silt interlayering. This changes to 3 metres of blue to brown, <b>finely</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>clays</b> including some shelly horizons. These clays are capped by a 1-metre thick, blueish-greyish, clayey sand layer with ball-and-pillow-structure, contorted bedding and convolute bedding indicating dewatering of the sediment during diagenesis. This gravitationally instable bed {{is known as}} the log bed for its up to 5 metre long tree trunks. The log bed is clearly a freshwater deposit as it contains besides the tree trunks plenty of washed-up seeds of the species Potamogeton and Stratiodes, and also the leaves of monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants. Its faunal remains attest the last pre-Grande Coupure assemblage (MP20).|$|R
5000|$|Evidence at Zhoukoudian cave in China {{suggests}} {{control of}} fire {{as early as}} 460,000 to 230,000 BP. Fire in Zhoukoudian {{is suggested by the}} presence of burned bones, burned chipped-stone artifacts, charcoal, ash, and hearths alongside H. erectus fossils in Layer 10, the earliest archaeological horizon at the site. This evidence comes from Locality 1, also known as the Peking Man site, where several bones were found to be uniformly black to grey. The extracts from the bones were determined to be characteristic of burned bone rather than manganese staining. These residues also showed IR spectra for oxides, and a bone that was turquoise was reproduced in the laboratory by heating some of the other bones found in Layer 10. At the site, the same effect might have been due to natural heating, as the effect was produced on white, yellow, and black bones. Layer 10 itself is described as ash with biologically produced silicon, aluminum, iron, and potassium, but wood ash remnants such as siliceous aggregates are missing. Among these are possible hearths [...] "represented by <b>finely</b> <b>laminated</b> silt and <b>clay</b> interbedded with reddish-brown and yellow brown fragments of organic matter, locally mixed with limestone fragments and dark brown <b>finely</b> <b>laminated</b> silt, <b>clay</b> and organic matter." [...] The site itself does not show that fires were made in Zhoukoudian, but the association of blackened bones with quartzite artifacts at least shows that humans did control fire {{at the time of the}} habitation of the Zhoukoudian cave.|$|R

40|$|We {{show with}} {{multiple}} luminescence dating techniques that the sedimentary record for Lake Eyre, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s largest lake, extends beyond 200 thousand years (ka) to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7. Transgressive clayey sand and <b>finely</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>clays</b> overlying the Miocene Etadunna Formation in Lake Eyre North document the deep-lake phases of central South Australia in the past. Until now, unresolved chronology has hampered {{our ability to}} interpret these sedimentary records, which are important for understanding {{the timing of the}} wettest phase of central Australia 2 ̆ 7 s late Quaternary climate. In this study, we apply quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, thermally-transferred OSL (TT-OSL) dating and K-feldspar post infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) dating to lake-floor sediments near Williams Point in Madigan Gulf to provide new age constraint for the lacustrine sediments of Lake Eyre. Methodological studies on quartz and K-feldspar demonstrate that these luminescence dating procedures are suitable for the Lake Eyre lacustrine samples and produce consistent replicate ages. A Bayesian model applied to the new dating results provides a chronological model of lacustrine deposition and shows that the transgressive clayey sand were deposited 221 ± 19 ka to 201 ± 10 ka and that the deep-water sediments were laid down in early MIS 6 (191 ± 9 ka to 181 ± 9 ka). We also find evidence for a potential depositional hiatus in mid MIS 6 and the likely formation of a palaeo-playa later in MIS 6 from 158 ± 11 ka to 143 ± 15 ka. In contrast, the MIS 5 sediments are characterised by oscillating deep- and shallow-water lacustrine units deposited 130 ± 16 ka to 113 ± 20 ka. This study is {{the first of its kind}} to provide evidence for a wet desert interior in Australia beyond the last glacial cycle using comprehensive numerical dating. Our results show that past deep-lake episodes of central South Australia, which were previously thought to represent peak interglacial conditions, are actually associated with both warm interglacial and cold glacial periods, with all the wettest episodes generally coinciding with the intervening periods between the glacial and interglacial maximums. We assume from these results that orbital forcing is not a first order control for the long-term dynamics of the Lake Eyre basin and the Indo-Australian monsoon. The high lake-level events of Lake Eyre are well correlated with millennial-scale cooling events and stadials of the North Atlantic, and coincide with weakened episodes/events for the East Asia summer monsoon. This may imply an important role for the northern high latitudes in influencing the Indo-Australian monsoon, which may be associated with a southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during cooling periods in the North Atlantic...|$|R

40|$|Perimarine river valleys are a rich {{resource}} for studying palaeoecological change which may provide information concerning catchment and sea-level change. This thesis reconstructs the environmental {{history of the}} lower Aire valley during the Holocene, and investigates the factors influencing floodplain and vegetational development. Reconstruction of environmental change in the lower Aire valley in the mid- to late-Holocene is based on lithological and palaeoecological records from three sites in the upper, middle, and lower parts of the study reach. Techniques used include pollen, diatom, wood macrofossil, loss on ignition, and radiocarbon analysis. Paludification of the valley floor was time transgressive, apparently responding to gradually rising sea level, beginning at c. 7000 BP (c. 8000 to c. 7600 cal. yrs BP) at the lowermost site, whereas conditions were not wet enough for preservation of organic sediment in the upper reach until c. 4200 BP (c. 5000 to c. 8500 cal. yrs BP). Accumulation of floodplain peat was interrupted by the deposition of <b>finely</b> <b>laminated</b> humic <b>clays</b> some time after c. 7000 BP (c. 8000 to c. 7600 cal. yrs BP) in the lower tract of the Aire valley, near Goole, suggesting a change to lagoonal conditions. This was apparently caused by the ponding of freshwater against the rising estuary. It {{is also possible that}} drainage was impeded, associated with widespread deposition of organic sediment in the lower valley areas, which {{may have contributed to the}} creation of a lagoonal environment. The lagoon had silted up by c. 6000 BP (c. 7200 to c. 6600 cal. yrs BP), probably due to an increase in tidal  asymmetry, and range, which resulted in a net surplus of sediment into the floodbasins and enabled the re-invasion of fen carr onto the site. The main period of organic sedimentation lasted for several millennia at each of the study sites, during which time Alnus glutinosa fen carr communities dominated the wet floodplain backswamp areas. During  mid-Holocene times, the vegetation of the surrounding dryland, was colonised by a mixed woodland, with Tilia, Ulmus, Quercus, and probably, Corylus avellana and Fraxinus excelsior. Pinus sylvestris was also prevalent in the region. Alnus carr was progressively replaced by fen meadow communities, and then saltmarsh or freshwater reedswamp communities, due to a phase of positive sea-level tendency, which was recorded throughout the lower Aire valley between c. 4600 and c. 2700 BP (c. 5500 to c. 2700 cal. yrs BP). Remnants of a possible upper peat unit and diatom evidence from the upper clastic sediment is tentatively interpreted as indicating the contraction of estuarine conditions and a phase of negative sea-level tendency some time during the late-Iron Age...|$|R

40|$|The Petermann Ice Tongue, {{located in}} the {{northwest}} region of Greenland, has experienced large caving events since 2010. It {{is one of the}} few remaining ice tongues and or ice shelves still present in Greenland. The Petermann Glacier and its ice tongue are important to study as little is known about their glacial history since the deglaciation that likely began in the early Holocene. Through analyzing two cores, 18 GC in Hall Basin and 003 TC/ 41 GC/ 003 PC in the Petermann Fjord, in conjunction with prior analysis of the HLY 03 - 05 GC core in Hall Basin (Jennings et al., 2011), a relative glacial history of the Petermann Glacier is proposed. The mineralogy, grain size, and mass magnetic susceptibility were analyzed at 10 -centimeter increments within the cores. A distinct lithofacies of <b>laminated</b> <b>clays</b> with almost no ice rafted debris (IRD) was observed in both the cores, as well in the HLY 03 - 05 GC core previously studied (Jennings et al., 2011). Based on knowledge of modern sub ice shelf sediments this <b>laminated</b> <b>clay</b> unit is tentatively interpreted to represent a sub ice shelf environment. The <b>laminated</b> <b>clay</b> unit is seen at the base of 18 GC, overlain by a bioturbated mud unit. This transition from the <b>laminated</b> <b>clay</b> to bioturbated mud within 18 GC is proposed to be representative of opening of Nares Strait around 9200 cal years BP. Within the composite core, 003 TC/ 41 GC/ 003 PC, a shift from coarser grained sediment to the <b>laminated</b> <b>clay</b> unit is proposed to reflect the advance of the ice tongue site in the Petermann Fjord. This history of the Petermann Glacier contributes to the ongoing research being conducted in order to further understand the processes at work since the onset of the retreat of the Greenland Ice Sheet...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The Laptev and East Siberian Seas are the shallow landward extensions of the Arctic Ocean which borders mainland Siberia to the north. The Laptev and East Siberian seas receive sediments from the complex structural regions that comprise mainland Siberia. Mainland Siberia is characterized by a harsh continental climate yielding intense mechanical weathering and by the complex fluvial network that drains the area. Terrigenous sediments that reach the Laptev and East Siberian Seas are influenced and distributed by bathymetry, ice form-nation, and the current regime. The mineralogy, occurrence, and distribution of these recent sediments have been characterized by x-ray diffraction and by optical and electron microscopy. Quantification of the heavy mineral fraction was determined by point counting and semi-quantification of the clay fraction was determined through forward modeling via NEWMOD. The bottom sediments of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas ranged from black-dark brown -tan, massive to very <b>finely</b> <b>laminated</b> sandy silty <b>clays,</b> silty sandy clays, silty clays, and silty sands. Heavy minerals of the Laptev and East Siberian Seas are restricted to the continental shelves and nearshore areas and the typical heavy mineral assemblage consists of amphibole, augite, hypersthene, quartz, and epidote with varying amounts of the following heavy minerals: andalusite, apatite, garnet, kyanite, monazite, rutile, sphene, staurolite, tourmaline, zircon, zoisite, and opaque minerals. The typical clay mineral assemblage consists of varying amounts of illite, discrete smectite, mixed layer illite/smectite, kaolinite, chlorite, quartz and feldspar. These heavy mineral and clay mineral assemblages reflect, and are a direct product of the climate and intense fluvial transportation. These sedimentary and environmental factors enable heavy mineral and clay mineral analyses to provide valuable information as to the source and provenance lithologies of mainland Siberia as well as establish a set of baseline data for future investigations...|$|R

40|$|Small-volume base-surge {{deposits}} of Astroni and Agnano^Monte Spina eruptions at Campi Flegrei consist of sets of beds {{formed by the}} passage of multiple pyroclastic density currents. Each set is made by a fining-upward sequence consisting, from base to top,of : (1) an inversely graded layer made of bombs and lapilli; (2) a <b>finely</b> <b>laminated</b> layer with wavy bedforms made of coarse ash and fine lapilli; (3) a structureless fine-ash bed. Lack of discontinuities at layer contacts allows us to hypothesize that each set of beds represents the passage of one pyroclastic density current. The sequence formed {{as a function of}} the decreasing particle transportation capability of the base surge during the waxing^sustained^waning phases of flowage. We make the simplifying assumptions that the flow,on passing from the deposition of the inversely graded layer to the deposition of the <b>finely</b> <b>laminated</b> layer,had low particle concentration,was quasi-steady and incompressible. By such assumptions,some of the equations that regulate sediment mechanics are applicable to the base surges of Campi Flegrei to reconstruct flow density and shear velocity in between the deposition of the two layers. Structural and textural features of deposits stress the importance of shear and turbulence during transportation and suggest that the turbulent boundary layer shear flow is a good approximation to such pyroclastic density currents. We used the Coles formula to reconstruct velocity as a function of flow height during the formation of the <b>finely</b> <b>laminated</b> layer of Astroni and Agnano^Monte Spina base surges. The methodology we used allows the reconstruction of flow parameters just at a particular point in time and space of base-surge evolution,and does not provide the complete picture of the flow history of pyroclastic density currents. Nevertheless,flow velocity and density data, as obtained with the proposed approach,point to dynamic pressure values that are compatible with those reported for similar currents on other volcanoes. We conclude therefore that the results obtained give approximate but helpful information on the nature of such hazardous events at Campi Flegrei...|$|R
