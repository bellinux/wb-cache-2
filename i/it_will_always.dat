25|$|This {{means that}} if a formula is {{deducible}} from the laws of intuitionistic logic, being derived from its axioms {{by way of the}} rule of modus ponens, then <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> have the value 1 in all Heyting algebras under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. However one can construct a Heyting algebra in which the value of Peirce's law is not always 1. Consider the 3-element algebra {0,½,1} as given above. If we assign ½ to P and 0 to Q, then the value of Peirce's law ((P→Q)→P)→P is ½. It follows that Peirce's law cannot be intuitionistically derived. See CurryHoward isomorphism for the general context of what this implies in type theory.|$|E
25|$|If a {{spaceship}} travels to a planet one light-year (as {{measured in the}} Earth's rest frame) away from Earth at high speed, the time taken to reach that planet could be {{less than one year}} as measured by the traveller's clock (although <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> be more than one year as measured by a clock on Earth). The value obtained by dividing the distance traveled, as determined in the Earth's frame, by the time taken, measured by the traveller's clock, is known as a proper speed or a proper velocity. There is no limit on the value of a proper speed as a proper speed does not represent a speed measured in a single inertial frame. A light signal that left the Earth {{at the same time as}} the traveller would always get to the destination before the traveller.|$|E

It has a minimal instrumentation which incorporates [...] "a mesh of fizzing synthesizers". It was released {{as a single}} on 16 October 2013, and was later featured on the singer's debut extended play, Truth Serum (2014). According to the artist, the songs on the EP talk about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. In an interview with Coup de Main Magazine, she said that [...] "'Out Of Mind' for me {{is kind of the}} step after 'Habits'... Picked up the pieces again and now just trying to glue them back together, you know? But it never really works". She further explained, [...] "That comes after I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak.

500|$|On {{the night}} before the 15 January 1987 {{deadline}} set by Island Records to complete the record, the band and the crew completed mixing. As they worked at Melbeach, Lillywhite's wife, singer Kirsty MacColl, volunteered to set the running order for the album. The band told her to put [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] first and [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] last, with the rest sequenced according to her preference. Bono said of MacColl's contribution, [...] "Your hope for your album is that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> be greater {{than the sum of its}} parts. It wasn't happening for The Joshua Tree and she came in and she organized it and it worked as an old-fashioned album: a beginning, middle and end." [...] Around 2 AM, just seven hours before the album was due to Island for mastering, the Edge tried to convince Lillywhite to allow him to add backing vocals to [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", but he was refused. In the morning, Meegan and Lillywhite flew with the album's tapes to Island's offices in Hammersmith, London.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, the Los Angeles Times {{announced}} that the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre would close in the fall, during its thirty-fifth year of seasonal performances. Prior to {{the news of the}} closure, City of Irvine officials discussed continuing the expansion of a local apartment development, which would be built atop the site. Representatives working with Stefani announced on September 9, 2016, that she would be the final act to perform in the theater in an event called Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre Final Shows, before deconstruction of the facilities began. She spoke of its closure: [...] "I have so many memories at Irvine Meadows [...] It has been such an important part of my life both as an artist and as a fan and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> hold a special place in my heart. I am humbled to perform there once again as it comes to a close." [...] In an interview earlier in the week on a California radio show, she expressed her devastation at the closure. It was the venue for her first live performance with her band No Doubt opening for Ziggy Marley in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles {{was chosen}} to write the {{segments}} about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] The episode focused on {{the life cycle of}} birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. [...] Stiles said, [...] "We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> stay". [...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. [...] Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Mr. Hooper's friend Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, [...] "Just because". [...] The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good explanation about why people die.|$|E

500|$|With the {{appearance}} of Carter, McCreary decided to quote the Agent Carter theme composed by Christopher Lennertz for the Agent Carter One-Shot. On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, [...] "I was excited {{for the opportunity to}} incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [...] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference." [...] On his use of the theme, McCreary stated, as Carter [...] "storms in, the first violins state an elongated version of her theme soaring above an aggressive, orchestral ostinato". McCreary also introduced a new Hydra theme in the episode that represents Daniel Whitehall, and is used in scenes featuring the Obelisk and Carl Creel. About the theme, McCreary said [...] "In true bad-guy-theme fashion, the theme is constructed from distantly related minor chords, and contains lots of close intervals. I build a theme like this so it can easily [...] into increasingly dissonant variations. For example, the E in the C minor chord will clash against the E minor, as will the B in the G minor chord. Building the theme in this way means that, in the future, I can put this theme over any pedal tone bass note and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> sound dissonant." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon {{opened his}} first Big Man Camp, where he teaches young frontcourt players {{the finer points}} of playing in the post. While Olajuwon never {{expressed}} an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players. When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, [...] "For a big man who is just big, maybe. But not if you play with speed, with agility. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> be a big man's game if the big man plays the right way. On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots. On offense, he draws double-teams and creates opportunities. He can add so much, {{make it easier for the}} entire team." [...] He runs the camp for free. Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players, including power forward Emeka Okafor, and center Yao Ming. In September, 2009, he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake. More recently he has been working with Dwight Howard, helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus. In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon. [...] Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar'e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian in 2013 cited Mughal-e-Azam as a [...] "landmark of cinema" [...] {{despite its}} {{historical}} inaccuracies, and the BBC stated in 2005 {{that it is}} [...] "widely considered one of Bollywood's most iconic films". Imtiaz Ali of The Times of India in 2010 called it the [...] "most proto-typical, high involvement, expensive, passionate piece of work that Hindi cinema has ever produced", one that [...] "set the standard for everything that will ever come after it". It continues to be regarded by critics as the Indian equivalent of Gone with the Wind. Filmmaker Subhash Ghai was quoted in 2010 as saying that a film like this could never be repeated: [...] "Mughal-e-Azam is an all-time classic and has been the ultimate love story in Hindi cinema at all levels. So <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>always</b> remain alive for generations to come." [...] To commemorate the film's anniversary, Asif's friend the actor and producer Shah Rukh Khan had his company Red Chillies Entertainment produce a documentary video titled Mughal-E-Azam– A Tribute by a son to his father. Hosted by Khan, it includes interviews with Asif's family and Bollywood stars. Artist M. F. Husain created a series of paintings for the video, in which he re-imagined some memorable scenes. Interested in preserving the film for future generations, Khan noted {{that his father was}} originally cast in the film but did not complete it. When asked if Mughal-e-Azam should be remade, he retorted: [...] "It is the mother of all films; mothers cannot be remade". No sequels have been made, but Maan Gaye Mughal-e-Azam (2008) paid tribute with its title and by including in its plot part of the original stage play; it received very poor ratings from critics. In October 2016, producer Feroz Abbas Khan premiered a stage play based on the film with a cast of over 70 actors and dancers at Mumbai's NCPA theatre.|$|E
