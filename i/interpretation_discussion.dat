40|$|When a theorem {{has been}} taught, {{students}} are expected to understand it and to know a proof. They should be able to reproduce the theorem and its proof, and to apply the theorem correctly. But for a real understanding they need to know something about the historical background of the theorem about its place within the theory, and its relevance for applications. Therefore students should learn not only theorems but also the importance of these theorems. This can only be accomplished by teachers who have learned to appreciate theorems adequately. Therefore, an important part of teacher education must be concer-ned with the <b>interpretation,</b> <b>discussion,</b> and evaluation of theorems. 1.

Few countries were able to achieve MDG- 4 from 1985 to 2010, and the few who did seem to have achieved the goal apparently either because of abnormally high baseline or a surprisingly low endpoint. If all countries experienced significant mortality decline, only a minority had a steady decline, and many had periods of rising and falling mortality, {{for a variety of}} reasons. <b>Interpretation.</b> <b>Discussion</b> focuses on data quality, on methods for estimating levels and trends in under- 5 mortality, and on the circumstances explaining rises and falls in mortality.

Our solutions are holographically dual to the 4 d N= 4 SU(N) super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory on a half-line, at large N and large 't Hooft coupling, with various boundary conditions that preserve half of the supersymmetry. The solutions are limiting cases of the general solutions with the same symmetries constructed in 2007 by D'Hoker, Estes and Gutperle. The classification of our solutions matches exactly with the general classification of boundary conditions for D 3 -branes ending on 5 -branes by Gaiotto and Witten. We use the gravity duals to compute the one-point functions of some chiral operators in the N= 4 SYM theory on a half-line at strong coupling, and find {{that they do not}} match with the expectation values of the same operators with the same boundary conditions at small 't Hooft coupling.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{widespread}} {{incorporation of}} behavioral support interventions into exercise trials has sometimes caused confusion concerning {{the primary purpose}} of a trial. The purpose of the present paper is to offer some conceptual and methodological distinctions among three types of exercise trials with a view towards improving their design, conduct, reporting, and <b>interpretation.</b> <b>Discussion</b> Exercise trials can be divided into "health outcome trials" or "behavior change trials" based on their primary outcome. Health outcome trials can be further divided into efficacy and effectiveness trials based on their potential for dissemination into practice. Exercise efficacy trials may achieve high levels of exercise adherence by supervising the exercise over a short intervention period ("traditional" exercise efficacy trials) or by the adoption of an extensive behavioral support intervention designed to accommodate unsupervised exercise and/or an extended intervention period ("contemporary" exercise efficacy trials). Exercise effectiveness trials may emanate from the desire to test exercise interventions with proven efficacy ("traditional" exercise effectiveness trials) or the desire to test behavioral support interventions with proven feasibility ("contemporary" exercise effectiveness trials). Efficacy, effectiveness, and behavior change trials often differ in terms of their primary and secondary outcomes, theoretical models adopted, selection of participants, nature of the exercise and comparison interventions, nature of the behavioral support intervention, sample size calculation, and interpretation of trial results. Summary Exercise researchers are encouraged to clarify {{the primary purpose of}} their trial to facilitate its design, conduct, and interpretation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Increasingly accessible, {{affordable}} and technically viable, 3 D printing {{is now being}} used {{for a number of}} high-end healthcare applications, including orthopaedic implants, prosthetics and dentistry casting. These applications, however, are largely driven by an industry that is often not embedded within the complex environments for which it is designing, therefore potentially lacking an in-depth understanding of the end-user. In contrast, this practice-based research operated within a hospital environment and alongside healthcare professionals who possessed a practical understanding of clinical requirements and the patient experience. Using a co-design methodology, a series of problems were identified and developed in workshops. Objects were designed and printed that not only leveraged the specific properties of 3 D printing – rapid, iterative, and customisable – but also worked as a tool for co-design. These 'probes' were not a forerunner of the future product, but rather vehicles for observation, reflection, <b>interpretation,</b> <b>discussion</b> and expression. Probes helped to create a bridge between the worlds of design and health, acting as a common language between the designer and the participant in order to help establish a shared understanding. This shared understanding provided a stronger foundation for the collaborative identification and development of an optimal design opportunity, suitably linking a specific clinical problem with the capabilities of technology. In this way, 3 D-printed probes helped co-design interactions evolve from passive exchanges of knowledge to active relationships. These more effective co-design relationships appear to provide a more reliable model for design outcomes in results- driven environments such as hospitals...|$|E
40|$|Background Collaboration between {{software}} companies, universities, {{and general}} practice, {{has been identified}} as central to developing new eHealth services for chronic disease management. However, most of the research evidence suggests that eHealth projects often fall short of their objectives. There has been limited exploration of the nature of collaboration between multistakeholder partnerships in the design, implementation and evaluation of eHealth technologies despite Greenhalgh’s assertion that ‘conflicts among the different parties are inevitable and should be treated as data and as opportunities for reflection’. The chronic disease management network (cdmNet) project, which aimed to introduce a diabetes web based care planning service into general practices in Geelong, Australia, provided an opportunity to explore the collaboration in an eHealth project. Aims and objectives To understand, from the perspective of implementing stakeholders, (a) the sociotechnical barriers to the introduction of a diabetes web based care planning tool into general practices in Geelong and (b) the dynamics (conflict and tension) of collaboration within the cdmNet project. Methods A theoretically informed single case study design was used to explore collaboration within the cdmNet project team. Participants were purposefully sampled to reflect those closely involved in the design, implementation and evaluation of the diabetes web based care planning tool. In depth interviews were conducted with 25 recruited participants and supported by examination of project documents and participant observation. The data obtained were analysed and the results interpreted using both sociotechnical and systems psychodynamics theories developed by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in London. Results The sociotechnical challenges encountered in general practice by the cdmNet project team contributed to difficulties in recruiting general practitioners into the project. Subsequently, failure to resolve the recruitment difficulties fuelled conflict and tension between the commercial and evaluation agendas, represented by software developers and health service researchers respectively. In addition, there was dispute around the roles of project management and the frontline researchers. Stakeholders blamed each other for the recruitment failures but worked together to bring the project to reasonable completion. <b>Interpretation,</b> <b>discussion</b> and conclusion The in-depth examination of the conflict within the cdmNet project, demonstrated the presence of ‘dysfunctional group’ behaviour that often co-existed with ‘work group’ behaviour, particularly {{at the outset of the}} project. The ‘dysfunctional group’ behaviour was characterized by black and white thinking, scape-goating and blaming of others for recruitment failures that occurred. The ‘work group’ behaviour provided an optimistic outlook of the challenges encountered and was geared towards project completion in order to satisfy the various funding partners. Stakeholders should be mindful of these issues in order to enhance the cooperation between community-based organizations working on new eHealth services for general practice. Future research should examine the role a consultant might play in managing the conflict and tension that may arise in multistakeholder collaboration on eHealth projects...|$|E
