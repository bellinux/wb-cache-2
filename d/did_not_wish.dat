5|$|In August 2012, Guillermo del Toro {{revealed}} he {{had been}} interested in directing the film, as the Japanese arc was his favorite Wolverine story. After meeting with Jim Gianopulos and Jackman, del Toro passed, deciding he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to spend {{two to three years}} of his life working on the movie.|$|E
5|$|In {{his closing}} word, Blythe {{said that he}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to avoid any {{responsibility}} and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so. He further commented that in case of acquittal, measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at Lamb of God concerts again.|$|E

5|$|On 23 June, {{the ship}} was present when the Pacific Squadron sortied in an {{abortive}} attempt to reach Vladivostok, but the new squadron commander, Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese battleline shortly before sunset, as he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle.|$|E
5|$|Ross and Emily's {{marriage}} was originally planned to last, but Helen Baxendale <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> {{to remain in}} America while pregnant. The writers could not script a convincing story for why Emily would not be seen, despite being married to Ross, so Baxendale was written {{out in the next}} season, making only three cameo appearances after the season premiere.|$|E
5|$|Although Gregory had {{intended}} London {{to be the}} southern archbishopric for the island, Augustine never moved his episcopal see to London, and instead consecrated Mellitus as a plain bishop there. After Augustine's death in 604, Canterbury continued to {{be the site of}} the southern archbishopric, and London remained a bishopric. It may have been that the Kentish king <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> greater episcopal authority to be exercised outside his own kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Although Jewish, Levi's {{family did}} not {{practise}} their religion, {{and were not}} part of the Jewish community, but when she was enrolled at the Victoria School (now the Bettina School) in Frankfurt, her religion was listed as Jewish. Religious instruction was compulsory, so she had to attend classes with a local rabbi. She soon rebelled against this, and told her parents that she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to attend the classes. She came to reject formal religion.|$|E
5|$|As per Khalid's suggestion, Abu Ubaidah {{ordered all}} the Muslim armies in Syria to {{evacuate}} the conquered land and concentrate at Jabiya. This maneuver gave a decisive blow to Heraclius' plan, as he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to engage his troops in an open battle with the Muslims, where the Muslim light cavalry could be effectively used against the heavy and less mobile Byzantine cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Before {{taking the}} role, Capaldi {{said that he}} had to seriously {{consider}} the increased visibility that would come with the part. He {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not go because he was unsure if he would get the part and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to be part of a large group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E

5|$|British Expeditionary Force {{commander}} General Douglas Haig and Second Army commander General Herbert Plumer both {{believed it}} necessary to expel the Germans from the captured positions. In view of the preparations for the Somme offensive, Haig <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to divert more forces than were necessary. Support was limited {{to a number of}} additional artillery units and an infantry brigade from the 20th (Light) Division. It was suggested that the next counterattack be carried out with the infantry available, with a particularly large emphasis placed on artillery.|$|E
5|$|Few films {{before the}} late 1970s about the Vietnam War {{actually}} depicted combat. The exceptions included The Green Berets (1968). Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because {{of opposition to}} United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to assist in making anti-war films.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{received}} the final {{part of his}} father's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich, Germany. Hitler was called up for conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army, so he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed by the medical examiners as unfit for service, he returned to Munich. Hitler later claimed that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to serve the Habsburg Empire because {{of the mixture of}} races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.|$|E

5|$|Mary soon {{experienced}} financial troubles, illnesses, and loneliness. In 1528, {{her aunt}} Margaret {{suggested that she}} should marry King James V of Scotland. Mary rejected the idea because she had loved her husband and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> another marriage. In 1530 Charles again suggested that she should remarry; he proposed to arrange a marriage to Frederick of Bavaria, who had unsuccessfully courted Mary's sister Eleanor sixteen years before. Mary rejected him as well.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to {{lead the}} U.S. into the war; his 1937 Quarantine Speech denouncing {{aggression}} by Italy and Japan had met mixed responses. Welles felt freer in this regard, looking towards postwar border issues {{and the establishment of}} a U.S.-led international body that could intervene in such disputes. Roosevelt saw Welles's stronger public statements as experiments that would test the public mood in regard to U.S. foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|Several further would-be suitors {{visited the}} Skinkers, but all were repulsed by Tannakin's face and she {{remained}} unmarried. Despairing {{of finding a}} suitable husband in Wirkham, the Skinker family moved to London, and took up residence in either Blackfriars or Covent Garden. (The anonymous author of A Certaine Relation says that the family <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to divulge their address, to discourage curiosity-seekers from gathering.) Many who met her were taken by her elegant dress and excellent demeanour.|$|E

5|$|The curial {{cardinals}} {{entered the}} conclave seeking to elect Gregorio Barbarigo as pope. Leopold I, the Holy Roman Emperor, considered {{him to be}} an unacceptable choice {{because he was a}} Venetian. While Leopold did not formally exclude Barbarigo, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> for him to be elected. In addition to Leopold, the Spanish ambassador in Rome worked against Barbarigo's election, and Louis XIV of France opposed it because of the wishes of his allies.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson, Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be cast the other way about, but Richardson <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to attempt Lear. Richardson's other roles in the season were Inspector Goole in An Inspector Calls, Face in The Alchemist and John of Gaunt in Richard II, which he directed, with Alec Guinness in the title role.|$|E
5|$|About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously {{informed}} him that Izumo had expended three-quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>wish</b> to leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik. By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, {{but he did not}} receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese turned back, Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. Iwate was the most seriously damaged Japanese ship and suffered a total of 40 killed and 37 wounded.|$|E
