5|$|All that is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style {{to those in the}} illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologically and ethnohistorically, Q'umarkaj is {{the best}} <b>known</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Late Postclassic {{highland}} Maya capitals. The earliest reference to the site in Spanish occurs in Hernán Cortés' letters from Mexico. Although the site has been investigated, little reconstruction work has taken place. The surviving architecture, which includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt, temples and palaces, has been badly damaged by the looting of stone to build {{the nearby town of}} Santa Cruz del Quiché.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{have not}} been able to recover enough of Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.|$|E

According to the folklore of the modern inhabitants of Risan, Teuta ended her life in grief by throwing herself from Orjen Peak.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the storm}} wrought {{extensive}} damage along the Gulf Coast. At least 371 {{people were killed}} by the storm; however, this is considered a conservative estimate and the true death toll may never be <b>known.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> known fatalities, 353 took place in Louisiana and 18 in Mississippi. This makes the 1909 Grand Isle hurricane the eleventh deadliest hurricane in United States history. However, {{at the time of its}} occurrence, it was the sixth deadliest storm in the country. Damage throughout Louisiana and Mississippi was estimated to be at least $10million (1909USD).|$|E

The area, directly opposite the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality City Hall, is now a preserved archaeological site open to visitors, although the sculptures have been removed to the Istanbul Archaeological Museum.|$|E
5|$|Little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{early life}} of Plegmund {{except that he}} was of Mercian descent. A later tradition, dating 300 years after his death, stated that Plegmund lived as a hermit at Plemstall in Cheshire. His {{reputation}} as a scholar {{attracted the attention of}} King Alfred the Great, who was trying to revive scholarship. Some time before 887, Alfred summoned Plegmund to his court. There he worked with three other scholars, Wærferth, Bishop of Worcester, Æthelstan and Wærwulf in working on translating Pope Gregory the Great's treatise Pastoral Care into Old English.|$|E

He was succeeded by Ruler 7, about whom even less is known. Around 764 Toniná defeated Palenque in battle.|$|E

5|$|Little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smoothtooth blacktip shark's natural history; {{it likely}} inhabits shallow waters and feeds on small bony fishes.

Although more specimens have since been discovered, the conservation status of this species remains precarious due to heavy fishing and habitat degradation within its range.|$|E

5|$|Little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{territorial}} behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females {{are larger than}} males, {{this is not the}} case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.|$|E
