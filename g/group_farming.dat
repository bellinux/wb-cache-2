In post-war Japanese agriculture, part-time farmers are increasing, and heirs and successors {{to the older}} farmers are leaving farms and rural areas {{as a consequence of}} rapid industrialization. About nine years after the emergence of post-war voluntary <b>group</b> <b>farming,</b> the government introduced the concept of corporate (<b>group)</b> <b>farming,</b> appealing in particular to young farmer-successors hoping that corporate (<b>group)</b> <b>farming</b> would help them get benefits similar to those offered by industries in urban areas. The study reveals that thanks to the government's special support and laws, the number of corporate (<b>group)</b> <b>farming</b> organizations has rapidly increased although it is still low as compared to the number of voluntary <b>group</b> <b>farming</b> organizations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze {{management}} of <b>group</b> <b>farming</b> on upland fields at vegetable introduction. Therefore, this paper, in Abashiri City, investigates the actual conditions of <b>group</b> <b>farming,</b> and clears a characteristic and correspondence at in-troduction on a vegetable production by <b>group</b> <b>farming.</b> The main conclusions of this paper are the following. First, the characteristic of introducing vegetables on <b>group</b> <b>farming</b> are (1) selection of a list of items, (2) what all farmhouses that take part produce it, (3) two situations of cooperative work and cooperative utilization, and (4) a restriction of area to do planting. Second, a management of <b>group</b> <b>farming</b> at introducing vegetables applies a method against upland field crops. It is possible for <b>Group</b> <b>farming</b> to introduce vegetables by such a method. However, there is possibility that differentials of the vegetables area under cultivation bring about a difficulty for impartiality of a role more than upland fields. In order to solve the problem, it is thought that set up a restriction of a severe vegetable area under cultivation. Third, individual correspondence of a vegetable production is expanded by a small-scale farmhouse, and a principal worker is parents and woman. This is correspondence for that a competition of individual work and cooperative work occurs. The <b>group</b> <b>farming</b> accepts that with a condition that make a cooperative work take priority. By this, a farmhouse can make sure of an income, and the <b>group</b> <b>farming</b> maintains by making sure of cooperative worker...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{technical}} efficiency of farms has sufficiently been detailed {{in the literature}} on agricultural economic development since Farrell (1957) and has now widely been studied by, among others, Bardhan (1973); Kalirajan and Flinn (1983); Fare, Grosskopf and Lovell (1985); Battese, Coelli and Colbi (1989); Kalirajan (1990); Battese and Coelli (1992); Himayatullah, et al. (1994); and Bashir and Himayatullah (1994). The interest in relative economic efficiency emerged from the observation that labour intensity and yield are inversely related to farm size. Economists interpreted this result as an indication that either small and large farms faced different configurations of input and output prices, or small and large farms differed with respect to economic efficiency. Economic efficiency of a <b>group</b> of <b>farms</b> can be conceptualised as comprising two main components; technical efficiency and allocative efficiency. A <b>group</b> of <b>farms</b> may be considered technically more efficient than another <b>group</b> of <b>farms</b> if it can produce a given output with less of some or all inputs, and a <b>group</b> of <b>farms</b> may be considered allocatively more efficient than another <b>group</b> of <b>farms</b> if it is more successful in equating marginal revenue product with the marginal cost of inputs. More simply, technical efficiency involves the farm’s ability to obtain the maximum possible output from a given set of resources, and allocative efficiency concerns its ability to maximise profits by equating the marginal revenue product with the marginal cost of inputs. Specifically, a <b>group</b> of <b>farms</b> that uses the best combination of inputs achieves the maximum possible output and is superior to another <b>group</b> of <b>farms</b> which does not do the same, given a similar bundle of inputs. ...|$|R

The following two points are especially needed for self-support of <b>group</b> <b>farming</b> as a "going concern" (business enterprise). One is the maintenance of capital without subsidies. Another is securing labour; that is, providing enough wages compared with other occupation opportunities. This group makes a net profit which is enough to maintain the capital so far.

However, the wage level is not high at the present, because the leader of this group is inclined to repay loans for machines and facilities as soon as possilbe. Thus, he depresses wage level for this purpose. We think it is necessary to raise the wage level in order to recruit a labour force...|$|E
