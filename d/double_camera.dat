40|$|Recent {{advances}} in nuclear medicine instrumentation {{have led to}} the development of improved positron-imaging systems which exceed in performance the earlier systems which were limited mainly by low count rate capability. This has led to renewed interest in positron imaging in general, primarily because such devices offer better resolution and higher sensitivity than conventional, mechanically collimated gamma cameras, as well as tomographic capability which may provide additional and more accurate information for the clinician. Furthermore, the unique capabilities of positrons for use in reconstructive imaging are beginning to be exploited. In the present report, results are presented from a preliminary study in which longitudinal tomographic myocardial images, produced with $sup 81 $Rb as the positron-emitting label using the <b>double</b> <b>camera</b> coincidence system are compared with conventional myocardial images obtained with $sup 201 $Tl and a gamma camera.

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a robust facial {{analysis}} of multiple camera system for cyber games which is capable of extracting the facial features of a face making large lateral movements. Tactical maneuvers of the gamer make single camera acquisition system unsuitable to analyse and track the face due to his large lateral movements. Although our proposition of <b>double</b> <b>camera</b> acquisition system resolved this problem, but the facial data obtained from both cameras produces optimization problems for face search algorithms. For an improved facial analysis system, we propose to acquire the facial images from two cameras and analyse them by Pareto based hybrid multi-objective face search optimization for 2. 5 D Active Appearance Model (HMOAAM). Proposed algorithm is applied on number of multi-view real and synthetic facial images and its results are compared with a non hybrid system. Results obtained validate our proposition...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{characteristics}} of binocular vergence eye movements, A new type of method to reduce blind areas caused by <b>double</b> <b>cameras</b> in motion platform was put forward, and a model for control binocular vergence eye movements was established according to neural pathways of human binocular oculomotor system. With the model, it is guaranteed that target areas can remain in the public vision field of the <b>double</b> <b>cameras</b> all the time during the <b>double</b> <b>cameras</b> platform moving. This feature is very important for the moving <b>double</b> <b>cameras</b> system, since 3 D reconstruction needs the <b>double</b> <b>cameras</b> to have an overlapping field of vision. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, some experiments on the model were conducted.

40|$|International audienceThe ESA Rosetta {{spacecraft}} {{has been}} tracking its target, the Jupiter-family comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in close vicinity {{for over two}} years. It hosts the OSIRIS instruments: the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System composed of two cameras, see e. g. Keller et al. (2007). In some imaging sequences dedicated to observe dust particles in the comet's coma, the two cameras took images at the same time. The aim of this work is to use these simultaneous <b>double</b> <b>camera</b> observations to calculate the dust particles’ distance to the spacecraft. As the two cameras are mounted on the spacecraft with an offset of 70 cm, the distance of particles observed by both cameras can be determined by a shift of the particles’ apparent trails on the images. This paper presents first results of the ongoing work, introducing the distance determination method for the OSIRIS instrument and the analysis of an example particle. We note that this method works for particles {{in the range of}} about 500 m – 6000 m from the spacecraft...|$|E

40|$|System design aspects must be {{considered}} to effectively map an application onto the constraints of a smart camera network. Therefore, we propose an application-driven design methodology that enables the determination of an output set of operation parameters given an input set of application requirements. We illustrate this approach utilizing distributed, sequential Bayesian estimation for several applications including target tracking, occupancy sensing and multi-object tracking. Observation models for single camera and stereo vision systems are introduced with a particular focus on low-resolution image sensors. Early simulation results indicate that (i) stereo vision can increase tracking accuracy by about a factor of five over single camera vision and (ii) <b>doubling</b> <b>camera</b> resolution can result in {{more than twice the}} accuracy...|$|R

Held in hand, Back-to-Back could deduce hand’s 3 D motion in real time. The basic idea is to extract good corner points from the image sequences captured by two cameras separately and track them while moving. By comparing the motions of two groups of points, the hand’s translation and rotation could be deduced accurately {{as well as other}} motion parameters. Back-to-Back is a prototype for gestural interaction on mobile devices equipped with two cameras.
