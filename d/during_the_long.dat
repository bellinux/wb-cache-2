5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> {{history of}} the British science fiction {{television}} programme Doctor Who, a number of stories were proposed but, {{for a variety of}} reasons, never fully produced.

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> {{period of}} peace between 1815 and 1846 midshipmen had few {{opportunities}} for promotion, and their warrants were often obtained via patronage. The poor quality of officer {{training in the}} US Navy became visible after the Somers Affair, an alleged mutiny aboard the training ship USS Somers in 1842, and the subsequent execution of midshipman Philip Spencer. Spencer had gained his post aboard the Somers via the influence of his father, United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer.|$|E
5|$|Having borne {{the burden}} of the long days of patrolling, {{reconnaissance}} and minor engagements with the advancing Austrian, German and Ottoman columns prior to the battle, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades had alone withstood the attack from midnight on 3/4 August until dawn on 4 August, as well as continuing to fight <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> days of battle.

5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining {{the grandeur of the}} best Man'yōshū poems in the same vein.

5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli {{found himself}} in {{political}} isolation. The triumvirate and the newspaper La Gazeta blamed him for the defeat at Huaqui, and sought punishment as a deterrent.

Castelli suffered from tongue cancer <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> trial, which made it progressively more difficult for him to speak.

5|$|Rosenthal is {{referred}} to as the pioneer of research into seasonal affective disorder. In 1984, he coined the term and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment. Rosenthal's interest in studying the effects of the seasons on mood changes emerged when he emigrated from the mild climate of Johannesburg, South Africa, to the northeastern US. As a resident in the psychiatry program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, he noticed that he was more energetic and productive <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> days of summer versus the shorter darker days of the winter.|$|E

River boats could navigate the Yukon in the summer from the delta until a point called Whitehorse, above the Klondike. Travel in general was made difficult by both the geography and climate. The region was mountainous, the rivers winding and sometimes impassable; the short summers could be hot, while from October to June, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> winters, temperatures could drop below −50°C (−58°F).|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> March Zhu and Zhou Enlai {{organized}} certain {{battles in}} tandem. There were few positive effects since {{the real power}} was {{in the hands of}} Bo Gu and Otto Braun. In the Zunyi Conference, Zhu supported Mao Zedong’s criticisms of Bo and Braun. After the conference, Zhu cooperated with Mao and Zhou on military affairs. In July 1935 Zhu and Liu Bocheng were with the Fourth Red Army while Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with the First Red Army. When separation between the two divisions occurred, Zhu was forced by Zhang Guotao, the leader of Fourth Red Army, to go south. The Fourth Red Army barely survived the retreat through Sichuan Province. Arriving in Yan'an, Zhu directed the reconstruction of the Red Army under the political guidance of Mao.|$|E
5|$|In 1714, Queen Anne was {{succeeded by}} her second cousin, and Sophia's son, George I, Elector of Hanover, who {{consolidated}} his position by defeating Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1719. The new monarch was less active in government {{than many of}} his British predecessors, but retained control over his German kingdoms, with which Britain was now in personal union. Power shifted towards George's ministers, especially to Sir Robert Walpole, who is often considered the first British prime minister, although the title was not then in use. The next monarch, George II, witnessed the final end of the Jacobite threat in 1746, when the Catholic Stuarts were completely defeated. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> reign of his grandson, George III, Britain's American colonies were lost, the former colonies having formed the United States of America, but British influence {{elsewhere in the world}} continued to grow, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was created by the Acts of Union 1800.|$|E
5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, {{it might be possible to}} establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> trip back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book Our Search for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E

5|$|Marquis {{wished to}} be sent to France, but was {{required}} first to take a course in French. In the meantime, he was assigned to a convalescent hospital. Shortly before being sent overseas, Marquis was assigned to Camp Forrest in Lytle, Georgia, an engineering camp, where he found himself treating victims of the beginning of the 1918 flu pandemic. Marquis arrived in England just as the war ended; the flu epidemic, however, had not. He continued to Cannes, where he was assigned the task of determining the capacity of hotels for use as hospitals. In January 1919 he was assigned to the Hotel Metropole as assistant to the attending surgeon. They were soon overwhelmed with influenza cases. Marquis himself came down with flu but continued working. He was reassigned to the Hotel Suisse in Nice, but, still ill, was ordered back to the US. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> wait for transport home, he took up medical duties in Gironde, finally docking in the US in June.|$|E

5|$|The Serb {{uprising}} of 1596–97, {{also known}} as the Herzegovina uprising of 1596–97, was a rebellion organized by Serbian Patriarch Jovan Kantul (s. 1592–1614) and led by Grdan, the vojvoda ("duke") of Nikšić against the Ottomans in the Sanjak of Herzegovina and Montenegro Vilayet, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Turkish War (1593–1606).

The rebels, defeated at the field of Gacko (Gatačko Polje) in 1597, were forced to capitulate due to a lack of foreign support.|$|E
