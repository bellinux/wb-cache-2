5|$|If Sheshi {{is to be}} {{identified}} with Salitis, the founder of the 15th Dynasty after Manetho, then he would have lived around 1650 BC, the date agreed upon by most Egyptologists, including Ryholt, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the Hyksos in Egypt.

Findley, though, following an expired contract with the Royals, declared his intentions to play overseas, with rumors circulating about him possibly playing for Danish Superliga clubs Brøndby and Randers, Premier League club Wolverhampton, even Championship club Nottingham Forest. On November 24, Randers denied rumors that Findley was on trial with the club.|$|R
5|$|As {{the weeks}} {{extended}} well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities {{to relieve the}} tedium. A permanent lookout was kept <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed {{with no sign of}} the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55minutes, and was a complete success.|$|E

In this role, he secured the capital <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> President-elect Abraham Lincoln, and was personally responsible for security at the new president's inaugural.|$|E

During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were unprepared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works.|$|E

5|$|Hearst first {{bought the}} monastery {{intending}} {{to replace the}} family retreat at Wyntoon, {{on the bank of}} the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted to replace it with a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.|$|E

The Government of Mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for coastal communities across Guerrero; by 21:00UTC (4p.m.CDT) on September28, a tropical storm watch was in effect for west of Lázaro Cárdenas to Punta San Telmo, a tropical storm warning for Acapulco to east of Tecpán de Galeana, and a hurricane warning for Tecpán de Galeana to Lázaro Cárdenas.

40|$|This paper validates the raison d’être of the {{effortlessly}} recovered web Search Intensity Indices (SII) <b>for</b> predicting <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> {{tourists in}} Cyprus. By using monthly data (2004 - 2015) and two causality testing procedures we find, for properly selected key-phrases, that web search intensity (adjusted for different languages and different search engines) {{turns out to}} convey a useful predictive content <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> tourists in Cyprus. Additionally, we show that whenever the prevailing shares of visitors come from countries in different languages, then {{the identification of the}} aggregate SII becomes complex. Hence, we argue that blindly using key-phrases to identify an aggregate SII is like an immersion into the unknown, since two sources of bias (the language bias and the search engine bias) are fully neglected. Given the importance of the tourism sector in the total economy activity of Cyprus, our findings might prove to be quite useful to governmental agencies, policy makers and other stakeholders of the sector when their purpose is to allocate effectively the existing limited resources, and to plan short- and long-run promotion and investment strategies...|$|R

In March 2007, the commandos, along with elements of the SASR, took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado. After the battle, the commandos and SASR elements were withdrawn {{at the request of the}} East Timorese government in order to start negotiations with the rebels.|$|E

Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square.
