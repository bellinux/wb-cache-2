5000|$|Penela-Pea: Female pea who {{pushes her}} baby, Nap-Pea, {{around in a}} <b>push</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nap-Pea: Penela-Pea's baby, {{who sits}} in a <b>push</b> <b>chair</b> and wears a large nappy.|$|R
6000|$|MARY. Poor Will! How selfish I {{must have}} seemed! You {{should have told}} me sooner, and I wouldn't have worried you. Come along. (She goes out, <b>pushing</b> <b>chair.)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Avoid {{getting a}} {{stroller}} or <b>push</b> <b>chair</b> before {{your baby is}} born. Keep it elsewhere, preferably {{away from the house}} if you happen to purchase one. It's bad luck to have an empty stroller within the house when you're pregnant.|$|R
50|$|Deirdre Langton (Anne Kirkbride) wheeled {{her young}} {{daughter}} Tracy (Christabel Finch) down to The Rovers in her pram. She {{was to see}} Annie Walker (Doris Speed) with regards to a knitting pattern. Knowing Annie's strict rules concerning children on licensed premises, Tracy was left outside in her <b>push</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|A low cry of astonishment {{broke from}} the squire. He <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> back.|$|R
60|$|He <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> away, such {{suffering}} in his look {{as she had}} never seen.|$|R
60|$|Then he rang off, and <b>pushing</b> Jake's <b>chair</b> {{out of the}} way, {{shut the}} door.|$|R
60|$|She got up {{and moved}} indignantly about the room, <b>pushing</b> a <b>chair</b> out of her way.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower end}} of the {{funicular}} railway is located on Paul's Walk next to the Thames and the top end is located 26.85 m further up Peter's Hill on the terrace which is level with the deck of the Millennium Bridge. It was primarily installed for use by those who cannot easily manage the steep steps, such as people with disabilities and parents with <b>push</b> <b>chairs.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{turned as}} pale as ashes, and <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> {{two or three}} feet away from me.|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily I <b>pushed</b> my <b>chair</b> back, as I {{looked from}} the boards {{at which he}} pointed to himself.|$|R
60|$|Lewisham, {{partially}} embraced, <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> {{back with}} his disengaged arm, so that she might sit on his knee....|$|R
60|$|She <b>pushed</b> Anne's <b>chair</b> {{close to}} the nearest open window--a window at {{the upper end of}} the library--and ran out.|$|R
60|$|Wingate rose {{slowly to}} his feet, <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> back and stood behind it. Flossie gripped {{him by the}} wrist.|$|R
60|$|Dominey <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> {{back from}} the fire as though he felt the heat. His eyes seemed glued upon the doctor's.|$|R
60|$|Caleb had <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> back, and {{was leaning}} forward, {{shaking his head}} slowly, and fitting his finger-tips {{together}} with much nicety.|$|R
60|$|He <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> back and, rising {{slowly from}} the table, confronted him. Captain Brisket, red-faced and confident, {{stared up at}} him composedly.|$|R
60|$|He <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> back and, {{throwing}} one {{leg over}} the other, {{looked down at his}} patent-leather boots. The benevolent expression had disappeared.|$|R
60|$|Rigaud <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> {{a little}} back; pushed his legs out {{straight}} before him; {{and sat with}} his arms folded over against her.|$|R
60|$|Luke Standifer {{rose to his}} feet, and <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> back. He looked rather perplexedly {{around the}} big office, with its {{handsome}} furniture.|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Percy, {{with one}} hand lightly pressed on the letter, <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> away and with his {{pleasant}} ringing voice, said once again: ...|$|R
6000|$|Conrade came most inconveniently {{close to}} her; she <b>pushed</b> her <b>chair</b> back; he came after her. His mother uttered a remonstrating, [...] "My dear!" ...|$|R
60|$|Draconmeyer <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> {{forward and}} {{leaned across the}} table. The heads of the three men were close together. His tone was stealthily lowered.|$|R
60|$|He {{dismissed}} {{the man who}} had <b>pushed</b> the <b>chair</b> and gave Mordaunt a quick glance. Bernard's brows were white, but his eyes were keen.|$|R
5000|$|When Jason was fired, he <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> {{over and}} swore {{as he left}} the board room, having argued with Bouris about his {{decision}} ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Panney now sat down, and La Fleur, <b>pushing</b> her <b>chair</b> {{a little}} {{away from the}} table, availed herself of the {{permission}} to do likewise.|$|R
6000|$|She {{rose to her}} feet. She was so horrified {{that she}} {{staggered}} backward, <b>pushing</b> her <b>chair</b> behind her. [...] "But you are mad," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, there's {{one thing}} to be said of it,' {{returned}} Tom, <b>pushing</b> his <b>chair</b> from him, and standing up; 'it will be getting away from home.' ...|$|R
60|$|And he rose, <b>pushing</b> his <b>chair</b> aside, {{leaving her}} there, {{kneeling}} beside the desk, humbled and helpless. And he retreated within {{the shadow of}} the room.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Chalk {{collapsed}} and sat {{staring at her}} in dismay. Mr. Stobell, placing {{both hands on the}} table, <b>pushed</b> his <b>chair</b> back and eyed her disagreeably.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take that plate away," [...] {{at last he}} said, {{getting up}} with an oath--and with this <b>pushing</b> his <b>chair</b> back, he walked into his own room.|$|R
5000|$|A {{significant}} {{development in}} transportation, and public transport in particular, to achieve accessibility, is {{the move to}} [...] "low-floor" [...] vehicles. In a low-floor vehicle, access to part {{or all of the}} passenger cabin is unobstructed from one or more entrances by the presence of steps, enabling easier access for the infirm or people with <b>push</b> <b>chairs.</b> A further aspect may be that the entrance and corridors are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Low-floor vehicles have been developed for buses, trolleybuses and trams.|$|R
5000|$|Blake {{was arrested}} on 23 January 1987 outside a {{department}} store opposite Lumphini Park along with her de facto husband Paul Hudson. With them was their baby son Todd Paul John. 4.47 kilograms of heroin was hidden inside the pillow in her son's <b>push</b> <b>chair.</b> The couple and their child spent the first night after the arrest together with other prisoners in a police cell. The child went into {{the care of the}} Australian embassy the following day. Police had been monitoring the pair and saw them pass US$49,000 to a Thai national and accept eight packets which they stuffed into the pillow in the stroller. The heroin was said by police to be of [...] "the lowest grade of purity". An officer also claimed that the presence of the child and <b>push</b> <b>chair</b> increased their suspicions as a French film showing in Bangkok at that time, Three Men and a Cradle, had involved drug smugglers hiding heroin in a baby's nappy for a drop. The Thai man, massage parlour operator Supoj Kittidejdamkern, was arrested as he drove away after the meeting. Police followed Blake and Hudson some distance before arresting them. Police said Blake and Hudson had made ten visits to Thailand in the previous seven years.|$|R
60|$|Madeline fled as if pursued. With {{trembling}} hands she locked the doors, drew the blinds {{of the windows}} that opened on the porch, <b>pushed</b> <b>chairs</b> aside {{so that she could}} pace the length of her room. She was now alone, and she walked with soft, hurried, uneven steps. She could be herself here; she needed no mask; the long habit of serenely hiding the truth from the world and from herself could be broken. The seclusion of her darkened chamber made possible that betrayal of herself to which she was impelled.|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry was {{apparently}} {{relieved to see}} his visitor. He <b>pushed</b> a <b>chair</b> towards him and indicated with a gesture of invitation a box of cigars upon his desk.|$|R
