These primary parts involve varying amounts of individual components to achieve the desired goal of reinforcing and clarifying the sound to the audience, performers, or other individuals.|$|E

As fluorescence is a special case of luminescence, digital X-ray imaging is conceptually similar to digital gamma ray imaging (scintigraphy, SPECT, and PET) in that in both of these imaging mode families, the information conveyed by the variable attenuation of invisible electromagnetic radiation as it passes through tissues with various radiodensities is converted by an electronic sensor into an <b>electric</b> <b>signal</b> that is processed by a computer and made output as a visible-light image.|$|E

In the year 1856, Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch measured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1/√ε0μ0, by discharging a Leyden jar, and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following year Gustav Kirchhoff calculated that an <b>electric</b> <b>signal</b> in a resistanceless wire travels along the wire at this speed. In the early 1860s, Maxwell showed that, according to the theory of electromagnetism he was working on, electromagnetic waves propagate in empty space at a speed equal to the above Weber/Kohrausch ratio, and drawing attention to the numerical proximity of this value to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, he proposed that light is in fact an electromagnetic wave.|$|E

In diabetic patients, impaired wound healing {{is one of}} the most challenging complications in diabetes management. A fundamental gap in knowledge is whether diabetic wounds have abnormal <b>electric</b> <b>signaling.</b> Here we used a vibrating probe to demonstrate that diabetic corneas produced significantly weaker wound <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> than the normal cornea. This was confirmed in three independent animal models of diabetes: db/db, streptozotocin-induced and mice fed a high-fat diet. Spatial measurements illustrated that diabetic cornea wound currents at the wound edge but not wound center were significantly weaker than normal. Time lapse measurements revealed that the electric currents at diabetic corneas lost the normal rising and plateau phases. The abnormal <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> correlated significantly with impaired wound healing. Immunostaining suggested lower expression of chloride channel 2 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator in diabetic corneal epithelium. Acute high glucose exposure significantly (albeit moderately) reduced electrotaxis of human corneal epithelial cells in vitro, but did not affect the electric currents at cornea wounds. These data suggest that weaker wound <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> and impaired electrotaxis may contribute to the impaired wound healing in diabetes...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} a review {{is made of}} the various preseismic <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> that have been {{observed}} before large EQs in Greece {{during the period of}} 1999 to 2012. The observed preseismic <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> comply quite well with the theoretical ones that are expected to be generated by a large scale piezoelectric mechanism been activatsd at the focal area due to its excess stress-load. Preseismic <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> of the total piezoelectric field, its first time derivative, its oscillation due to M 1 and K 1 tidal components have been observed by single monitoring sites during the actual 1999 to 2012 experiment in Greece. Moreover, the "strange attractor like" <b>electric</b> preseismic <b>signal</b> was detected by the simultaneously use of two distant monitoring sites. It is demonstrated that the preseismic <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> can not only determine quite accurately a very short time window for the EQ occurrence and its epicentral location but the latter can be achieved without any prior knowledge of the geological, tectonic setting or past seismic history of the seismogenic area. The predicted pending EQ is treated as a single isolated destructive nature event which sends clear warning signals well before its occurrence. Real examples are presented from the Greek territory.

30|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{and presents}} {{a different perspective}} for classifying single and multiple disturbances in <b>electric</b> <b>signals,</b> such as voltage and current ones. Basically, the principle of divide to conquer is applied to decompose the <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> into what we call primitive signals or components from which primitive patterns can be independently recognized. A technique based on such concept is introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of such idea. This technique decomposes the <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> into three main primitive components. In each primitive component, few high-order-statistics- (HOS-) based features are extracted. Then, Bayes' theory-based techniques are applied to verify the ocurrence or not of single or multiple disturbances in the <b>electric</b> <b>signals.</b> The performance analysis carried out on {{a large number of}} data indicates that the proposed technique outperforms the performance attained by the technique introduced by He and Starzyk. Additionally, the numerical results verify that the proposed technique is capable of offering interesting results when it is applied to classify several sets of disturbances if one cycle of the main frequency is considered, at least.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>signal</b> is {{transmitted}} through cables into an electronic or digital drum module ("brain" [...] {{as it is}} sometimes called), synthesizer or other device, which then produces a sound associated with, and triggered by, the struck pad.

Since digital drums have become more popular, companies have started selling digital electronic drum files, referred to as drum kits. While electronic drum kits are typically used to trigger drum and percussion sounds, a MIDI-equipped electronic drum kit can be used to trigger any types of MIDI sounds, such as synthesized or sampled piano, guitar, or any other instrument.|$|E

Usually, the [...] "acoustic triggered kit" [...] has either commercially available mesh head [...] "skins" [...] (silent), or the drummer keeps her natural skins (using acoustic skins for a Hybrid kit are standard practice) and other muting accessories to reduce the acoustic sounds generated when played. This way, an acoustic (electro/acoustic) or Hybrid triggered drum kit has the feel and sizes of the standard acoustic kit but with the added benefits of an electronic kit's onstage silence, controllable volume (an important factor in small venues) or the added sound library available in 2016-era high-end kits, which includes sounds for large gongs and other instruments that are expensive and hard to transport in their original acoustic form. A recent innovation is DrumsAnywhere software, which uses only a single piezoelectric microphone to trigger eight different drum pads on any flat or irregular surface.|$|E
2500|$|The Gotthardbahn {{employed}} signal bells {{within its}} stations {{and along the}} line to signal any approaching train. An alarm was triggered once a train had left a neighbouring station or block station. These signal bells were partly installed along the line and signalled any construction worker an approaching train. In addition, any railway watchman's house and railroad crossing would be equipped with a signal bell. Southbound trains were signalled by 3 triple chimes, northbound trains by two double chimes. The signalling mechanism at each signal bell had to be manually wound up every day by station employees and railway watchmen.

2500|$|Electric violins have a {{magnetic}} or piezoelectric pickup that converts string vibration to an <b>electric</b> <b>signal.</b> A patch cable or wireless transmitter sends {{the signal to}} an amplifier of a PA system. Electric violins are usually constructed as such, but a pickup {{can be added to}} a conventional acoustic violin. An electric violin with a resonating body that produces listening-level sound independently of the electric elements can be called an electro-acoustic violin. To be effective as an acoustic violin, electro-acoustic violins retain much of the resonating body of the violin, and often resemble an acoustic violin or fiddle. [...] The body may be finished in bright colors and made from alternative materials to wood. These violins may need to be hooked up to an instrument amplifier or PA system. [...] Some types come with a silent option that allows the player to use headphones that are hooked up to the violin. The first specially built electric violins date back to 1928 and were made by Victor Pfeil, Oskar Vierling, George Eisenberg, Benjamin Miessner, George Beauchamp, Hugo Benioff and Fredray Kislingbury. These violins can be plugged into effect units, just like an electric guitar, including distortion, wah-wah pedal and reverb. Since electric violins do not rely on string tension and resonance to amplify their sound they can have more strings. For example, five-stringed electric violins are available from several manufacturers, and a seven string electric violin (with three lower strings encompassing the cello's range) is also available. The majority of the first electric violinists were musicians playing jazz fusion (e.g., Jean-Luc Ponty) and popular music.|$|E
