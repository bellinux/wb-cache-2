5|$|Similar to the 1997 film, Air <b>Force</b> <b>One,</b> 24 {{featured}} the president's personal jumbo-jet (Air <b>Force</b> <b>One).</b> Air <b>Force</b> <b>One</b> {{was featured in}} 24 seasons 2 and 4. Air Force Two (carrying the Vice President but not the President) was featured in season 6. Several actors featured in 24, such as Xander Berkeley, Glenn Morshower, Wendy Crewson, Timothy Carhart, Jürgen Prochnow, Tom Everett and Spencer Garrett also appeared in the film Air <b>Force</b> <b>One.</b> The 25th amendment, which deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures for filling a vacancy {{in the office of}} the Vice President and responding to Presidential disabilities, was also a shared theme between the film and the television series. 24 used the same Air <b>Force</b> <b>One</b> set from another television series, The West Wing.|$|E

5|$|For {{the inauguration}} of the CCP, a gala opening of the Golden Salakot, a pageant-drama of {{a story about the}} {{prehistory}} of the Philippines, occurred on September 8, 1969. The United States of America's President Nixon was invited but instead Ronald Reagan, California's Governor, along with his wife, flew to the country using the Air <b>Force</b> <b>One</b> for the event.

5|$|Isaac Newton derived this theorem in Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, first {{published}} in 1687. In Proposition 43, he showed that the added force must be a central <b>force,</b> <b>one</b> whose magnitude depends only upon the distance r between the particle and a point fixed in space (the center). In Proposition 44, he derived a formula for the force, showing {{that it was an}} inverse-cube <b>force,</b> <b>one</b> that varies as the inverse cube of r. In Proposition 45 Newton extended his theorem to arbitrary central forces by assuming that the particle moved in nearly circular orbit.|$|E
