40|$|Multiple {{delivery}} specifications {{exist on}} nearly all commodity futures contracts. Sellers are typically allowed {{to choose among}} several grades of the underlying commodity. On the delivery day, the futures price converges to the spot price of the cheapest-to-deliver grade rather than {{to that of the}} par-delivery grade of the commodity, thereby imposing an additional <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> on hedgers. This paper derives the optimal production and futures hedging strategy for a risk-averse competitive firm facing <b>delivery</b> <b>risk.</b> We show that the option value of the multiple delivery specification induces the firm to produce more with than without the <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> if the firm gauges this value higher than the market. We further show that if the <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> is additively related to the commodity price risk, the firm optimally under-hedges its risk exposure. On the other hand, if the <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> is multiplicatively related to the commodity price risk, the firm may optimally choose an under- or over-hedge which we illustrate using a numerical example. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

One of the objectives of this research is to fill the gap of previous literature that did not much investigated the external online factors that influence consumers’ online shopping behavior in Sweden’s context. Thus, the focus lays on these five online factors: financial risk, product performance risk, <b>delivery</b> <b>risk,</b> trust and security, and website design. The empirical data was collected through a questionnaire survey and it was distributed among 100 respondents by hand and online. The findings of this research revealed that website design is the most influential and significant factor.

To investigate the hypotheses of the research, data was collected from online shopping users; a survey was conducted with a sample size of 395 online shoppers among consumers who previously purchased online and mainly from the main popular online stores in Jordan, methodology was done using SPSS 17 and Amos 18. The study revealed that financial risk, product risk, <b>delivery</b> <b>risk,</b> and information security risk negatively affect online shopping behavior.

40|$|Preterm {{delivery}} {{increases the}} risk of infant mortality and morbidity, and therefore developing reliable methods for predicting its likelihood are of great importance. Previous work using uterine electromyography (EMG) recordings has shown that they may provide a promising and objective way for predicting risk of preterm delivery. However, to date attempts at utilizing computational approaches to achieve sufficient predictive confidence, in terms of area under the curve (AUC) values, have not achieved the high discrimination accuracy that a clinical application requires. In our study, we propose a new analytical approach for assessing the risk of preterm delivery using EMG recordings which firstly employs Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to obtain their Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF). Next, the entropy values of both instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the first ten IMF components are computed in order to derive ratios of these two distinct components as features. Discrimination accuracy of this approach compared to those proposed previously was then calculated using six differently representative classifiers. Finally, three different electrode positions were analyzed for their prediction accuracy of preterm delivery in order to establish which uterine EMG recording location was optimal signal data. Overall, our results show a clear improvement in prediction accuracy of preterm <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> compared with previous approaches, achieving an impressive maximum AUC value of 0. 986 when using signals from an electrode positioned below the navel. In sum, this provides a promising new method for analyzing uterine EMG signals to permit accurate clinical assessment of preterm <b>delivery</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|E

While the importance of optimizing embryo culture and improving obstetrical outcomes after in vitro fertilization cannot be underestimated, we believe this study suffers from a serious methodological flaw, namely ‘confounding by indi-cation’. Due to this bias, blastocyst-stage transfer—the most effective means of improving selection and reducingmultiple gestation (Papaniko-laou et al., 2006) —may be incorrectly blamed for this small difference in preterm <b>delivery</b> <b>risk</b> (17. 2 versus 14. 1 %).
