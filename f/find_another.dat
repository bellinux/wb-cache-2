From Table  4, the optimal solution reported by Lampinen et.al. is (9, 1.223041, 0.238) of (x_ 1, x_ 2, x_ 3). DE/best, mDEOB/best/ 1 and DE/cur_to_best/ 1 algorithms find the same optimal solution, while mDEOB/cur_to_best/ 1 <b>finds</b> <b>another</b> optimal solution, (10, 1.18104, 0.283).|$|R

5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} for lifewhat we call 'pre-biotic chemistry'are abundant in many solar system objects, such as comets, asteroids and icy moons.

But, energy is another matter, and currently, Callisto's ocean is only being heated by radioactive elements, whereas Europa has tidal energy as well, from its greater proximity to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} requires foreign domestic helpers {{to leave}} Hong Kong {{within two weeks}} of the termination of their employment contract, unless they <b>find</b> <b>another</b> employer (the two-week rule).
