In 1913, his father, Harold Woodruff, a {{professor}} of veterinary medicine at the Royal Veterinary College in London, moved the family to Australia so he could take up the post of Professor of Veterinary Pathology and Director of the Veterinary Institute at the University of Melbourne. The elder Woodruff later became the Professor of Bacteriology. The family's new life in Australia was interrupted by World War I, which prompted Harold to enlist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services.</b> He became {{an officer in the}} Australian Army Veterinary Corps and was sent to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1940 Lindwall made his first grade rugby league debut in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for the St. George club {{alongside}} his older brother Jack, {{who had been with}} the club since 1938. He played at fullback and assumed goal-kicking responsibilities. Lindwall's cricketing improved during the 1940–41 season, taking 34 wickets at 16.45, approximately doubling his wickets while halving their cost. By this time, many of his colleagues had enlisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> and the competition was beginning to thin out during World War II. Lindwall missed the 1941 NSWRFL season due to illness, and in doing so missed out on the team that won the premiership that season. In October 1941, Lindwall was selected to make his first-class cricket debut against Queensland in Brisbane, just after turning 20. Playing along his childhood hero McCabe, Lindwall put in a wayward performance. He conceded an expensive 81 runs in 15 wicketless overs and made just one run with the bat. The Sheffield Shield season was cancelled a month later after the December 1941 Pearl Harbor attack, that signalled the widening of the war into the Pacific arena. The Sydney grade cricket competition continued, and Lindwall helped St. George to a hat-trick of premierships with 27 wickets at 22.19 and 405 runs at 27.00.|$|E

Similarly, the Japan Self-Defense Forces, when being asked about their policy toward gays and lesbians following the U.S. debate during the Clinton presidency, answered that it was not an issue, and individuals within the forces indicated that as long as same-sex relations did not lead to fights or other trouble, there were few, if any, barriers to their inclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

25|$|His World War I {{services}} are not known, but a dozen William Scotts are recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> at this time. In 1915 he married Lily Edmundson (born 19 August 1891) in Leeds Register Office; {{she was a}} tailoress and the daughter of George Edmundson, a machine fitter in 1891 and electrical engineer in 1915. Scott {{was at that time}} an artist and caricaturist, living at 79 Buslingthorpe Lane, Leeds; his mother was one of the witnesses at the wedding. They had two daughters: the first was Patricia Shirley born at 1 Highfield Terrace, Golder's Green on 28 September 1919 when Scott described himself as a black and white artist. The second was Marjory Sylvia born at St Edwards maternity home, Station Road, Herne Bay on 4 January 1921. At this point Scott was describing himself as a journalist and living at Roldale House, Selsea Avenue, Herne Bay.|$|E
500|$|Embittered by his {{dismissal}} {{from the}} RAAF and the meagre severance {{he received from}} the Australian Government, McNamara insisted that his Victoria Cross not be returned to Australia after his death; his family donated it to the RAF Museum, London. A fellow No.1 Squadron pilot, Lieutenant (later Air Vice Marshal) Adrian Cole, described McNamara as [...] "quiet, scholarly, loyal and beloved by all... the last Officer for whom that high honour would have been predicted". He {{was one of the}} few Victoria Cross recipients to subsequently attain senior rank <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services,</b> though RAAF historian Alan Stephens considered that his appointments were [...] "in the main routine" [...] and that his one great deed led to [...] "a degree of fame that he perhaps found burdensome". Biographer Chris Coulthard-Clark summed up McNamara's [...] "dilemma" [...] as that of [...] "an essentially ordinary man" [...] thrust into the limelight by one [...] "truly amazing episode". His name is borne by Frank McNamara Park in Shepparton, Victoria, and the Frank McNamara VC Club at Oakey Army Aviation Centre, Queensland.|$|E

500|$|That month, Clinton {{implemented}} a Department of Defense directive known as [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", which allowed {{gay men and}} women to serve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services</b> provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation. The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that [...] "the President should lift the ban... even though [...] was sure to be overridden by the Congress". Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions. Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future. Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not [...] "out of whack". The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.|$|E
500|$|The {{end of the}} war {{marked the}} start of the 1945 cricket season. Miller {{returned}} to Lord's and top-scored with 50 for the RAAF against a British Empire XI, as his team opened the season with a six-wicket win. Warner had organised a series of matches between England and Australian servicemen, known as the Victory Tests, to celebrate the end of hostilities. However, Australian cricket administrators would not accredit the three-day matches as official Test matches, arguing that there were not enough Test-level players <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>services.</b> England were close to full strength, so the AIF and the RAAF teams merged to strengthen their quality. As a result, the Australian Services cricket team was formed under the leadership of Warrant Officer Lindsay Hassett to compete in the Victory Tests. Hassett was the only capped Test player, but six others had first-class experience in Australia. The First Victory Test was at Lord's and was expected to usher in a new post-war era, which it hoped would be more aggressive and attractive. The last Anglo-Australian Test series before the war had featured a large number of draws due to defensive play. England batted first and Miller came on as the fifth bowler. He bowled his Great Massingham pilot colleague Bill Edrich for 45 to end with 1/11, precipitating an English collapse from 4/200 to 267. In reply to England's 267, Miller came to the crease at 3/136 and joined Hassett. Miller gradually progressed, and once Australia had taken the lead, he cut loose. After spending 40 minutes in the 90s, he finished with 105 in 210 minutes, with a straight six. The Times opined that his innings was [...] "as good a century as has been seen at Lord's in many a long day". Wisden said that he [...] "was always getting runs with the soundness characteristic of most Australians". Harry Altham declared that [...] "a brilliant new star had joined the cluster of the Southern Cross". Australia took a 188-run lead, and reached their second innings target with two balls to spare to win by six wickets despite Miller being run out for only one. He then took 2/2 and made a duck as the RAAF lost to the RAF by 16 runs in a one-day match.|$|E
