The influence of membrane composition on the electrodes’ response was studied. The electrodes showed a fast, stable and Nernstian response over a wide distigmine concentration range 5. 0  ×  10 − 7 – 1  ×  10 − 2  mol L− 1 with a slope of ∼ 30. 5  ±  1. 0  mV dec− 1. The response is independent of the pH of test solution within the range 3. 8 – 10. 5. The life span of the electrodes extends to at least 2  months without any considerable divergence in potential and has a fast response time of < 15  s. The electrodes showed good selectivity towards distigmine with respect to large numbers of ions in batch and FIA systems. The electrodes have been applied to the determination of distigmine in pure solution, pharmaceutical compound and human urine. The dissolution profile for Ubretid tablets (5  mg/tablet) was studied...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} method for {{the determination of}} atorvastatin calcium in pharmaceutical preparations using two modified carbon paste electrodes was developed. One electrode (sensor A) is based on ion-pair of atorvastatin with 5, 6 -diaminouracil hydrochloride (ATS-DAUH) and the other (sensor B) is based on atorvastatin with picric acid (ATS-PC). Among three different solvent mediators tested, <b>dioctylphthalate</b> (DOPH) exhibited a proper behavior including Nernstian slopes of the calibration curve at 58. 76  ±  0. 8 and 57. 48 ± 1  mV per decade for sensors A and B. The response times were 10 and 12  s, detection limits 1. 3  ×  10 − 6 and 2. 2  ×  10 − 6  M; the concentration range 2. 5  ×  10 − 6 - 7. 9  ×  10 − 2  M and 3. 0  ×  10 − 6 to 7. 9  ×  10 − 2  M respectively. The present electrodes show good discrimination of atorvastatin calcium from several inorganic, organic ions, sugars and some common excipients. The sensors were applied for the determination of atorvastatin calcium in pharmaceutical preparations using standard addition and the calibration curve methods. The results obtained were satisfactory with excellent percentage recovery comparable and sometimes better than those obtained by other routine methods for the assay. The proposed potentiometric methods offer the advantages of simplicity, accuracy, automation feasibility and applicability to turbid and colored sample solutions...|$|E
40|$|A {{potentiometric}} strontium-selective electrode {{based on}} 18 -crown- 6 in PVC matrix for measurement of strontium ion is reported. The electrode was prepared by coating {{the surface of}} a graphite by a membrane contain-ing <b>dioctylphthalate</b> (DOP), 18 -crown- 6 and carbon powder in poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The membrane composition consisting of 18 -crown- 6, PVC, DOP, carbon, the thickness of coated membrane, effect of pH and possible interfering cations and anions were investigated and optimized electrode were evaluated. The electrode exhibits significantly enhanced response toward strontium ions over the concentration range 1 × 10 - 7 to 1 × 10 - 2 M with slope of 27. 35 mV per decade change. Fast and stable response, good reproducibility, long-term stability is demonstrated. The electrode has a response time of 20 - 25 s and can be used for at least 6 weeks without any considerable divergence in their potential response. The proposed electrode shows fairly good discrimination of strontium from several cations. The electrode was used for direct potentiometric measurements of strontium ions over the concentration range 1 × 10 - 7 – 1 × 10 - 2 M. The practical utility of the electrode has been demonstrated by using it successfully as an indicator electrode in the potentiometric titration of Sr 2 + with EDTA...|$|E
40|$|Large {{amplitude}} oscillatory {{shear strain}} {{was applied to}} anionically synthesized linear polystyrene solutions in <b>dioctylphthalate.</b> The resulting torque was analyzed in Fourier space with respect to frequency, magnitude, and phase (Fourier-transform rheology). The concentration of the solutions was varied to achieve different degrees of entanglement. In addition, numerical simulations were performed using the Giesekus constitutive equation fitted {{on the basis of}} linear viscoelastic data. We found a good qualitative agreement between experiments and predictions; a quantitative agreement was reached for intermediate strain amplitudes. Some deviations were observed at very low strain amplitudes. We present a descriptive relation for the relative magnitude of the third harmonic as a function of strain amplitude using a modified damping function. From this relation we obtained a universal parameter that describes the scaling behavior law for the increasing non-linearity (e. g., measured by the relative intensity of the third harmonic with respect to the response at the excitation frequency) {{as a function of the}} strain amplitude. We found that the scaling exponent for the investigated linear polymer systems was independent of various factors. In addition, we analyzed the strain dependence of the relative phase of the higher harmonics. For vanishing strain amplitudes we define a property Φ 3 0 that should reflect the contribution of the different relaxation modes to the viscoelastic response, and thus, a potential correlation to polymer topology...|$|E
40|$|Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) based polymer {{inclusion}} membranes (PIMs), {{with different}} concentrations of Cyphos® IL 104 as the membrane extractant/carrier, were studied {{for their ability}} to extract Au(III) from hydrochloric acid solutions. Some of the PIMs also contained one of the following plasticizers or modifiers: 2 -nitrophenyloctyl ether, <b>dioctylphthalate,</b> 1 -dodecanol, 1 -tetradecanol, or tri(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate. The best performance, in terms of extraction rate and amount of Au(III) extracted, was exhibited by a PIM consisting of 25 wt% Cyphos(®) IL 104, 5 wt% 1 -dodecanol, and 70 wt% PVC. An almost complete back-extraction of the Au(III) extracted from this membrane was achieved by using a 0. 10 mol L(- 1) Na₂SO₃ receiver solution at pH 8. The stoichiometry of the extracted Au(III) /Cyphos® IL 104 adduct was determined as [P]⁺ [AuCl₄](-) H⁺ [PO₂](-) where [P]⁺ and [PO₂](-) represent trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium and bis(2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl) phosphinate ions, respectively. Back-extraction of Au(III) is suggested to occur by reduction of Au(III) to Au(I), with the formation of the species [Au(SO₃) ₂](3 -) in the aqueous receiver solution. Loss of 1 -dodecanol from the newly developed PIM to the aqueous solutions in contact with it was observed, which indicated that this membrane was suitable for single use in the efficient recovery of Au(III) from hydrochloric acid solutions of electronic scrap or recycled jewelry.

40|$|The {{statistical}} evaluation of seven ion selective chemical sensors (ISE) for nitrate ion determination, based on polymeric membranes on a conductive support, {{has been carried}} out in this work. This was donw {{in order to determine the}} influence of ionophore concentration and that of solvent-mediator on the slope (S) and the practical detection limit (PDL). Tetradecilammonium nitrate (TDAN) was used as ionophore, polyvinylchloride (PVC) as matrix and seven plasticizers, namely, 3 -nitro-o-xylene (NOX),Tributylphosphate(TBP), Bis (2 -ethylhexyl) sebacate (DOS), o-Ntrophenyloctyl ether (o-NPOE), Tris - 2 ethyl-hexylphosphate (TEHP), <b>Dioctylphthalate</b> (DOP) and Dibutylphthalate (DBP) as solvent-mediators (SM). The amount of PVC employed was 29 % by weight in all sensors while three different concentration of SM and that of ionophore was used. All constructed sensors presented Nernstian slopes with values of the Practical detection Limit (PDL) and Lower Limit on Linear Response (LLLR) in the range 10 - 6 - 10 - 5 mol/dm 3. The sensitivity of the sensors was found to be independent from composition but the values pf PDL changes with the composition of the membrane. The selectivity coefficient on the electrode constructed by using 7 % by weight of ionophore for an interfering anion with concentration of 10 - 2 mol/dm 3 was determined by using the method of additions. The principal intgesssrfering anions were found to be CIO- 3, BrO- 3, Br-, Cl- and Bz- (benzoate) ...|$|E
40|$|Supercritical fluid {{extraction}} (SFE) using unmodified {{carbon dioxide}} has been explored {{as an alternative}} method for the extraction of semivolatile organic compounds from high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. HEPA filters provide {{the final stage of}} containment on many exhaust systems in US Department of Energy (DOE) facilities by preventing the escape of chemical and radioactive materials entrained in the exhausted air. The efficiency of the filters is tested by the manufacturer and DOE using <b>dioctylphthalate</b> (DOP), a substance regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Therefore, the filters must be analyzed for semivolatile organics before disposal. Ninety-eight acid, base, and neutral semivolatile organics were spiked onto blank HEPA material and extracted using SFE, Soxhlet, automated Soxhlet, and sonication techniques. The SFE conditions were optimized using a Dionex SFE- 703 instrument. Average recoveries for the 98 semivolatile compounds are 82. 7 % for Soxhlet, 74. 0 % for sonication, 70. 2 % for SFE, and 62. 9 % for Soxtec. Supercritical fluid extraction reduces the extraction solvent volume to 10 [...] 15 mL, a factor of 20 [...] 30 less than Soxhlet and more than 5 times less than Soxtec and sonication. Extraction times of 30 [...] 45 min are used compared to 16 [...] 18 h for Soxhlet extraction...|$|E
