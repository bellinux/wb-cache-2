50|$|In the 1980s the ÖGEG {{procured}} a Class 142 locomotive in Romania. This {{class was}} a 214 or 12 built under licence in Romania, {{the largest and}} most powerful steam locomotive of Austrian design. It was back in service by 1993. After the collapse of the Iron Curtain, numerous well-preserved German locomotives could be bought, particularly from Romania, but also in the former German Democratic Republic. As a result the society was criticised because funding was used to buy several German locomotives without any connexion to the railway history of Austria. These engines were however used commercially for special services with great success. On the retirement of older locomotives from the ÖBB in the early 1990s the ÖGEG also obtained many electric and <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
25|$|Objections {{were made}} against the closure, notably from the Kent County Council and Strood Rural District Council which {{challenged}} BR's method of calculating passenger numbers and losses. They {{argued that the}} figures (i) failed to consider cheaper methods of running the line such as using <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> <b>units,</b> closing minor halts, eliminating unnecessary journeys, the operation of direct summer excursions from London to Allhallows and the combination of passenger and goods services, (ii) took into account costs incurred for the line between Gravesend and Grain which would remain open for freight, (iii) included a figure of £5,000 which would be paid to Maidstone & District Motor Services for replacement bus services, (iv) failed {{to take into account}} holiday traffic - 2,812 passengers having used Allhallows on the Whitsun holiday of 3/6 June 1960, and (v) failed to record the 25% increase in passenger numbers or take into account the ongoing residential development in the area.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, under CIÉ management, the West Clare Railway became {{a pioneer in}} the use of <b>diesel</b> <b>traction.</b> Passenger {{services}} were largely operated by four new articulated diesel railcars, built by Walker Brothers of Wigan, England (almost identical to units built for the County Donegal Railways). These were followed by three diesel locomotives (also built by Walkers). The use of <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> reduced operating costs, yet the investment in new rolling stock would largely be wasted by the early closure of the line.|$|R

50|$|The KiHa 285 series train uses a new {{compound}} tilting system, which tilts {{the train}} vehicles {{by up to}} 8 degrees using a pendular system (tilt of up to 6 degrees) combined with air suspension tilting (tilt of up to 2 degrees). The train also uses a new motor-assisted ("MA") hybrid <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> system, which supplements conventional <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> with batteries, inverters, and electric motors. The train was designed to allow a maximum speed of 140 km/h even on curves. Total development costs for the train came to 2.5 billion yen.|$|R
5000|$|From the {{introduction}} of <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> {{on the line in}} the early 1960s, class 26 locomotives were used, followed later by class 37 locomotives. A writer in 1961 said that [...] "At present, <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> is used only for goods trains, and the Sunday morning newspaper train from Inverness to Lairg, which returns as a passenger train." [...] The general pattern of passenger operation was three trains daily, dividing (northbound) at Georgemas Junction, with one portion going to Thurso and one to Wick. Incidentally this rendered the passenger facility between the two terminals impracticable.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the results}} of the study were {{released}} October 17, 2011, by the citizens group High Speed Rail Canada, [...] it revealed results for two technology alternatives: <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> and electric <b>traction.</b> <b>Diesel</b> <b>traction</b> would provide speeds of 200 km/h and would cost $18.9 billion for an entire Windsor-Quebec City system; a Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto system would cost $9.1 billion. Electric traction would provide speeds of 300 km/h and would cost $21.3 billion for an entire Windsor-Quebec City system; a Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto system would cost $11 billion. The study further revealed that a Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto system is the most economically viable section and could generate a positive net economic benefit using either <b>diesel</b> or electric <b>traction.</b>|$|R

It reaches the surface beside the Rimutaka Rail Trail near the former route's Pakuratahi Tunnel. The 117 metre (380 ft) high shaft was constructed after tests showed that the tunnel would not generate enough natural ventilation if <b>diesel</b> <b>traction</b> was used through the tunnel. Originally it had been envisaged that electric traction would be used by extending the 1500-volt DC overhead electrification beyond Upper Hutt to either Featherston or Masterton, but economic studies favoured <b>diesel</b> <b>traction.</b>|$|R

Following the Privatisation of British Rail depot ownership transferred to EWS, now DB Schenker and continued as a base for <b>diesel</b> <b>traction,</b> latterly becoming a facility for storing surplus rolling stock.
