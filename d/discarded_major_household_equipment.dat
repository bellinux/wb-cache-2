40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} of household appliances and the division of labor in accomplishing household tasks in the family. It investigated the relationship between ownership of specific items of <b>household</b> <b>equipment</b> and the performance of directly related household tasks and the overall ownership of <b>household</b> <b>equipment</b> and the overall division of labor in the family. Data for this study came from 2 ̆ 2 Determinants and outcomes of Household Time Use, 2 ̆ 2 which is part of the S- 206 Regional Research Project. Data from 214 two-parent, two-child households were analyzed to determine the relationship between ownership of <b>household</b> <b>equipment</b> and time spent in three categories of household tasks by husbands, wives and children. Ownership of <b>household</b> <b>equipment</b> was determined by means of an equipment inventory. The ownership of appliances and their relationship to the performance of directly associated tasks included: (microwave oven and time spent in food preparation; (2) dishwasher and garbage disposal and time spent in dishwashing; and (3) power garden and/or yard equipment and power shop tools and time spent in maintenance of home, yard, car, and pets. The total time spent in household production by husbands, wives, children and its relationship to the total number of household appliances owned was also studied. The t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis were used to analyze the differences in proportion of time spent in the various household tasks by wives, husbands, and children by ownership of related <b>household</b> <b>equipment.</b> No significant differences were found in the proportion of time spent in food preparation, dishwashing, and maintenance by wives, husbands, and children in households that did and did not own the related <b>household</b> <b>equipment.</b> The correlation between level of equipment ownership and husbands 2 ̆ 7 and children 2 ̆ 7 s proportion of total family time spent in household work was not significant indicating that as more equipment is acquired husbands and children do not contribute a smaller proportion of total family time in household work...|$|R

40|$|The National Committee on <b>Household</b> <b>Equipment</b> Research {{under the}} {{leadership}} of the Bureau of Home Economics, has been working 2 ̆ 7 for several years on test specifications for various household appliances, so that the several investigators in the field may be able to follow similar methods in testing equipment and have a basis for comparing results. Since research in the field of <b>household</b> <b>equipment</b> is of comparative recent date, very little data are available. It is necessary, therefore, to test the performance of appliances before test specifications can be set up and agreed upon. The present investigation was carried on for the purpose of obtaining necessary data for setting up test specifications for the electric roaster. The electric roaster is an appliance which provides many of the services of a range at much lower initial cost, with the added advantage of occupying comparatively small space and deriving current from a convenience outlet. The roaster is a recent addition to <b>household</b> <b>equipment.</b> There were, therefore, no established methods for testing it. Since the roaster is similar in many ways to the electric range oven it was considered feasible to used standard oven tests as a basis for developing methods for testing the roaster. The following discussion is divided into two parts. The first is a description of procedure followed in checking the empty performance of certain roasters to determine desirable tests methods. The second part records results of actual cooking operations...|$|R
