40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} chlorhexidine release from unfilled non-solvated methacrylate-based resins of increasing hydrophilicity and to examine relationships among Hoy's solubility parameters, water sorption, solubility and the rate of chlorhexidine release. Methods: Resin discs were prepared from light-cured, experimental <b>resin</b> blends (<b>R</b> 1, R 2, R 3, R 4 and R 5) containing 0. 0, 0. 2, 1. 0 and 2. 0 wt. % chlorhexidine diacetate (CDA). Discs were immersed in distilled water at 37 °C, and mass changes were recorded at different periods. Spectral measurements were made to follow change in optical densities of storage solution to examine chlorhexidine release kinetics. After a 28 -day period, water sorption, solubility, and the cumulative chlorhexidine release were obtained. Additionally, antibacterial study was performed by observing the presence of inhibition zone against Streptococcus mutans. Results: The most hydrophilic <b>resin</b> (<b>R</b> 5) exhibited the highest chlorhexidine release rate. The most hydrophobic <b>resin</b> (<b>R</b> 1) exhibited the lowest rate. However, no inhibition zone was produced by any specimens stored in water for 2 weeks. The addition of CDA increased solubility significantly but had no effect on water sorption. Significant positive correlations were seen between water sorption and the cumulative chlorhexidine release. Significance: Chlorhexidine release from resins may be related to water-induced swelling, which in turn is enhanced by the hydrophilicity of cured polymer matrix. © 2008 Academy of Dental Materials. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

The {{results showed that}} both zeolite and ion-exchange resin were effective (up to 87 % of removal) in eliminating ammonia from aqueous solution. Factorial design and response surface methodology were applied to evaluate and optimize the effects of pH, dose, contact time, temperature and initial ammonia concentration. Low pH condition was preferred with the optimum pH found to be 6 for both zeolite and ion-exchange resin. High dose generated high removal rate and low exchange capacity. Results of factorial design and response surface methodology showed that temperature {{was not a significant}} parameter. The model prediction was in good agreement with observed data (R 2 = 0. 969 for zeolite and R 2 = 0. 957 for resin, respectively). For zeolite, the optimum Qe was 22. 90 mg/g achieved at pH= 7 and initial ammonia concentration of 3000 mg/L.

40|$|Rotenone and rotenoid-containing botanicals, {{important}} insecticides {{and fish}} poisons, {{are reported to}} have anticancer activity in rats and mice. The toxic action of rotenone is attributed to inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity and the purported cancer chemopreventive effect of deguelin analogs {{has been associated with}} inhibition of phorbol ester-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. This study defines a possible relationship between these two types of activity important in evaluating the toxicology of rotenoid pesticides and the suitability of the anticancer model. Fractionation of cubé resin (the commercial rotenoid pesticide) establishes that the activity in both assays is due primarily to rotenone (IC 50 = 0. 8 – 4 nM), secondarily to deguelin, and in small part to rotenolone and tephrosin. In addition, the potency of 29 rotenoids from cubé insecticide for inhibiting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase in vitro assayed with bovine heart electron transport particles satisfactorily predicts their potency in vivo in the induced ODC assay using noncytotoxic rotenoid concentrations with cultured MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells (r = 0. 86). Clearly the molecular features of rotenoids essential for inhibiting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase are similar to those for blocking ODC induction. This apparent correlation extends to 11 flavonoids and stilbenoids from cubé <b>resin</b> (<b>r</b> = 0. 98) and genistein and resveratrol except for lower potency and less selectivity than the rotenoids relative to cytotoxicity. These findings on cubé insecticide constituents and our earlier study comparing rotenone and pyridaben miticide indicate that inhibition of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity lowers the level of induced ODC activity leading to the antiproliferative effect and anticancer action...|$|R

Methods: Four commercial adhesives were selected along with their solvent-monomer combination: the bonding resins were of Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose (MP) and Clearfil SE Bond (SE) systems, and the "one-bottle" systems, Adper Single Bond (SB) and Excite (EX). Five experimental methacrylate-based resins of known hydrophilicities (R 1, R 2, R 3, R 4 and R 5) were used as reference materials. Specimen disks were prepared by dispensing the uncured resin into a mould (5. 8 mm × 0. 8 mm). After desiccation, the cured specimens were weighed and then stored in distilled water for evaluation of the water diffusion kinetics over a 28 -day period. Results: Resin composition and hydrophilicity (ranked by their Hoy's solubility parameters) influenced water sorption, solubility and water diffusion in both commercial and experimental dental resins. The most hydrophilic experimental <b>resin,</b> <b>R</b> 5, showed the highest water sorption, solubility and water diffusion coefficient. Among the commercial adhesives, the solvated systems, SB and EX, showed water sorption, solubility and water diffusion coefficients significantly greater than those observed for the non-solvated systems, MP and SE (p < 0. 05). In general, the extent and rate of water sorption increased with the hydrophilicity of the resin blends. Significance: The extensive amount of water sorption in the current hydrophilic dental resins is a cause of concern.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{measuring}} the concentration of {{carbon dioxide in the}} expired air, based on the variation of the gas in water, is described. The sensitivity of the basic instrument is such that it is able to measure parts per million but is non-linear above 1 % carbon dioxide. The construction of a modified instrument to produce a linear output between 0 - 10 % carbon dioxide is described. In 1865 Tyndall delivered a paper in which he stated that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the expired air could be measured by the amount by which it absorbed infra-red radiation. Although many improvements have been incorporated since that date, the method outlined by Tyndall remains the most commonly used method of measuring the carbon dioxide content of the air. A typical com-mercially available instrument has a full-scale deflection of 10 %, an accuracy of ± 1 % of the full-scale deflection, and an overall response time of about 1. 5 sec, {{depending on the size of}} the sample tube used. This paper describes a new method based on an idea first published in a letter from James (1972) which considerably increased the clinical use of the first instrument as it is potentially cheaper, smaller and easier to use. In his letter, James pointed out that the amount by which de-ionized water increased its conduc-tivity when a gas was bubbled through it was pro-portional to the amount of gas which dissolved in the water to form ions.

Bitumens forming very small droplets show a homogeneous surface without microphase separation. Bitumens are divided into four solubility groups: Saturates (S), aromatics (A), <b>resins</b> (<b>R)</b> and asphaltenes; Each group consits of mixtures of different substances with different structural characteristics itself. Nevertheless, these phases are homogeneously dispersed in very good emulsifiable bitumens. On AFM images of phase-separated bitumens one can distinguish several phases. First, these are island-like domains, which are formed from the agglomeration of asphaltene flakes. These islands are surrounded by a halo, which is composed of low molecular weight paraffins (C- 15 to C- 17) and the resin phase. The asphalt islands are higher molecular weight paraffins (C- 20 to C- 23), which crystallize in the so-called wavy Catanas. The islands are located in the maltene phase, which consists of saturated, aromatic and resin phase molecules. The degree of dispersion of the asphaltenes depends on their ability to stabilize the bitumen, which in turn is determined by the molecular structure. Asphaltenes consist fundamentaly of a polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and aliphatic groups which are substituted at the aromatic nucleus. In addition to different aromaticity and molecular weight the polarity of the fractions, or molecules promotes phase separation also. The polar or polarizable groups in bitumens are the <b>resin</b> fraction (<b>R)</b> and especially the asphaltene fraction (A). The polarity of these molecules comes from their aromatic skeleton with free π-electrons {{on the one hand and}} on the other hand from heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen. In the formulation of emulsions, these two fractions are taken particularly due to their surface activity. The key role is played by the asphaltenes, as they assemble irreversible at the oil-water interface. That is contrary to the resins and external surfactants. In experiments with the drop tensiometer it turned out that the surface activity of the polar substances in the bitumen depends on their solubility in the bitumen itself more than on hydrophilic groups for example carbonylic acid groups. The asphaltenes from a very well emulsifiable bitumen are in both solvents toluene and heptane mixed with toluene (70 : 30), the most surface active fraction. They do not aggregate; neither in aromatic nor in aliphatic solvents. These asphaltenes are perfect phase mediator between the aromatic and saturated phase, i. e. they are able to disperse the bitumen constituents in the interfacial film and in the bitumen itself as well. The interfacial films were characterized by TEM. Will the asphaltenes be extracted from the well emulsifiable bitumen, separations occur at the interface. For the less emulsifiable bitumens the resins are more surface active than their corresponding asphaltenes. This leads to a separation of the asphaltenes at the interface and therefore to an inhomogeneous interfacial fim. The inhomogeneity of the interfacial films leads to increased coagulation of the Bitumen droplets, which finally causes droplet coalescence and large average droplet sizes. From these results it can be concluded that a bitumen that shows phase separation at the surface is not able to form a homogeneous interface also. By adding asphaltene disperson agents (e. g. dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid) to a phase separated bitumen a homogenization of the interface of its emulsion droplets occurred. Consequently small-scale bitumen emulsions from originally not emulsifiable bitumens are produced (d (50) = 0. 6 microns). Bitumen preferably forms W/O emulsions. By making such a bitumen emulsion and subsequent inversion in the same emulsifying prosess with the help of two surfactants (low HLB and high HLB) very small, but less stable, mean droplet sizes (d (50) = 0. 7 microns) could be achieved in this work also...|$|R

Dragon's blood has a number of traditional medical uses, although dragon's blood obtained from Dracaena draco was not known until the 15th century, and analyses suggest that most dragon's blood used in art was obtained from species of the genus Daemonorops. The primary and secondary plant body are the site of the secretory plant tissues that form dragon's blood. These tissues include ground parenchyma cells and cortex cells. Dragon's blood from Dracaena draco and Dracaena cinnabari can be distinguished by differences in 10 compounds and a dominant flavonoid DrC11 missing in Dracaena draco.|$|R

B.), in various proportions, were cured with {{hexamethylenetetramine}} (HTA) and pyrolyzed up to 900 degrees C. The pyrolysis mechanism was monitored using TGA and gas chromatography. The pyrolysis regions, {{as well as}} important pyrolysis parameters of the materials used, were determined. Cured and pyrolyzed composites of N. R. /OL. B. varied from 20 / 80 to 75 / 25, exhibiting at temperatures up to approx. 600 degrees C lower weight losses than expected by the rule of mixtures, owing to additional cross linkages of lignin with HTA. This stabilization effect vanished during pyrolysis at higher temperatures because of the breaking of other chemical bonds, e. g. cross linkages. The release of CH, during the pyrolysis of OL. B. {{is derived from the}} lignin contained in OL. B. The other gases, CO, CO 2 and H- 2, could be formed from celluose, hemicellulose and lignin which are the main components of OL. B. The use of N.

E. <b>R</b> 332), which is mainly used as {{filament}} winding, electrical laminates and encapsulation applications, {{was used as}} a host. The epoxy resins were loaded with nano-SiO 2 and nano-BN in different loading concentrations, and then test of the AC/DC breakdown strength has been performed. It has been observed that the presence of untreated nano-fillers will decrease the AC/DC breakdown strength of nanocomposites. This may be caused by field enhancement resulting from agglomeration of un-treated nano-fillers. The influence of filler concentration and surface treatment, especially the filler type, of particles on AC, DC breakdown strength and space charge has been investigated. Moreover, it has been widely recognised that the presence of moisture in nanocomposites has detrimental effect on the electrical performance. Therefore, the water absorption of epoxy nanocomposites and its impact on electrical performance has also been considered...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare microhardness of resin cements under different thicknesses of zirconia and the light transmittance of zirconia as a function of thickness. Study design: A total of 126 disc-shaped specimens (2 mm in height and 5 mm in diameter) were prepared from dual-cured resin cements (RelyX Unicem, Panavia F and Clearfil SA cement). Photoactivation was performed by using quartz tungsten halogen and light emitting diode light curing units under different thicknesses of zirconia. Then the specimens (n= 7 /per group) were stored in dry conditions in total dark at 37 °C for 24 h. The Vicker's hardness test was performed on the resin cement layer with a microhardness tester. Statistical significance was determined using multifactorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) (alpha=. 05). Light transmittance of different thick - nesses of zirconia (0. 3, 0. 5 and 0. 8 mm) was measured using a hand-held radiometer (Demetron, Kerr). Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA test (alpha=. 05). Results: ANOVA revealed that resin cement and light curing unit had significant effects on microhardness (p < 0. 001). Additionally, greater zirconia thickness resulted in lower transmittance. There was no correlation between the amount of light transmitted and microhardness of dual-cured <b>resin</b> cements (<b>r</b> = 0. 073, p = 0. 295). Conclusion: Although different zirconia thicknesses might result in insufficient light transmission, dual-cured resin cements under zirconia restorations could have adequate microhardnes...|$|R
40|$|Expanded bed {{adsorption}} (EBA) is an integrative step in {{downstream processing}} allowing the direct capture of target proteins from cell-containing feedstocks. Extensive co-adsorption of biomass, however, may hamper {{the application of}} this technique. The latter is especially observed at anion exchange processes as cells or cell debris are negatively charged under common anion exchange conditions. The restrictions observed under these conditions are, however, directly related to processing steps prior to fluidised bed application. In this study, it could be shown that the effective surface charge of cell debris obtained during homogenisation {{is closely related to}} the debris size and thus to the homogenisation method and conditions. The amount and thus effect of cells binding to the adsorbent could be significantly decreased when optimising the homogenisation step not only towards optimal product release but towards a reduction of debris size and charge. The lower size and charge of the debris results not only in a reduced retention probability but also, in a lower collision probability between debris and adsorbent. The applicability was shown in an example where the homogenisation conditions of E. coli were optimised towards EBA applications. In a previous report (Reichert et al., 2001) studying the suitability of EBA for the capture of formate dehydrogenate from E. coli homogenate the pseudo affinity <b>resin</b> Streamline <b>Red</b> was identified as the only suitable adsorbent. The new approach, however, led to a system where anion exchange as capture step became possible, however, to the cost of binding capacity...|$|R
40|$|Foram avaliadas diferentes formas de glazeamento da superfície de porcelana quanto à resistência ao cisalhamento de bráquetes metálicos colados com diferentes cimentos. Quarenta e dois corpos de prova de metalocerâmica foram confeccionados (2 controles) e divididos em quatro grupos de acordo com o tipo de glazeamento, com camada extra de glaze (G) ou auto-glazeados (AG), e o cimento utilizado, resina fotopolimerizável (r) ou ionômero de vidro resinosos (i), formando os seguintes grupos: Gr, Gi, AGr e AGi com 10 corpos de prova cada grupo. Todas as superfícies dos corpos de prova receberam tratamento com ácido fosfórico 35 % por 30 s seguidos de uma camada de silano. Quarenta bráquetes metálicos foram colados. Os corpos de prova foram submetidos a termociclagem e ao teste de resistência ao cisalhamento com uma máquina {{universal}} de ensaios mecânicos. Uma amostra de cada grupo após descolagem, remoção da resina e polimento, foi avaliado em microscópio eletrônico de varredura. O índice de fratura coesiva da porcelana foi também avaliado. Os resultados mostram valores acima da média aceitável na literatura para todos os grupos, sendo que o grupo AGr apresentou valor menor (10, 38 MPa) e estatisticamente significativo em relação aos demais. A análise no microscópio eletrônico de varredura mostrou que as superfícies, após polimento, não readquirem as características de antes da colagem, apesar de se apresentarem aceitáveis clinicamente. Houve fratura da porcelana em todos os grupos. Conclui-se que é possível se conseguir colagem adequada de bráquetes metálicos em superfícies metalocerâmicas auto-glazeadas e com camada extra de glaze, preservando-o, não necessitando reconhecer previamente a forma de glazeamento. Different glazing {{techniques for}} porcelain surface were evaluated {{in terms of}} shear bond strength of metallic brackets bonded with different cements. Forty-two metal-ceramic samples were made (2 controls) and then divided into four groups according to type of glazing technique, either using extra glaze layer (G) or self-glazing material (SG), and type of adhesive material, that is, self-curing <b>resin</b> (<b>r)</b> or <b>resin</b> glass-ionomer cement (i), thus forming the following groups: Gr, Gi, SGr, and SGi with 10 samples each. The whole surface of all samples was treated with 35 % phosphoric acid for 30 s, followed by application of silane layer. Forty metallic brackets were bonded. The samples were submitted to thermocycling process and shear bond strength test with a universal testing machine. After bracket debonding, removal of resin, and polishing, one sample from each group was evaluated with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The index of cohesive porcelain fracture was also assessed. The results show that all the groups had, on average, values higher than {{those found in the}} literature, with AGr presenting the lowest value (10. 38 MPa) compared to other groups. SEM analysis showed that the porcelain surfaces did not recover their original characteristics before the bracket debonding procedure, although they were considered acceptable for clinical use. Porcelain fracture was observed in all groups. One can conclude {{that it is possible to}} bond metallic brackets adequately to metal-ceramic porcelain surfaces previously treated with either self-glazing material or extra glaze layer without having to recognise the glazing technique originally employed...|$|R
