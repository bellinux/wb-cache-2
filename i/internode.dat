5|$|Fractals are {{infinitely}} self-similar, iterated mathematical constructs having fractal dimension. Infinite iteration is {{not possible}} in nature so all 'fractal' patterns are only approximate. For example, the leaves of ferns and umbellifers (Apiaceae) are only self-similar (pinnate) to 2, 3 or 4 levels. Fern-like growth patterns occur in plants and in animals including bryozoa, corals, hydrozoa like the air fern, Sertularia argentea, and in non-living things, notably electrical discharges. Lindenmayer system fractals can model different patterns of tree growth by varying {{a small number of}} parameters including branching angle, distance between nodes or branch points (<b>internode</b> length), and number of branches per branch point.|$|E

40|$|The {{intensity}} of ethylene emission in growing maize stem <b>internodes</b> is studied. The most intensive ethylene biosynthesis in maize <b>internodes</b> is ascertained {{for the early}} stages of development (5 leaves), and the least intensive one - for older stages (a ﬂowering of panicle). So, during the maize development, the high and low levels of ethylene accumulation are typical of, respectively, rapidly growing top <b>internodes</b> and lower <b>internodes...</b>|$|R

40|$|This work {{examined}} cell composition gradients in maturing tillers of switchgrass (Panicum virgatuln L.) {{with the}} aim of developing baseline information on this important forage and biomass crop. Flowering tillers were collected from plants raised from seeds in a greenhouse and field, harvested at soil level and separated into <b>internodes</b> beginning with the node subtending the peduncle. <b>Internodes</b> were analyzed using microscopy, by fiber digestion, high-performance liquid chromatography and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to obtain anatomical and compositional data. Microscopy demonstrated the development and maturation of cortical fibers which eventually became confluent with the fiber sheath surrounding vascular bundles in the lower <b>internodes.</b> Detergent fiber analysis indicated increasing cellulose and lignin contents and decreases in cell solubles and hemicelluloses with increasing distance of the <b>internodes</b> {{from the top of the}} plant. Soluble phenolics were greatest in amounts and complexity in top <b>internodes.</b> The lower <b>internodes</b> contained greater levels of wall-bound phenolic acids, principally as 4 -coumarate and ferulate...|$|R

25|$|Beyond spring frost, {{the other}} {{viticulture}} hazard that growers {{have to worry}} about is court-noué (also known as roncet) which is a virus transmitted from vine to vine by nematodes that causes the vine to develop small leaves with short <b>internode</b> segments. This can impact a vine's ability to receive adequate foliage coverage to capture the sunlight needed to complete photosynthesis. Another hazard that Chardonnay is particularly susceptible to is oidium/powdery mildew.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{study was to}} assess the rate of water loss from the strings of vines in {{relation}} to <b>internodes</b> position on vine chords and degree of wood maturity. The biological material was represented by Burgund vine cultivar, to which were analyzed individually all <b>internodes</b> distributed on the chord length (<b>internodes</b> number IN 2 - 19). The rate of water loss and associated parameters (maximum rate of water loss - RWLMax, total drying time - T, time to achieve RWLMax - tRWLMax) were determined from the Burgund vine cultivar, in controlled condition. Parameters studied were associated with dry matter content (refractometric method), degree of maturity of the wood, and <b>internodes</b> positions on chord. RWL Max had higher values in the basal <b>internodes</b> (IN 2; RWL Max = 0. 252 ± 0. 005 g/min) and lower in the apical <b>internodes</b> (IN 17 - 19; RWLMax = 0. 202 ± 0. 011 g/min). RWLMax distributions values, according to the position of <b>internodes</b> on chord was described by a third degree polynomial function, statistical safety (R 2 = 0. 949, p< 0. 01). Dry substance content in <b>internodes</b> (sugar) was correlated with the total time of water loss (T; R 2 = 0. 945), the time to reach the maximum rate of water loss (tRWLMax; R 2 = 0. 855), and maximum rate of water loss (RWLMax; R 2 = 0. 984) ...|$|R
60|$|The tendrils {{themselves}} also spontaneously revolve. The movement begins whilst the tendril is young, and is {{at first}} slow. The mature tendrils of Bignonia littoralis move much slower than the <b>internodes.</b> Generally, the <b>internodes</b> and tendrils revolve together at the same rate; in Cissus, Cobaea, and most Passiflorae, the tendrils alone revolve; in other cases, as with Lathyrus aphaca, only the <b>internodes</b> move, carrying with them the motionless tendrils; and, lastly (and {{this is the fourth}} possible case), neither <b>internodes</b> nor tendrils spontaneously revolve, as with Lathyrus grandiflorus and Ampelopsis. In most Bignonias, Eccremocarpus Mutisia, and the Fumariaceae, the <b>internodes,</b> petioles and tendrils all move harmoniously together. In every case the conditions of life must be favourable in order that the different parts should act in a perfect manner.|$|R

25|$|In the {{clinical}} setting, {{the function of}} the <b>internode</b> can only be explored by excitability studies (see Measurement). Experimental observations utilizing threshold measurements to assess excitability of myelinated nerve fibers have indicated that the function of regenerated internodes indeed remains persistently abnormal, with regenerated motor axons displaying increased rheobase and decreased chronaxie—changes that are consistent with abnormal active membrane properties. These studies have furthermore determined that activity-dependent conduction block in myelination was due to hyperpolarization, as well as abnormally increased Na+ currents and increased availability of fast K+ rectifiers. Listed below are findings on the changes in nerve excitability, and therefore the strength-duration time constant, that have been observed within several of the most pervasive nerve disorders.|$|E

40|$|Secondary {{generation}} biofuels such as {{cellulosic biofuels}} rely on {{large portions of}} cellulosic bioresources, which may include forests, perennial grasses, wood and agricultural residues. Switchgrass is one promising feedstock for biofuel production. In the present study, thesis work focused on the chemical and structural profiles and hydrothermal pretreatment of switchgrass. Four populations of switchgrass were investigated for their chemical properties among populations and morphological portions, including the compositions of lignin and carbohydrates, extractives content, higher heating value (HHV), and syringyl:guaiacyl (S:G) ratio. The results demonstrate similar chemical profiles and lignin structure among the four populations of switchgrass. Morphological fractions of switchgrass including leaves, <b>internodes,</b> and nodes differ significantly in chemical profiles and S:G ratios of lignin. The structure of isolated cellulose from switchgrass SW 9 is similar between leaves and <b>internodes.</b> The structure of isolated lignin from leaves and <b>internodes</b> of switchgrass SW 9 differs in S:G ratio and molecular weight. Hydrothermal pretreatment of leaves and <b>internodes</b> indicates that a similar chemical composition and chemical structure for pretreated leaves and <b>internodes.</b> The degree of polymerization (DP) for cellulose of the pretreated <b>internodes</b> is 23. 4 % {{greater than that of}} the pretreated leaves. The accessibility of pretreated leaves measured by Simons' Staining technique is greater than that of pretreated <b>internodes.</b> Pretreated leaves have a 32. 5 - 33. 8 % greater cellulose-to-glucose conversion yield than do pretreated <b>internodes.</b> Ph.

25|$|Philodendrons {{have both}} aerial and {{subterranean}} roots. The aerial roots occur in many {{shapes and sizes}} and originate {{from most of the}} plant's nodes or occasionally from an <b>internode.</b> The size and number of aerial roots per node depends on the presence of a suitable substrate for the roots to attach themselves. Aerial roots serve two primary purposes. They allow the philodendron to attach itself to a tree or other plant, and they allow it to collect water and nutrients. As such, the roots are divided morphologically into these two categories. Aerial roots used for attaching to trees tend to be shorter, more numerous, and sometimes have a layer of root hairs attached; those used for collecting water and nutrients tend to be thicker and longer. These feeder roots tend to attach flush with the substrate to which the philodendron is attached, and make their way directly downwards in search of soil. In general, feeder roots tend to show both positive hydrotropic and negative heliotropic behaviors. Characteristic of roots in philodendrons is the presence of a sclerotic hypodermis, which are cylindrical tubes inside the epidermis that can be one to five cells long. The cells that line the sclerotic hypodermis are elongated and tend to be hardened. Underneath the epidermis is a unique layer of cells in a pattern of long cells followed by short cells.|$|E

40|$|The {{lengths of}} <b>internodes</b> on {{peripheral}} and central {{stretches of the}} same ventral motoneuron axons were measured in 6 day rats. The former were {{more than twice as}} long as the latter. The distribution of peripheral internodal lengths was broader, and was shifted to the right, relative to that of central <b>internodes.</b> Short <b>internodes</b> were present centrally and peripherally throughout the early period of rapid myelination occurring immediately after birth. All such <b>internodes</b> appeared normal centrally, as did a proportion found peripherally. Some peripheral examples appeared to be degenerating. Evidence is presented suggesting that some short <b>internodes,</b> both peripherally and centrally, increase in length to achieve a normal appearance. Many central stretches of central motoneuron axons which were myelinated at some levels, at other levels possessed unmyelinated segments covered by numberous short glial processes. Such bare stretches commonly occurred immediately deep to the cord surface. The lengths of the unmyelinated stretches decreased as age advanced, perhpas due to the extension of adjacent myelinated segments along them...|$|R
