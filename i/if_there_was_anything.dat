5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> in Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E

He had earlier said that he remained convinced that the fire was “undoubtedly” started by accident by a discarded match or cigarette, despite the new evidence.|$|E
25|$|Later Krishna told Arjuna how {{he could}} bring down Bhishma, through the help of Sikhandhi. The Pandavas were {{initially}} not agreeable to such a ploy, as by using such cheap tactics {{they would not be}} following the path of Dharma, but Krishna suggested a clever alternative. And thus, on the next day, the tenth day of battle Shikhandi accompanied Arjuna on the latter's chariot and they faced Bhishma who put his bow and arrows down. He was then felled in battle by Arjuna, pierced by innumerable arrows. Using Sikhandhi as a shield, Arjuna shot arrows at Bhishma, piercing his entire body. Thus, as was preordained (Mahadeva's boon to Amba that she would be the cause of Bhishma's death) Shikhandi, that is, Amba reincarnated was the cause of Bhishma's fall. As Bhishma fell, his whole body was held above the ground by the shafts of Arjuna's arrows which protruded from his back, and through his arms and legs. Seeing Bhishma lying on such a bed of arrows humbled even the gods who watched from the heavens in reverence. They silently blessed the mighty warrior. When the young princes of both armies gathered around him, inquiring <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> they could do, he told them that while his body lay on the bed of arrows above the ground, his head hung unsupported. Hearing this, many of the princes, both Kaurava and the Pandava alike brought him pillows of silk and velvet, but he refused them. He asked Arjuna to give him a pillow fit for a warrior. Arjuna then removed three arrows from his quiver and placed them underneath Bhishma's head, the pointed arrow tips facing upwards. To quench the war veteran's thirst, Arjuna shot an arrow into the earth, and a jet stream of water rose up and into Bhishma's mouth. It is said that Ganga herself rose to quench her son's thirst.|$|E

He had just adjourned the session {{for the day and}} was preparing to have a drink in House Speaker Sam Rayburn's office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House. Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage.

500|$|The Beatles {{auditioned for}} Martin on 6 June 1962, in studio three at the Abbey Road studios. Ron Richards and his {{engineer}} Norman Smith recorded four songs, which Martin (who {{was not present}} during the recording) listened to {{at the end of}} the session. The verdict was not promising, however, as Richards complained about Pete Best's drumming, and Martin thought their original songs were simply not good enough. Martin asked the individual Beatles <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> they personally did not like, to which George Harrison replied, [...] "Well, there's your tie, for a start." [...] That was the turning point, according to Smith, as John Lennon and Paul McCartney joined in with jokes and comic wordplay, that made Martin think that he should sign them to a contract for their wit alone.|$|E
500|$|Other {{evidence}} has surfaced illustrating Mölders' ambiguous {{relationship with the}} National Socialist regime. Mölders {{may have been in}} contact with bishop Clemens August Graf von Galen, who was highly critical of the Nazi regime. Von Galen publicly criticised the regime for the Gestapo's tactics and the deportation and euthanasia of the mentally ill. According to the diary kept by Heinrich Portmann, von Galen's secretary and chaplain, Mölders threatened to return his awards if von Galen's euthanasia accusation turned out to be true. Furthermore, Portmann stated that Hitler had asked Mölders during the presentation of the Diamonds to the Knight's Cross <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> he wished for. Mölders reportedly responded, [...] "Please leave the bishop of Münster alone." [...] Hitler assured him that [...] "Yes, nothing will happen to the bishop of Münster." [...] The MGFA concluded in 2004 that this story was most likely false. The MGFA revised its position again on 28 June 2007, concluding that there had been contact between Mölders and von Galen.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{recording}} contract was signed, the Beatles performed a [...] "commercial test" [...] (i.e. {{an evaluation of}} a signed artist) on 6 June 1962 in studio two at the Abbey Road studios. Assistant producer Ron Richards and his engineer Norman Smith recorded four songs: [...] "Bésame Mucho", [...] "P.S. I Love You", [...] "Ask Me Why" [...] and [...] "Love Me Do". The last three songs were the Beatles' own compositions, which was very unusual for bands new to recording. Martin was in the building {{but not in the}} studio. Martin was called into the studio by Norman Smith when he heard the band play [...] "Love Me Do". At {{the end of the session}} Martin asked the individual Beatles <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> they personally did not like, to which George Harrison replied, [...] "Well, there's your tie, for a start."

[...] On her {{response}} that she knew probably as much as any girl of eighteen, he invited her out the next evening for what she presumed would be some advice. [...] Instead, he drove her [...] west of town on Highway 16 and parked on a side road before asking her to have sex with him. [...] He said that he had been madly in love with her from the start, that he was lonely, {{that he and his wife}} had not lived together as man and wife in a long time, that his wife (an invalid) would be endangered by a pregnancy, and that he could not be premier any longer unless MacMillan agreed to have sex with him. [...] He told her that if she refused him, he would be forced to resume his sexual relationship with his wife, and that this would likely kill her. [...] MacMillan reacted fearfully, and asked <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>anything</b> else she could do to help Brownlee and his wife; he replied that there was not.|$|E

According to John Murdoch (1894), the brooch had been given by Mrs. Hume to her daughter who had given it to a man she admired. Blavatsky had happened to meet the man in Bombay and obtained the brooch in return for money. Blavatsky allegedly planted it in the garden before directing people to the location through what she claimed as occult techniques.|$|E
