5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called <b>heterosis,</b> hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, George Harrison Shull {{described}} <b>heterosis,</b> {{also known}} as hybrid vigor. <b>Heterosis</b> describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. The detection of the usefulness of <b>heterosis</b> for plant breeding {{has led to the}} development of inbred lines that reveal a heterotic yield advantage when they are crossed. Maize was the first species where <b>heterosis</b> was widely used to produce hybrids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heterosis,</b> or {{hybrid vigor}} {{associated}} with historical reductions of {{the levels of}} inbreeding, has been proposed by Michael Mingroni as an alternative explanation of the Flynn effect. However, James Flynn {{has pointed out that}} even if everyone mated with a sibling in 1900, subsequent increases in <b>heterosis</b> would not be a sufficient explanation of the observed IQ gains.|$|E
25|$|Bryophytes {{reproduce}} sexually, but {{the larger}} and commonly-seen organisms are haploid and produce gametes. The gametes fuse {{to form a}} zygote which develops into a sporangium, which in turn produces haploid spores. The diploid stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. haploid dominance. The advantage of diploidy, <b>heterosis,</b> only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction {{despite the fact that}} the haploid stage does not benefit from <b>heterosis.</b> This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than <b>heterosis,</b> such as genetic recombination between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the population more able to survive environmental variation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heterosis</b> in rice, three-line hybrid rice system: A team of {{agricultural}} scientists headed by Yuan Longping applied <b>heterosis</b> to rice, developing the three-line hybrid rice system in 1973. The innovation allowed for roughly 12,000kg (26,450lbs) of rice to be grown per hectare (10,000 m2). Hybrid rice {{has proven to}} be greatly beneficial in areas where there is little arable land, and has been adopted by several Asian and African countries. Yuan won the 2004 Wolf Prize in agriculture for his work.|$|E
25|$|Dominance versus overdominance. In applied {{genetics}} (selective {{and agricultural}} breeding), this controversy has reflected the century-long {{debate over whether}} dominance or overdominance provides the best explanation for <b>heterosis</b> (hybrid vigor).|$|E
25|$|Wolf-dog hybrids are {{generally}} {{said to be}} naturally healthy animals, and are affected by fewer inherited diseases than most breeds of dog. Wolfdogs are usually healthier than either parent due to <b>heterosis.</b> Some of the established breeds of wolfdog that exist today were bred specifically to improve the health and vigor of working dogs.|$|E
25|$|Attempted {{explanations}} {{have included}} improved nutrition, {{a trend toward}} smaller families, better education, greater environmental complexity, and <b>heterosis</b> (the occurrence of offspring with more pronounced phenotypical traits from mixing the genes of its parents). Another proposition is the gradual spread of test-taking skills. The Flynn effect has been too rapid for genetic selection to be the cause.|$|E
25|$|Silkworms {{were first}} domesticated in China over 5,000 years ago. Since then, the silk {{production}} {{capacity of the}} species has increased nearly tenfold. The silkworm {{is one of the}} few organisms wherein the principles of genetics and breeding were applied to harvest maximum output. It is second only to maize in exploiting the principles of <b>heterosis</b> and cross breeding.|$|E
25|$|Some {{crossbred}} dogs, {{created by}} breeding two purebred dogs of different breeds, {{may have the}} advantage of <b>heterosis,</b> or crossbreed vigor. This advantage can be progressively diluted when two crossbreeds are bred in the attempt to create a breed, narrowing the gene pool. The best way to continue taking advantage of crossbreed vigor is from the breeding of dogs with genetic diversity.|$|E
25|$|In {{agriculture}} and horticulture pollination management, a good pollenizer is {{a plant that}} provides compatible, viable and plentiful pollen and blooms {{at the same time}} as the plant that is to be pollinated or has pollen that can be stored and used when needed to pollinate the desired flowers. Hybridization is effective pollination between flowers of different species, or between different breeding lines or populations. see also <b>Heterosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{hypotheses}} for {{the origins}} of sex are difficult to test experimentally (outside of Evolutionary computation), most current work {{has focused on the}} maintenance of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction must offer significant fitness advantages to a species because despite the two-fold cost of sex, it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from recombination, where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual replication, where the offspring is identical to the parents. Recombination supplies two fault-tolerance mechanisms at the molecular level: recombinational DNA repair (promoted during meiosis because homologous chromosomes pair at that time) and complementation (also known as <b>heterosis,</b> hybrid vigor or masking of mutations).|$|E
25|$|<b>Heterosis,</b> or {{hybrid vigor}} (as in the {{familiar}} F1 hybrids of maize), occurs in common (hexaploid) wheat, {{but it is difficult}} to produce seed of hybrid cultivars on a commercial scale (as is done with maize) because wheat flowers are perfect and normally self-pollinate. Commercial hybrid wheat seed has been produced using chemical hybridizing agents; these chemicals selectively interfere with pollen development, or naturally occurring cytoplasmic male sterility systems. Hybrid wheat has been a limited commercial success in Europe (particularly France), the United States and South Africa. F1 hybrid wheat cultivars should not be confused with the standard method of breeding inbred wheat cultivars by crossing two lines using hand emasculation, then selfing or inbreeding the progeny many (ten or more) generations before release selections are identified to be released as a variety or cultivar.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{the data}} not only {{facilitate}} in deciphering the complex phenomena such as <b>heterosis</b> and epigenetics, {{it may also}} enable breeders to predict which fragment of a chromosome is derived from which parent in the progeny line, thereby recognizing crossover events occurring in every progeny line and inserting markers on genetic and physical maps without ambiguity. In due course, this will assist in introducing specific chromosomal segments from one cultivar to another. Besides, the researchers had identified diverse classes of genes participating in energy production, metabolism and growth that were probably linked with crop yield, which can now be utilized {{for the development of}} transgenic wheat. Thus whole genome sequence of wheat and the availability of thousands of SNPs will inevitably permit the breeders to stride towards identifying novel traits, providing biological knowledge and empowering biodiversity-based breeding.|$|E
25|$|Because wheat self-pollinates, {{creating}} hybrid varieties {{is extremely}} labor-intensive; {{the high cost}} of hybrid wheat seed relative to its moderate benefits have kept farmers from adopting them widely despite nearly 90 years of effort. F1 hybrid wheat cultivars {{should not be confused with}} wheat cultivars deriving from standard plant breeding. <b>Heterosis</b> or hybrid vigor (as in the familiar F1 hybrids of maize) occurs in common (hexaploid) wheat, but it is difficult to produce seed of hybrid cultivars on a commercial scale as is done with maize because wheat flowers are perfect in the botanical sense, meaning they have both male and female parts, and normally self-pollinate. Commercial hybrid wheat seed has been produced using chemical hybridizing agents, plant growth regulators that selectively interfere with pollen development, or naturally occurring cytoplasmic male sterility systems. Hybrid wheat has been a limited commercial success in Europe (particularly France), the United States and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} characteristics {{of an animal}} created by breeding a wolf to a dog are not predictable, {{similar to that of}} mixed-breed dogs. Genetic research shows that wolf and dog populations initially diverged approximately 14,000 years ago and have interbred only occasionally since, accounting for the dissimilarity between dogs and wolves in behavior and appearance. In many cases the resulting adult wolfdog may be larger than either of its parents due to the genetic phenomenon of <b>heterosis</b> (commonly known as hybrid vigor). Breeding experiments in Germany with Poodles and wolves, and later on with the resulting wolfdogs showed unrestricted fertility, mating via free choice and no significant problems of communication (even after a few generations). The offspring of poodles with either coyotes and jackals however all showed a decrease in fertility, significant communication problems, and an increase of genetic diseases after three generations of interbreeding between the hybrids. The researchers therefore concluded that domestic dogs and wolves are the same species.|$|E
500|$|In a hybrid, any {{trait that}} falls outside {{the range of}} parental {{variation}} (and is thus not simply intermediate between its parents) is considered heterotic. Positive <b>heterosis</b> produces more robust hybrids, they might be stronger or bigger; while the term negative <b>heterosis</b> refers to weaker or smaller hybrids. <b>Heterosis</b> is common in both animal and plant hybrids. For example, hybrids between a lion and a tigress ("ligers") are much larger than {{either of the two}} progenitors, while [...] "tigons" [...] (lioness × tiger) are smaller. Similarly, the hybrids between the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and domestic fowl (Gallus gallus) are larger than either of their parents, as are those produced between the common pheasant and hen golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus). Spurs are absent in hybrids of the former type, although present in both parents.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Heterosis</b> (or {{heterozygote}} advantage): [...] "Heterosis: the heterozygote at a locus is fitter {{than either}} homozygote".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the modern}} {{hybridization}} process, where one inbred line of corn is crossed with another, developed from this early work in cross breeding. In 1908, George Harrison Shull described <b>heterosis,</b> {{also known as}} hybrid vigor. <b>Heterosis</b> describes the tendency of the progeny of a specific cross to outperform both parents. In 1917 a process was developed that would make this hybridization commercially viable. In 1933 less than 1% of the corn produced in the United States was produced from hybrid seed; by 1944 over 83% was. [...] This hybrid seed is produced by crossing two inbred lines by planting a row of one inbred variety followed by several rows of a second variety. The tassels of the second variety were removed by hand so that the second variety could be pollinated by the first.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{is clear}} that the nature of natural populations is a very {{complicated}} subject, and it now appears probable that adaptation of the various genotypes to different ecological niches and frequency-dependent selection are at least as important, and probably more important in many cases, than simple <b>heterosis</b> (in the sense of increased viability or fecundity of the heterozygote)".|$|E
2500|$|During sexual reproduction, mating with a close {{relative}} (inbreeding) generally leads to inbreeding depression. [...] For instance, inbreeding was found to increase juvenile mortality in 11 small animal species. [...] Inbreeding depression {{is considered to be}} largely due to expression of deleterious recessive mutations. [...] Mating with unrelated or distantly related members of the same species is generally thought to provide the advantage of masking deleterious recessive mutations in progeny. (see [...] <b>Heterosis).</b> [...] Animals have evolved numerous diverse mechanisms for avoiding close inbreeding and promoting outcrossing (see Inbreeding avoidance).|$|E
2500|$|A mongrel, mixed-breed dog or mutt is a {{dog that}} {{does not belong to}} one {{recognized}} breed and is not the result of intentional breeding. Estimates place their numbers at 150 million animals worldwide. Although the term [...] "mixed-breed dog" [...] is preferred by some, many mongrels have no known purebred ancestors. [...] Furthermore, crossbreed dogs, while literally a mix of breeds, differ from mongrels in being intentionally bred. [...] Although mongrels have at times been considered somehow lesser than intentionally bred dogs, they are thought to be less susceptible to genetic health problems associated with dog breeding (based on the theory of <b>heterosis),</b> and have enthusiasts and defenders who prefer them to intentionally bred dogs.|$|E
2500|$|In some {{lines of}} descent from the {{earliest}} organisms, the diploid stage of the sexual cycle, which was at first transient, became the predominant stage, because it allowed complementation — the masking of deleterious recessive mutations (i.e. hybrid vigor or <b>heterosis).</b> Outcrossing, the second fundamental aspect of sex, is maintained by the advantage of masking mutations and the disadvantage of inbreeding (mating with a close relative) which allows expression of recessive mutations (commonly observed as inbreeding depression). This is in accord with Charles Darwin, who concluded that the adaptive advantage of sex is hybrid vigor; or as he put it, [...] "the offspring of two individuals, especially if their progenitors {{have been subjected to}} very different conditions, have a great advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigor and fertility over the self fertilised offspring from either one of the same parents." ...|$|E
2500|$|Genomics is an {{interdisciplinary}} {{field of science}} {{within the field of}} molecular biology. A genome is a complete set of DNA within a single cell of an organism, and as such, focuses on the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes. Genomics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of genes, which direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. Genomics also involves the sequencing and analysis of genomes. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in discovery-based research to understand even the most currently complex biological systems such as the brain. In contrast to genetics, which refers to the study of individual genes and their roles in inheritance, genomics uses high throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatics to assemble, and analyze the function and structure of entire genomes. [...] The field also includes studies of intragenomic (within the genome) phenomena such as <b>heterosis</b> (hybrid vigour), epistasis (effect of one gene on another), pleiotropy (one gene affecting more than one trait) and other interactions between loci and alleles within the genome. Advances in genomics have triggered a revolution in systems biology which facilitates the understanding of complex biological systems such as the brain.|$|E
