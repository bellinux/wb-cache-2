30|$|This {{model is}} {{estimated}} using OLS regression analysis. A higher GDP and population in country j were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> {{lead to greater}} demand and, consequently. to higher passenger car exports from country i to country j. A higher GDP and population in country i were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> increase the production capacity. Similarly, a higher quality of logistics in the importing country can also be <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be positively related to trade volumes. With respect to the dummy variables, the adjacency of trading nations, a common language, membership of the EEA and {{direct access to the}} sea would all also be <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> facilitate trade. Hence, the variables GDPj; POPj; GDPCAPj; LOGISj; CAij; LCij; EEAj and SEAj were all <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be positively correlated to export quantities. On the other hand, increasing physical distance between trade partners, as well as higher tariffs, were both <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have a depressing effect on trade quantities. Hence, the variables Dij and Tariffij were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be negatively correlated to trade volumes.|$|R

5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as {{without the support of}} his more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E

Based on the qualitative estimation, the abundance of 10 species among the 31 species is predicted to increase, whereas that of 21 species is projected to decrease. The abundance of 32 species among 57 species was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> decrease due to climate changes, whereas 15 species was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> increase; {{the number of species}} <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> decrease was more than two times that of species that are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> increase...|$|R
