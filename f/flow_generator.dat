40|$|Introduction: The {{application}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) {{is one of}} the most important therapeutic interventions used in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) secondary to acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE). Thanks to its positive effects on both hemodynamics and ventilation, CPAP improves clinical and blood-gas parameters. Compared with standard oxygen therapy, use of CPAP is associated with decreased mortality and reduced need for intubation in these patients. Aim of the study: This review examines the principles of CPAP, techniques and equipment used to deliver it, and clinical applications. Special emphasis is placed on CPAP delivered with the Boussignac device. Discussion and conclusions: In emergency departments, this simple, lightweight, disposable device has proved to be well tolerated and similar to Venturi-like <b>flow</b> <b>generators</b> in terms of effectiveness. These findings suggest that Boussignac CPAP might be useful for managing ARF in non-critical care areas where other more complicated CPAP equipment (Venturi-like <b>flow</b> <b>generators</b> and ventilators) are not available (for example, in general medical wards) ...|$|R
50|$|This pulsatile <b>flow</b> <b>generator</b> {{produces}} a pulsating water flow by using flexible tubes, a collapsible elastic bladder and a fluid supply. This {{is a rare}} phenomenon which still isn't fully understood. What makes this phenomenon unique {{is the fact that}} it can generate a pulsatile flow without any use of difficult mechanical engines. There are existing pulsatile flow generators but none of them are as frugal and easy to build as this one. They are also expensive and none of them are based on principle of flow limitation occurring in collapsible tubes.|$|E
50|$|The fluid {{reservoir}} {{is connected to}} the collabsible bladder. The lower end of the bladder is connected to a flexible tube made of synthetic rubber or PVC. The first bit of the flexible tube that begins {{at the lower end of}} the bladder is 'U' shaped by using an elastic connector or a wire spiral. The end of the flexible tube were the water flows out is open to the atmospheric pressure. If the vertical height from the reservoir to the bladder is less than from the ground to the bladder and during a certain flow rate the bladder performs an interesting phenomenon of collapsing and opening along with the generation of a pulsatile flow of the liquid. The cause of this phenomenon can be explained by the functioning of the Starling resistor which produces self-excited oscillations caused by fluid-structure interaction in an elastic tube due to sudden stoppage of flow. This pulsatile <b>flow</b> <b>generator</b> can actually be seen as a modification of the Starling resistor.|$|E

40|$|As {{cardiovascular}} diseases {{have been the}} most common cause of mortality in the western world for decades, the demand for appropriate diagnostic methods is obvious. To facilitate the examination non-invasive methods are preferable since they do not require sensors within the circulation system. Ultrasonic Doppler is a frequently used technique in non-invasive hemodynamic studies. To increase the accuracy in volume flow recordings, the pulsatile vessel diameter and flow velocity were measured simultaneously. The method was evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo. The in vitro results were compared with corresponding data produced by an MRI-scanner. The in vivo evaluation was performed through the reproducibility on normally grown fetuses in a longitudinal study. New diagnostic methods for the vascular system are frequently validated in vitro. To facilitate this work, an arbitrary <b>flow</b> <b>generator</b> was designed and evaluated. The <b>flow</b> <b>generator</b> produces constant and pulsatile flow. The generator is furthermore capable of generating typical physiological waveforms found in the human arterial circulation system. The achieved performance in terms of accuracy, bandwidth, ripple and load invariance makes the <b>flow</b> <b>generator</b> very suitable for its application. Vascular impedance is a quantity that characterizes the flow resistance in the arterial tree. Traditional methods for impedance determination require invasive measurements which limits their applicability. To estimate the impedance non-invasively, the relationship to phase velocity was utilized. The agreement between theoretical relationship and measured data was evaluated in vitro. The validation was concentrated on parameters used for clinical diagnosis. Pulse wave velocity is, in contrast to vascular impedance, a local measure of the arterial wall elasticity. A new method for non-invasive PWV estimation is described and evaluated. The PWV estimation was based on arterial wall movements which were detected by Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI), a color Doppler optimized for low tissue velocities. The TDI modality allowed the artery to be measured at multiple positions simultaneously which improved the PWV estimation considerably. The method was initially evaluated and optimized on an in vitro set-up and thereafter validated with respect to repeatability and reproducibility in a clinical study...|$|E
40|$|Analog {{layout design}} is a costly and {{error-prone}} task since analog synthesis {{is still far}} from applicable. It is expected that procedural bottom-up generators managing constructive tasks {{will be part of}} future synthesis <b>flows.</b> <b>Generators</b> contain expert knowledge implicitly within complex and hard-to-understand source code. Due to a lack of explicit layout definition and uncaptured design intent, generator layouts can hardly be adapted by constructive algorithms directly. Thus, synthesis flows need to adapt layout blocks by varying generator parameters which results in computation-expensive optimization. This paper introduces MESH—a software structure to define detailed and flexible layout generators explicitly. Using MESH, just a few lines of code describe complex layouts while all relations and design intents, such as element positions and routing styles, are captured through abstract commands. As a result, generators are created fast with less programming errors, and constructive algorithms can modify the generator structure directly...|$|R

40|$|A {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a novel flow meter {{evaluation}} system which can realize the same gas pulsation flow characteristics in a lab as in a field, such as a chemical plant or a gas pipe line system. In order to develop this system, this research adopts a an experimental approach using an “Oscillatory <b>flow</b> <b>generator</b> using isothermal chambers ” and “Quick and precise pressure regulator”. The prototype system developed in this research showed a precise duplicability of a pulsation flow. A present problem in such system is that there have not been any devices having enough performance to evaluate the accuracy of the flow meter under a pressure pulsation condition, although a flow meter usually can be affected by a sudden pressure change. Now, therefore, flow meter tests have to be conducted in the real plant systems. But, these experiments in the real plant system cost time and money. As a result, Industries related to plant systems definitely need a flow meter evaluation system that can produce arbitrary pulsation flow. In order to realize the boundary conditions, a very quick and precise pressure regulating device, which is invented in our former research, is essential. In addition, in the experimental approach, a prototype system was made and the similarity of the pulsating flow to real system was evaluated precisely. The system consists of three main components, an oscillatory <b>flow</b> <b>generator,</b> a quick and precisio...|$|E

In addition, all our tiles and the resulting tiling are divergence-free and hence suitable for representing a range of effects. We discuss issues that arise in designing flow tiles, algorithms for creating tilings, and three applications: a crowd on city streets, a river flowing between banks, and swirling fog.
