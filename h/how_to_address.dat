5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> {{the issue in the}} future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E
5|$|The last 145 {{pages of}} the book is {{addressed}} to passengers, to help them determine which airlines have good safety records and how to better ensure safe travel while flying. Schiavo discusses the average ages of certain airline fleets, reveals the accident rates of the major airline carriers, safety ratings at national airlines, bomb detection rates at U.S. airports, and provides a list of airports where power failures have affected the effectiveness of control towers. She concludes with a list of recommendations for how individuals can effect change at government agencies including the FAA, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> concerns of conflict of interest between air safety and inspection and the airline industry.|$|E

30|$|The {{focus on}} {{learning}} from big stream data is <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>addressing</b> the concept drifting challenge. Concept drift {{was first introduced}} by Wdimer and Kubat [1], where they noticed that the concept (the classification boundary or clustering centers) continuously changes with time elapsing. Based on the changing speed of concept, we formally divide the concept drifting into loose concept drift and rigorous concept drift [2]. In the former, concepts in adjacent data chunks are sufficiently close to each other; in the latter, genuine concepts in adjacent data chunks may randomly and rapidly changed.|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, {{long-term}} copper treatment (oral {{intake of}} 8mg copper (Cu-(II)-orotate-dihydrate)) was excluded as {{a risk factor}} for Alzheimer's disease in a noted clinical trial on humans and a potentially beneficial role of copper in Alzheimer's disease has been demonstrated on cerebral spinal fluid levels of Aβ42, a toxic peptide and biomarker of the disease. More research is needed to understand metal homeostasis disturbances in Alzheimer's disease patients and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> these disturbances therapeutically. Since this experiment used Cu-(II)-orotate-dihydrate, it does not relate to the effects of cupric oxide in supplements.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during his}} tenure as finance minister, Martin coordinated a series of {{meetings}} between the finance ministers of all provinces to discuss <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the pending crisis in the Canada Pension Plan (CPP). Consequently, Martin oversaw the creation of a general public consultation process in February 1996 that eventually led to major structural reform of the CPP. The results of this public consultation process were collected and analyzed by the Finance ministry. Eventually, it led to a proposal for overhauling the CPP, which was presented to Parliament and was approved soon after, thereby averting a pension crisis if left unaddressed.|$|E

25|$|During Soviet times, {{locomotives}} and wagons {{were regularly}} supplied {{on the basis}} of estimated needs. When the Soviet Union broke up, shares of the Soviet wagon fleet were allocated to the various republics; the smaller ones did not get the better deals. As a feature of the Soviet system, state-owned rail companies provide provided social welfare services such as free education and housing to their workers. After independence, each country had to figure out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> these obligations (without Soviet funding). In Soviet times, marketing was not a concern for railways since their clients were for the most part assigned to them by a central planning agency. To increase revenues after independence, railways had either to find more clients or to increase tariffs.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) Natural Experiments of History, a {{collection}} of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach {{to the study of}} history that he advocates. The book’s title {{stems from the fact that}} it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one must look at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed, either by different starting conditions or by different impacts. The book’s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> those difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Berchtold {{previously}} {{had decided to}} seek a more direct statement of German intentions. On 24 June, Austria-Hungary had prepared a letter for its ally outlining the challenges in the Balkans and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> them, but Franz Ferdinand was assassinated {{before it could be}} delivered. According to the letter, Romania was no longer a reliable ally especially since the Russo-Romanian summit meeting of 14 June in Constanța. Russia was working toward an alliance of Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro against Austria-Hungary, dismemberment of Austria-Hungary, and the movement of borders from east to west. To break up this effort, Germany and Austria-Hungary should first ally with Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. To this letter was added a post-script on the Sarajevo Outrage and its impact. Finally, Emperor Franz Joseph added his own letter to Emperor Wilhelm II which closed with advocating the end of Serbia as a political power factor. Hoyos was dispatched to Germany to present these letters.|$|E

500|$|On August 16, 2005, Combs {{announced}} on Today {{that he was}} altering his stage name yet again; he would be calling himself [...] "Diddy". Combs said that fans didn't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> him, which led to confusion. In November 2005, London-based musical artist and DJ Richard Dearlove, who had been performing under the name [...] "Diddy" [...] since 1992– nine years before Combs started using even [...] "P. Diddy"– sought an injunction in the High Court of Justice in London. He accepted an out-of-court settlement of £10,000 in damages and more than £100,000 in costs. Combs can no longer use the name Diddy in the UK, where he is still known as P. Diddy.

500|$|The 2007–2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent Great Recession challenged macroeconomic theory. [...] Few economists predicted the crisis, and, even afterwards, {{there was great}} disagreement on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> it. The new synthesis consensus broke down as economists debated policy responses {{to deal with the}} deep recession. The new synthesis formed during the Great Moderation and had not been tested in a severe economic environment. Many economists agree that the crisis stemmed from an economic bubble, but neither of the major macroeconomic schools had paid much attention to finance or a theory of asset bubbles: how they form, how they can be recognized, and how they can be prevented. The failures of current economic theory to deal with the crisis spurred economists to reevaluate their thinking. Commentary ridiculed the mainstream and proposed a major reassessment.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} the Brazilian Cabinet could not reach {{agreement}} as to <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> the danger posed by Rosas. Some ministers advocated seeking a peaceful resolution at any cost. These feared Brazil was unprepared for war and that a defeat {{would lead to a}} situation similar to the chaos following the loss of Cisplatine in the 1820s, which ended in abdication by Dom Pedro I, the Emperor's father. Other ministers took the position that only a military response would eliminate the threat. In 1849, however, Paulino José Soares de Sousa, a member of the pro-war faction and later Viscount of Uruguai, was chosen as the new minister of Foreign Affairs. Soares made clear his intent to deal with Argentina without foreign assistance, announcing that the [...] "Imperial Government does not desire or judge convenient an alliance with France or any other European nation related to the matters in the Platine region. It understands that they must be resolved by the nations which [...] are closely connected with... It will not admit European influence over America."

500|$|In early 2011, Christian Svensson at Capcom {{said that}} there were no plans at the time to release Ace Attorney Investigations 2 in regions outside Japan, due to higher {{localization}} costs than estimated returns; according to Eshiro, however, the main reason for the lack of a localization was scheduling, as all the staff working on the game had disbanded and moved to different teams after finishing the game, and were unable to work on a localization.
