40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to address a question of the effectiveness of Financial Service Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan - OJK) investigators in eradicating financial service crimes in Indonesia. This question arises because in Law on Financial Service Authority there are OJK 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>investigators</b> with an investigatory authority on OJK crimes, including; banking, capital market, insurance, pension fund, financing institutions, and other financial service institution sectors. Meanwhile, there have been other investigators with an authority to investigate, namely, public prosecutor, police, and KPK (Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s corruption eradicating commission). The theoretical framework of this paper was grounded in the thoughts of Aristotle, who says that the goal of law is to achieve justice, and that of Hans Kelsen 2 ̆ 7 s stuffen theory. The method of writing was juridical-normative, by studying legislations, both contained in laws themselves and in literatures/books of legal science, particularly those related to Financial Service Authority. The result was in a form of juridical aspect and written in a descriptive-analytical form. The conclusion of this paper was as follows: There was an overlapping of authorities between OJK 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>investigators</b> and public attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>investigators,</b> police, and KPK, be they in the investigation of general crimes and that of special crimes/corruption.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} risk of oral {{contraceptives}} on the occurrence of cervical cancer. Material and Method: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. Sixty women patients with histo-logically confirmed invasive cervical cancer and 180 healthy women as the control group who attended the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand were recruited. Information {{about the use of}} oral contraceptives and other cervical cancer risk factors were obtained from personal interviews. The risk factors were evaluated by using odds ratio (OR). Results: 60 women with invasive cervical cancer and 180 healthy controls were interviewed by the <b>investigator.</b> <b>s</b> Compared with non-users, patients who had ever used or currently used oral contraceptive had an increased risk of cervical cancer (OR 1. 45; 95 % CI 0. 79 - 2. 64). However, the risk was not statistically significant. Considering the duration of use, patients who had used oral contraceptives for 3 years or less did not have an increased risk of cervical cancer (OR 0. 78; 95 % CI 0. 39 - 1. 77). Nevertheless, the odds ratio of oral contracep-tive pill use for more than 3 years was 2. 57 (95 % CI 1. 22 - 5. 49) which was statistically significant. Conclusion: Long-term use of oral contraceptive might be a cofactor that increases the risk of cervical carcinoma. Further investigations should be conducted to confirm this risk. However, Pap smear has to be done routinely in long-term oral pill users...|$|R

Eusociality requires that generations overlap, allowing close contact between individuals such that altruistic behaviors can be favored by kin selection. The populations that live in sponges contain a few hundred individuals, each with two generations of kin. Also, by having just one reproductive female, colonies clearly fit the first criterion of reproductive division of labor. Most hypotheses that explain eusociality entail some form of adaptive division of labor, which results in enhanced reproductive output of the breeders and inclusive fitness benefits for the nonbreeding helpers.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glass ionomer {{sealants}} are {{an alternative}} to resin-based sealants, especially for use in partially erupted permanent molars. The authors conducted a study to compare the retention, marginal staining and cariostatic properties of a glass ionomer sealant with those of a resin-based sealant during a 24 -month period. METHODS: We {{included in this study}} 39 patients aged 5 through 9 years who had bilateral partially erupted first permanent molars. One of us (S. B.) placed a resin-based sealant (Delton Plus FS+, Dentsply Professional, York, Pa.) (group D) on a partially erupted first molar in one quadrant of the maxilla or mandible and a glass ionomer sealant (GC Fuji Triage White, GC America, Alsip, Ill.) (group T) in the other quadrant. Two masked and calibrated <b>investigators</b> (<b>S.</b> A. A., J. C.) evaluated the sealants for retention, marginal staining and carious lesions at three, six, 12 and 24 months. The authors used a multinomial regression for statistical analysis (P 3 ̆c. 05). RESULTS: The recall rate was 69. 2 percent at 24 months. Two sealants from group D and three from group T were lost completely. Complete retention rates at 24 months were 40. 7 and 44. 4 percent for groups D and T, respectively. The authors found no statistically significant difference in retention rates between groups at each recall examination (P 3 ̆e. 05). For marginal staining, sealants in the resin-based group exhibited statistically higher marginal staining than did sealants in the glass ionomer group (P 3 ̆c. 05). Although the authors detected no caries in teeth in group T, teeth in group D in which the sealant was lost completely experienced demineralization. CONCLUSIONS: Resin-based and glass ionomer sealants exhibited similar retention rates at 24 months. However, marginal staining was lower in the glass ionomer group, and the authors found no caries in teeth in this group. Consequently, glass ionomer sealants may be a better choice when salivary contamination is expected. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Sealing during tooth eruption presents a particular challenge owing to difficulty in isolating the tooth. Glass ionomers may be a better material for sealing partially erupted molars...|$|R

40|$|The skin, one of {{the largest}} organs of the body, is {{composed}} of three layers: the epidermis, dermis and subcutis. The outer most part of the epidermis i. e., the stratum corneum - serves as a protective barrier between the individual and the environment, defending the body from mechanical injuries, foreign chemical substances, microbes and loss of water. Both inherited and acquired abnormalities of the stratum corneum may increase the sensitivity of the skin to environmental factors and predispose it to the development of irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. Such a diagnosis is based on the medical history, clinical examination and appropriate patch testing. However, the reading of patch tests is subjective, provides qualitative information and the results depend largely on the <b>investigator</b> <b>s</b> experience. To obtain objective, comparable data, various bioengineering techniques have been designed to evaluate various aspects of the skin s response. In this Thesis, we used visual scoring together with several established non-invasive methods (transepidermal water loss, Corneometer, laser Doppler) and a new one (electrical impedance) to assess the irritant and allergic contact reactions, the effects of the treatment on skin sensitivity and skin dryness. In Paper I, we used the above-mentioned techniques to evaluate clinically similar allergic (to NiSO 4 in distilled water in different concentrations) and irritant (to 2 % sodium lauryl sulphate) skin reactions in 19 nickel-allergic patients. In Paper II, patch tests with 0. 5 % and 2 % NiSO 4 in petrolatum were done on the forearm of 20 nickel-allergic patients and five healthy subjects, which had been pre-treated with a urea-containing moisturiser. Skin areas that had not been pre-treated were used for comparisons. In Paper III, 2 % sodium lauryl sulphate and 40 % non-anoic acid were used by two independent laboratories to induce irritant contact reactions in 40 healthy volunteers. In Paper IV, the dry skin of the lower legs of 24 healthy elderly subjects was treated twice daily with two identical creams, one of which contained urea and sodium chloride and the other urea alone. In Paper V, 2 % sodium lauryl sulphate in distilled water was used to produce irritant contact dermatitis in 29 eczema patients and 19 healthy controls. The main conclusion of this thesis is that bioengineering techniques give descriptive, detailed information about pathophysiological changes in the skin of patients. Our data suggest that, in addition to well-established biophysical methods, this new impedance technique is of value for experimental studies of contact dermatitis. However, more investigations are needed before it can be used in routine diagnostic work, e. g., technical refinement and the development of guidelines for impedance measurements...|$|R
