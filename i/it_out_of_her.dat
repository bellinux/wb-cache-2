5|$|A large, cranky sow {{escapes from}} its herd and attacks the Mistress after {{she tries to}} shoo <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> garden. Lad charges between them and battles the sow, but with his old age and blunt fangs he struggles with the fight and is badly injured. Bruce and Wolf return from a forest romp in time to aid him, and the younger dogs are able to easily drive her off. While fleeing, the pig runs {{directly}} {{into the path of}} one of the Place's cars, driven by a car thief who is knocked unconscious. Lad's feelings are hurt by the battle being finished by the other dogs and the Mistress' holding him back from joining them at the end, but he quickly forgives her.|$|E
25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but everybody {{will be talking about}} it to everybody else. The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E
500|$|Kitty Empire of The Observer {{also thought}} that it shares {{similarities}} with [...] "Fighter". She cited the Björk song {{of the same name}} as another influence, due to its [...] "emotional territory" [...] Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "nothing we haven't heard from her before, but there's an urgency to it that suggests Christina needed to get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> system", while Matthew Horton of Virgin Media wrote that Aguilera sounds as though she is declaring war. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush was critical of the song, writing that it sounds like a Cher disco song which features Aguilera [...] "overworking" [...] her vocal cords. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the song's message to be confusing and did not understand who exactly Aguilera is supposed to be rising up against on the song, writing [...] "She hollers 'And we're gonna rise up.../ For every time you wronged me/ Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me.' Which begs the question: Rise up against whom? Is the whole world really out to get her, or is this just an excuse to wear camouflage hot pants?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the first}} sister passed {{the eye to}} the second, but as the second groped for it the boy caught <b>it</b> cleverly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to charge the lady anything?" [...] he asked. [...] "The money I've got on the ring isn't much. Mother won't like having <b>it</b> taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> rent." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jetpack Away - When Daisy Wheel's jetpack {{goes on the}} fritz, Flex {{volunteers to}} fix it. But he makes it so fast that <b>it</b> flies <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> reach and all over Doozer Creek.|$|R
2500|$|Barnes herself came {{to regard}} The Book of Repulsive Women as an embarrassment; {{she called the}} title [...] "idiotic," [...] left <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{curriculum}} vitae, and even burned copies. But since the copyright had never been registered, {{she was unable to}} prevent it from being republished, and it became one of her most reprinted works.|$|E
2500|$|Allen told Loveline {{that the}} {{audience}} was [...] "brought to tears {{at the sight of}} a troubled young girl doing something good". At that point Allen said she knew that music was something she needed to do either as a lifelong vocation or to get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> system. She played piano to grade 5 standard and achieved Grade 8 in singing. She played violin, guitar and trumpet and was a member of a chamber choir. Her first solo was [...] "In the Bleak Midwinter". She appeared as a lady-in-waiting in the 1998 film Elizabeth, which was co-produced by her mother. She dropped out of school at age fifteen, not wanting to [...] "spend a third of her life preparing to work for the next third of her life, to set herself up with a pension for the next third of her life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{opening track}} and lead single, [...] "Mr. Know It All," [...] {{features}} a steady four-four stomp, synthetic strings and drum-machine loops, with Clarkson's vocals being deemed as [...] "raw". It {{talks about a}} deceptive, arrogant man, with Rolling Stone remarking that [...] "Clarkson sasses a controlling man with double-entendres that up her R appeal." [...] The second track, [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)", {{was described as a}} [...] "chilly" [...] electropop and [...] "glitter-disco" [...] song, about encouraging personal reinvention. Clarkson herself compared it to her 2004 hit single [...] "Since U Been Gone". The third, [...] "Dark Side", is a mid-tempo track about a longing to be loved and accepted unconditionally, while [...] "Honestly" [...] longs for the truth, even when it's hard. Clarkson wrote [...] "You Love Me" [...] following an incident that she thought would break her, which she described as the most hurt she has ever been in her life, and while writing about it she was able to get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> system. It has Clarkson laying her anger at her emotional abuser’s feet and features heavy guitar in its chorus.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{did want}} {{the boy to}} go somewhere. I should not care where, so <b>it</b> were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> way. What creatures they must be {{for her to have}} {{produced}} no more effect on them!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, {{when the}} {{organization}} outgrew {{her ability to}} manage <b>it</b> part-time <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> home, her duties were expanded to full-time stewardship, and an office suite was rented [...] - [...] though still {{in the same building}} in which she lived.|$|R
6000|$|... "God's will be {{done with}} me," [...] he cried. [...] "I saw the first timber of the Ariel laid, and shall live {{just long enough to}} see <b>it</b> turn <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bottom; after which I wish to live no longer." ...|$|R
60|$|On such {{encouragement}} to ask, Elizabeth {{was forced to}} put <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> power, by running away.|$|E
60|$|He took <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand, {{opened it}} {{with a kind of}} {{professional}} carelessness, barely glanced at the signature and seals, and returned it.|$|E
60|$|He was {{relieved}} to find the late subject blown over, and only wishing to keep <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mind, he invited her to take a walk.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will write}} to the Governor to excuse him," [...] says she. [...] "We must keep our strong friends." [...] But when she took up the pen <b>it</b> flew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fingers. [...] "I cannot write," [...] said she. [...] "Can you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, you did. I {{knew that}} I should {{find out what}} was what if I once went there. I got <b>it</b> all <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> But, by George, what a woman she is! She swore at me to my very face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, she walked," [...] {{said the}} widow, {{interrupting}} him; [...] "she walked, quiet and asy, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your door, and into mine. But that's a lie, for <b>it</b> was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own. She didn't {{come through the}} kay-hole, nor yet <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't expect anything, Nancy. If {{she was a}} child I could whip <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> {{but when}} your child {{has got to be a}} woman you can't whip her." ...|$|E
6000|$|And then Clara {{sent off}} the {{following}} reply, written under her mother's dictation; though the countess strove {{very hard to}} convince her daughter that she was wording <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own head:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was the old}} Scotch fool Jenny, who did <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own head, I suppose," [...] said Margaret; [...] "for she {{has been}} {{stunning}} me these two hours about you and Mother Redcap." ...|$|E
60|$|Tinville took <b>it</b> roughly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand, {{but would}} not glance at it. He crushed it {{into a ball and}} then Merlin {{snatched}} it from him with a coarse laugh, smoothed out the creases on his knee and studied it for a moment.|$|R
60|$|PURDIE. I read to Mabel aloud for an hour. I did <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{kindness}} to <b>her,</b> because I had met you.|$|R
60|$|As she {{was going}} home, bowed with grief, she saw a little black pony coming towards her, {{springing}} and curveting in every direction. When it got quite near her it neighed loudly, and galloped past her so quickly {{that in a moment}} <b>it</b> was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the book, Magsy?" [...] he asked, took <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{slightly}} resisting hand, {{closed it}} {{and read the}} title. [...] "Um," [...] he said; [...] "Isn't this a bit stiff for little women's brains?" ...|$|E
60|$|SIMONE. My month's {{allowance}} arrived to-day. I {{have the}} cheque here. (She takes <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> corsage.) Two hundred thousand francs. It's signed already. You {{can get it}} cashed {{as soon as the}} hanks open to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Away, fool!" [...] {{said the}} Lady; [...] "send me that hag hither; she shall avouch {{what it was}} that she hath given to the wretch Dryfesdale, or the pilniewinks and thumbikins shall wrench <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> finger joints!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said the}} monitress, {{shaking her head}} and heaving a deep sigh. With this ejaculation, {{indicative}} that she perceived a screw to be loose somewhere, but that <b>it</b> was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> reach to set it right, she bent over her grammar, and sought the rule and exercise for the day.|$|R
60|$|During {{the rest}} of that day Martin sulked by himself behind a great tussock of grass, refusing to eat with the others, and when one of the women went to him and offered him a piece of meat he struck <b>it</b> vindictively <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand. She only laughed a little and left him.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him as if she would speak, and said nothing. She {{suspected}} him of hating his home and affecting to care for <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> politeness to <b>her....</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I promised {{my sister}} I wouldn't.' Which Louisa hastily confirmed. 'And besides,' said the whelp bitterly, 'she tells her own story so {{precious}} well - and so full - that what business had I to take <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is right! Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so. That {{music has}} taken the vanity out of me as Rome took <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> and I won't be a humbug any longer. Now what shall I do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{when the}} will was made out all right, she took <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chest one night an' read {{it all over}} to me. I {{could see it was}} shipshape, though I couldn't read a word of its crabbed letters myself.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Shelby, being entirely ignorant <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's embarrassments, {{and knowing}} only the general kindliness of his temper, {{had been quite}} sincere in the entire incredulity with which she had met Eliza's suspicions. In fact, she {{dismissed}} the matter from her mind, without a second thought; and being occupied in preparations for an evening visit, <b>it</b> passed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> thoughts entirely.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Miller then said: [...] "There is a box {{of candy}} on a shelf back of Mrs. Smiley. <b>It</b> is quite <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> reach. Can you bring that to me, 'Wilbur'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. You {{know how}} tidy {{she is and}} how she hates wind. She remembered that the fences were broken--she remembered the wind blowing. Sand--sun--salt wind--fences--faces--I got <b>it</b> all <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> bit by bit. You don't know what I know! And it all {{happened}} {{three or four months}} before you were born. There!' Nurse Blaber slapped her knee with her little hand triumphantly.|$|R
