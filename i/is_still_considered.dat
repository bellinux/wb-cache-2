5|$|A Night to Remember is a 1955 non-fiction book by Walter Lord {{about the}} sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912. The book was hugely successful, and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>considered</b> a {{definitive}} resource about the Titanic. Lord interviewed many survivors of the disaster as well as drawing on books, memoirs and articles that they had written. He authored a follow-up book, The Night Lives On, in 1986 following renewed interest in the story after the wreck of Titanic was found.|$|E
5|$|A subfamily, the Diplodocinae, {{was erected}} to include Diplodocus and its closest relatives, {{including}} Barosaurus. More distantly related is the contemporaneous Apatosaurus, which <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>considered</b> a diplodocid, {{although not a}} diplodocine, {{as it is a}} member of the subfamily Apatosaurinae. The Portuguese Dinheirosaurus and the African Tornieria have also been identified as close relatives of Diplodocus by some authors. The Diplodocoidea comprise the diplodocids, as well as dicraeosaurids, rebbachisaurids, Suuwassea, Amphicoelias and possibly Haplocanthosaurus, and/or the nemegtosaurids. This clade is the sister group to Macronaria (camarasaurids, brachiosaurids and titanosaurians).|$|E

5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>considered</b> valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it {{was not one of}} the three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, Germany, has led to the nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E

After completing his dissertation, which <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>considered</b> a classic on Indonesian history, Kahin became a faculty member at Cornell University.

Pilsbry's study has remained the only illustrated monograph of the genus, and it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>considered</b> indispensable for any serious study of the genus.|$|E

5|$|The Large Black {{combined}} local black pig breeds {{from the}} West Country and the East of England.

The Large Black was popular in the early 1900s and was exported to {{many areas of the}} world. Population numbers declined after the Second World War as farmers turned to breeds more suitable to intensive pig farming, and by the 1960s the breed was almost extinct. Numbers have slowly risen, but it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>considered</b> vulnerable by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, and Rare Breeds Canada.|$|E

5|$|The modern view of synapsid {{relationships}} {{was proposed}} by paleontologist Robert R.

Within Sphenacodontia is the group Sphenacodontoidea, which in turn contains Sphenacodontidae and Therapsida. Sphenacodontidae is the group containing Dimetrodon and several other sail-backed synapsids like Sphenacodon and Secodontosaurus, while Therapsida includes mammals and their mostly Permian and Triassic relatives.|$|E
