5|$|By 26 December, strong German defences had stalled Canadian {{forces in}} Ortona and British and New Zealand forces in Orsogna. Although both Ortona and Villa Grande were {{captured}} {{by the end of}} December, general exhaustion among the Allied forces prevented the capture of Orsogna and an advance to Pescara. When harsh winter weather set in, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the Allied commanders that no further progress would be made and General Alexander called off the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Early in his reign, {{there were}} plans {{regarding}} {{a marriage of}} Władysław and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine (daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine). This was however unpopular, both with Catholic nobles and the Catholic Church, and when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Władysław that this would not convince the Swedes to elect him to their throne, this plan, with quiet support from Władysław himself, was dropped.|$|E
5|$|One British soldier, Bradley Tinnion, {{was killed}} in the operation. Another twelve {{soldiers}} were injured, one seriously. The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) did not officially acknowledge the involvement of special forces, issuing a press release which made no mention of the SAS, but when it was made public that Brad Tinnion was a Lance Bombardier originally from 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> experts that Tinnion had been serving with special forces. Operation Barras was Tinnion's first operational deployment as an SAS trooper.|$|E
50|$|When <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Lamorak {{that neither}} side will give in, he reluctantly volunteers {{to operate the}} waste {{processing}} machinery himself. Seeing this, Ragusnik capitulates {{and goes back to}} work.|$|R
50|$|Barbara {{jumps to}} the {{conclusion}} that Peter and Marguerite have run away together. First her parents, Major and Mrs Bone, and then Marguerite's husband and finally Barbara descend on the inn. <b>It</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> everyone that Peter and Marguerite are blameless, and both couples are reconciled.|$|R
50|$|As {{his travels}} {{progress}} <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Henry {{that the woman}} he had been raised to believe was his mother was in fact his aunt. His real mother is Augusta, and her reconnection with him at her sister's funeral {{marked the beginning of}} her reclamation of her child.|$|R
5|$|Starting in August 1941, when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> {{some in the}} Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht {{high command}} that the war would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew {{increasingly}} concerned about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of spectacular victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, {{when they had to}} explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory.|$|E
5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. She {{had had a}} series of rows with Bamber. He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E
30|$|This {{is exactly}} the point where I {{suddenly}} {{realize that it is}} sort of not quite fitting how I was using those symbols previously.

50|$|The song Nur ein Traum {{describes}} a day-dream (Tagtraum) twice - once in English {{and once in}} German. The narrator is travelling with his loved one {{in the car and}} is all over her. Then <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> him that he is actually sitting alone in the car and his loved one is only a dream.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{reluctant}} {{to force her}} inclination as his own was forced, the Baron tries {{to determine whether or}} not his daughter, Amelia, loves the affected and foppish Count Cassel. <b>It</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the audience that she instead loves Anhalt, a poor clergyman, and he her. <b>It</b> also <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> that the Baron regrets the misdeeds of his youth and has long sought, fruitlessly, to make amends.|$|R
5|$|Motley's knees {{continued}} to bother him in 1952. While he showed occasional signs {{of his old}} form that season, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the Browns' coaching staff {{that he was no}} longer in his prime. Motley finished the year with 444 yards of rushing and 4.3 yards per carry, a career low. The Browns finished with an 8–4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game. Motley performed well in that matchup against the Detroit Lions, rushing for 95 yards. The Browns, however, lost 17–7.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Board of Consultants to a {{committee}} appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In this report, the committee advocated creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. Bernard Baruch was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the Baruch Plan of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets. With this, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.|$|E
5|$|On 2 April, the Japanese divisional commander, Akanaga, {{called the}} 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments {{back across the}} Puriata, to a {{position}} south-west of the Pain feature. At this point, {{the decision was made}} to launch a fresh attack aimed at taking Slater's Knoll and eliminating the Australian forces in the area surrounding the Puriata ford. The attack was scheduled for 5 April, and over the course of the following three days, contact was minimal. In this time, there were a few minor skirmishes, and small groups of Japanese were seen by the Australians around Barara, Slater's Knoll and Mosigetta. As further intelligence reports came in, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the Australian commanders that the Japanese were about to deliver the main attack.|$|E
50|$|Orbison {{takes the}} family to the Bahamas, where a romantic {{attachment}} between P.J. and the married Maureen seems to be growing. Orbison's business partner, Grenoble, is shot dead and P.J. is arrested by the police. <b>It</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> P.J. {{that he has been}} set up by the Orbisons, who wanted to rid themselves of Grenoble and needed a fall guy.|$|R
50|$|Within hours <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the {{residents}} of Black Mountain that this is no ordinary blackout, and {{they come to the}} realization that the power may remain off for a very long time. Every modern electrical device is disabled, destroyed by what Matherson is beginning to suspect is an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack on the United States by unknown attackers.|$|R
25|$|Therefore, as {{the series}} progresses, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Nantucket's {{scaled-down}} Government that sitting back and reinventing isolationism {{is no real}} option, and {{that the people of}} Nantucket have no choice but build an army, a navy, and a set of foreign alliances of their own and take the fight to Walker - and in the process, build up what amounts to an empire of their own.|$|R
5|$|Soon after Washington's {{orders were}} delivered, a British raiding party under George Collier and Edward Mathew arrived in Virginia to capture or destroy {{supplies}} {{that might otherwise}} be sent southward to aid the reinforcements going to South Carolina. Scott's orders changed again; the Virginia House of Delegates ordered him to immediately prepare defenses against Collier and Mathew's raids. When <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> both the legislature and Washington that Collier and Mathew intended only to raid supplies, not to invade, they concluded that the local militia would be able to sufficiently protect Virginia's interests and that Scott should continue to recruit men to reinforce the south. The legislators presented him with a horse, a firearm, and 500 pounds sterling for his quick response to the threat.|$|E
5|$|When <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Tiberius {{that support}} for Sejanus was {{not as strong as}} the emperor had feared, his next step was to choose Naevius Sutorius Macro, {{previously}} prefect of the vigiles (Roman police and fire department), to replace Sejanus and effect his downfall. On October 18, AD 31, Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn, he entered the Senate; but while the letter was being read, Macro assumed control of the Praetorian Guard and members of the vigiles led by Graecinius Laco surrounded the building. The senators at first congratulated Sejanus but when the letter, which first digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately surrounded and escorted to prison.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway and Denmark, {{followed by a}} warning by the new Japanese naval attaché Captain Tadashi Meada that a German attack on the Netherlands was certain, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the Dutch military that staying out of the conflict might prove impossible. They started to fully prepare for war, both mentally and physically. Dutch border troops were put on greater alert. Reports of the presumed actions of a Fifth Column in Scandinavia caused widespread fears that the Netherlands too had been infiltrated by German agents assisted by traitors. Countermeasures were taken against a possible assault on airfields and ports. On 19 April {{a state of emergency}} was declared. However, most civilians still cherished the illusion that their country might be spared, an attitude that has since been described as a state of denial. The Dutch hoped that the restrained policy of the Entente and Central Powers during the First World War might be repeated and tried to avoid the attention of the Great Powers and a war in which they feared a loss of human life comparable to that of the previous conflict. On 10 April Britain and France repeated their request that the Dutch enter the war on their side, but were again refused.|$|E
50|$|Pearl {{introduces}} {{her younger}} sister Bessie to English aristocracy and especially to eligible young bachelor Lord Harry Bleane. Bessie is seduced by the glamour of high society. When her former fiance, Fleming Harvey, comes <b>to</b> see her, <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> him that she no longer loves him. Harry proposes to Bessie; she accepts, though she tells him only that she likes him very much.|$|R

5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, Furieuse disappeared ahead, Mounsey pursuing in {{the hope}} of rediscovering his opponent during the night. At 03:00 on 6 July, the British lookouts spotted the French ship in the distance and the chase began again, Bonne Citoyenne proving much faster than the French ship as the wind strengthened. At 09:10 <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Kerdaniel that he could not escape his opponent and instead turned to meet her, opening fire five minutes later as Bonne Citoyenne came within range. Mounsey replied immediately, the two ships exchanging fire at close range for nearly seven hours, the smaller and more manoeuvrable Bonne Citoyenne successfully turning several times to vary her broadsides and prevent her guns overheating. In the exchange, the British ship fired 129 broadsides, while Furieuse only managed 70: Bonne Citoyenne lost three cannon to fractures caused by the intense heat generated by repeated firing. With his ammunition spent, Mounsey swung towards Furieuse at 18:16 to board and capture her, at which point Kerdaniel, whose ship was battered and unmanoeuvrable, surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Implementing the {{deception}} operation {{did not go}} through entirely without incident. Initially the Soviets were {{kept in the dark}} about Egyptian intentions to go to war. Instead, on October 2, they were told that an Israeli raid was expected. Over the next two days the director of the Defense Intelligence Service, General Fouad Nassar, informed the Chief Soviet Liaison Officer, General Samakhodsky, that the raid was expected to be a large-scale attack, coupled with an air strike. Though Samakhodsky appeared at first to believe Nassar's story, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the Egyptians that the Soviets were suspicious. In particular Soviet advisors serving with Egyptian and Syrian units were by October 3 reporting the unusually heightened activities of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Both Sadat and Assad decided to inform the Soviets of their intention to go to war on October 3. Promptly, the Soviets requested permission to evacuate their personnel in Egypt, and both leaders reluctantly agreed. Egyptian commanders were taken completely by surprise, when, beginning late evening on October 4, Soviet experts serving with field units, embassy personnel and their families were hurriedly evacuated. By October 5, the evacuation was complete. This incident would be an important factor in convincing the Israelis that war was likely.|$|E
5|$|These {{delays in}} turn {{affected}} the fly-in of 1 RAR, with the companies forced to wait at the departure point in AO Colombus before they commenced the air move to FSB Coral. Hughes visited Bennett at FSB Coral at 15:30 to discuss {{aspects of the}} defence, as well as events planned for the following day. The deployment of the second battalion was not complete until 16:10, with the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon arriving on the last flight, {{more than four hours}} late. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> Bennett that 1 RAR would need to deploy to the east of the FSB, and with just two hours before last light the companies were moved into hasty defensive positions, the last of which were not established until 17:00. Due to the hurried deployment, by dusk the two battalions of 1 ATF and their supporting elements were scattered around FSB Coral in four roughly connected groups, rather than in a co-ordinated defensive position. The task force headquarters advance party and part of its Defence Platoon were located centrally, yet the task force tactical headquarters and the artillery tactical headquarters under Lieutenant Colonel Jack Kelly—Commanding Officer of 12th Field Regiment—both remained in Bearcat. Hughes was not present either, having left Bearcat to attend to matters at the task force rear headquarters at Nui Dat, and was due to move forward with the tactical headquarters to FSB Coral the following day.|$|E

Through Sam he discovers Carry's whereabouts, and resolves to rescue her if he can. He finds her a temporary home, but <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> him that the only permanent solution must involve bringing her back into the Brattle family, which means winning her father's forgiveness.|$|R
25|$|The Wampanoag tribe under Metacomet's {{leadership}} {{had entered}} into {{an agreement with}} the Plymouth Colony and believed that they could rely on the colony for protection.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> {{the local}} general merchants that strong legal {{protection}} of the good name of Harris Tweed by a trade mark and an established standard definition had therefore become essential to the developing industry. This led to groups of merchants in both Lewis and Harris applying to the Board of Trade for a registered trade mark.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Free Syrian Army was {{perceived}} as the ultimate military force of the Syrian Opposition, but {{with the collapse of}} many FSA factions and emergence of powerful Islamist groups, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> the opposition that only a cooperation of secular military forces and moderate Islamists could form a sufficient coalition to battle both the Syrian Government forces and radical Jihadists such as ISIL and in some cases al-Nusra Front.|$|E

25|$|After the Second World War, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> the British {{government}} that its African colonies were moving towards self-government {{at a faster}} pace than previously envisaged, so the condition of African residents on the estates {{could no longer be}} ignored. African political consciousness was growing and unused and under-used estate land could no longer be justified by an appeal to dubious 19th century claims. The increasing disturbances made resolution more urgent, and a commission of enquiry was set up.|$|R
