5|$|The Sharabha Upanishad {{mentions}} that shara means jiva ("soul") and Hari (Vishnu) is <b>gleaming</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of Sharabha, and that Hari has manifested as Sharabha who {{is capable of}} granting moksha (salvation). There is a reference to Sharabha in the Vishnu sahasranama, the 1000 names of Vishnu, and the literal meaning seems to suggest the praise of Sharabha (the lion-killing animal).|$|E
2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, <b>gleaming</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{filtering}} system, based on a new model which reshapes the aims of content-based filtering. The filtering system has been developed within the EC project PENG [3], aimed at providing news professionals, such as journalists, with a system supporting both filtering and retrieval capabilities. In particular, we suggest that <b>in</b> tackling <b>the</b> problem of information overload, {{it is necessary for}} filtering systems to take into account multiple aspects of incoming documents in order to estimate their relevance to a user's profile, and in order to help users better understand documents, as distinct from solely attempting to either select relevant material from a stream, or block inappropriate material. Aiming to so this, a filtering model based on multiple criteria has been defined, based on <b>the</b> ideas <b>gleamed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> project requirements stage. The filtering model is briefly described in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This thesis mainly {{concerns}} {{with the study}} on how the speakers overcome their problems in life in William Wordsworth's poems, Resolution and Independence and Ode: Intimations of Immortality From Recollections of Early Childhood. In Resolution and Independence, the speaker deals with his fear about his uncertain future life as a poet, while in Ode: Intimation of Immortality, the speaker deals with his loss of visionary <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. However, both speakers can face and solve their problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end. Based on this reason, the thesis writer is curious {{to know how they}} overcome their problems. She analyzes the poems by the use of literary tools, such as, imagery, tone, allusion, diction and some figures of speech, and also the theory of characterization. In Resolution and Independence, of which problem {{concerns with}} the fear of the future, the thesis writer finds out that the speaker is trapped in his own fear as a poet. After analyzing the poem, the thesis writer knows that the speaker is afraid of having the same unpleasant experiences like the other poets, such as, Thomas Chatterton and Robert Burns. Yet, he can overcome his fear and be resolute <b>in</b> mind after <b>the</b> encounter with the leech gatherer. He learns about optimism and endurance, thus he can defeat his fear and start facing his future life optimistically. While in Ode: Intimations of Immortality, of which problem concerns with the loss of visionary <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> childhood, <b>the</b> thesis writer detects that the speaker is still burdened with the loss at present. He cannot accept the loss and keep searching for it. Through the figure of a child, the speaker can finally realize that the loss is a natural process. It is a consequence of growing up to be a man. Along with this realization, the speaker can face and accept the loss. He knows that his effort to seek and bring back the loss will be useless. Later, as the conclusion, the thesis writer greatly expects the readers of this thesis might realize that the process to overcome problems in life requires both time and great efforts...|$|R
500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him." [...] For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.|$|R

25|$|In 1936 a {{fragment}} of a similar Temple warning inscription was found. After 1967, archaeologists found that the wall extended {{all the way around}} the Temple Mount and is part of the city wall near the Lions' Gate. Thus, the Western Wall is not the only remaining part of the Temple Mount. Currently, Robinson's Arch (named after American Edward Robinson) remains as the beginning of an arch that spanned the gap between the top of the platform and the higher ground farther away. This had been used by the priests as an entrance. Commoners had entered through the still-extant, but now plugged, gates on the southern side which led through colonnades to the top of the platform. One of these colonnades is still extant and reachable through the Temple Mount. The Southern wall was designed as a grand entrance. Recent archeological digs have found thousands of mikvehs (ceremonial bathtubs) for the ritual purification of the worshipers, as well as a grand stairway leading to the now blocked entrance. Inside the walls, the platform was supported by a series of vaulted archways, now called Solomon's Stables, which still exist and whose current renovation by the Waqf is extremely controversial.
