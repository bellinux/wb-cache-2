Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E

Similar animals like the long-tailed Rhamphorhynchus and Gnathosaurus were soon discovered around Europe and {{it became obvious that}} earth was once home to a diverse group of flying reptiles. The British anatomist Sir Richard Owen dubbed this vanished order the Pterosauria. Soon after, he described Britain's own first pterosaur, Dimorphodon. Later in the 19th century pterosaurs were discovered in North America as well, the first of which was a spectacular animal named Pteranodon by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh.|$|E

The recording sessions were overseen by noted anime and feature film sound director Toshio Sato, who followed Hiroi's request that the characters be portrayed as real people. Sato was initially shocked at being given four script books and being told <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> third of the entire script. Sato's instruction to the cast was {{that they would be}} the characters' main emotive force as their faces would not move much. Sakura was the last character to be recorded, so Sato could concentrate on how to bring out her heroine status alongside the other characters. One of the elements Sato concentrated on was portraying the fractious relationship between newcomer Sakura and established star Sumire. The sheer amount of voice acting was the main reason the game was delayed.|$|E
25|$|Before {{their debut}} in the EuroLeague, Neptūnas {{recalled}} former team leader Deividas Gailius. Multiple LKL champion Donatas Zavackas and UBL champion Michailas Anisimovas were signed as well. However, Anisimovas left the team shortly afterward without debuting in the EuroLeague due to the military crisis in Ukraine. On October 15, 2014, Neptūnas played their first EuroLeague game against the Laboral Kutxa, which they lost 69–88 despite playing more than two quarters point-to-point. On October 23, 2014, Neptūnas achieved the club's first EuroLeague victory against KK Crvena zvezda with a score of 83–81 after the Valdas Vasylius winning shot 3 seconds away from over-time. This was the first EuroLeague game played in the Neptūnas home-court. On October 31, 2014, Neptūnas lost their third EuroLeague game only after OT 81–85 {{against one of the}} strongest tournament teams, Olympiacos Piraeus, two times EuroLeague champion over the past three years. Despite being competitive and cherishing a chance of qualifying for the TOP16 stage, Neptūnas failed to accomplish this in their debut EuroLeague season, winning 4 games of 10 total and taking 5th place in the group. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> step from the TOP16's qualifier Galatasaray, who also finished with a 4–10 record. As a result, Neptūnas was transferred to the EuroCup Last 32 stage. The EuroCup was just a terrible place for Neptūnas. There they won only once against Paris-Levallois Basket, suffered five defeats and took last place in the group. A promising season in international competitions was finished painfully.|$|E

Barlow never had any intention of attempting a run but the Laws of cricket had to be observed and he was given out. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> in a catalogue of incidents that highlighted Grace's determination to [...] "win at all costs".|$|E

Author Georges Claude Guilbert wrote in his book, Madonna as Postmodern Myth, that her [...] "straggly, expensively unwashed look" [...] was {{comparable to that of}} singer Alanis Morissette and to Venetian paintings. According to Madonna she went for an Italian Renaissance look, invoking work of painter Raphael and Botticelli. Guilbert found the singer's description as catering to postmodernism, in tune with the zeitgeist, and noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of her [...] "many reinventions". The book recalled how Madonna [...] "quickly grew tired of the Botticelli-Earth Mother phase" [...] with subsequent singles being promoted with a new Asian inspired look. In the book Ex-foliations: Reading Machines and the Upgrade Path, author Terry Harpold commented about the time-lapse sequences, especially the image of a clock and its hands rotating past the hours. He felt that the clip portrays the daily life as a futile attempt for survival, enhanced by another shot showing the sonogram of a fetus in utero, and a hamster running on a wheel. Santiago Fouz-Hernández, {{one of the authors of}} Madonna's Drowned Worlds, described Madonna as esoteric in the clip, as well as [...] "skin-deep Beverly Hills spiritualism".|$|E
500|$|Away from acting, Hawke {{directed}} the music video for the 1994 song [...] "Stay (I Missed You)," [...] by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb, {{who was a}} member of Hawke's theater company at the time. In a 2012 interview, Hawke said that the song, which was included in Reality Bites, is the only number-one popular song by an unsigned artist in the history of music. He published his first novel in 1996, The Hottest State, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, [...] "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of the best things I ever did." [...] The book met with a mixed reception. Entertainment Weekly said that Hawke [...] "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in The Hottest State. If Hawke is serious... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues." [...] The New York Times thought Hawke did [...] "a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion", concluding that The Hottest State was ultimately [...] "a sweet love story".|$|E
