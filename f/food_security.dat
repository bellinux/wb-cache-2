5|$|<b>Food</b> <b>security</b> {{and food}} power {{are not the}} same thing. However, they are often {{directly}} related. <b>Food</b> <b>security</b> is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active, healthy life. Food power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get something in return. Many countries employ the exploit of food power to threaten another country's <b>food</b> <b>security.</b> A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating food power.|$|E

40|$|<b>Food</b> and {{nutrition}} <b>security</b> is a multi-dimensional subject. The {{definition of the}} FAO in 1996, i. e. “when all people at all times have access to sufficient, {{safe and nutritious food}} that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”, presents the following four core dimensions. It includes: a) physical availability of food, b) economic and physical access to food, c) food utilization, and d) stability of the other three dimensions. Consequently, achieving <b>food</b> {{and nutrition}} <b>security,</b> as the main goal of food systems, requires adequate Food Availability, Food Accessibility, Food Utilization and Food Stability. The pathway to <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>security</b> begins by exploring the challenges, whose knowledge is needed for developing adequate solutions. Thus, decision-making is the process of discovering the best decision from all of the possible alternatives. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Models have received much consideration from researchers as a tool to assess and rank alternatives. Amongst various multi-criteria decision-making models, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) remains to work adequately. The major focus of the paper is to provide a synthesizing judgment about the <b>Food</b> and Nutrition <b>Security</b> (FNS) performance, including multiple and conflict criteria. We apply TOPSIS technique as a multi-criteria method, to build a dynamic quantitative national-level <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>security</b> index {{to be used as a}} benchmark for all dimensions of <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>security,</b> and prioritize the vulnerabilities of food system in the delivery of <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>security</b> in Iran. Using this technique, we survey how the food system has worked to provide <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>security</b> over time, in order to check if it has improved or worsened. We also analyze the level of overall vulnerability of food system by investigating changes in the four dimensions of <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>security</b> over the time in Iran...|$|R
5|$|Crop {{diversity}} loss threatens global <b>food</b> <b>security,</b> as the world's {{human population}} {{depends on a}} diminishing number of varieties of a diminishing number of crop species. Crops are increasingly grown in monoculture, meaning that if, as in the historic Irish Potato Famine, a single disease overcomes a variety's resistance, it may destroy an entire harvest, or {{as in the case}} of the 'Gros Michel' banana, may cause the commercial extinction of an entire variety. With the help of seed banks, international organizations are working to preserve crop diversity.|$|E

In Thailand, there are 20,000 farmers rearing crickets, with an estimated production of 7,500 tons per year and United Nation's FAO has implemented a project in Laos to improve cricket farming and consequently <b>food</b> <b>security.</b> The food conversion efficiency of house crickets (Acheta domesticus) is 1.7, some five times higher than that for beef cattle, and if their fecundity is taken into account, 15 to 20 times higher.|$|E

40|$|Abstract only. Much of fish {{consumed}} by the poor are caught by household members and traded in local markets. These fish trades are rarely or poorly included in national statistics, and it is therefore difficult to estimate precisely the real contribution of fish to <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>security.</b> The WorldFish Center recently completed a global review {{on the role of}} fish for <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>security</b> of the poor in low-income countries. This presentation will synthesize the main findings of this research, highlighting the pathways through which fish can contribute to <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>security.</b> For this, both small-scale fisheries and aquaculture sectors are considered. The presentation also discusses the methodology as to how we can statistically demonstrate the contributions of fish to <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>security...</b>|$|R
5|$|Over 3 million {{vessels are}} {{employed}} in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide <b>food</b> <b>security</b> to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.|$|E
5|$|Reports from Burundi and Angola warn of {{a threat}} to <b>food</b> <b>security</b> caused by the African Cassava Mosaic Virus (ACMD). ACMD is {{responsible}} for the loss of a million tons of cassava each year. CMD is prevalent in all the main cassava-growing areas in the Great Lakes region of east Africa, causing between 20 and 90 percent crop losses in the Congo. The FAO emergency relief and rehabilitation program is assisting vulnerable returnee populations in the African Great Lakes Region through mass propagation and distribution of CMD resistant or highly tolerant cassava.|$|E
5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide <b>food</b> <b>security</b> for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems. Ethnobotany {{is the study of}} the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plant–people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants. This relationship the indigenous people had with plants was recorded by ethnobotanists.|$|E

Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human <b>food</b> <b>security,</b> biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Jatropha is {{native to}} Mexico and Central America and was likely transported to India and Africa in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors {{convinced}} it had medicinal uses. In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten <b>food</b> <b>security</b> and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce jatropha.
