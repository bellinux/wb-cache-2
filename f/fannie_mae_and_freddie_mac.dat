5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E

5|$|In February 2014, Politico {{reported}} that in October 2008, Bevin had signed a report for his investment fund that praised the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government takeover of <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac.</b> During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator. When Beck asked Bevin about the issue during an interview, Bevin said {{the content of the}} report had been written by the fund's chief investment officer, and that he had only signed it because he was legally required to do so as president of the fund. Later, Bevin added that he had not physically signed the letter, but that his signature was added to the document digitally. Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data. The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters. His campaign offered no explanation for the inconsistency.|$|E

5000|$|From the {{beginning}} of his tenure as Director of OFHEO, Lockhart warned about the systemic risks Fannie <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> posed to the financial system and the need for Congress to grant OFHEO additional regulatory powers. In December 2006, Lockhart wrote an article stating that <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac’s “government charters enable these companies to take on more risk than other major financial institutions. In addition to their significant operational difficulties, the Enterprises have lower capital requirements than banks, massive investment and derivative portfolios, limited discipline from credit markets, an inability to diversify their investments and no limit on bank investments in their securities…Fannie <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> Mac present very large systemic risks to financial markets and financial institutions.

25|$|On May 8, 2013, Representative Scott Garrett {{introduced}} the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill, {{if it were}} passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac.</b> The bill would require {{that the cost of}} direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The changes made by the bill would mean that <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac</b> {{were allowed}} to hold less capital than normal {{financial}} institutions: e.g., they {{were allowed to}} sell mortgage-backed securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions. Regulations exist through the FDIC Bank Holding Company Act that govern the solvency of financial institutions. The regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capital/asset ratio {{greater than or equal to}} 3%. The GSEs, <b>Fannie</b> <b>Mae</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freddie</b> <b>Mac,</b> are exempt from this capital/asset ratio requirement and can, and often do, maintain a capital/asset ratio less than 3%. The additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times, but put the companies at greater risk in bad times, such as during the subprime mortgage crisis. FNMA is not exempt from state and local taxes. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC are exempt from SEC filing requirements; they file SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports, but many other reports, such as certain reports regarding their REMIC mortgage securities, are not filed.|$|E
