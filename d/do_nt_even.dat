We have combined pyrophosphate-based high-throughput sequencing and computational analysis to identify and analyze, in genome scale, cis-NAT and trans-NAT small RNAs that are derived under normal conditions and in response to drought and salt stresses in the staple plant Oryza sativa. Computationally, we identified 344 cis-NATs and 7142 trans-NATs that are formed by protein-coding genes. From the deep sequencing data, we found 108 cis-NATs and 7141 trans-NATs that gave rise to small RNAs from their overlapping regions. Consistent with early findings, the majority of these 108 cis-NATs seem to be associated with specific conditions or developmental stages. Our analyses also revealed several interesting results. The overlapping regions of the cis-NATs and trans-NATs appear to be more enriched with small RNA loci than non-overlapping regions. The small RNAs generated from cis-NATs and trans-NATs have a length bias of 21 <b>nt,</b> <b>even</b> though their lengths spread over a large range. Furthermore, > 40 % of the small RNAs from cis-NATs and trans-NATs carry an A as their 5 ′-terminal nucleotides.

Neurite outgrowth from explants of 8 -d chick embryo dorsal root ganglia was achieved at very low NGF concentrations with heart conditioned medium during overnight culture. Quickly incrasing the NGF concentration in the growth medium dramatically affected GC and neurite morphology: the majority of GCs and neurites collapsed and retracted towards the cell body over a course of approximately 2 - 5 min. Retraction was elicited by increasing NGF levels from 0 to 0. 05 ng/ml to as little as 0. 5 ng/ml but did not occur if the NGF concentration during the initial overnight culture period exceeded 0. 8 ng/ml, regardless of how much the concentration was elevated. Similar concentration changes of cytochrome c or insulin <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> result in retraction. Neurites that had been separated from their cell bodies by cutting close to their exit from the explant still retracted when NGF levels were raised. Cytochalasin B reversible inhibits retraction, whereas colchicine allows retraction to occur.

Six runoff plots of 22. 5 m(2) (2. 25 x 10 m) under NT and T since 2002 were considered. At each plot, soil bulk density (rho(b)) and SOC content of the 0 - 0. 02 m layer were estimated at nine pits. Top-soil SOC stocks were 26 % higher under NT than under T (P = 0. 001). The NT reduced soil losses by 68 % (96. 8 vs. 301. 5 g m(- 2) yr(- 1), P = 0. 001) and SOC losses by 52 % (7. 7 vs. 16. 2 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1), P = 0. 001), and differences in runoff were not significant. Dissolved organic carbon accounted for about 10 % of total SOC losses and showed significantly higher concentrations under T than NT (1. 49 versus 0. 86 mg C m(- 2) yr(- 1)).

Experiments were conducted at 25 °C in 25 ml capacity vials with 20 ml of medium into which we introduced B. calyciflorus at an initial density of 1 ind ml- 1. The experimental design consisted a total of 33 test vessels (2 food combinations X 5 densities X 3 replicates = 30 plus 3 replicates as controls that contained only algae). Experiments were terminated after day 16. Waste water in original concentration <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> rotifes. However, when diluted to 5 oncentrations (ranging from 2 % to 32 % and pH adjusted to 7. 0), rotifer density increased with increasing concentration of waste water. Green algae (at constant density of 2 X 10 6 cells- 1 of Chlorella) in combination with waste water resulted in a higher abundance of rotifers only at higher concentration (above 8 %) of waste water. The maximum peak density of rotifers (238 - 50 ind ml - 1) was obtained at 16 % dilution of waste water nd with addition of Chlorella. The rate of population increase per day ® (mean-SD) varied from 0. 355 - 0. 059 to 0. 457 - 0. 048 depending on food combination and concetration. Se usó aguas de desecho de la industria de la masa y la tortilla (aguas de nixtamal o nejayote) para crecer rotíferos de agua dulce, Brachionus calyciflorus. El nejayote sin dilución no permitió el desarrollo del rotífero. Sin embargo, cuando se diluyó, B. calyciflorus aprovechó la materia orgánica. El agua de desecho por sí misma (sin alimento algal adicional) fue comparable al agua con densidades del alga Chlorella de 2 X 10 (6) células ml- 1. Concentraciones de nejayote por encima del 8 % no permitieron el crecimiento poblacional. Sin embargo, la presencia de alga permitió el desarrollo del rotífero a concentraciones de 8 % y 16 %. Nuestros hallazgos indican que el nejayote puedo ser utilizado de manera efectiva para la producción de rotíferos a gran escala para la acuacultura...|$|R
