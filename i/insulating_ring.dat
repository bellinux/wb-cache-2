40|$|Abstract. Anomalous strong {{resonances}} {{in silver}} and gold nano-porous thin films which conduct are found to arise from isolated metal nano-islands separated from the surrounding percolating metal network by a thin loop of insulator. This observed resonant optical response is modelled. The observed peak position is {{in agreement with the}} observed average dimensions of the silver core and insulator shell. As the <b>insulating</b> <b>ring</b> thickness shrinks the resonance moves to longer wavelengths and strengthens. This structure is the Babinet’s principle counterpart of dielectric core-metal shell nanoparticles embedded in dielectric. Like the latter tuning of resonant absorption is possible, but here the matrix reflects rather than transmits and tuning to longer wavelengths is more practical. A new class of metal mirror for a single thin layer is identified using the same resonances in dense metal mirrors. Narrow band deep localised dips in reflectance result...|$|E

40|$|Initial {{steps to}} apply a ceramic {{multi-layer}} technique {{to build a new}} sensor for a Tian–Calvet calorimeter are presented in this contribution. The new sensor has a stacked design of ceramic sensor discs and <b>insulating</b> <b>rings.</b> The development was finite-element method (FEM) supported to design the sensor disc. In the next step, the function of the sensor disc was proven up to a temperature of 600  °C. Finally, the entire stack was tested at room temperature, delivering a resolution of 5  µW and a maximum sensitivity of 8. 5  µV mW − 1. The time constant is strongly dependent on the mass of the cuvette. We show that the time constant of the sensor can be more exactly characterized when using a novel low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) cuvette with a low mass and an integrated heater. Then, the time constant can be reduced to T 1 ∕ e [*]=[*] 118  s. The new sensor shows similar specifications as commercial devices and presents a good starting point for future high temperature applications...|$|R

Optical emission spectroscopy and mass loss measurements have been employed to quantify gross chemical erosion and net erosion yields, respectively. Effects of the ion impact energy and target geometry on carbon erosion yields have been studied. It is concluded that temporal evolution of gross chemical erosion is strongly connected with changes in morphology of plasma exposed surfaces.

40|$|A {{mesoscopic}} conducting ring {{pierced by}} magnetic flux {{is known to}} support the persistent electron current. Here we propose possibility of the persistent current in the ring made of the perfect crystalline insulator. We consider a ring-shaped lattice of one-dimensional "atoms" with a single energy level. We express the Bloch states in the lattice as a linear combination of atomic orbitals. The discrete energy level splits into the energy band {{which serves as a}} simple model of the valence band. We show that the <b>insulating</b> <b>ring</b> (with the valence band fully filled by electrons) supports a nonzero persistent current, because each atomic orbital overlaps with its own tail when making one loop around the ring. In the tight-binding limit only the neighboring orbitals overlap. In that limit the persistent current at full filling becomes zero which is a standard result. Comment: Conference proceedings.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} blackbody cavity {{has been}} designed and built for calibrating infrared radiometers used to measure radiant temperatures {{in the range from}} about 200 to about 273 K. In this below-room-temperature range, scattering of background infrared radiation from room-temperature surfaces could, potentially, contribute significantly to the spectral radiance of the blackbody cavity, thereby contributing a significant error to the radiant temperature used as the calibration value. The present blackbody cavity is of an established type in which multiple reflections from a combination of conical and cylindrical black-coated walls are exploited to obtain an effective emissivity greater than the emissivity value of the coating material on a flat exposed surface. The coating material in this case is a flat black paint that has an emissivity of approximately of 0. 91 in the thermal spectral range and was selected over other, higher-emissivity materials because of its ability to withstand thermal cycling. We found many black coatings cracked and flaked after thermal cycling due to differences in the coefficient of expansion differences. On the basis of theoretical calculations, the effective emissivity is expected to approach 0. 999. The cylindrical/conical shell enclosing the cavity is machined from copper, which is chosen for its high thermal conductivity. In use, the shell is oriented vertically, open end facing up, and inserted in a Dewar flask filled with isopropyl alcohol/dry-ice slush. A flange at the open end of the shell is supported by a thermally <b>insulating</b> <b>ring</b> on the lip of the Dewar flask. The slush cools the shell (and thus the black-body cavity) to the desired temperature. Typically, the slush starts at a temperature of about 194 K. The slush is stirred and warmed by bubbling dry air or nitrogen through it, thereby gradually increasing the temperature through the aforementioned calibration range during an interval of several hours. The temperature of the slush is monitored by use of a precise thermocouple probe...|$|E

Such an ionizer sits {{on top of the}} quadrupole mass filter and consists of a short, gas-tight tube with two openings for the entrance of electrons and exit of ions. The ions are formed close to a single extraction plate and exit the ionizer. Electrically <b>insulated</b> alumina <b>rings</b> seal the tube and the biased electrodes {{from the rest of the}} quadrupole mass assembly.

Such design has been applied to gas chromatography mass spectrometry instruments before adaption by quadrupole gas analyzers. Most commercially available CIS systems operate between [...] and [...] Torr and offer ppm level detectability over the entire mass range for process pressures between [...] and [...] Torr. The upper limit is set by reduction in mean free path for ion-neutral collisions which takes place at higher pressures, and results in the scattering of ions and reduced sensitivity.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} discussion and summary of static and dynamic track distortions in the HARP TPC {{in terms of}} physical origin, mathematical modelling and correction algorithms. `Static' distortions are constant with time, while `dynamic' distortions are distortions that occur only during the 400 ms long accelerator spill. The measurement of dynamic distortions, their mathematical modelling and the correction algorithms build on our understanding of static distortions. In the course of corroborating the validity of our static distortion corrections, their reliability and precision was further improved. Dynamic TPC distortions originate dominantly from the `stalactite' effect: a column of positive-ion charge starts growing at the begin of the accelerator spill, and continues growing with nearly constant velocity out from the sense-wire plane into the active TPC volume. However, the `stalactite' effect {{is not able to}} describe the distortions that are present already {{at the start of the}} spill and which have a sign opposite to the one of `stalactite' distortions. The 'margaritka' effect accounts for this: the radially outward oriented electric field generated by a deposit of positive ions on the <b>insulating</b> inner <b>ring</b> of the TPC readout chamber...|$|R

Temperature profiles for the steady and unsteady states have been measured. In modeling, the Ergun equation and energy equations are solved to calculate the temperature profile for the steady-state only. It has been found that the introduction of the packing into the air flow passage increases the wall-to-fluid heat transfer approximately three times compared with that of empty bed. This finding can enhance the rational use of energy from solar air heaters, chemical reactors, electronic cooling and many other engineering applications.

40|$|A new {{reciprocating}} Langmuir probe {{has been}} used to measure density and temperature profiles, ion flow, and potential fluctuation levels from the lower divertor floor up to the X-point on the DIII-D tokamak. This probe is designed to make fast (2 kHz swept, 20 kHz Mach, 500 kHz Vfloat) measurements with 2 mm spatial resolution in the region where the largest gradients on the plasma open flux tubes are found and therefore provide the best benchmarks for SOL and divertor numerical models. Profiles are constructed using the 300 ms time history of the probe measurements during the 25 cm reciprocating stroke. Both single and double null plasmas can be measured and compared with a 20 Hz divertor Thomson scattering system. The probe head is constructed of four different kinds of graphite to optimize the electrical and thermal characteristics.

40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} (CPs) {{are promising}} materials for fluorescence imaging application. However, {{a significant problem}} in this field is the unexplained abnormally low fluorescence brightness (or number of fluorescence photons detected per one excitation photon) exhibited by most of CP single chains in solid polymer hosts. Here it is shown that this detrimental effect can be fully avoided for short chains of polyfluorene-bis-vinylphenylene (PFBV) embedded in a host polymer matrix of PMMA, if the conjugated backbone is <b>insulated</b> by cyclodextrin <b>rings</b> to form a polyrotaxane (PFBV-Rtx). Fluorescence kinetics and quantum yields are measured for the polymers in liquid solutions, pristine films, and solid PMMA blends. The fluorescence brightness of PFBV-Rtx single chains dispersed in a solid PMMA {{is very close to}} that expected for a chain with 100 % fluorescence quantum yield, while the unprotected PFBV chains of the same length possess 4 times lower brightness. Despite this, the fluorescence decay kinetics are the same for both polymers, suggesting the presence of static or ultrafast fluorescence quenching in the unprotected polymer. About 80 % of an unprotected PFBV chain is estimated to be completely quenched. The hypothesis is that the cyclodextrin rings prevent the quenching by working as 'bumpers' reducing the mechanical forces applied by the host polymer to the conjugated backbone and help retaining its conformational freedom. While providing a recipe for making CP fluorescence bright at the single-molecule level, these results identify a lack of fundamental understanding in the community of the influence of the environment on excited states in conjugated materials...|$|R
40|$|Spatiotemporal pattern {{formation}} {{through the}} interplay of chemical reactions and electrical effects is a wide-spread phenomenon. It occurs at biological membranes (e. g., in nerve cells and muscle tissue), but has been most extensively studied in electrochemistry. The present work discussed self-organized spatiotemporal behavior in nonlinear electrochemical systems as exemplified by the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid on Pt. The most important quantity for the kinetics of any electrochemical reaction is the interfacial potential (or double layer potential) at the electrode/electrolyte interface. It also constitutes an essential variable for almost all nonlinear phenomena observed in electrochemical systems. In this environment, the equations describing spatiotemporal patterns of interfacial potential are composed of a local (reaction) term and a part describing the spatial coupling through the electric field in the electrolyte. The spatial coupling through the electric field is termed migration coupling, and consequently, {{the evolution of the}} double layer potential is said to be described by a reaction-migration equation (RME). Different geometries of the electrode setup give rise to different coupling properties. Using a ring as working electrode (sufficiently narrow to neglect radial patterns), all points of the working electrode are equivalent and affected equally by the external control as long as the reference electrode is placed symmetrically {{in the center of the}} ring; the sign of the long-range coupling is determined by the vertical distance between working and reference electrode. In contrast, on a ribbon electrode not all points are equivalent, moreover the coupling function diverges at the edges due to electrostatic effects. The symmetry of a ring electrode was broken in the present work by either asymmetric placing of the reference electrode changing the local properties without introducing singularities in the coupling, or by insulating parts of the ring which introduces edge effects similar to the ribbon electrode while otherwise essentially preserving the equivalence of points along the azimuthal direction. The experiments on pattern formation under galvanostatic or potentiostatic conditions were carried out with the formic acid oxidation on platinum electrodes in the presence of bismuth ions (Bi 3 +) which enhanced the oxidation of formic acid at low potential and led to the high current oscillations over a broad potential region. In chapter 3 potential oscillations in the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid with and without bismuth ions on a Pt ring electrode were investigated for symmetric geometry under galvanostatic conditions. Period-doubling and chaos (Feigenbaum scenario) were observed at fixed current. Characterization of the resulting chaotic attractors clearly suggested a Shil’nikov homoclinic orbit in the temporal behavior, at the same time the ring electrode remained always strictly in phase, demonstrating the occurrence of purely temporal chaos. In chapter 4 an asymmetric condition was imposed on the ring electrode by removing the reference electrode from the central axis. We studied the effect of the asymmetrically placed reference electrode in the bistable and oscillatory regime. The transitions between active and passive state in the bistable regime were very similar to the symmetric situation, but in addition asymmetry-induced double metastability was obtained. New types of patterns were observed in the oscillatory region. Apart from periodic, spatially inhomogeneous oscillations, complex aperiodic behavior with more and less prolonged quiescent phases were observed. The latter phases are probably indicative of many coexisting attractors predicted earlier [34]. A ribbon electrode (chapter 5) has different dynamic regimes because the local effective resistance and the migration coupling depend on the different positions of the ribbon. Since the local effective resistance is smallest at the edges of the ribbon electrode, the local function diverges and the coupling strength increases at the edges. Using a short distance between reference and working electrode, transitions via front propagation from passive to active states could be induced by a trigger electrode placed at one end of the ribbon, both locally and (by reversing the sign of the perturbation) at the opposite edge (remote triggering). For identical parameters, transitions from the active to the passive state as well as vice versa could be triggered (asymmetry-induced double metastability). Anti-phase edge oscillations for different positions of the reference electrode could be rationalized in terms of negative coupling and local inhomogeneity. On the other hand, in-phase edge oscillations were detected when the reference electrode was located far from the ribbon electrode, attributed to positive coupling. An asymmetrically placed reference electrode led to a patterned oscillation in which one side of the electrode oscillated with a frequency twice as high as the other side of electrode. Chapter 6 focused on a pure edge effect, i. e., insulated areas were introduced on an otherwise symmetric arrangement of the ring electrode and their effect on the pattern formation investigated. The basic pattern sequence for a symmetric ring (standing waves, travelling pulses, anti-phase oscillations with increasing voltage) had its analogues on ring electrodes which had 1, 2, or 3 small symmetrically placed insulated areas. Spontaneous emergence of active fronts always occurred at maximum distance from the conductor/insulator edges, in agreement with ribbon electrodes. Oscillations in-phase or out-of-phase at adjacent edges were comparable too, but differed in their relative parameter values from similar results on a ribbon. Some patterns on partially <b>insulated</b> <b>ring</b> electrodes did not have a counterpart in either ring or ribbon systems. These include period-doubled pulses and trapped oscillatory states, as well as the local velocity changes of travelling pulses due to the influence of the insulated parts. For not too broad insulated areas, travelling pulse waves accelerated near the insulators and jumped across them (saltatory conduction). This can readily be attributed to the fact that the coupling rises (and actually diverges) at a conductor/insulator interface. Consequently a pulse approaching an insulated area coupled very strongly to those parts of the electrode adjacent to the insulator and activated (or passivated) them much more rapidly than in regions far away from the insulated part. These findings may be of interest for certain biological systems (such as myelinated nerve axons). The aim of the present work was to provide experimental evidence for the influence of the geometry and symmetry of the electrode setup on the dynamics of electrochemical reactions. The results were achieved by studying HCOOH electro-oxidation on Pt using different geometries of the working electrode, different electrode arrangements, and the introduction of symmetry-breaking insulated areas...|$|R
