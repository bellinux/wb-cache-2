40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the quality of care {{provided}} at emergency departments (<b>ED)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands by <b>analysing</b> medical liability insurance claims. METHODS: A retrospective study performed by reviewing records at MediRisk, presently the largest insurer for medical liability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. The following data were abstracted from the files available for analysis: medical discipline involved, physician involved (resident or consultant), nature and gravity of the complaint, and final claim disposition. RESULTS: Between 1993 and 2001 a total of 326 claims involving the ED were filed at MediRisk. Of these, 256 claims (79 %) were closed and were available for analysis. Medical liability claims were filed primarily for alleged errors in diagnosis and treatment. The majority of claims involved minor surgical conditions: fractures, luxations (joint dislocations), wounds and tendon injuries (210 / 256, 82 %). Residents were involved in 76 % of the claims; resident supervision by a consultant was documented in only 15 % of the medical records. Permanent patient disability resulting from improper ED treatment was alleged in 22 % of the claims. Four per cent of the claims involved the death of a patient. Physicians accepted liability in 16 % of the claims filed. Indemnity payments during the 8 -year study period totalled Euros 504, 000. CONCLUSION: The number of medical liability claims is low compared with the number of patients treated <b>in</b> <b>ED</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. Claims primarily concerned alleged mistakes <b>in</b> diagnosis and <b>the</b> treatment of minor trauma. Residents were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> majority of the claims. More resident supervision is needed, as are specific training programmes for emergency physicians...|$|R
