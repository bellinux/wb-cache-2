5|$|The first metagenomic studies {{conducted}} using high-throughput sequencing used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing. Three other technologies commonly applied to <b>environmental</b> <b>sampling</b> are the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system. These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25-75bp reads. Historically, these read lengths were significantly {{shorter than the}} typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~750bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200–500megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20–50gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years. An additional advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing {{one of the main}} biases and bottlenecks in <b>environmental</b> <b>sampling.</b>|$|E

The reports provide specifics on the <b>environmental</b> <b>sampling</b> of sediment, water, and marine life that is done to ascertain whether the submarine has significantly affected the deep-ocean environment.

The nuclear fuel aboard the submarine remains intact and no uranium in excess of levels expected from the fallout from past atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons has been detected by the Navy's inspections. In addition, Scorpion carried two nuclear-tipped Mark 45 anti-submarine torpedoes (ASTOR) when she was lost. The warheads of these torpedoes are part of the environmental concern. The most likely scenario is that the plutonium and uranium cores of these weapons corroded to a heavy, insoluble material soon after the sinking, and they remain at or close to their original location inside the torpedo room of the boat. If the corroded materials were released outside the submarine, their density and insolubility would cause them to settle into the sediment.|$|E

50|$|Tetrapods exhibit both a {{main and}} {{accessory}} olfactory system. The main olfactory sense {{is derived from}} the more ancient neural system, broadly present across insects and mammals. This system is specialized to detect volatile, airborne molecules. The accessory olfactory system is the more recently evolved structure, first appearing in the common ancestor of modern amniotes and amphibians. The detection of non-volatile molecules and chemoreception seems to be the primary function of this system, as the accessory organ (Jacobson’s organ) contains vomeronasal receptors responsible for <b>environmental</b> <b>sampling.</b> Quantitative research has suggested that the relative size of the main olfactory bulb is highly correlated with ecological adaptations, while the relative size of the accessory olfactory bulb is related to sociosexual factors.|$|E
50|$|Pakistan {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} in which poliomyelitis has not been eradicated. As of 2008, there were a total of 89 reported cases of polio in Pakistan. Polio cases may be on an increase. The year 2010 saw an increase in the number of cases as well as identification of polio from new locations. Experts from the national program and the WHO felt that the new cases identified from southern Punjab and northern Sindh may have resulted from importation of infections from other locations in Pakistan. Locations in FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain hosts for year-round persistence of infection and <b>environmental</b> <b>sampling</b> by the national program, and WHO suggests that polio remains endemic in many other parts of the country.|$|E
