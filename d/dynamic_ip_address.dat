40|$|For Internet {{telephony}} systems, it {{is necessary}} to establish a connection between a caller and recipient using the Internet Protocol (<b>IP)</b> <b>address</b> before actual voice communication can take place. A problem of <b>dynamic</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addressing</b> arises when the connection to the Internet is made through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) since the <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> is dynamically allocated only at connection time.

Based on the distinct characteristics observed, we propose a scanning-based technique for identifying <b>dynamic</b> <b>IP</b> <b>addresses</b> in blocks. We conduct an experiment using a month-long data collected from our campus network, and instead of scanning our own network, we utilize identified outside scanning traffic.

The result was that a user with a <b>dynamic</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> could only use BE's own SMTP server or one configured to use non-standard ports for sending email.

50|$|Hardware-based {{management}} {{works at}} a different level from software applications, and uses a communication channel (through the TCP/IP stack) {{that is different from}} software-based communication (which is through the software stack in the operating system).

A <b>dynamic</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> assignment protocol like DHCP requires centralized servers that may not be present in MANETs. Hence, we propose a distributed protocol for <b>dynamic</b> <b>IP</b> <b>address</b> assignment to nodes in MANETs.
