40|$|Effective control {{methods are}} of high {{importance}} {{to establish and}} maintain certain water qual-ity standards. Eutrophication and annual phytoplankton blooms {{play an important role in}} the Baltic Sea. The cyanobacteria dominated summer bloom causes special problems in that eco-system, not only because of the ability to fixate atmospheric nitrogen, but also for the capabil-ity of producing cyanotoxins, harming other life forms. An impact on human life is given di-rectly by blooms being washed ashore, as well as indirectly through the food chain. In Situ measurements in wide aquatic areas are time-consuming and expensive, yet only give spatial-ly and temporally limited information. A special algorithm addressing the <b>specific</b> <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea is developed at the Marine Remote Sensing group of the German Aerospace Centre. Based on inherent <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of cyanobacteri-al pigments and other water constituents, a four component model with parameters for Chlo-rophyll-a, Phycocyanin, Suspended matter and CDOM was developed for the optically com-plex Baltic Sea. Using the simulated dataset, a neural network was trained for the task of in-verting atmospherically corrected MERIS reflectances. This algorithm extends the set of standard water quality products (C,S,Y) by a qualitative new parameter for the pigment Phy-cocyanin and accounts for the <b>specific</b> <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of the Baltic Sea.

Also, the problems of measuring in situ spectral backscattering are addressed. It is shown how measured <b>specific</b> inherent <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> are used to parameterize semi-analytical bio-optical models. The models are then used to produce large synthetic data sets based {{on the distribution of}} water quality parameters, and from these data sets, band ratio or single band ratio algorithms for remote estimation of water quality parameters are constructed. A similar model was also used to calculate under water PAR from measured water quality parameters. The <b>specific</b> inherent <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> of Swedish lakes and coastal waters are very similar to earlier reported data from the oceanic environment. However, different relations of the water quality parameters will affect the inherent <b>optical</b> <b>properties</b> absorption and backscattering. The absorption spectra are dominated by yellow substance with terrestrial origin. Phytoplankton absorption is low, and account in general only for about 10 % of the total absorption in regions where phytoplankton pigments are active. The spectral backscattering is dominated by suspended particulate inorganic matter. Phytoplankton backscattering is almost negligible, except in cases where the phytoplankton community is dominated by highly scattering cyanobacteria. Experiences from remote sensing campaigns and modeling shows that remote chlorophyll estimation is most effective at longer wavelengths, where the absorption of yellow substance is low. However, modeling also predicts that large uncertainties have to be expected in the estimation of chlorophyll, both from variation in the specific phytoplankton absorption and from influences of other optically active water quality parameters...|$|R
