40|$|After {{the catastrophic}} losses of three Hull deep sea {{trawlers}} in 1968, the Committee of Inquiry into Trawler Safety (CITS) was established. Fourteen months later, CITS reported on factors affecting {{the safety of}} deep sea trawlers and their crews. Pre-CITS (1961 - 70) and post-CITS (1971 - 80) crude mortality rates for accidents at work are compared for "deep sea" fishermen (those working on vessels {{greater than or equal}} to 24. 4 m (80 feet) registered length) and "inshore" fishermen (those working on vessels less than 24. 4 m). The ratio of deep sea to inshore fishermen had changed from 1 : 1. 5 (1961) to 1 : 7. 0 (1980), reflecting the radical restructuring of the fishing fleet that began in the early 1970 s. Between 1961 and 1980, there were 909 recorded deaths at sea of United Kingdom fishermen. Of these, 711 (78 %) were due to accidents (either from vessel losses or personal accidents) and 198 (22 %) were due to unspecified disease, homicide, and suicide. Comparison of pre-CITS and post-CITS mean death rates showed an increase (+ 39 %) for deep sea fishermen, a decrease (- 4 %) for <b>inshore</b> <b>fisherman,</b> and an increase (+ 2 %) for both combined. For deep sea fishermen, there were synchronous increases in mortality from vessel losses (+ 32 %) and from personal accidents (+ 49 %, p less than 0. 05) whereas the overall rate for inshore fishermen reflected a decrease (- 33 %, p less than 0. 01) in deaths from personal accidents but an increase (+ 52 %) in deaths from vessel losses. Although pre-CITS mortality rates exhibited no statistically significant difference between deep sea fisherman was significantly greater (p< 0. 02). Compared with coal miners, fishermen were, on average, four times more likely to die from accidents at work. If CITS had reasonable cause for concern in 1969, the grounds for similar concern did not diminish because the evidence suggests that deep sea fishermen were at no lesser risk of death from accidents after CITS reported than before. Overall, both groups of fishermen experienced an accident mortality rate between 1961 and 1980 that showed no indication of improvement...|$|E

Data for the study was collected from a surveyconducted between June and August 2007 where 100 fishermenin 14 villages were chosen by stratified sampling. Data envelopmentanalysis (DEA) and Tobit analysis were employed to determinethe technical efficiency level and factors influencing technicalefficiency among the fishermen. Results of the study show that,most fishing units exhibit a low degree of technical efficiency. This implies that either fishing inputs were used inefficiently orinsufficient inputs were used in fishing activities. The meantechnical efficiency for the sample was estimated to be 55 % forthe peak season and 40 % for the non peak season. About 37 %and 62 % of the fishermen had less than 40 % level of technicalefficiency in peak season and non peak season respectively.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of inshore fisheries to Scotland’s economy there has been lack of coherence between past management policies. Co-management strategies have become increasingly popular due to the theoretical benefits such as devolvement of decision making power to local communities, greater compliance and heightened transparency and accountability.

Such programmes instigate the formation of new relationships in contexts Scottish <b>Inshore</b> <b>fishermen</b> have unlikely encountered previously.

Information is gathered from interviews with individuals at the IFG, SSMO, Scottish Natural Heritage and the North Atlantic Fisheries College and is combined with recent historical data from newspapers and organisational websites. It is found from the research that several barriers exist for the successful implementation of new policies such as lack of government will, funding and data availability restrictions. It can be confidently stated that co-management is the optimum structure for fisheries management in Scotland when the environment, society and economy are working in synchrony.

40|$|The Newfoundland {{northern}} cod inshore fishery {{has been of}} great importance to both the Newfoundland economy and thousands of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishermen.</b> This fishery is associated with both spatial and temporal variations in landings. Various {{studies have been conducted}} to examine the relationships between landings and biological and oceanographical factors. However, these studies analyzed the relationships at an annual scale. Temporal and spatial variations in landings within a fishing season and among different geographical areas have not been formally investigated. No attempt has been made to forecast inshore cod landings thus far. This study, using the 1974 - 1991 data, examined the spatial and temporal variability and the relationships between temperature and the landing patterns in the inshore trap and gillnet fisheries. Several parametric and nonparametric forecast models of inshore landings were constructed and tested. Area, year and week effects and their interaction effects on inshore landings were identified and examined using ANOVA. Annual variation of the weekly landing patterns was found to be significantly influenced by water temperature. Significant spatial variation in weekly landing patterns was also found, probably due to the spatial difference of water temperature. Based on the jackknifed prediction sums of squares, probability density function (PDF) forecast models were shown to have some utility in forecasting inshore landings, particularly with respect to the inshore gillnet fishery...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the <b>inshore</b> <b>fishermen</b> in Canso, Nova Scotia and see if they are {{becoming}} proletarianized. It was believed that competition from the capital intensive off-shore fishery continually forced these men from ownership and control over their means of production to wage labour. Historically conceptualized as petty commodity producers they are increasingly losing their middle class status because of their inability to compete within the capitalist mode of production. This argument was based upon Marxist theory. To help us gain a more indepth picture of what factors enter into the fisherman 2 ̆ 7 s decision to give up fishing dependency theory was also used. The results found in the study were consistent with those trends in petty commodity production for all of Canada.

40|$|A {{description}} of fisheries within {{a depth of}} 100 fathoms is provided for the eight southeastern-most islands of the Hawaiian Archipelago, known as the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). These are the inhabited islands of the State of Hawaii and are those most subject to inshore fishing pressure, because of their accessibility. Between 1980 and 1990, an average of 1, 300 short tons of fishes and invertebrates were reported annually within 100 fm by commercial fishermen. Total landings may be significantly greater, since fishing is a popular pastime of residents and noncommercial landings are not reported. Although limited data are available on noncommercial fisheries, the majority of this review is based on reported commercial landings. The principal ecological factors influencing fisheries in the MHI include coastal currents, the breadth and steepness of the coastal platform, and differences in windward and leeward climate. Expansive coastal development, increased erosion, and sedimentation are among negative human impacts on inshore reef ecosystems on most islands. Commercial fisheries for large pelagics (tunas and billfishes) are important in inshore areas around Ni'ihau, Ka'ula Rock, Kauai, and the Island of Hawaii (the Big Island), as are bottom "handline" fisheries for snappers and groupers around Kauai and Molokai. However, many more <b>inshore</b> <b>fishermen</b> target reef and estuarine species. Two pelagic carangids, "akule," Selar crumenopthalmus, and "opelu," Decapterus macarellus, support the largest inshore fisheries in the MHI.

40|$|Bycatch of red {{king crab}} (Paralithodes camtschatica) in {{stationary}} fishing gears, q&ally gillnets, {{is an increasing}} problem to the <b>inshore</b> <b>fishermen</b> {{in the northern part}} of Norway (Finnmark county). The results are large bycatches of king crabs together with the crabs’ damages on the gear and catch. In the cod gillnet fisheries, the problem might be solved by using specially made gillnets (“norsel-mounted” nets) where the net itself is floated 0. 5 meters above the seabed. The norsel-mounted nets were compared with standard nets in the Varangerfjord (eastern Finnmark) in the period 17 March - 28 May 1999. The trials showed that norsel nets needed more floats than the standard nets to get the net to stand properly in the sea (to get the norsels stretched out suitably). By using extra float (rings) on the norsel mounted nets the bycatches of king crab were reduced to an acceptable level with an average of 0. 6 crabs/net, compared with 3. 3 crabs/net on standard and 6. 7 crabs/net on nor-se 1 nets without extra float. Norse 1 nets caught only about l/ 3 as many fish as standard nets. The catch results indicated that the gear configuration functioned in order to reduce the bycatch of red king crab. Loss of fish up to 65 % is, however not satisfying. Further work is needed to find a solution that gives a minimal loss of fish.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of dory building in the Bay of Islands in western Newfoundland using the analytical categories of design, construction, and use. Tradition and culture are separated to show how culture, the time specific part of boat building, operates within tradition, the components of boat building which persist through time. This study explores the significance of dory use and how the information gained by the builder through use may influence change in design, and therefore, construction. [...] Most of the material presented came from data collected in interviews with the area's boat builders who received their training from other builders. The boat types, which have been built and used in the area, have changed greatly over time. At first, original settlers brought boats with them {{from other parts of}} Newfoundland and then altered them upon reaching the Bay of Islands. After living there for about one hundred years the economic and technological contexts changed and fishermen and boat builders looked to a different boat design to meet the requirements of the change. At this point, the dory became the central focus of boat building activities. [...] Once it was evident that the dory would become the new boat for the area, builders began to experiment with design and construction in response to these environmental changes. During the past fifty years, the dory has developed from a row dory into an outboard powered dory used for lobster fishing, the mainstay of most <b>inshore</b> <b>fishermen</b> of the area. Dory development in the Bay of Islands took place within the confines of tradition, culture, personal expectations and innovation. While the tradition of boat building has remained in the area, it has undergone cultural changes {{in the form of the}} boat in which the tradition is manifested...|$|R

For instance, this thesis also documents, at least in part, the history of health care in Bonavista; particularly women's experiences of health care via their work as bearers and rearers of children. [...] From a theoretical perspective, the thesis examines Newfoundland's introduction to social welfare initiatives via Confederation, and argues that Bonavista women were not as significantly affected by Confederation, in financial terms, as much of the traditional economic and political historiography of Newfoundland suggests. Although many of the women interviewed indicated that Confederation had a positive effect on their lives, they often contradicted this by saying that the baby bonus/family allowance was too little to make any large difference in the household budget. Similarly, many stated that neither they nor their husbands received unemployment insurance for any significant periods of time. In fact, many respondents were adamant in expressing that they and their families did not rely on government money for their livelihood. Moreover, this thesis argues, Bonavista women were not so affected by Confederation because they had been raised to appreciate the value of hard work and, in turn, as adults they worked beyond the subsistence level to contribute to their household income...|$|R

They did not settle at Harbourville but logged the land which gained the location the name of Shingle Log Brook. The land around the brook was purchased by John Given and James Owens in 1824. They settled at the brook a few years later, built a pier and carried out logging as the area became known as Givens Wharf. The Hamilton family joined the settlement in 1829. The community became first a logging, then shipbuilding and trading centre exporting lumber and agricultural products from farms in the Berwick area of Annapolis Valley in the 1840s and 50s. On March 13, 1860 residents voted to choose the name Harbourville, reflection the sheltered harbour created by the book and piers.
