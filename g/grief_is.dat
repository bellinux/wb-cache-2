5|$|The history text Zubdat-al Tawarikh, {{dedicated}} to Sultan Murad III in 1583, narrates {{a story of}} Uzair's grief {{for the destruction of}} Jerusalem. His <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> said to have been so great that God took his soul and brought him back to life after Jerusalem was reconstructed. In the miniature accompanying the manuscript, the building on the lower right depicts the rebuilt city of Jerusalem in the form a typical sixteenth-century Ottoman building with a dome and an arched portico. The former ruins of Jerusalem are alluded to by the broken arches and columns on the left.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E
5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E

25|$|<b>Grief</b> <b>is</b> a {{multifaceted}} response to loss, {{particularly to the}} loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, and <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> the reaction to that loss.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a high level of {{skepticism}} about the universal and predictable “emotional pathway” that leads from distress to “recovery” with an appreciation that <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> a more complex process of adapting to loss than stage and phase models have previously suggested.|$|E
25|$|Art {{therapy and}} other creative, {{humanistic}} intervention strategies are becoming popular methods {{for working with}} life-threatened patient and for working with the family members of patients who die—particularly bereaved children. Art therapy stimulates the conscious and unconscious expression of the mourning process in adult and child patients. Children are at greater psychological risk because their <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> less overt and can occur {{months or even years}} after the death. Group therapy is used to provide social sanction for the expression of that grief and to promote adaptive mourning responses.|$|E

The date of the piece is unknown, but a date in the reign of Tiberius has been suggested because of that emperor's prominence in the poem.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grief</b> <b>is</b> {{a natural}} {{response}} to loss. It is the emotional suffering one feels when something or someone the individual loves is taken away. The grief associated with death {{is familiar to}} most people, but individuals grieve {{in connection with a}} variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship. Loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract, the physical loss being related to something that the individual can touch or measure, such as losing a spouse through death, while other types of loss are abstract, and relate to aspects of a person’s social interactions.|$|E

The Queen was devastated, {{and ordered}} her household, {{along with her}} daughters, to move from Windsor to Osborne House, the Queen's Isle of Wight residence.

His love {{operates}} on the subconscious level, and he relates to Lucy more as a spirit of nature than as a human being. The poet's <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> private, and {{he is unable to}} fully explain its source. When Lucy's lover is present, he is completely immersed in human interactions and the human aspects of nature, and the death of his beloved is a total loss for the lover. The 20th-century critic Spencer Hall argues that the poet represents a [...] "fragile kind of humanism".|$|E
500|$|Beatrice's {{life was}} {{overturned}} {{by the death}} of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901. She wrote to the Principal of the University of Glasgow in March, [...] "...you may imagine what the <b>grief</b> <b>is.</b> I, who had hardly ever been separated from my dear mother, can hardly realise what life will be like without her, who was the centre of everything." [...] Beatrice's public appearances continued, but her position at court was diminished. She, unlike her sister Louise, was not close to her brother, now King Edward VII, and {{was not included in the}} King's inner circle. Although their relationship did not break down completely, it was occasionally strained, for example when she accidentally (but noisily) dropped her service book from the royal gallery onto a table of gold plate during his coronation.|$|E
40|$|Objective Pregnancy {{termination}} for foetal abnormality (TFA) {{can have}} significant psychological repercussions, but {{little is known}} about the coping strategies involved in dealing with TFA. This study examined the relationships between women's coping strategies and perinatal grief. Method A total of 166 women completed a survey online. Coping and perinatal <b>grief</b> <b>were</b> measured using the Brief COPE and Short Perinatal <b>Grief</b> Scales. Data <b>were</b> analysed through multiple regression analyses. Results Despite using mostly adaptive coping strategies, women's levels of <b>grief</b> <b>were</b> high and varied according to obstetric and termination variables. <b>Grief</b> <b>was</b> predicted by behavioural disengagement, venting, planning, religion, self-blame, being recently bereaved, being childless at the time of TFA, not having had children/being pregnant since TFA and uncertainty about the decision to terminate the pregnancy. Acceptance and positive reframing negatively predicted grief. Conclusion Identifying women vulnerable to poor psychological adjustment and promoting coping strategies associated with lower levels of <b>grief</b> may <b>be</b> beneficial. This could be addressed through information provision and interventions such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy...|$|R

500|$|Shelley's first travel {{narrative}} and first published work, History of a Six Weeks' Tour, was published anonymously and was co-written with her husband. Rambles, {{on the other}} hand, places Mary Shelley at {{the centre of the}} narrative. It tells the story of [...] "the recovery of paradise" [...] and the fears of a mother. Her maternal sorrow is generalised. For example, in discussing the death of her daughter in 1818, she writes: [...] "I was agitated again by emotions—by passions—and those the deepest a woman's heart can harbour—a dread to see her child even at that instant expire—which then occupied me". Connecting these deep feelings to writings by Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Thomas Holcroft, she argues that intense emotion and environment are intertwined, contending that maternal <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> sublime.|$|E
500|$|The Dougy Center, {{established}} in 1982 in Portland, Oregon offers support groups {{and services to}} grieving children. It {{has been described as}} a [...] "safe haven where <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> normal", and is assisted by support groups, professional staff, and trained volunteer facilitators. Groups are separated by age (for example, the [...] "Littles" [...] group is for children ages 3–5) and type of death. Through a peer support model, children are encouraged to talk and play with one another, sharing their experiences in the process. Its peer support program and network of children's grief services make the organization the first of its kind in the United States. 500 independent programs around the world are based on its model, more than 300 of which have staff who were trained by the organization's staff. Its Summer Institute offers training for the leaders of other grief support programs.|$|E
500|$|It {{was widely}} known that Brown desired {{election}} to the U.S. Senate when his gubernatorial term expired in 1896. The leading Democratic candidates to succeed Brown as governor were his old rivals, Cassius M. Clay, Jr. and Parker Watkins Hardin, and Brown believed he would need his eventual successor's support to secure the Senate seat. Having already alienated Hardin and his free silver allies, Brown threw his support to Clay. Family tragedy would soon remove {{his interest in the}} race, however. On October30, 1894, Brown's teenage daughter Susan died of tuberculosis. A few months later, his son, Archibald Dixon Brown, divorced his wife; it was subsequently discovered that he had been carrying on an extramarital affair. Acting on an anonymous tip, his lover's husband found the couple at a brothel in Louisville; drawing his pistol, he shot his wife and Archibald Brown, killing them both. Of the series of family tragedies, Governor Brown wrote to Clay, [...] "I shall not be a candidate for the Senate. The calamities of my children, which have recently befallen, have utterly unfitted me for the contest. My <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> so severe that, like a black vampire of the night, it seems to have sucked dry the very arteries and veins of my ambition." [...] Clay went on to lose the nomination to Hardin. Brown refused to endorse Hardin, and the fractured Democratic party watched as the Republicans elected William O. Bradley, the party's first-ever governor of Kentucky. Despite Brown's proclaimed lack of interest in the Senate seat, he received one vote during the tumultuous 1896 Senate election to replace Senator J. C. S. Blackburn.|$|E

500|$|In {{the palace}} at Ithaca, Penelope mourns the long absence of Ulysses: [...] "The awaited {{one does not}} return, and the years pass by." [...] Her <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> echoed by her nurse, Ericlea. As Penelope leaves, her {{attendant}} Melanto enters with Eurimaco, a servant to Penelope's importunate suitors. The two sing passionately of their {{love for each other}} ("You are my sweet life"). The scene changes to the Ithacan coast, where the sleeping Ulisse is brought ashore by the Phaecians (Faeci), whose action is in defiance of the wishes of gods Giove and Nettuno. The Phaecians are punished by the gods who turn them and their ship to stone. Ulysses awakes, cursing the Phaecians for abandoning him: [...] "To your sails, falsest Phaeacians, may Boreas be ever hostile!" [...] From the goddess Minerva, who appears disguised as a shepherd boy, Ulisse learns that he is in Ithaca, and is told of [...] "the unchanging constancy of the chaste Penelope", {{in the face of the}} persistent importunings of her evil suitors. Minerva promises to lead Ulisse back to the throne if he follows her advice; she tells him to disguise himself so that he can penetrate the court secretly. Ulisse goes to seek out his loyal servant Eumete, while Minerva departs to search for Telemaco, Ulisse's son who will help his father reclaim the kingdom. Back at the palace, Melanto tries vainly to persuade Penelope to choose one of the suitors: [...] "Why do you disdain the love of living suitors, expecting comfort from the ashes of the dead?" [...] In a wooded grove Eumete, banished from court by the suitors, revels in the pastoral life, despite the mockery of Iro, the suitors' parasitic follower, who sneers: [...] "I live among kings, you here among the herds." [...] After Iro is chased away, Ulisse enters disguised as a beggar, and assures Eumete that his master the king is alive, and will return. Eumete is overjoyed: [...] "My long sorrow will fall, vanquished by you." ...|$|E
500|$|On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg {{conducted}} a private church {{service for the}} family and reported that Tatiana and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead. The final entry in Tatiana's final notebook at Yekaterinburg was a saying she had copied from {{the words of a}} well-known Russian Orthodox holy man, Father Ioann of Kronstadt: [...] "Your <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> indescribable, the Savior's grief in the Gardens of Gethsemane for the world's sins is immeasurable, join your grief to his, in it you will find consolation." [...] The following day, on 15 July, Tatiana and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked with one another and moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor. They got down on their hands and knees to help the women and whispered to them when the guards weren't looking. All four young women wore long black skirts and white silk blouses, the same clothing they had worn the previous day. Their short hair was [...] "tumbled and disorderly." [...] They told the women how much they enjoyed physical exertion and wished there was more of it for them to do in the Ipatiev House. On the afternoon of 16 July 1918, the last full day of her life, Tatiana sat with her mother and read from the Biblical Books of Amos and Obadiah, Alexandra noted in her diary. Later, mother and daughter sat and just talked. As the family was having dinner that night, Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, came in and announced that the family's kitchen boy and Alexei's playmate, 14-year-old Leonid Sednev, must gather his things and go to a family member. The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him {{along with the rest of}} the Romanov party. The family, unaware of the plan to kill them, was upset and unsettled by Sednev's absence. Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky's office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated her by telling her the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.|$|E

Stenson spoke of Steph's reasoning stating: [...] "With Gilly, she's embarrassed and doesn't want him to look after her." [...] Speaking of the storyline Quinlan stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "I think Gilly's really gutted that he didn't get together with Steph sooner - he wasted so much time with Cheryl and Jem, when really {{he was in love}} with her." [...] At one point Steph cancels her wedding to Gilly because he cannot accept she is dying, of this Quinlan states: [...] "His denial is not helping her. She's tying to take this in her stride and wants to spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes. She tells him he has to accept she's going to die or the wedding is off. and she hands back her engagement ring." [...] Quinlan has also stated he was eager for the pair to marry because of the [...] "tear jerking" [...] scenes it would create. Steph is killed off during a special week of episodes dubbed [...] "fire week". The cast filmed many stunts themselves, and Quinlan filmed scenes in front of a burning set, and he stated he [...] "was very manly about it" [...] whilst filming a ladder rescue scene. Gilly's immediate grief resulted in the characters name trending on Twitter, of this Quinlan stated: [...] "So glad that the ep had the impact that was desired! Buzzing Gilly is trended again!" [...] Gilly's <b>grief</b> <b>is</b> made worse because of Steph making the decision to die prematurely. Conversing this Quinlan said: [...] "He's grieving - he just can't understand why she took her life like that." [...] He added that Gilly's grief turns to anger because he cannot get the answers to his questions. Quinlan opined that he wanted Gilly to take a different root stating: [...] "I'd like to see Gilly go down a bit of a different route because he’s been a bit of a push-over in the past. I'd like to see his character progress a bit more and I'd like to see a side of him that we haven't seen before." [...] Gilly's grief then continued to get worse with Quinlan adding: [...] "The poor guy's heading off on a very dark journey that I'm sure he'll live to regret." [...] As Gilly is still so angry, at Steph's funeral, the director of the episode asked Quinlan not to cry at all during the ceremony. Quinlan added [...] "It was all so heartfelt, though, that I broke down for real a few times - and I think that's going to come across in the final episode." ...|$|E
