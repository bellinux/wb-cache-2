25|$|There {{are several}} common terms used for <b>Image</b> <b>Intensifier</b> tubes.|$|E
25|$|An <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> or <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube is {{a vacuum}} tube device for {{increasing}} the intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low-light conditions, such as at night, to facilitate visual imaging of low-light processes, such as fluorescence of materials in X-rays or gamma rays (X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifier),</b> or for conversion of non-visible light sources, such as near-infrared or short wave infrared to visible. They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a microchannel plate), and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night vision goggles.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tubes began during the 20th century, with continuous development since inception.|$|E
40|$|Night vision devices, such <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> and {{infrared}} imagers, {{are readily available}} {{to a host of}} nations, organizations, and individuals through international commerce. Once the trademark of special operations units, these devices are widely advertised to ''turn night into day''. In truth, they cannot accomplish this formidable task, but they do offer impressive enhancement of vision in limited light scenarios through electronically generated <b>images.</b> <b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> {{and infrared}} imagers are both electronic devices for enhancing vision in the dark. However, each is based upon a totally different physical phenomenon. <b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> amplify the available light energy whereas infrared imagers detect the thermal energy radiated from all objects. Because of this, each device operates from energy which is present in a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This leads to differences in the ability of each device to detect and/or identify objects. This report is a compilation of the available information on both state-of-the-art <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> and infrared imagers. <b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> developed in the United States, as well as some foreign made <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> are discussed. <b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> are categorized according to their spectral response and sensitivity using the nomenclature of GEN I, GEN II, and GEN III. As the first generation of <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> GEN I, were large and of limited performance, this report will deal with only GEN II and GEN III equipment. Infrared imagers are generally categorized according to their spectral response, sensor materials, and related sensor operating temperature using the nomenclature Medium Wavelength Infrared (MWIR) Cooled and Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) Uncooled. MWIR Cooled refers to infrared imagers which operate in the 3 to 5 {micro}m wavelength electromagnetic spectral region and require either mechanical or thermoelectric coolers to keep the sensors operating at 77 K. LWIR Uncooled refers to infrared imagers which operate in the 8 to 12 {micro}m wavelength electromagnetic spectral region and do not require cooling below room temperature. Both commercial and military infrared sensors of these two types are discussed...|$|R
50|$|X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> became {{available}} in the early 1950s and were viewed through a microscope.|$|R
25|$|Generation 3 Thin Film {{technology}} is presently {{the standard for}} most <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> used by the US military.|$|R
25|$|<b>Image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tubes (IITs) are {{optoelectronic}} {{devices that}} allow many devices, such as night vision devices and medical imaging devices, to function. They convert {{low levels of}} light from various wavelengths into visible quantities of light at a single wavelength.|$|E
25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tubes {{manufactured}} for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the microchannel plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant current draw from the microchannel plate, it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of image intensifiers is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E
25|$|By 2001, the United States federal {{government}} {{concluded that a}} tube’s “Generation” was not a determinant factor of a tube’s global performance, making the term “Generation” irrelevant in determining the performance of an <b>Image</b> <b>Intensifier</b> Tube, and therefore eliminated the term as a basis of export regulations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> are {{available}} with input diameters of up to 45cm, and a resolution of approximately 2-3 line pairs mm−1.|$|R
25|$|Generation III Filmless {{technology}} {{is still in}} production and use today, but officially, there is no Generation 4 of <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> are {{available}} with input diameters of up to 45 cm, and a resolution of approximately 2-3 line pairs mm−1.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} to the cascade tube explored in the mid 20th century involves optical feedback, with {{the output of the}} tube fed back into the input. This scheme has not been used in rifle scopes, but it has been used successfully in lab applications where larger <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> assemblies are acceptable.|$|E
25|$|The United States Air Force {{experimented with}} {{panoramic}} night vision goggles (PNVGs) which double the user's {{field of view}} to around 95 degrees by using four 16mm <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tubes, rather than the more standard two 18mm tubes. They are in service with A-10 Thunderbolt II, MC-130 Combat Talon and AC-130U Spooky aircrew, and are also popular with special forces.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} Generation 3 Omni VII and Generation 3+, {{following}} the issues experienced with generation IV technology, Thin Film technology became {{the standard for}} current <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> technology. In Thin Film image intensifiers, {{the thickness of the}} film is reduced from around 30 Angstrom (standard) to around 10 Angstrom and the photocathode voltage is lowered. This causes fewer electrons to be stopped than with third generation tubes, while providing the benefits of a filmed tube.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Image</b> <b>Intensifiers</b> (CsI Far-UV, CsTe Near-UV, Alkali-Antimonide Visible) for the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on Astrosat. ISRO - Launched September 28, 2016.|$|R
25|$|Flat panel {{detectors}} {{are considerably}} {{more expensive to}} purchase and repair than <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> so their uptake is primarily in specialties that require high-speed imaging, e.g., vascular imaging and cardiac catheterization.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) cameras equipped with <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> {{are increasingly being}} used for radiographic applications. These systems {{may be used to}} replace film recording for static imaging, or at other times CCDs coupled with electro-optical shutters may be used for static or dynamic (explosive) radiography. <b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> provide precise shuttering and signal gain. The authors have developed a set of performance measures to calibrate systems, compare one system to another, and to predict experimental performance. The performance measures discussed in this paper are concerned with image quality parameters that relate to resolution and signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R
25|$|Additionally, {{since the}} {{limiting}} resolution is usually {{defined as the}} point at which the MTF is three percent or less, this would also be the maximum resolution of the tube. The MTF is affected by every part of an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube's operation and on a complete system is also affected by the quality of the optics involved. Factors that affect the MTF include transition through any fiber plate or glass, at the screen and the photocathode and also through the tube and the microchannel plate itself. The higher the MTF at a given resolution, the better.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy is an imaging {{technique}} commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} internal structures of a patient {{through the use of}} a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a contrast material. Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for coronary artery blockages) and barium swallow (to examine for esophageal disorders).|$|E
25|$|Although not {{formally}} recognized under the U.S. generation categories, Super Second Generation or SuperGen {{was developed in}} 1989 by Jacques Dupuy and Gerald Wolzak. This technology improved the tri-alkali photocathodes to more than double their sensitivity while also improving the microchannel plate by increasing the open-area ratio to 70% while reducing the noise level. This allowed second generation tubes, which are more economical to manufacture, to achieve comparable results to third generation <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tubes. With sensitivities of the photocathodes approaching 700 uA/lm and extended frequency response to 950nm, this technology continued to be developed outside of the U.S., notably by Photonis and now forms the basis for most non-US manufactured high-end night vision equipment.|$|E
40|$|For many {{military}} operations, {{situational awareness}} {{is of great}} importance. During night conditions, this situational awareness can be improved using both analog and digital image-intensified cameras. The quality of <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> is a topic of interest. One {{of the differences between}} a digital and analog system is noise behavior. For digital <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> the noise behavior is not as good as for analog <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> but it can be improved using noise-reduction techniques. In this paper, the improvement using temporal noise reduction and local adaptive contrast enhancement is shown and quantitatively evaluated by subjective measurement of the conspicuity and triangle orientation discrimination (TOD). The results of the conspicuity and TOD experiments are consistent with each other. The highest improvement is found for a low-clutter environment; for medium- and high-clutter environments, the improvement is less. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that image enhancement increases contrast of all image details, irrespective of whether they are targets or clutter. For low-clutter image enhancement, target conspicuity and target detection improvement will be largest, since there are not many distracting element...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescence {{lifetime}} imaging (FLIM) {{uses the}} fact that the fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore depends on itsmolecular environment but not on its concentration. Molecular effects in a sample can therefore be investigated independently of the variable, and usually unknown concentration of the fluorophore. There is a variety of technical solutions of lifetime imaging in microscopy. The technical part of this paper focuses on time-domain FLIM by multidimensional time-correlated single photon counting, time-domain FLIM by gated <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> frequency-domain FLIM by gain-modulated <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> and frequency-domain FLIM by gain-modulated photomultipliers. The application part describes the most frequent FLIM applications: Measurement of molecular environment parameters, protein-interaction measurements by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) ...|$|R
2500|$|X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> {{generally}} have radiation-reducing {{systems such as}} pulsed rather than constant radiation, and last image hold, which [...] "freezes" [...] the screen and makes it available for examination without exposing the patient to unnecessary radiation.|$|R
25|$|Development {{continued}} in the US as well during the 1930s and mid-1930, the first inverting <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> was developed at RCA. This tube used an electrostatic inverter to focus an image from a spherical cathode onto a spherical screen. (The choice of spheres was to reduce off-axial aberrations.) Subsequent development of this technology led directly to the first Generation 0 image intensifiers which were used by the military during World War II to allow vision at night with infrared lighting for both shooting and personal night vision. The first military night vision device were introduced by the German army as early as 1939, developed since 1935. Early night vision devices based on these technologies were used by both sides in World War II. However, the downside of active night vision (when infrared light is used) {{is that it is}} quite obvious to anyone else using the technology.|$|E
25|$|A {{night vision}} device (NVD), {{also known as}} night optical/observation device (NOD) and night vision goggles (NVG), is an {{optoelectronic}} device that allows images to be produced in levels of light approaching total darkness. The image may be a conversion to visible light of both visible light and near-infrared, while by convention detection of thermal infrared is denoted thermal imaging. The image produced is typically monochrome, e.g. shades of green. NVDs are most often used by the military and law enforcement agencies, but are available to civilian users. The term usually refers to a complete unit, including an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube, a protective and generally water-resistant housing, and some type of mounting system. Many NVDs also include optical components such as a sacrificial lens, or telescopic lenses or mirrors. An NVD may have an IR illuminator, making it an active as opposed to passive night vision device.|$|E
25|$|The {{modulation}} {{transfer function}} of an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> {{is a measure}} of the output amplitude of dark and light lines on the display for a given level of input from lines presented to the photocathode at different resolutions. It is usually given as a percentage at a given frequency (spacing) of light and dark lines. For example, if you look at white and black lines with a MTF of 99% @ 2 lp/mm then the output of the dark and light lines is going to be 99% as dark or light as looking at a black image or a white image. This value decreases for a given increase in resolution also. On the same tube if the MTF at 16 and 32 lp/mm was 50% and 3% then at 16 lp/mm the signal would be only half as bright/dark as the lines were for 2 lp/mm and at 32 lp/mm the image of the lines would be only three percent as bright/dark as the lines were at 2 lp/mm.|$|E
5000|$|Marder 1 A1(+) (1979-1982): dual feed for 20 mm cannon {{enabling}} {{choice of}} ammunition, night vision equipment including <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> and a thermal imager. Infantry capacity reduced to five. Applied to 674 vehicles between 1979 and 1982.|$|R
5000|$|X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> {{generally}} have radiation-reducing {{systems such as}} pulsed rather than constant radiation, and last image hold, which [...] "freezes" [...] the screen and makes it available for examination without exposing the patient to unnecessary radiation.|$|R
25|$|<b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} that increase {{the brightness of the}} screen, so that the patient needs to be exposed to a lower dose of X-rays. Whilst this reduces the risk of ionisation to occur, it does not remove it entirely.|$|R
25|$|Photons {{hitting a}} thin film of alkali metal or {{semiconductor}} material such as gallium arsenide in an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect. These are accelerated by an electrostatic field where they strike a phosphor coated screen, converting the electrons back into photons. Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by {{increasing the number of}} electrons through secondary emissions, such as with a micro-channel plate. Sometimes a combination of both methods is used. Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the conduction band and into the vacuum level. This is known as the electron affinity of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band, explained by the band gap model. Some materials such as Gallium Arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the conduction band. In these materials, electrons that move to the conduction band are all of sufficient energy to be emitted from the material and as such, the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick. These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the genitourinary system, or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Electronic Gating (or 'gating') is a {{means by}} which an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube may be {{switched}} ON and OFF in a controlled manner. An electronically gated <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube functions like a camera shutter, allowing images to pass through when the electronic [...] "gate" [...] is enabled. The gating durations can be very short (nanoseconds or even picoseconds). [...] This makes gated <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tubes ideal candidates for use in research environments where very short duration events must be photographed. As an example, in order to assist engineers in designing more efficient combustion chambers, gated imaging tubes have been used to record very fast events such as the wavefront of burning fuel in an internal combustion engine.|$|E

25|$|Early radiologists would adapt {{their eyes}} to view the dim {{fluoroscopic}} images by sitting in darkened rooms, or by wearing red adaptation goggles.
