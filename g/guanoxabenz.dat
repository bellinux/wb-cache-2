40|$|The {{in vitro}} N-hydroxylation of {{guanabenz}} {{as well as}} the corre-sponding N-dehydroxylation of <b>guanoxabenz</b> has been previously detected in biotransformation studies with microsomal fractions of different species including human hepatic microsomes. Further-more, the N-hydroxylation of guanabenz was found to be catalyzed by enriched cytochrome P 450 (P 450) fractions in reconstituted systems. Strong correlations between 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-de-ethylation (r 5 0. 96; p < 0. 001), caffeine N-demethylation (r 5 0. 92; p < 0. 001), respectively, and guanabenz N-hydroxylation activities were demonstrated in 10 human liver microsomal preparations. Studies with microsomes from human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing human cytochrome P 450 enzymes proved that CYP 1 A 2 is the major isozyme responsible for this metabolic pathway. Fur-ther, P 450 isozymes did not show any detectable conversion rates. The reaction was inhibited in presence of the potent CYP 1 A...|$|E
40|$|Seven alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists {{with diverse}} {{chemical}} structures {{have been examined}} for their effects at alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the vas deferens and central nervous system of the rat. Antagonist potency assessed against the presynaptic alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist action of clonidine in the isolated vas deferens (RX 781094 greater than Wy 26703 greater than yohimbine greater than rauwolscine greater than piperoxan greater than mianserin greater than RS 21361) was highly correlated with the ability of these drugs to displace saturable [3 H]-RX 781094 binding from cerebral cortex membranes. Similarly, antagonist potency in the vas deferens was highly correlated with antagonist activity in reversing the centrally-mediated mydriasis induced by the selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, <b>guanoxabenz,</b> in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats. The {{results indicate that the}} presynaptic alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the vas deferens are pharmacologically similar to characterized these alpha 2 -adrenoceptors in the central nervous system of the rat...|$|E
