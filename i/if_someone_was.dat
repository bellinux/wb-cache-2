5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{the prison}} had {{separate}} areas for its {{two classes of}} prisoner: the master's side, which housed about 50rooms for rent, and the common or poor side, consisting of nine small rooms, or wards, into which 300people were confined from dusk until dawn. Room rents on the master's side were ten shillings a week in 1728, with most prisoners forced to share. John Baptist Grano paid 2s 6d (two shillings and six pennies) for a room with two beds on the master's side, shared with three other prisoners: Daniel Blunt, a tailor who owed £9, Benjamin Sandford, a lighterman from Bermondsey who owed £55, and a Mr. Blundell, a jeweller. Women prisoners who could pay the fees were housed in the women's quarters, known as the oak. The wives, daughters and lovers of male prisoners were allowed to live with them, <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> paying their way.|$|E

25|$|The deontological {{argument}} against research on human beings is that persons are an ends in themselves. This means we cannot use people for any purpose. The deontological argument {{relies on the}} belief that we should treat others as we would like to be treated. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> suffering from a terminal illness and they were likely to die shortly, under deontological assumptions research could not be done on them even if it meant saving the lives of millions.|$|E
25|$|The {{preposition}} von ("of") {{was used}} to distinguish Nobility; for example, <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> baron of the village of Veltheim, his family name would be von Veltheim. In modern times, people who were elevated to nobility often had a 'von' added to their name. For example, Johann Wolfgang Goethe had his name changed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. This practice ended with {{the abolition of the}} monarchy in Germany and Austria in 1919. Sometimes von is also used in geographical names that are not noble, as in von Däniken.|$|E

25|$|Majapahit people, men and women, favoured their head. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> {{touched on}} his head, {{or if there}} is a {{misunderstanding}} or argument when drunk, they will instantly draw their knives and stab each other. When the one being stabbed was wounded and dead, the murderer will flee and hide for three days, then he will not lose his life. But if he was caught during the fight, he will instantly stabbed to death (execution by stabbing). The country of Majapahit knows no caning for major or minor punishment. They tied the guilty men on his hands in the back with rattan rope and paraded them, and then stabbed the offender in the back where there is a floating rib which resulted in instant death. Judicial executions of this kind were frequent.|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{of touch}} also varies {{significantly}} between different cultures. Harper refers to several studies, {{one of which}} examined touching in coffee houses. During a one-hour sitting 180 touchings were observed for Puerto Ricans, 110 for French, none for English and 2 for Americans. (Harper, 297). In order to know <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> touching more frequently than normal {{it would be necessary}} to first know what is normal in that culture. In high touch countries a kiss on the cheek is considered a polite greeting while in Sweden it may be considered presumptuous. Jandt relates that two men holding hands will in some countries be a sign of friendly affection, whereas in the United States the same tactile code would probably be interpreted as a symbol of homosexual love (85).|$|E

If his mental health was uncertain but he was not constantly unwell, he and his kharakteristika [...] were sent to a labour camp or to be shot. When allusions to socialist legality started to be made, it was decided to prosecute such people. Soon it became apparent that putting people who gave anti-Soviet speeches on trial only made matters worse for the regime. Such individuals were no longer tried in court. Instead they were given a psychiatric examination and declared insane.|$|E
500|$|The film's overall {{structure}} {{was influenced by}} the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, [...] "We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes." [...] The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, [...] "He {{is a little bit of}} an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's as <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain." ...|$|E
500|$|In Stanley Kubrick's 1968 {{science fiction}} film , {{astronaut}} David Bowman slowly disassembles {{the mind of}} an artificial intelligence named HAL by sequentially unplugging its memory banks. Carr likened the emotions of despair expressed by HAL as its mind is disassembled to his own, at the time, cognitive difficulties in engaging with long texts. He felt as <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> [...] "tinkering with [...] brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory". HAL had also {{been used as a}} metaphor for the [...] "ultimate search engine" [...] in a PBS interview with Google co-founder Sergey Brin as noted in Carr's book The Big Switch, and also Brin's TED talk. Brin was comparing Google's ambitions of building an artificial intelligence to HAL, while dismissing the possibility that a bug like the one that led HAL to murder the occupants of the fictional spacecraft Discovery One could occur in a Google-based artificial intelligence. Carr observed in his essay that throughout history technological advances have often necessitated new metaphors, such as the mechanical clock engendering the simile [...] "like clockwork" [...] and the age of the computer engendering the simile [...] "like computers". Carr concluded his essay with an explanation as to why he believed HAL was an appropriate metaphor for his essay's argument. He observed that HAL showed genuine emotion as his mind was disassembled while, throughout the film, the humans onboard the space station appeared to be automatons, thinking and acting as if they were following the steps of an algorithm. Carr believed that the film's prophetic message was that as individuals increasingly rely on computers for an understanding of their world their intelligence may become more machinelike than human.|$|E

[...] When Abraham Lincoln visited Richmond from April 4 to 7, 1865, Ripley became aware of an assassination plot and met with Lincoln to urge him to take increased precautions for his safety. [...] Lincoln declined, stating that it was more important that he be seen among the people as a sign that hostilities were over, and that <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> determined to assassinate him, increased security would not prevent it.|$|E

2500|$|Under {{the reign}} of Stephen the Great, all farmers and villagers had to bear arms. Stephen {{justified}} this by saying that [...] "every man {{has a duty to}} defend his fatherland"; according to Polish chronicler Jan Długosz, <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> found without carrying a weapon, he was sentenced to death. Stephen reformed the army by promoting men from the landed free peasantry răzeși (i.e. something akin to freeholding yeomen) to infantry (voinici) and light cavalry (hânsari) — to make himself less dependent on the boyars — and introduced his army to guns. In times of crises, The Small Host (Oastea Mică) — which consisted of around 10,000 to 12,000 men — stood ready to engage the enemy, while the Large Host (Oastea Mare) — which could reach up to 40,000 — had all the free peasantry older than 14, and strong enough to carry a sword or use the bow, recruited. This seldom happened, for such a levée en masse was devastating for both economy and population growth. In the Battle of Vaslui, Stephen had to summon the Large Host and also recruited mercenary troops.|$|E

This {{can be seen}} in a myriad of situations. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> mad, they will yell. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>is</b> happy, their tone of their speech will rise. Location also has an influence on how a person acts verbally. At a football game, typically people are intended to scream and shout with joy, rooting for their team to win. When a player scores, the sound of the crowd cheering increases exponentially, because they are asserting excitement and thrill for the victorious performance.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{contracts}} concern voluntary obligations, {{the courts}} employ {{a number of}} protections to ensure only people who give informed and true consent are legally bound. Before 1875, the common law courts only allowed escape from an agreement and damages <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>was</b> induced to enter an agreement by fraud or was put under physical duress, or suffered {{from a lack of}} legal capacity. The courts of equity, however, were significantly more generous because they allowed [...] "rescission" [...] (i.e. cancellation) of a contract if a person was the victim of any misrepresentation, even an innocent one, and any [...] "undue influence", beyond influence by physical threats. In these situations the victim of the misrepresentation or unconscionable behaviour has the option to avoid the contract. If avoided, the parties are both entitled to have returned whatever property they had already conveyed, so nobody remains unjustly enriched (though this terminology was not used till the 20th century). As the 20th century unfolded, the courts and statute expanded on the range of circumstances in which a person could claim damages for negligent misrepresentation, on top of fraud. As concern over the use of unfair terms grew, there were calls to recognise a positive duty on contracting parties to disclose material facts {{as part of a broader}} duty of [...] "good faith" [...] and some judges attempted to follow the American Uniform Commercial Code by fashioning a broader doctrine of [...] "unconscionable" [...] bargains, procured through inequality of bargaining power. This development was, however, stopped by the House of Lords, so that problems of unfair contract terms continued to be dealt with through targeted legislation. The courts also declare contracts void if they were for an illegal purpose, and refuse to enforce the agreement, or give any legal remedy if doing so would require a person to rely on their illegal act.|$|E
