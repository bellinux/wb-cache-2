50|$|When the League of Nations {{resolved}} {{the issue of}} Åland’s constitutional affiliation in 1921 a decision was also taken to draw up an international convention. The convention, which confirmed the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> 1856 and also neutralised Åland, was signed by ten states. Russia is not {{a party to the}} 1921 convention, but the 1940 Moscow Treaty on the Åland Islands and the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty contain provisions on the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Åland. Neutralisation is not mentioned, however.|$|R
50|$|As {{the process}} of the {{so-called}} Lublin government advanced (early November 1918), German-led military councils were organised in Warsaw. Koc initiated the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> some part of them.|$|R
50|$|Las Águilas Negras {{are one of}} {{a number}} of groups that have formed {{following}} the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the AUC, and they are said to be closely linked with the Usuga Clan.|$|R
50|$|The Plan did {{not deal}} in full {{with the issue}} <b>of</b> <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the legally invalid 'TRNC', and Greek Cypriots felt they {{had no reason to}} believe Turkish {{promises}} concerning the withdrawal of troops.|$|R
50|$|In Egypt demonstrations {{were held}} {{across the country}} to call for the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> {{university}} campuses. Meanwhile, in Ghana, the All Africa Student Union organised events to promote quality assurance in education and commemorations were held in Uganda.|$|R
50|$|The {{preamble}} of {{the resolution}} deplored the failure of UNITA to complete its tasks under the Lusaka Protocol and noted declarations by UNITA concerning the complete <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> its forces and of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation (GURN) legalising UNITA as a political party.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, {{the mandate}} was {{extended}} to so-called [...] "pink zones" [...] controlling access to the UNPAs (UNSC Resolution 762), some border control and monitoring of civilian access to the Pink Zones (UNSC Resolution 769), and control <b>of</b> the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the Prevlaka peninsula near Dubrovnik (UNSC Resolution 779).|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Finland {{celebrated the}} 150th Anniversary <b>of</b> the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the Åland Islands by issuing a {{commemorative}} coin. Its obverse depicts a pine tree, very typical in the Åland Islands, and the reverse features a boat's stern and rudder, with a dove {{perched on the}} tiller, a symbol of 150 years of peace.|$|R
50|$|In 1905 a new {{hospital}} was opened and was {{situated on the}} bank of lake Klückensee (since 1945 called Lake Klukom). The First World War had little effect on Arnswalde but the post-war German depression damaged the tourist economy. In the framework <b>of</b> the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> post-war Germany the garrison was disbanded, but in 1938 it was reinstated.|$|R
25|$|Incessant {{fighting}} {{followed the}} Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the January 28 Incident battle. This {{resulted in the}} <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Shanghai, which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an ongoing campaign to defeat the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan.|$|R
50|$|In {{the end the}} Siamese {{submitted}} {{fully to}} the French conditions, finding no support from the British. In addition, the French demanded as guarantees the temporary occupation of Chantaburi and the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Battambang, Siem Reap and a 25 kilometre-wide zone {{on the west bank}} of the Mekong. The conflict led to the signature of the Franco-Siamese Treaty, on 3 October 1893.|$|R
50|$|Since 2004, the Defence & MRO Division of Aero Vodochody has {{performed}} a general maintenance, repair and modernisation program of civil-operated L-39s, {{as well as}} performing the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> ex-military aircraft. Services offered to civil operators include life-extension programs, support for civil registration/certification, training of ground/flight crew, logistics and analysis, customization, routine inspection, condition-based maintenance support, and providing general expertise/consultancy work.|$|R
50|$|The <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the {{hospital}} began in 1926 {{when it was}} handed to the Ministry of Pensions, to care for disabled ex-servicemen. The Second World War saw the first civilian patients admitted, and several temporary huts added to the site to increase capacity. As with many makeshift hospitals from the era, the huts stayed in place for several years after the war.|$|R
5000|$|The Chin-Doihara Agreement ( [...] ; 土肥原・秦徳純協定) was {{a treaty}} that {{resolved}} the North Chahar Incident of 27 June 1935 between the Empire of Japan and Republic of China. The agreement was made between Kwantung Army negotiator, Kenji Doihara, representing Japan, and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang 29th Army, General Qin Dechun (Chin Techun), representing China. It {{resulted in the}} <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Chahar.|$|R
50|$|The Council {{noted the}} {{agreement}} between Presidents of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) concerning the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the Prevlaka peninsula and the contribution {{it had made}} to reducing tension in the region. It also reaffirmed the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Croatia, {{and the importance of}} mutual recognition between the successor states in the former Yugoslavia.|$|R
50|$|The {{base was}} the subject of a botched proxy bomb attack on 24 October 1990, when the main charge of the bomb failed to explode. The barracks closed in 2007 as part <b>of</b> the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Northern Ireland {{according}} to the Good Friday Agreement. Eventually, an environmentally friendly PSNI station was built on the grounds next to the existing St Lucia barracks site in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The Security Council, {{extending}} MINURSO's {{mandate for}} a final time, noted that Chad {{would be responsible for}} the protection of the civilian population in eastern Chad, including humanitarian and United Nations personnel. Furthermore, it called upon Chad to take action in this regard, for example by the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> refugee camps. The Council requested both Chad and the United Nations to assess the situation on the ground on a monthly basis.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 {{the agency}} was renamed to Instituto Geográfico Militar (IGM) after a merger with the Military Cartographic Service, and became a {{dependency}} of the Ministry of Defence. In January 1998, following the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> state institutions stipulated in the Peace Accords, the IGN was reinstated as a dependency of the Ministry of Communications, Infrastructure and Housing, and became a dependency of the Ministry of Agriculture in September 2006.|$|R
50|$|The {{resolution}} {{reiterated that}} {{the primary cause of}} the political crisis in Angola was the failure of UNITA to comply with its obligations under peace agreements and Security Council resolutions. Furthermore, it demanded that it complete the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> its forces and withdraw from territories it occupied through military means; there could be no military solution to the conflict and both parties were urged to seek a political settlement.|$|R
25|$|The 2010 Kashmir unrest was {{series of}} protests in the Muslim {{majority}} Kashmir Valley in Jammu and Kashmir {{which started in}} June 2010. These protests involved the 'Quit Jammu Kashmir Movement' launched by the Hurriyat Conference led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who had called for the complete <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Jammu and Kashmir. The All Parties Hurriyat Conference made this call to protest, citing human rights abuses by Indian troops.|$|R
50|$|The {{programme}} {{was introduced}} by United States President Bill Clinton's administration in 1995, {{as a response to}} arguments that ordinary Iraqi citizens were inordinately affected by the international economic sanctions aimed at the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Saddam Hussein's Iraq, imposed {{in the wake of the}} first Gulf War. The sanctions were discontinued on 21 November 2003 after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and the humanitarian functions turned over to the Coalition Provisional Authority.|$|R
50|$|The Svalbard Treaty or the Spitsbergen Treaty, {{recognises}} {{the sovereignty}} of Norway over the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, at the time called Spitsbergen. The exercise of sovereignty is, however, subject to certain stipulations, and not all Norwegian law applies. The treaty regulates the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the archipelago. The signatories were given equal rights to engage in commercial activities (mainly coal mining) on the islands. , Norway and Russia are making use of this right.|$|R
50|$|From 6 April to 17 May 1920, {{following}} {{military intervention}} {{to put down}} the Ruhr uprising, Frankfurt was occupied by French troops. The French claimed that Articles 42 to 44 of the peace treaty of Versailles concerning the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the Rhineland had been broken. In 1924, Ludwig Landmann became the first Jewish mayor of the city, and led a significant expansion during the following years. During the Nazi era, the synagogues of the city were destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Despite these reservations, {{however, the}} NRM/NRA {{eventually}} agreed to peace talks {{presided over by}} a Kenyan delegation headed by President Daniel arap Moi. The talks, which lasted from 26 August to 17 December, were notoriously acrimonious and the resultant ceasefire broke down almost immediately. The final agreement, signed in Nairobi, called for a ceasefire, <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Kampala, integration of the NRA and government forces, and absorption of the NRA leadership into the Military Council. These conditions were never met.|$|R
40|$|While the {{presence}} of militia in conflicts dates back several centuries, their current nature and importance remains unique {{and in need of}} further analysis and understanding. This article attempts to further this understanding by providing an interpretative framework for the analysis of militia groups. It does this by first problematising the definition of militias, particularly with regards to the question of being a non-state actor. A framework is then provided which highlights the need to study the rationality and motivations of militias, their strategies and tactics, their structure, their means of achieving legitimacy and accountability and their relationship with other actors. These themes are crucial with regards to disarmament, demobilisation and re-integration (DDR) and the overall peace process. However, <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> militias cannot be enforced from the top-down only, which is why the contextualisation of the historical, political, economic, identity politics, regional, international and civil society situation must also be considered. Thus, the multi-faceted and multi-layered nature <b>of</b> the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> militias is discussed here in the hopes to provide a better theoretical understanding to aid in a more efficient implementation of the peace process.

50|$|After the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Stralsund, {{the call}} for a new, more modern and higher {{capacity}} station became louder. The new station was built of brick and opened to traffic on 29 March 1905. The design for the station building was prepared by the Royal Railway Directorate in Stettin (now Szczecin). The processing of the detailed architectural design and construction management was supervised by Alexander Rüdell, with its implementation handled by Hans Stubbe, who was later {{a professor at the}} Braunschweig University of Technology.|$|R
50|$|The Security Council {{expressed}} its alarm at {{the continuing}} {{civil war in}} Angola {{and its impact on}} the civilian population. It reiterated that the primary cause of the crisis in Angola was the failure of UNITA, under the leadership of Jonas Savimbi, to comply with obligations under the , Lusaka Protocol and relevant Security Council resolutions. In this regard, it demanded that UNITA immediately and unconditionally complete the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> its forces and co-operate in the extension of state authority throughout Angola.|$|R
50|$|The Security Council {{stressed}} the importance of the timely implementation of various peace agreements, including the Lusaka Protocol, between Angolan government and UNITA. Progress had been made recently, but the overall pace of implementation was slow. Talks on the formation of an army unit had been successfully completed and there was also an agreement on forming a unity government. Respect for human rights and the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Angolan society was important and the recovery of the Angolan economy was essential for lasting peace.|$|R
50|$|The Security Council {{condemned}} {{the failure of}} UNITA to implement the remaining tasks of the Lusaka Protocol including the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> its forces and the extension of state administration throughout the country. It was concerned that the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, had not responded to proposals {{for the restoration of}} the peace process by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. There was a serious humanitarian impact brought about by the impasse in the peace process which had consequences on the security of the country.|$|R
50|$|The Security Council {{noted that}} all parties had {{generally}} respected the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement but remained concerned at the continuing hostilities {{in the east}} of the country. It welcomed the withdrawal of Namibian forces as a positive step towards the withdrawal of all foreign forces, with remaining contingents asked to leave in accordance with Resolution 1304 (2000). The Council demanded the full <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> Kisangani which was occupied by the RCD-Goma and welcomed the deployment of MONUC personnel to the city for police training purposes.|$|R
50|$|The Council {{noted the}} {{agreement}} between Presidents of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) concerning the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the Prevlaka peninsula and the contribution {{it had made}} to reducing tension in the region. There was concern that violations {{had taken place in}} the designated United Nations zone, including restrictions on the freedom of movement which increased tension. On 23 August 1996 both parties signed an agreement on the normalisation of diplomatic relations between them and had committed themselves to peacefully resolve the dispute.|$|R
50|$|The {{resolution}} {{noted that}} the Council would include measures for demobilisation, <b>demilitarisation</b> and reintegration <b>of</b> ex-combatants and child soldiers, disposal <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> and ammunition, and resources {{for the protection of}} civilians in immediate danger. Such measures would include security zones or corridors to protect civilians and the facilitation of humanitarian assistance in instances of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The peacekeeping missions could also include a component for the dissemination of information on international law through mass media.|$|R
25|$|There was no armed {{resistance}} {{movement in the}} Channel Islands. This has been ascribed {{to a range of}} factors including the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the Islands by the British government in 1940, the physical separation of the islands, the density of troops (up to one German for every two islanders), the small size of the islands precluding any hiding places for resistance groups, and the absence of the Gestapo from the occupying forces. Moreover, much of the population of military age had already joined the British or French armed forces.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in June 1999, Çeku {{oversaw the}} <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> the KLA and its {{transformation}} into the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC), an ostensibly civilian organization charged with disaster response, demining, search and response and humanitarian projects. Although the international community insisted the KPC was a civilian organization, Çeku and its membership said they believed the KPC should evolve into the future army of an independent Kosovo. Çeku managed ably many difficult challenges for the KPC, including allegations that its members were supporting the ethnic Albanian insurgency in Macedonia in 2001 ...|$|R
5000|$|In a communique dated 28 November but {{released}} publicly on 3 December, the FARC-EP {{declared that}} {{they were no longer}} insisting on the <b>demilitarisation</b> <b>of</b> San Vicente del Caguán and Cartagena del Chairá as a precondition for the negotiation of the prisoner exchange, but instead that of Florida and Pradera in the Valle department. They state that this area would lie outside the [...] "area of influence" [...] of both their Southern and Eastern Blocks (the FARC-EP's strongest) and that of the military operations being carried out by the Uribe administration.|$|R
