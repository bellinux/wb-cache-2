5|$|The {{airframe}} {{was also}} subdivided into sections to allow {{transport by road}} or rail. The wings were of standard Junkers double-wing construction. This gave the Ju 87 considerable advantage on take-off; <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> shallow angle, large lift forces were created through the aerofoil, reducing take-off and landing runs.|$|E
5|$|Ali {{received}} {{a degree in}} social science, politics and sociology from University College Dublin in 1989 at age28, giving birth to the couple's first daughter, Jordan, two weeks before her final exams. Further plans to earn a master's degree in moral and political ethics were derailed by {{the birth of their}} second daughter, Memphis Eve, in 1991. Two sons, Elijah Bob Patricus Guggi Q and John Abraham, were born in 1999 and 2001, respectively. Being effectively a single parent while U2 toured was difficult for Hewson, but she now found Bono helpful <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for}} a different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E

5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which to make a living, began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman. Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission to Yale College. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> young age, Allen was curious and interested in learning.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{three sons}} reigned {{in an age}} of almost {{constant}} civil and religious war in France. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.|$|E

5|$|Philosophers {{in antiquity}} used {{the concept of}} force {{in the study of}} {{stationary}} and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force. In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved for nearly three hundred years. By the early 20th century, Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light, and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.|$|E
5|$|Late in {{the morning}} of November 22, 1952, Loring led a flight of four F-80s on patrol over Kunwha. Upon radioing a forward air controller, he was told a T-6 Texan flying over Sniper Ridge had spotted a {{concentration}} of artillery near the ridge which was pinning down UN ground troops on the ridge. He was also told the artillery concentration was surrounded by a heavy presence of anti-aircraft guns. Loring ordered the flight to the location, spotting the artillery concentration. Immediately after Loring began his dive bombing run, he was spotted by the anti-aircraft batteries. The Chinese crews operating them were highly skilled, and <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance, the batteries fired an extremely accurate barrage which struck Loring's aircraft several times on the nose and fuselage. The fire disabled the aircraft. His wingmen, noting the damage, suggested he abort the bombing mission, as the flight was not far behind the lines and Loring's aircraft could have attempted the return trip. Instead, Loring ceased radio contact, and resumed {{what appeared to be the}} standard bombing mission. At , however, Loring accelerated his aircraft at a 40-degree angle in what appeared to be a controlled maneuver, lining up the Chinese batteries. The other pilots reported they watched, stunned, as Loring dove his damaged aircraft into the battery position. Loring was killed instantly in the impact, but his action resulted in the complete destruction of the battery position.|$|E
25|$|When milling metals, the {{material}} is relatively ductile, although remaining strong <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> small scale. A Type II chip is formed, and waste may be produced as continuous swarf. Cutter forces are high, so milling machines must be robust and rigid, usually substantial constructions of cast iron.|$|E

25|$|In {{the port}} of Lázaro Cárdenas, near the epicenter, the 19 September event {{registered}} as IX on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale; in parts of Mexico City, it registered the same, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of about 400km (249mi) away. There was no historic record of such a strong quake in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The Douras {{family lived}} near Prospect Park in Brooklyn. The sisters changed their surname to Davies, {{which one of}} them spotted on a {{real-estate}} agent's sign in the neighborhood. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when New York was the melting pot for new immigrants, having a British surname greatly helped one's prospects—the name Davies has Welsh origins.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{capacitors}} {{are normally}} {{measured with a}} small AC voltage (0.5V) and a frequency of 100Hz or 1kHz depending on the capacitor type. The AC capacitance measurement offers fast results, important for industrial production lines. The capacitance value of a supercapacitor depends strongly on the measurement frequency, which {{is related to the}} porous electrode structure and the limited electrolyte's ion mobility. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> low frequency of 10Hz, the measured capacitance value drops from 100 to 20 percent of the DC capacitance value.|$|E

5000|$|Array the options. Kahneman and Tversky {{found that}} {{personal}} [...] "psychological accounts" [...] will produce {{the effect of}} framing the choice and determining what options are considered as subjects to factor. For example, <b>an</b> <b>evening</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> concert could be just one entry in a much larger account, of say a [...] "meeting a potential mate" [...] account. Or it {{could be part of}} a more general account such as [...] "ways to spend a Friday night".

25|$|While {{the general}} outline of these {{buildings}}, with steeply pitched roofs, lower chancels and small bellcotes are easily recognisable, the form varies from tiny buildings like St Mark's Greendale, (1848) to the somewhat larger cruciform St Michael's, Wollongong, (1858). <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> church as remote as St Mark's, which {{was surrounded by}} fields and forest, and had neither village nor full-time priest, {{the details of the}} design commanded Blacket's care, the little building having an elegant gable over its fluted doorway, and floral bosses, long since destroyed, at the ends of its drip moulding.|$|E
25|$|The {{playing of}} the wire-strung harp has been {{described}} as extremely difficult. Because of the long-lasting resonance, the performer had to dampen strings which had just been played while new strings were being plucked, and this while playing rapidly. Contrary to conventional modern practice, the left hand played the treble and the right the bass. It was said that a player should begin to learn the harp no later than the age of seven. The best modern players have shown, however, that reasonable competence may be achieved <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> later age.|$|E
25|$|It is {{typically}} classified {{as one of}} the four major jumping events in athletics, alongside the high jump, long jump and triple jump. It is unusual among track and field sports in that it requires a significant amount of specialised equipment in order to participate, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> basic level. A number of elite pole vaulters have had backgrounds in gymnastics, including world record breakers Yelena Isinbayeva and Brian Sternberg, reflecting the similar physical attributes required for the sports. Running speed, however, may be the most dominant factor.|$|E

25|$|Even in {{his later}} years, Scheinberg {{continued}} to fly abroad to fund-raise for his yeshiva. He always took the Talmudic tractate of Niddah with him and tried to learn all 72 folio-pages during the flight. He was known for never wasting a minute, using the time he spent walking or driving to yeshiva immersed in Torah study. According to his driver, Asa Wittow, he always sat with a Torah book in front of him, <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> wedding, and propped a Mishnah Berurah on the shelf above his kitchen sink while he washed dishes.|$|E
25|$|Within {{weeks of}} the killing, ten women and one man were arrested in {{connection}} with the murder. They were convicted in February 1975. All but one, a minor whose sentence was suspended, went to prison. The murder caused widespread revulsion, shock and horror throughout Northern Ireland and remained long in the public psyche <b>even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when bombings and killings were daily occurrences. The Ann Ogilby murder was investigated by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) which was established by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to investigate the most controversial killings carried out during the Troubles.|$|E
25|$|Doom also {{possesses}} originally minor mystical capabilities due to teachings from Tibetan monks, {{but later}} increased {{them to a}} considerable extent due to tutoring from his lover Morgan Le Fay. He is capable of energy projection, creating protective shields, and summoning hordes of demonic creatures. <b>Even</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time when his abilities were consistently referred to as minor, with assistance from his technology and by tag-teaming with Doctor Strange, Doom managed to come in second in a magic tournament held by the ancient sorcerer the Aged Genghis. After Strange relinquished the title of Sorcerer Supreme, he admitted that Doom had enough magical ability that he might become the new Sorcerer Supreme.|$|E
