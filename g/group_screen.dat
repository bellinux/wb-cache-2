40|$|Current {{research}} in screen design for human computer interaction {{has demonstrated that}} user task performance is influenced by placement, prompting methodology, and screen complexity. To assess {{the difference between a}} grouped item screen prompt and a series of single item screen prompts, a field experiment in a semiconductor manufacturing facility was designed. Subjects were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two groups to use a data entry system. Seven of the screen prompts differed between the two groups. During the four weeks of the study, a significant difference was measured between groups. The <b>group</b> <b>screen</b> users had lower task times for all four weeks. No significant correlation exists between work experience, performance review scores, or designated work shift. A strong negative correlation exists between frequency of system usage and task time. No difference was noted for measured errors. Subjective scores significantly favored the <b>group</b> <b>screen</b> design...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} step-wise <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> designs in which group-factors contain {{an equal number of}} factors in the initial step.   A usual assumption in <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> designs is that the directions of possible effects are known a-priori. In practice, however, this assumption is unreasonable. We shall examine step-wise <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> designs without errors in observations when this assumption is relaxed. We shall consider cancellations of effects within group-factors. The performance of step-wise group-screening designs shall then be compared with the performance of multistage <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> designs...|$|R

40|$|Screening is {{the process}} of sifting through a set of factors through {{experimentation}} to determine the few important factors that have a substantial effect on a response. When the set of factors is large and interactions are anticipated, screening methods using single fractional factorial designs may require too many observations to be feasible. The methodology of two-stage <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> has been suggested as an alternative. This article gives the first description of practical aspects involved in running a two-stage <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> experiment for investigating interactions. Issues involved in the design and analysis of such an experiment are discussed {{in the context of a}} study run at Jaguar Cars on cold start optimization. The analysis of this experiment provides insight into how <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> works in practice and how the factorial effects of the individual factors relate to those of the grouped factors. Elicitation of information from subject specialists, choice of factor groups, and selection of designs for two-stage <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> are discussed. Through the analysis of the experimental data, it is shown that the process of <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> can provide an efficient method of detecting interactions among large numbers of factors...|$|R
40|$|<b>Group</b> <b>screening</b> is a {{technique}} for examining {{a large number of}} factors in order to discover the few factors that have important influences on a measured response. In two-stage <b>group</b> <b>screening,</b> factors are assigned to groups and new ``grouped factors'' are investigated in a first stage experiment by varying all the factor values within a group simultaneously. The factors within those groups identified as important are then investigated individually in a second stage experiment. This paper describes theory and software that allows investigation of <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> in the presence of unequal-sized groups of factors in the first stage experiment and different probabilities of the various main effects and interactions being important (or active). Examples are given to show how the results can be used in practice to guide the choice of the number and sizes of the groups and to investigate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} the paper is on the {{comparison}} of results obtained using and not using <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> in an experimental design methodology applied to a semiconductor manufacturing simulation model. A wholeline simulation model of a semiconductor fab is built. The model includes more than 200 tools used in manufacturing 2 products with around 250 steps each. Output analysis results for the equipment utilization and queue sizes have identified the three most critical equipment groups in the fab. Seventeen input factors are set for investigation through a 2 -stage group-screening experiment and a fractional factorial using all 17 factors. The result illustrates that the final models can be quite different. While <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> used with simulation can be an appealing, flexible, tractable tool for capacity analysis of a semiconductor manufacturing facility, one must be concerned {{with the fact that}} the two techniques can give different answers to the users. Additionally, researchers need to address the proper choice of significance level for <b>group</b> <b>screening.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the paper is on the {{comparison}} of results obtained using <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> versus not using <b>group</b> <b>screening</b> in an experimental design methodology applied to a semiconductor manufacturing simulation model. The experiments were performed on the cycle time for the main product in the lab, which takes about 250 steps before completion. High utilization and large queue sizes were the basis for determining the five most critical workstations in the lab. Three parameters for each workstation were set as factors for investigation plus another more general important factor making a total of 16 input factors. A 2 -stage group-screening experiment and a 2 k'p factional factoffal were performed to identify the significant factors affecting the cycle time for the product. The {{results showed that the}} two methods could be very similar or very different depending on the choice of significance level for <b>group</b> <b>screening,</b> particularly at the early stages of eliminating group-factors...|$|R
