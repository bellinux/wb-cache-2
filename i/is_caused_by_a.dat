5|$|Crystalline {{zinc oxide}} is thermochromic, {{changing}} from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling.

5|$|DCS <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{reduction}} in ambient pressure {{that results in}} the formation of bubbles of inert gases within tissues of the body. It may happen when leaving a high-pressure environment, ascending from depth, or ascending to altitude.|$|E

5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> rear wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train.

5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E
5|$|Arabic astronomical {{contributions}} include Albatenius' {{discovery that}} {{the direction of}} the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing. (In modern heliocentric terms, this <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} human activities.

Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E

5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken {{the color of the}} skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|In Newton's {{description}} of gravity, the gravitational force {{is caused by}} matter. More precisely, it <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> specific property of material objects: their mass. In Einstein's theory and related theories of gravitation, curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass is a key property in determining the gravitational influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be {{the only source of}} gravity. Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.|$|E
5|$|Rinderpest, which <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> virus {{closely related}} to measles virus, is a disease of cattle known since Roman times. The disease, which {{originated}} in Asia, was first brought to Europe by the invading Huns in 370. Later invasions of Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his army, started pandemics in Europe in 1222, 1233 and 1238. The infection subsequently reached England following the importation of cattle from the continent. At the time rinderpest was a devastating disease with a mortality rate of 80–90%. The resulting loss of cattle caused famine.|$|E

5|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{new type}} of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear. The fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{weakening of}} the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold {{the shape of the}} windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{important}} pathogens of livestock. Diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue {{are caused by}} viruses. Companion animals such as cats, dogs, and horses, if not vaccinated, are susceptible to serious viral infections. Canine parvovirus <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> small DNA virus and infections are often fatal in pups. Like all invertebrates, the honey bee is susceptible to many viral infections. However, most viruses co-exist harmlessly in their host and cause no signs or symptoms of disease.|$|E
