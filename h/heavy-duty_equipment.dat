40|$|Every year {{large amounts}} of money must be spent for {{vehicles}} and equipment used in the high-way operation services. The main objective of this investigation was therefore to seek areas for cost savings by optimized equipping the vehicles and devices at autobahn and highway surveillance centres through improved use of equipment carriers. In addition to the aspect of economic efficiency, technical, operational, ergonomic and ecological criteria were brought into the evaluation of the vehicle types relevant for the investigation. On the basis of this analysis, recommendations were able to be made on the equipping of autobahn and highway surveillance centres, whereby these recommendations are based in the main on the investigation results obtained {{on the use of the}} vehicles in summer months services; an investigation of the use of the vehicles and equipment for the winter services is recommended but has not yet been carried out. In addition to the multipurpose equipment carriers commonly used at the present time-trucks as equipment carriers as well as the newly developed <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>equipment</b> carriers can be put to use very well in the summer-month services. <b>Heavy-duty</b> <b>equipment</b> carriers can be used on the one hand as equipment carriers and, on the other hand, in the same way as large trucks for winter services, road safety work and transporting. The cost comparison calculations carried out show that significant reductions in annual overall costs for autobahn and highway surveillance centres are capable of being obtained in many cases by the use of medium-sized trucks capable of being used as full-value equipment carriers. The savings are achieved by means of a reduction in the number of vehicles at a surveillance centre by reason of better levels of utilization of the existing vehicles or the vehicles to be procured in the future. Accordingly for typical autobahn surveillance centres in rural areas with average levels of traffic and average to unfavourable growth conditions 1 multipurpose equipment carrier as well as 1 universal vehicle are sufficient in addition to 4 conventional trucks. For a highway surveillance centre with an average profile of tasks, the vehicle fleet can be reduced to 3 vehicles (1 conventional truck, 1 multipurpose equipment carrier and 1 universal vehicle). A <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>equipment</b> carrier, a medium-sized truck as equipment carrier or a multipurpose equipment carrier with a permissible overall weight of at least 14 t can be used as the universal vehicle, whereby the selection should be made in accordance with the specific requirements of each surveillance centre.

This results from the nature of the work involving vessels often manned by only a few individuals who are working with <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>equipment</b> in dangerous environments at all hours.

Deaths result from a wide variety of situations involving vessel loss, falls overboard, fire and explosions, cable entanglements and gas exposure.

40|$|Tunnel {{construction}} workers face many dangers while working under dark conditions, with difficult access and egress, and many potential hazards. To enhance safety at tunnel construction sites, low latency tracking of mobile objects (e. g., <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>equipment)</b> and {{construction workers}} {{is critical for}} managing the dangerous construction environment. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are {{the basis for a}} widely used technology for monitoring the environment because of their energy-efficiency and scalability. However, their use involves an inherent point-to-point delay caused by duty cycling mechanisms that can result in a significant rise in the delivery latency for tracking mobile objects. To overcome this issue, we proposed a mobility-aware adaptive duty cycling mechanism for the WSNs based on object mobility. For the evaluation, we tested this mechanism for mobile object tracking at a tunnel excavation site. The evaluation results showed that the proposed mechanism could track mobile objects with low latency while they were moving, and could reduce energy consumption by increasing sleep time while the objects were immobile...|$|E

Problems {{in the development}} of the company is how to increase the production in each production line. Constraints incurred in the company due to non optimal operation performance system. This is an obstacle for the company to expand its business. That problem causes difficulties for the company in determining the long-term strategic plan. Evolving business issues will be discussed through strategic audit that is expected could achieve strategic fit. The discussion includes the current situation of the company, corporate governance, external environment, internal environment, and strategic analysis. Constraints on the performance of the operation will be solved by formulating operations strategy. Ability to carry out operations management requires performance measurement. Measurement in meeting customer needs includes productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, and health and safety workplace. Measurement is fundamental to know the capabilities. Thus the company will know the capacity and productivity of the plant. The ability to recognize this capacity will be a fundamental consideration of the company in making a development strategy decision to achieve long-term targets. Changes will occur in the basic performance records, knowledge of the exact production capacity, also in opportunities to make working methods improvement and an appropriate investment. By knowing the production capacity accurately, the coordination of each division in achieving target will be synergic.
