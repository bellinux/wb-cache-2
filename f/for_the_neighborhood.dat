5|$|During Christmas, Edward carves an angelic ice {{sculpture}} {{modeled after}} Kim; the ice shavings are {{thrown into the}} air and fall like snow, a rarity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming Kim, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealousy, breaks up with him. Edward runs off in a rage, destroying his works until he is calmed by a stray dog. Kim tells her parents what happened, and they set out to find Edward. Edward returns to the Boggs home to find Kim and Kevin there. Kim tries apologizing for Jim's behavior and asks him to hold her, but Edward fears he will hurt her. Jim drives around in a drunken rage and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety, inadvertently cutting him. Jim tells those witnessing the event that Edward is attacking Kevin, and he tries attacking Edward. Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm, and then flees to the mansion.|$|E
5|$|The ferry {{scene was}} filmed in the New York town of Athens, and Mary Ann's parents' house {{was located in}} Brooklyn (but was {{featured}} in the film in Boston). <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> plane crash scene, the production crew bought a retired Boeing 747, with transportation costs of $2 million, destroyed it into pieces, and built houses around them. The destroyed plane was kept for the Universal Studios back-lot tour. Ray's house was filmed in Bayonne, New Jersey (with a soundstage doubling the interior); meanwhile, the valley war sequence was filmed in Lexington, Virginia and Mystery Mesa in California. The scene where the tripod is shot down and crashes through a factory was filmed in Naugatuck, Connecticut at the since dismantled Naugatuck Chemical. The scene of the bodies floating down the river was filmed on the Farmington River in Windsor, Connecticut by a second unit using a stand in for Dakota Fanning (the back of her character) with the portion showing {{the faces of the}} credited actors cut in later. Some filming was shot on the Korean War Veterans Parkway in Staten Island, NY. The film used six sound stages, spread over three studio lots.|$|E

25|$|As {{the city}} grew {{following}} {{the opening of}} the Erie Canal in the early 19th century, development did not reach the South End immediately, save for an early toll road, now South Pearl Street (part of New York State Route 32) built {{in the first years of}} the 19th century, which later became the backbone of the South End and remains important. Planned streets <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> were included in Albany's grid pattern as early as 1818. They were built in the middle of the century, and by the 1870s the district had begun to grow rapidly, fueled by German immigrants, a group still closely associated with the South End and the first of several waves of immigrants to leave their mark on it. Irish Americans would also consider it theirs even as they dispersed to other parts of the city, and one native of the district, Daniel P. O'Connell, grew up to become boss of the city's Democratic political machine well into the 20th century, using a now-demolished building in the district as his headquarters.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the current}} issues {{today is the}} trend to redevelop {{properties}} by constructing grand towers behind the facades of historic structures along Michigan and Wabash Avenues (the parallel street one block to the west). The most recent examples of this have been The Heritage at Millennium Park, Legacy at Millennium Park and the 80-story tower proposed {{as part of the}} YWCA building redevelopment at 830 S. Michigan Avenue. This trend is now endangering the Chicago Athletic Association Annex, which has been proposed for demolition {{to make way for a}} fifty- to eighty-story condominium tower across from Millennium Park. As a result, the building is listed first on the 2006-07 Chicagoland Watch List of the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois. [...] On the other hand, many were concerned that the landmark district designation would stagnate development of the area. [...] The purpose of the designation was to [...] "keep the architecture there and encourage architecture like it and keep the wall of the park," [...] according to the City's Department of Planning and Development. [...] Thus, redevolpment for new uses will be part of the ongoing concerns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Thus, buildings being renovated for condos and dormitories is a part of the present and future for the district.|$|E

Along {{with the rest of}} the downtown transit tunnel stations, International District/Chinatown station was designed with integrated public artwork, coordinated by lead artists Alice Adams and Sonya Ishii. The plaza level includes seating areas, covered shelters for seller's booths, and a small wooden stage modeled after the architecture of traditional Japanese homes. The plaza is paved with bricks arranged with symbols of the Chinese zodiac in the style of traditional Coast Salish depictions of animals. Other areas of the plaza have steel trellises with grown ivy and a pair of etched poems about Asian railroad laborers. At the north end of the plaza are two kiosks with clay tiles depicting legends and stories from Native American, Asian, and African cultures, created by elementary school students from Beacon Hill. The platform level's east wall has a series of nine painted steel origami patterns by Ishii, called the [...] "Paper Chase"; the origami depicts the phases of the moon and blooming of a cherry blossom. The entrance stairways between the platform and plaza levels are also adorned with quotations from Phillippine writer Jose Rizal, poet Eve Triem, Chinatown merchant Chin Gee Hee, and University of Washington professor Teresa Schmid McMahon.|$|E
