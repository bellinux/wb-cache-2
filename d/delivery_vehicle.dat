40|$|<b>Delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{that can}} {{encapsulate}} and release active ingredients of pre-determined volumes {{at the target}} site on-demand present a challenge in biomedical field. Due to their tunable physiochemical properties and degradation rate, polymeric particles {{are one of the}} most extensively employed <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Generally they are fabricated from emulsion templates. Conventional bulk emulsification technique provides little control over the characteristics of droplets generated. Thus the properties of the subsequent particles cannot be controlled. The advance of droplet microfluidics enables the generation and manipulation of designer single, double or higher-order emulsion droplets with customizable structure. These droplets are powerful and versatile templates for fabricating polymeric <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> with pre-determined properties. Due to the monodispersity of droplet templates by microfluidics, the relationship between size, size distribution, shape, architecture, elastic responses and release kinetics can be systematically studied. These understandings are of key importance for the design and fabrication of the next generation polymeric <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> with custom-made functions for specific applications. In the present work, we engineer the droplet templates generated from microfluidics to fabricate designer polymeric microparticles as <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> We investigate and obtain the relationship between the particle size, size distribution, structure of microparticles and their release kinetics. Moreover, we also identify an innovative route to tune the particle shape that enables the investigation of the relationship between particle shape and release kinetics. We take advantage of the dewetting phenomena driving by interfacial tensions of different liquid phases to vary the droplet shape. We find that the phase-separation-induced shape variation of polymeric composite particles can be engineered by manipulating the kinetic barriers during droplet shape evolution. To predict the performance of our advanced polymer particles in practical applications, for instance, in narrow blood vessels in vivo, we also develop a novel capillary micromechanics technique to characterize the linear and non-linear elastic response of our polymer particles on single particle level. The knowledge of the mechanical properties enables the prediction as well as the design of the mechanical aspects of polymer particles in different applications. The ability to control and design the physical, chemical, mechanical properties of the <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and the understanding between these properties and the biological functionalities of <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles,</b> such as the release kinetics, lead towards tailor-designed <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> with finely-designed functionalities for various biomedical applications. Our proposed electro-microfluidic platform potentially enables generation of submicron droplet templates with a narrow size distribution and nanoscaled <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> with well-controlled properties, leading to a next generation of intracellular <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Microfluidic-based technique has the potential to be scaled up by parallel operation. Therefore, we are well-equipped for the massive production of custom-made droplet templates of both micron-size and nanosized, and we can design the physiochemical properties and biological functionalities of the <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> These abilities enable us to provide solutions for applications and fundamental topics where encapsulation, preservation and transportation of active ingredients are needed. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

In 1919 the company expanded {{for the first time}} outside of Seattle to Oakland, California and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United under the same organisation and Parcel identified the type of business offered as part of its Service. Common carrier service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.|$|E
40|$|Track 4 : Manufacturing and Materials for Nanomedicine, Biology and Na … - Session: 4 - 4 Delivery Applications using Polymersomes, Capsules, and Bubbles: paper no. NEMB 2013 - 93028 Successful therapies {{often require}} the use of drugs, which should be {{delivered}} to the target and be released for a certain period of time. To achieve targeted release with a suitable drug release profile, the drug <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> that first encapsulate and subsequently release the drugs need to be tailored. Conventional drug <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles,</b> such as polymer microspheres, enable the tuning of the drug release profiles by varying their size, size distribution, as well as the degradation rates of the microspheres. However, more complex release profiles, such as zeroth order release, cannot be easily achieved with polymer microspheres. Moreover, important current approaches to prepare these polymer microspheres are often emulsion-based; they typically involve the use of organic solvents, which may lead to degradation of the drugs involved. Furthermore, certain therapies {{require the use}} of a cocktail of multiple drugs, which can include both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Co-encapsulation and sequential release of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs are challenging to achieve with existing drug <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Therefore, novel approaches to fabricate <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> for encapsulating both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, with complicated drug release kinetics, without the use of organic solvents, are desired. In our work, we propose the use of multiphase microfluidics to prepare drug <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> with complex structures, such as core-shell capsules, multicompartment microspheres and nonspherical particles; by tailoring the spatial distribution of drugs, unconventional drug release profiles can be achieved. To avoid the use of harmful organic solvents, we introduce the use of aqueous two-phase systems in microfluidics to generate the emulsion templates for making these novel <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> By manipulating the interfacial characteristics of the emulsion templates, complex structures with hydrophilic and hydrophobic compartments can be prepared for separate encapsulation and sequential release of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. We will discuss the fundamental problems {{that need to be addressed}} to generate these drug <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> and highlight their potential by demonstrating their release characteristics. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Experiments were performed on both porcine and human blood DC subpopulations. Encapsulation of class-A CpG-ODN (loading into Ng) strongly reduced the CpG-ODN uptake and intracellular trafficking in the cytosol; this was associated with a marked deficiency in IFN-α induction. In contrast, encapsulation of class-B CpG-ODN increased its uptake and did not influence consistently intracellular trafficking into the nucleus. The choice of CpG-ODN class as adjuvant is thus critical in terms of how it will behave with nanoparticulate vaccine <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The latter can have distinctive modulatory influences on the CpG-ODN, which would require definition for different CpG-ODN and <b>delivery</b> <b>vehicles</b> prior to vaccine formulation.
