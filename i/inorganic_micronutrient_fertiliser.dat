40|$|Several {{aspects of}} soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) tissue {{culture and its}} {{transformation}} were examined in this study. A protocol for regeneration of soybean plants from excised parts of 7 -day-old Peking seedlings has been developed. Two kinds of explants were used: excised cotyledons and explants each consisting of cotyledonary and primary leaf nodes, the internode that joins them, and one attached cotyledon. When both explants were cultured in vitro on the highly effective shoot-induction medium devised in this study, 35 and 37 shoots per explant on the average were produced from the petiol of the excised cotyledon and from the primary leaf node, respectively. The shoot-induction medium is a modified Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing the normal level of MS inorganic macronutrients, fourfold <b>inorganic</b> <b>micronutrients</b> except cobalt, B 5 vitamins, 3 g · 1 [superscript]- 1 sucrose, 2 g · 1 [superscript]- 1 L-proline, 2 mg · 1 [superscript]- 1 N[superscript] 6 -benzyladenine, and 0. 02 mg · 1 [superscript]- 1 [alpha]-naphthaleneacetic acid. Added proline and the increased <b>inorganic</b> <b>micronutrients</b> interact synergistically on shoot regeneration from both kinds of explant, but increasing the micronutrient supply alone {{has little or no}} effect. This latter finding seems to explain why earlier attempts to increase shoot regeneration by raising micronutrient did not succeed;The effect of each element of MS micronutrients on shoot regeneration was tested by either singly omitting or adding each element, or raising or lowering the concentration of each element in the medium. Among the seven elements of the MS micronutrients mixture, zinc is the most limiting and all except cobalt are in less than optimal concentration when tested in the proline-containing medium;Small, apparently transformed shoots have been obtained by using Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer and the productive regeneration system involving shoot regeneration from primary leaf node explants. Agrobacterium strain A 281, LBA 4404, and A 208 caused shoot transformation judging from kanamycin resistance and [beta]-glucuronidase (GUS) activity...|$|R

More than 6 % of global mortality and morbidity burdens are associated with undernourishment and MNDs. Here we show that, in 2011, 3. 5 and 1. 1 billion people were at risk of calcium (Ca) and zinc (Zn) deficiency respectively due to inadequate dietary supply. The global mean dietary supply of Ca and Zn in 2011 was 684 [*]±[*] 211 and 16 [*]±[*] 3 mg capita− 1 d− 1 (±SD) respectively. Between 1992 and 2011, global risk of deficiency of Ca and Zn decreased from 76 to 51 %, and 22 to 16 %, respectively. Approximately 90 % of those at risk of Ca and Zn deficiency in 2011 were in Africa and Asia. To our knowledge, these are the first global estimates of dietary Ca deficiency risks based on food supply. We conclude that continuing to reduce Ca and Zn deficiency risks through dietary diversification and food and agricultural interventions including fortification, crop breeding and use of <b>micronutrient</b> <b>fertilisers</b> will remain a significant challenge...|$|R

Micronutrient concentrations were lower compared to the average long-term values for the summer period.

Phytoplankton biomass varied from 11 to 205 mg C/m** 3 with the highest values observed in the Bas and DB. Three groups of stations were defined during the analysis of phytoplankton species composition similarity.

The Wetlands are intimately linked with the agro-ecosystems in the mountainous area of the Himalaya and the depletion has definite and obvious impacts on the overall socio-economic and agricultural scenario of the entire region. Macro invertebrate community responses to environmental changes are useful in assessing the impact of municipal, industrial, oil and agricultural wastes from other land uses on surface waters. There are four types of environmental changes, for which the patterns of Macrozoobenthos community structure changes have been documented, these are: Increased <b>inorganic</b> <b>micronutrients,</b> increased organic load, substrate alteration and toxic chemical pollution.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{life cycle}} of the marine brown alga Petalonia fascia (O. F. Müll.) Kuntze has been investigated in artificial sea water under unialgal culture. The zoospores produced from the plurilocular sporangia of sporophytes developed directly into protonemata, plethysmothalli, and Ralfsia-like thalli. The appearance and fertility of various morphological types of thalli of P. fascia might be controlled by iodine concentrations, light and temperature. The last two factors, Interrelated with each other, were discussed. Protonemata and/or plethysmothalli survived in the most extreme experimental culture conditions, such as lowest and highest temperatures, intensities of light, and total iodine deficiency. However, Ralfsia-like thalli and sporophytes required more suitable environments. [...] Optimum concentrations of <b>inorganic</b> <b>micronutrient</b> requirements (I, Br, Mo, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Co) and growth-regulating substances (indoleacetic acid and vitamin B 12) for the growth, development, and/or reproduction of P. fascia were determined. Iodine {{appears to be an}} essential element for growth, morphogenesis and reproduction of P. fascia and it cannot be replaced by bromine. There is an antagonistic effect between iron and manganese in the growth of the experimental alga. [...] The low concentrations of indoleacetic acid stimulate growth and accelerate zoospore production of P. fascia. This plant hormone may counteract the zinc deficiency.

40|$|Soil {{amendment}} with biochar {{is currently}} proposed as a management strategy to improve soil quality and enhance plant productivity. Relatively {{little is known}} about how biochar affects plant competition, although {{it has been suggested that}} it can increase the competitive ability of legumes. This study tested the impact of a biochar on the competitive ability of legumes through alterations to soil pH and/or nutrient availability. Biochar was produced from aboveground plant biomass from a species-rich semi-natural grassland pyrolysed at 400 °C. In a greenhouse experiment, a legume (red clover, Trifolium pratense L.); a grass (red fescue, Festuca rubra L.); and a forb (plantain, Plantago lanceolata L.) were grown in (1) monocultures, (2) in a mixed culture of red fescue and red clover, and (3) in a mixture of all three species. Soil treatments included fertilisation with nitrogen (N), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), or <b>micronutrient</b> <b>fertiliser</b> in the presence or absence of biochar; a pH-adjusted control soil; and a control (i. e. with no amendment). The competitive ability of red clover was quantified as the proportion of aboveground biomass of this species within the mixtures. Both biochar amendment and K fertilisation significantly (P < 0. 001) increased red clover biomass, and increased the competitive ability of red clover when grown with red fescue and plantain. Application of N fertiliser, irrespective of biochar amendment, resulted in significantly (P < 0. 001) greater red fescue and plantain biomass and eliminated the competitive advantage of red clover. The biochar-mediated pH increase did not affect red clover biomass or its competitive ability. We conclude that biochar has a beneficial effect on red clover under N limiting conditions due to an increase in K availability. Our results suggest a potential role for biochar to maintain the proportion of forage legumes in agricultural pastures or semi-natural grasslands...|$|R
40|$|Calcareous soils in arid and {{semi-arid}} environments {{are often}} deficient in <b>micronutrients.</b> Sulphur and <b>inorganic</b> <b>micronutrient</b> fertilizers are sometimes added to these soils {{to increase the}} availability of Fe and Zn. A greenhouse study was initiated to investigate the enhancement of micronutrient availability {{as a result of}} adding small amounts of S, with or without Zn or Fe. A calcareous soil from western Kansas, known to be deficient in Zn and Fe, was amended with all combinations of 0, 20. 0 or 40. 0 ppm S as elemental S; 0, 2. 5 and 5 ppm Zn as ZnO; 0, 5 and 10 ppm Fe as FeCl 3. In one study, soils were incubated and periodically sampled and analyzed for pH and DTPA-extractable Fe and Zn. In a second study, soils were planted with soybean (glycine mar L.). Plants were harvested after eight weeks and analyzed for dry matter and uptake of Zn and Fe. The addition of S did not change the pH of the soil. but dry matter Yield, plant uptake of Zn and DTPA-extractable Zn increased. Iron concentration in the plants and DTPA-extractable Fe were not affected by S additions. Addition of Zn increased Zn in the plants, but addition of Fe did not produce a response. Combinations of S and Zn and Fe did not result in increases in DTPA-extractable concentrations, dry matter yields or plant uptake. These results suggest that soil amendments of Zn and S are feasible to correct Zn deficiencies in the calcareous soils but are not practical for Fe...|$|R
40|$|The {{stoichiometry}} {{of biological}} components and {{their influence on}} dissolved distributions have long been {{of interest in the}} study of the oceans. Cobalt has the smallest oceanic inventory of <b>inorganic</b> <b>micronutrients</b> and hence is particularly vulnerable to influence by internal oceanic processes including euphotic zone uptake, remineralization, and scavenging. Here we observe not only large variations in dCo : P stoichiometry but also the acceleration of those dCo : P ratios in the upper water column in response to several environmental processes. The ecological stoichiometry of total dissolved cobalt (dCo) was examined using data from a US North Atlantic GEOTRACES transect and from a zonal South Atlantic GEOTRACES-compliant transect (GA 03 / 3 _e and GAc 01) by Redfieldian analysis of its statistical relationships with the macronutrient phosphate. Trends in the dissolved cobalt to phosphate (dCo : P) stoichiometric relationships were evident in the basin-scale vertical structure of cobalt, with positive dCo : P slopes in the euphotic zone and negative slopes found in the ocean interior and in coastal environments. The euphotic positive slopes were often found to accelerate towards the surface and this was interpreted as being due to the combined influence of depleted phosphate, phosphorus-sparing (conserving) mechanisms, increased alkaline phosphatase metalloenzyme production (a zinc or perhaps cobalt enzyme), and biochemical substitution of Co for depleted Zn. Consistent with this, dissolved Zn (dZn) was found to be drawn down to only 2 -fold more than dCo, despite being more than 18 -fold more abundant in the ocean interior.

40|$|The quantity, {{quality and}} variety of food {{ingested}} by humans largely determines the intake of the essential mineral micronutrients required for normal human physiological functioning, growth and development. Inadequate dietary intake, low bioavailability, and failure {{of the human body}} to utilize ingested essential minerals lead to mineral micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs), an invisible form of undernutrition also known as hidden hunger. With the aim of aiding future human nutrition policy planning, the extent of dietary MNDs of calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), iodine (I), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) were estimated by integrating food supply and composition, estimated average requirement and demographic data. National level dietary Ca, Mg and Zn deficiency risks between 1992 and 2011 were estimated for the populations of 145 countries. Globally, in 2011, 3. 5 and 1. 1 billion people were at risk of Ca and Zn deficiency, respectively, due to inadequate dietary supply; 14 million people were at risk of Mg deficiency during the same period. Ninety percent of those at risk of Ca and Zn deficiency in 2011 lived in Africa and Asia. Considering the limited policy-making relevance of the low resolution national estimates of mineral MNDs, sub-national level assessments of the prevalence of dietary mineral MNDs were made for Malawi in 2011 using a 7 -day household dietary recall survey data (n = 12117). It was estimated that > 50 % of households in Malawi were at risk of energy, Ca, Se, or Zn deficiencies due to inadequate dietary supplies, but supplies of Fe, Cu and Mg were adequate for > 80 % of households. Interventions to address dietary mineral deficiencies, such as dietary diversification using underutilized multipurpose and hardy tree/shrub species (e. g. Moringa spp.), were considered. Greater than 78 % of Moringa growing households in southern Ethiopia and Kenya use M. oleifera (MO) and M. stenopetala (MS) trees as a source of food. Increasing the dietary consumption of MO and MS leaves, as a fresh vegetable or in powdered form, can reduce the prevalence of mineral micronutrient deficiencies, most notably Se deficiency. Daily consumption of 100 g Kenyan MO or MS fresh leaves could provide 100 % and 144 %, respectively, of the Se recommended daily allowance for a healthy adult man. Research and development to promote the use of these species in the fight against hidden hunger, are necessary. Continuing to reduce mineral MND risks through dietary diversification, and food and agricultural interventions, including fortification, crop breeding and use of <b>micronutrient</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> will remain a significant challenge during the global Sustainable Development era...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of micronutrients in sustainable crop production is usually {{linked to the}} focus on high yields and increased cropping intensity on existing arable lands for feeding the ever-increasing world population. However, micronutrient exports from cropping systems have often been neglected, while fertiliser strategies for high yields are largely based on NPK, particularly in developing countries. Land degradation such as organic matter loss and soil acidification has added another layer of complexity of managing micronutrients in cropping systems. Micronutrient fertilizer strategies must embrace changes in farming systems and land uses, including the shifts to no-till and water-saving rice production. In addition to effects of soil organic matter and soil acidification, micronutrient availability in the rooting zone {{is likely to be}} further influenced by erratic rainfall patterns and drought associated with climate change in the future. Solutions to these challenges will lie with well-designed agronomic measures such as regular replenishment of <b>micronutrients</b> through <b>fertiliser</b> inputs and crop residue management.

This study examined the success after 12 years of imported topsoil, sewage sludge, <b>micronutrients,</b> and <b>fertiliser</b> tablets applied at planting (all with and without broadcast fertiliser) on the survival, growth and health of six-month old seedlings of Eucalyptus gomphocephala, Acacia saligna, Banksia prionotes, B. attenuata, E. decipiens, Templetonia retusa and Dodonaea aptera in an abandoned limestone quarry in a mediterranean type climate in south-west Western Australia. Natural recruitment of seedlings of these species was also noted. After 12 years, overall survival was 17. 4 %, ranging from 42 % in E. gomphocephala to 1 % in T. retusa. Treatment combinations did not influence survival of any species, nor did growth (measured as height and DBHOB) vary in response to treatment. Treatment did not influence the health of any species significantly, with the exceptions of E. decipiens (healthiest in the All treatment) and B. attenuata (significantly lower levels of health when exposed to broadcast fertiliser). A. saligna, D. aptera and other local species from surrounding woodlands had naturally recruited seedlings.

40|$|The grain yield {{benefits}} of applying <b>micronutrient</b> fluid <b>fertilisers</b> over conventional granular products in calcareous sandy loam soils have been agronomically demonstrated. An {{understanding of the}} fundamental mechanisms and reactions occurring following application of these products to soils is critical to improve fertiliser management. We therefore examined the diffusion, solubility, and potential availability of manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) from both granular and fluid forms of Mn and Zn fertiliser in an alkaline calcareous and alkaline non-calcareous soil using laboratory incubation experiments in conjunction with an isotopic dilution technique with ⁵⁴Mn and ⁶⁵Zn. Enhanced mobility, solubility, and/or potential availability of Mn and Zn from fluid fertilisers were observed in comparison to Mn or Zn from granular fertilisers in both soils after 5 weeks of incubation. Differential behaviour of fluid and granular fertilisers for Mn and Zn appeared to be independent of their effects on soil pH. Most (~ 90 %) of the Mn in granular fertiliser dissolved and diffused out of the granule but was retained within 4 mm of the point of granular placement, whereas most (~ 85 %) of the Zn in the granular Zn fertiliser source remained in the granule. Our {{data suggest that the}} superior agronomic effectiveness of fluid Mn and Zn fertilisers observed in calcareous soils under field conditions may have resulted from the enhanced diffusion (Mn) and/or solubility/availability (Mn, Zn) of these micronutrients in soil when applied in fluid form.

West Bengal India’s resounding success from its past green revolution has {{been followed by}} stagnating or declining agricultural productivity, even with increased total fertiliser use in the country over the years. This declining factor productivity {{is largely due to}} imbalanced fertiliser use (Kumar et. al. 2007). Fertiliser application is highly skewed in favour of N, with relatively small use of K and P application, and rare use of secondary and <b>micronutrients.</b> Current generalised <b>fertiliser</b> recommendations are also sub-optimal and need upward refinement. In rice-based crop-ping systems, a negative K balance of 31 kg K 2 O/ha/year was estimated, and this imbalance is projected to increase further (Trivedi, 2001). Phosphorus removal under this intensive crop rotation amounts to 150 kg P 2 O 5 /ha/year, which is often higher than the annual nutrient replenishment (Tandon and Sekhon, 1998). Keeping in view the need for more balanced and intensive agriculture in India, P and K application needs to be increased (Sanyal and Chatterjee, 2007). The present study was conducted to optimise P and K management strate-gies to achieve maximum yields in an important rice-based cropping sequence.

Treatments were investigated at different amendment concentrations. From initial studies, the incapability of the endogenous soil microorganisms to mineralise diuron was confirmed. However, after the inorganic amendment was applied, {{with the aim}} of supplying essential nutrients for soil flora activation, a 5 % of diuron mineralisation was reached after 150 days, concluding that the soil has a potential capacity to mineralise the herbicide through biostimulation-assisted natural attenuation. Diuron mineralisation was improved using a HPBCD solution at a very low concentration of only 10 times the diuron equimolar concentration in soil. This molecule is able to form diuron inclusion complexes, which provokes an increasing in its hydrosolubility, and hence, in the amount of the herbicide in the soil solution. With this strategy, a higher amount of diuron molecules will be more bioaccesible for the soil microorganisms. After HPBCD application mineralisation rate was increased 27 times regarding to the inorganic amendment application, and the extent of herbicide mineralisation reached a 31 %. Organic amendments from different origins were also applied on the contaminated soil at different concentrations (0. 5, 2 and 4 % w/soil dw). In general, as increasing amendment concentration diuron mineralisation rate was improved, regarding to the inorganic amendment application. 33 % of the herbicide was mineralised after RSU amendment was applied at 4 % w/soil dw. Finally, the joint application of the three amendments investigated and at the best conditions tested was conducted in order to obtain the best diuron mineralisation results.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of application of small amounts of nitrogen to the soil together with foliar application of micronutrients on the content of copper, manganese and zinc in the grain of spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta L.). The study was based on a two-factor field experiment conducted in 2009 – 2011 on very good rye complex soil. Nitrogen was applied in the form of ammonium nitrate (34 % N), and manganese and copper were applied to the leaves in the form of the fertilisers Adob Mn (1. 5 l∙ha− 1) and Adob Cu (1. 0 l∙ha− 1), respectively. The results indicated that the nitrogen fertilisation, the foliar application of micronutrients and the interaction of these factors significantly determined the contents of copper, manganese and zinc in the grain. The highest content of Cu and Mn in the material was obtained following the application of 50 kg N·ha− 1, and an increase in nitrogen application (to 50 kg·ha− 1) caused a decrease in the content of zinc in the grain. Foliar application of Cu, Mn and both elements together resulted in significant changes in the concentrations of Cu, Mn and Zn in the plant material as compared to treatment without the application of <b>micronutrients.</b> The mineral <b>fertilisers</b> at the rates applied had a beneficial effect on the chemical composition of the grain, and thus on its quality, and this was achieved with substantially lower consumption of agrochemicals than that in the case of agrotechnical procedures for traditional cereals.

40|$|Phytoplankton is the {{dominant}} primary producer in aquatic ecosystems and is considered a gauge of ecological condition and change. Some phytoplankton groups, namely diatoms, dinoflagellates, and coccolithophores, produce morphological or chemical fossils {{that can be used}} for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. This study aims to review the processes that regulate dynamics in living phytoplankton and to highlight how this knowledge is used in paleoecological studies. The distribution patterns of phytoplankton in present-day aquatic ecosystems are shaped by the interplay between processes that regulate cell growth and cell death. Cell growth and cell death are regulated by the internal environment of phytoplankton (e. g., specific environmental tolerances, resource uptake properties, cell size, density and morphology, alternative nutritional strategies such as mixotrophy or N 2 uptake, motility, intracellular storage capacities, grazing resistance properties), and by its external environment. The external environment includes variables dependent on the availability of resources (e. g., light intensity, concentration of CO 2 and dissolved <b>inorganic</b> macronutrients and <b>micronutrients,</b> availability of living prey in case of mixotrophs) and variables independent of resources (e. g., temperature, salinity, turbulence, ultraviolet radiation, bioactive compounds, activity of grazers, viruses, and eukaryotic parasites). The importance of recently described loss processes, such as grazing by phagotrophic protists, viral lyses, and programmed cell death, is discussed in the context of its potential impact upon phytoplankton vertical fluxes.

40|$|Perennial fruit crops like citrus {{can benefit}} from foliar {{nutrition}} since deep roots can deplete the soil and soil amendments other than fertigation are not easily applied without damaging roots. Increases in production costs are urging farmers to be more cost effective in supplying their crops with the necessary micronutrients. Different formulations (amino acid, chelated or <b>inorganic</b> complexes) for <b>micronutrients</b> exist and, when used as foliar sprays, more information is needed on: i) {{the most effective and}} cost effective formulation for uptake in citrus, ii) the highest concentrations for each formulation for the most efficient application and iii) the influence of contact time between micronutrient and citrus leaves on nutrient uptake. Plant species, organ types and developmental stages of the plant organ may also result in differences in cuticle ultrastructure that influences the uptake of foliar applied chemicals. Potted ‘Midknight’ trees on Carizzo Citrange rootstock were used to evaluate the uptake of foliar applied micronutrients. All experiments were done in a greenhouse at the University of Pretoria. For the main experiment different formulations, concentrations and times of sampling for foliar applied manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), boron (B) and molybdenum (Mo) were evaluated. The treated leaves, as well as the leaf directly above and below the treated leaves were sampled. The most effective and cost effective formulation and concentration were determined by applying B: H 3 BO 3 (2 X) and Mo: Na 2 MoO 4. 2 H 2 O (4 X) as a multiple of the recommended concentration of the FSSA (Fertiliser Society of South Africa) (2003) and Mn: MnSO 4 (4 X), Zn: ZnSO 4 (4 X), Cu: CuSO 4 (4 X) and Fe: FeSO 4 (0. 5 X) as a multiple of the recommended concentration of the manufacturer of the amino acids used. The multiple concentrations are given in parenthesis. The optimal times of sampling after application to determine the time at which maximum uptake occurred for the different elements were: Cu – 24 h, Mo & B – 48 h, Mn & Zn – 96 h, Fe – 192 h. The translocation of Mn, B and Mo occurred to the leaf directly above and below the treated leaf, while Cu, Zn and Fe did not translocate readily, indicating that multiple seasonal applications may be necessary. A scanning electron microscopic study (SEM) was done on leaf surfaces of lemon, grapefruit, mandarin, navel and orange trees. The physical appearance of the wax on the leaf surfaces was visually inspected and no considerable differences between the different citrus species, for the same age leaves, were found that may affect penetration of foliar applied micronutrients. Mature leaves had larger amounts of surface wax than young leaves. Cuticle thicknesses for the different citrus species differed among the leaf age and the abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces. ‘Bahianinha’ navel, ‘Satsuma’ mandarin and ‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit leaves had thicker cuticles than Valencia leaves in most cases. ‘Washington’ navel and ‘Genoa’ lemon leaves had thinner cuticles than that of Valencia. Cuticle thickness may therefore have an influence on differences in the uptake of foliar applied products between citrus species. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.
