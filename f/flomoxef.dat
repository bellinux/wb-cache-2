40|$|Background: In {{the face}} of {{increasing}} treatment options for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kp) hemodialysis (HD) access-related bacteremia, the difference in clinical effectiveness between ertapenem and <b>flomoxef</b> remains unclear. We conducted this retrospective study to determine their efficacies and treatment outcomes. Methods: Patients on maintenance HD with fistula-, graft-, or catheter-related ESBL-Kp bacteremia were enrolled. Data related to clinical features and antibiotic treatments were collected. Outcome was determined by mortality resulting from bacteremia during the 14 -day period after {{the collection of the}} first positive blood culture for flomoxef-susceptible ESBL-Kp. Results: The 64 patients studied had severe septicemia as determined by the Pitt bacteremia score; 50 % (32 / 64) were {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) at the time of bacteremia. Old age (> 65 years; 57. 8 %), malnutrition (albumin  30 days; 75 %) were also highly prevalent. The study population comprised nine fistula-, 10 graft-, and 45 HD catheter-related bacteremia cases, and the mortality rate was high (38 / 64, 59. 4 %). The mortality rate was significantly higher in the <b>flomoxef</b> treatment group than in the ertapenem treatment group (22 / 30, 73 % vs. 16 / 34, 47 %, p <  0. 05). Among patients with catheter-related bacteremia, multivariate analyses revealed that <b>flomoxef</b> use (odds ratio (OR) 2. 52, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 34 – 35. 17) and Pitt bacteremia score (OR 4. 37, 95 % CI 1. 28 – 5. 26) were independently associated with mortality. Conclusions: In accordance with our previous study, our results have demonstrated the inferiority of <b>flomoxef</b> to carbapenems in the treatment of HD access-related ESBL-Kp bacteremia and provide an insight into the possibility of using ertapenem rather than <b>flomoxef</b> as an initial or de-escalating therapy for infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hemodialysis (HD) {{patients}} {{are susceptible to}} extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing bacterial infections. Because the optimal treatment and clinical significance of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kp) HD access-related bacteremia remain unclear, we conducted this retrospective study to determine the clinical outcomes of patients treated with either <b>flomoxef</b> or a carbapenem. Methods The eligibility criterion was fistula or graft- or catheter- related ESBL-Kp bacteremia in patients on maintenance HD. The clinical characteristics and antibiotic management were analyzed. Outcome was determined by mortality resulting from bacteremia during the 14 ‐day period after the first positive blood culture for flomoxef-susceptible ESBL-Kp. Results The 57 patients studied were predominantly elderly, malnourished, {{with a history of}} severe illnesses and broad-spectrum antibiotic use before the onset of bacteremia, and with severe septicemia as determined by the Pitt bacteremia score (PBS). The study population comprised 7 fistula, 8 graft, and 42 HD catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) cases, and the mortality rate was high (36 / 57, 63. 2 %) in these 57 patients. Of 42 patients with CRB, those in the deceased group (27 / 42, 64. 3 %) had significantly lower levels of serum albumin, longer prior hospital stay and duration of catheter-dependent HD, and higher PBS than patients in the survived group. Failure to receive effective antibiotics (<b>flomoxef</b> or a carbapenem) within 5 days after onset of bacteremia and treatment with <b>flomoxef</b> both significantly contributed to higher mortality. Multivariate analyses revealed that <b>flomoxef</b> use, PBS, and catheter-dependent HD > 30 days were independently associated with increased mortality (OR, 3. 52; 95 % CI, 1. 19 – 58. 17, OR, 2. 92; 95 % CI, 1. 36 – 6. 26 and OR, 5. 73; 95 % CI, 1. 21 – 63. 2, respectively). Conclusions Considering the high mortality rate, ESBL-Kp should be recognized as a possible pathogen in patients on maintenance HD at high risk of acquiring HD access infections associated with ESBL-producing bacteria. Carbapenems rather than <b>flomoxef</b> should be the therapy of choice in these critically vulnerable patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Many {{cephalosporin}} antibiotics {{have recently}} been invented and {{attempts have been made}} to use them clinically. The choice of which of these drugs should be used has been difficult in gynecology. The efficacies of these drugs depend on their antibacterial spectra, potencies, and concentrations in tissues. This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of various cephem antibiotics in the exudate of the retroperitoneal space that is formed after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. These cephem antibiotics were cefoxitin, cefotiam, cefotetan, cefpiramide, cefminox, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, cefpimizole, <b>flomoxef,</b> and cefuzonam. The maximum concentrations after administration of a 1 -g dose in the exudate of the pelvic retroperitoneal space were 37. 9 micrograms/ml with cefminox, 30. 3 micrograms/ml with cefpimizole, 21. 6 micrograms/ml with <b>flomoxef,</b> 21. 5 micrograms/ml with ceftazidime, and 17. 6 micrograms/ml with cefbuperazone, which were relatively high.

The MICs were less than 6. 3 micrograms/ml and more than 12. 5 micrograms/ml in the low- and high-resistance groups, respectively. All strains produced penicillin-binding protein 2 ' (PBP 2 '), which {{has been associated with}} methicillin resistance and which has very low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. Production of PBP 2 ' was regulated differently in low- and high-resistance strains. With penicillinase-producing strains of the low-resistance group, cefazolin, cefamandole, and cefmetazole induced PBP 2 ' production about 5 -fold, while <b>flomoxef</b> induced production 2. 4 -fold or less. In contrast, penicillinase-negative variants of low-resistance strains produced PBP 2 ' constitutively in large amounts and induction did not occur. With high-resistance strains, <b>flomoxef</b> induced PBP 2 ' to an extent similar to that of cefazolin in both penicillinase-producing and -negative strains, except for one strain in which the induction did not occur. The amount of PBP 2 ' induced by beta-lactam antibiotics in penicillinase-producing strains of the low-resistance group correlated well with resistance to each antibiotic. Large amounts of PBP 2 ' in penicillinase-negative variants of the low-resistance group did not raise the MICs of beta-lactam compounds, although these strains were more resistant when challenged with <b>flomoxef</b> for 2 h. Different regulation of PBP 2 ' production was demonstrated in the high- and low-resistance groups, and factor(s) other than PBP 2 ' were suggested {{to be involved in the}} methicillin resistance of high-resistance strains...|$|E

Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC- 39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC- 39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, <b>flomoxef,</b> and cefpirome.

40|$|AbstractThe {{characteristics}} {{of patients with}} recurrent bacteraemia caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae (EK) are rarely described. <b>Flomoxef</b> belongs to the cephamycins group and demonstrates in vitro activity against ESBL-producing organisms. Whether <b>flomoxef</b> {{may be used for}} the treatment of such infections remains controversial. This retrospective case–control study enrolled adult patients who had bacteraemia caused by ESBL-EK during 2005 – 2011. Case patients were those who had more than one episode of ESBL-EK bacteraemia. Controls were those who were matched for age and interval time of blood sampling and had only one episode of ESBL-EK bacteraemia with subsequent bacteraemia episodes caused by other non-ESBL-EK bacteria. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and microbiologic profiles of the initial and subsequent ESBL-EK isolates were analysed. During the study period, 424 patients were found to have at least one positive blood culture after the first ESBL-EK bacteraemia episode, and 67 (15. 8 %) had a second episode of ESBL-EK bacteraemia. Bacteraemia resulting from vascular catheter–related infection (odds ratio, 3. 24; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 31 – 8. 05), and definitive therapy with <b>flomoxef</b> (odds ratio, 2. 99; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 10 – 8. 15) were both independent risk factors for the recurrence. Among the 56 patients with available ESBL-EK isolates for analysis, 38 (67. 8 %) were infected by genetically similar strains. In three of these 38 recurrent ESBL-EK bacteraemia cases caused by an identical strain, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of carbapenem for the subsequent K.  pneumoniae isolates were fourfold or higher than the initial isolates. Recurrent bacteraemia was not uncommon in our patients with ESBL-EK bacteraemia, and most of the episodes were caused by identical strains...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Although the {{usefulness}} of antimicrobial prophylaxis for clean-contaminated surgery has been recognized, only a few randomized controlled studies on the duration of administration after hepatectomy have been performed. We investigated the duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis after hepatectomy. Methods: The subjects were 180 patients who underwent hepatectomy without reconstruction of the biliary or intestinal tract between April 2003 and March 2006 at our department. The patients were ran-domly allocated to groups {{to be treated with}} <b>flomoxef</b> sodium as antimicrobial prophylaxis for 2 days (89 patients) or 5 days (91 patients), including the operation day. The presence or absence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and infections was investigated. Results: No significant differences were noted in patient background between the two groups. Infections occurred in seven and six patients in the 2 day and 5 day treatment groups (7. 9 % and 6. 6 %), respectively, showing {{no significant difference between the}} two groups. No significant difference was noted when the cases were divided into surgical site infections and remote infections. The positive rate of SIRS was significantly higher in the 2 day treatment group than in the 5 day treatment group on days 2 and 3 after surgery. The risk factors in patients who developed infections were blood loss, oper-ation time and the complication of biliary fistula. Conclusions: Two day administration of <b>flomoxef</b> sodium may be sufficient for antimicrobial prophy-laxis after hepatectomy. However, when SIRS is positive on post-operative day 2, and induction of liver failure is of concern, it may be safer to continue antimicrobial drug administration until SIRS is eliminated...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{combinations}} of beta-lactams with two beta-lactamase inhibitors, sulbactam and clavulanic acid, were determined in vitro against 22 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Combinations of cefpirome, cefotaxime, and cefazolin with sulbactam (10 micrograms/ml) showed synergistic effects against more than 70 % of the strains. Combinations of methicillin and penicillin G with sulbactam also showed synergistic effects against 50 and 68 % of the strains, respectively, while cefotiam, moxalactam, <b>flomoxef,</b> and cefmetazole {{in combination with}} sulbactam showed such effects against only 40 % or fewer. Clavulanic acid was synergistic only when combined with penicillin G, the effect probably being due to the beta-lactamase inhibition by the inhibitor. Sulbactam did not improve the antimicrobial activities of the beta-lactams against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains. At 42 degrees C the MICs of cefotaxime, methicillin, and <b>flomoxef</b> alone were markedly decreased from the values at 35 degrees C, and no synergy between these beta-lactams and sulbactam appeared. The resistance to penicillin G was not inhibited by incubation at 42 degrees C, and combinations of penicillin G with sulbactam and clavulanic acid showed synergy. The amounts of beta-lactamase produced were {{not related to the}} decreases in the MICs of the beta-lactams, except for penicillin G combined with sulbactam. Clavulanic acid showed slightly stronger beta-lactamase-inhibiting activity than sulbactam did. These results suggest that the synergy between sulbactam and the beta-lactams, except for penicillin G, may not be due to beta-lactamase inhibition but to suppression of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus-specific resistance based on other factors...|$|E

40|$|Background/PurposeIn Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, AmpC β-lactamases can confer {{resistance}} to the third-generation cephalosporins and oxacephems, {{but not to the}} fourth-generation cephalosporins. Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) may confer {{resistance to}} all extended-spectrum cephalosporins but not <b>flomoxef.</b> As difficult to detect, the ESBL phenotype of the intrinsically AmpC- producing E. cloacae and S. marcescens is not routinely screened in the clinical microbiology laboratories. The distinct antibiotic resistance phenotype between ESBL- and AmpC-producers may assist to differentiate the type of secreted β-lactamases. Therefore, we attested the validity of an antibiogram-based method to predict the presence of ESBLs in both species. MethodsPolymerase chain reaction-based methods and antibiogram-based methods were compared for their detection of ESBL in 74 E. cloacae and 69 S. marcescens isolates recovered from patients hospitalized at two medical centers in Taiwan. Three major types of antibiogram were defined: type I (3 s 4 s), susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime; type II (3 r 4 s), resistant to cefotaxime or ceftazidime, but susceptible to cefepime; and type III (3 r 4 r), resistant to cefepime plus cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime. Furthermore, subtype-a and subtype-b were defined as being resistant and susceptible to <b>flomoxef,</b> respectively.

All type I isolates of both species (n= 49) were non-ESBL producers. In E. cloacae, all subtype IIb (n = 6) and type III (n = 6) isolates produced ESBLs, but only 8 of 17 IIa isolates produced ESBLs. The IIb and III types had the highest positive predictive value (100 %) and specificity (100 %) for ESBL detection. In S. marcescens, type II isolates rarely produced ESBLs (4 / 57 isolates), while seven of type III (n = 8) isolates produced ESBLs. Type III antibiogram had the highest positive predictive value (87. 5 %) and specificity (98. 3 %) for ESBL detection. ConclusionThe antibiograms of subtype IIb and type III are highly predictive for ESBL detection in E. cloacae, while type III is highly predictive for ESBL detection in S. marcescens. It is imperative to further examine ESBLs, focusing on the E. cloacae isolates with antibiogram subtype IIa...|$|E
40|$|A 5 -year-old boy {{suffering}} from abdominal pain {{accompanied by a}} fever of up to 39. 5 degrees C for 2 days {{was admitted to the}} hospital. Although <b>Flomoxef</b> was administered following admission, the boy's fever persisted and abdominal distension gradually worsened. On the 4 th day, dry lips, red eyes and a strawberry tongue were noted. An echocardiogram revealed pericoronary enhancement with mild mitral valve regurgitation and a small degree of pericardial effusion, characteristics compatible with Kawasaki disease. Although intravenous immunoglobulin was administered, the fever and abdominal distension persisted. On the 8 th day, a pediatric surgeon was consulted and an exploratory laparotomy was arranged. During the operation, intestinal pseudo-obstruction and fibrin coatings around the intestine near the splenic flexure were found. A colostomy was performed for decompression of the dilated bowel and a biopsy of the lymph node surrounding the splenic flexure was taken. The fever subsided dramatically after decompression of the bowel and the recovery course was uneventful. The pathologic report revealed necrotic lymphadenitis. We report this rare case and review the literature...|$|E
40|$|The uptake and {{intracellular}} {{activity of}} AM- 1155 in murine J 774. 1 macrophages and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes were investigated. AM- 1155 penetrated phagocytic cells rapidly and reversibly, although the penetration process was {{not affected by}} metabolic inhibitors such as sodium fluoride, cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, or ouabain or by nucleoside transport system inhibitors such as adenosine. The intracellular concentration-to-extracellular concentration ratio of AM- 1155 in both cell types of phagocytes ranged from 5 to 7. These ratios were almost equal to those for sparfloxacin. The intracellular activity of AM- 1155 in J 774. 1 macrophages, examined with Staphylococcus aureus 209 P as a test bacterium, was dependent on the extracellular concentration. AM- 1155 at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml {{reduced the number of}} viable cells of S. aureus ingested by more than 90 %. The intracellular activity of AM- 1155 was more potent than those of sparfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, <b>flomoxef,</b> and erythromycin. These results suggest that the potent intracellular activity of AM- 1155 might mainly be due to the high intracellular concentration and its potent in vitro activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} effect of cefozopran (SCE- 2787), a new semisynthetic parenteral cephalosporin, against experimental infections in mice was examined. Cefozopran {{was more effective}} than cefpiramide and was as effective as ceftazidime and cefpirome against acute respiratory tract infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae DT-S. In the model of chronic respiratory tract infection caused by K. pneumoniae 27, cefozopran was as effective as ceftazidime. The {{therapeutic effect}} of cefozopran against urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa P 9 was superior to that of cefpirome and was equal to those of ceftazidime and cefclidin. In addition, cefozopran was more effective than ceftazidime and was as effective as <b>flomoxef</b> in a thigh muscle infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus 308 A- 1. Against thigh muscle infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus N 133, cefozopran was the most effective agent. The potent therapeutic effect of cefozopran in those experimental infections in mice suggests {{that it would be}} effective against respiratory tract, urinary tract, and soft tissue infections caused by a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in humans...|$|E
40|$|To {{find the}} exact {{substrate}} specificities of three species of tripartite efflux systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, and MexXY-OprM, we constructed {{a series of}} isogenic mutants, each of which constitutively overproduced {{one of the three}} efflux systems and lacked the other two, and their isogenic mutants, which lacked all these systems. Comparison of the susceptibilities of the constructed mutants to 52 antimicrobial agents belonging to various groups suggested the following substrate specificities. All of the efflux systems extrude a wide variety of antimicrobial agent groups, i. e., quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, lincomycin, chloramphenicol, most penicillins (all but carbenicillin and sulbenicillin), most cephems (all but cefsulodin and ceftazidime), meropenem, and S- 4661, but none of them extrude polymyxin B or imipenem. Extrusion of aminoglycosides is specific to MexXY-OprM, and extrusion of a group of the β-lactams, i. e., carbenicillin, sulbenicillin, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, is specific to MexAB-OprM. Moreover, MexAB-OprM and MexCD-OprJ extrude novobiocin, cefsulodin, and <b>flomoxef,</b> while MexXY-OprM does not. These substrate specificities are distinct from those reported previously...|$|E
40|$|Four {{types of}} beta-lactamases {{consisting}} of a penicillinase type I (TEM- 1), a penicillinase type II (OXA- 1), a cephalosporinase of Citrobacter freundii, and a cephalosporinase of Proteus vulgaris were introduced into Escherichia coli MC 4100 and its omp mutants, MH 1160 (MC 4100 ompR 1) and MH 760 (MC 4100 ompR 2), by transformation. Effects of {{the combination of the}} omp mutations and these beta-lactamases on the susceptibility of E. coli strains were studied with 15 beta-lactam antibiotics including cephalosporins, cephamycins, penicillins, imipenem, and aztreonam. The ompR 1 mutant, MH 1160, lacks OmpF and OmpC, and it showed reduced susceptibility to 11 of the 15 beta-lactam agents. The reduction in susceptibility to cefoxitin, moxalactam, and <b>flomoxef</b> was much greater than reduction in susceptibility to the other agents. When the ompR 1 mutant produced the cephalosporinase of C. freundii, the susceptibility of the mutant to 12 of the 15 beta-lactam antibiotics decreased. The reduction in susceptibility of MH 1160 to 10 of the 12 agents affected by the enzyme was two- to fourfold greater than that observed in MC 4100. Such a synergistic effect was also observed with the cephalosporinase of P. vulgaris and ompR 1 mutation against six cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aztreonam...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Prevotella bivia {{is one of}} the {{anaerobic}} {{bacteria that}} resides in the flora of the female genital tract. We studied the pathogenicity of P. bivia in a rat pyometra model. Methods: The experimental animal (rat) model of pyometra was developed to investigate the pathogenicity of P. bivia in a rat pyometra model. Results: In the groups inoculated with aerobes alone, the infection rate was 10 % (1 / 10) in the Staphylococcus aureus- or Staphylococcus agalactiae-inoculated group and 20 % (2 / 10) in the Escherichia coli-inoculated group. Infection Was not established in the groups inoculated with anaerobes alone. High infection rates were observed in all the mixed-infection groups. In the S. agalactiae- and Bacteroides fragilis-, S. agalactiae- and P. bivia-, E. coli- and B. fragilis-, and E. coli- and P. biviainoculated groups, an infection rate of 100 % (10 / 10) was demonstrated. The efficacy of antibiotics such as <b>flomoxef</b> (FMOX) could be determined using a rat pyometra model. In relation to the alteration of vaginal microbial flora during the menstrual cycle, estrogen increased the growth of P. bivia. Conclusion: Mixture of aerobic bacteria and P. bivia increased the pathogenicity of P. bivia. Estrogen would be useful for raising up the inflammatory change of the uterus in experimental models of genital tract infection due to P. bivia. Infect. Dis. Obstet. Gynecol. 6 : 61 - 65, 1998...|$|E
40|$|Seven extended-spectrum beta-lactamases {{related to}} TEM and four enzymes derived from SHV- 1 were {{transferred}} to a common Escherichia coli host so that the activity {{of a variety of}} beta-lactams could be tested in a uniform genetic environment. For most derivatives, penicillinase activity was 10 % or less than that of strains making TEM- 1, TEM- 2, or SHV- 1 beta-lactamase, suggesting that reduced catalytic efficiency accompanied the broader substrate spectrum. Despite this deficit, resistance to aztreonam, carumonam, cefdinir, cefepime, cefixime, cefmenoxime, cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefpirome, cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, and E 1040 was enhanced. For strains producing TEM-type enzymes, however, MICs of carumonam, cefepime, cefmenoxime, cefotiam, cefpirome, and ceftibuten were 8 micrograms/ml or less. Susceptibilities of cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, <b>flomoxef,</b> imipenem, meropenem, moxalactam, temocillin, FCE 22101, and Sch 34343 were unaffected. FCE 22101, imipenem, meropenem, and Sch 34343 were inhibitory for all strains at 1 microgram/ml or less. In E. coli an OmpF- porin mutation in combination with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enhanced resistance to many of these agents, but generally by only fourfold. Hyperproduction of chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase increased resistance to 7 -alpha-methoxy beta-lactams but not that to temocillin. When tested at 8 micrograms/ml, clavulanate was more potent than sulbactam or tazobactam in overcoming resistance to ampicillin, while cefoperazone-sulbactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate or piperacillin-tazobactam, especially against TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma species {{cannot be}} {{identified}} by routine bacteriological culture methods and are resistant to common antimicrobial agents. Mycoplasma hominis usually colonizes the lower urogenital tract and causes pyelonephritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, chorioamnionitis, rupture of fetal membranes, preterm labor, postpartum fever, postabortal fever, and neonatal infection. This organism is highly prevalent in cervicovaginal cultures of sexually active women. M. hominis, M. genitalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and U. parvum may invade and infect placental and fetal tissues, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. M. hominis occasionally causes nongenitourinary infection of the blood, wounds, central nervous system, joints, or respiratory tract. We present {{a case of a}} 27 -year-old woman who developed abdominal wound hematoma and abscess after cesarean section. The wound was drained, but her high fever persisted, in spite of antibiotic treatment using <b>flomoxef</b> sodium and imipenem·cilastatin sodium. Because the exudate exhibited M. hominis growth in an anaerobic environment, we administered the quinolone ciprofloxacin. This therapy resolved her fever, and her white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level diminished to the normal ranges. To our knowledge, there are four published articles regarding the isolation of M. hominis from postcesarean incisions. Based on the current study and the literature, infection by this pathogen may cause hematoma formation with or without abscess after cesarean section or in immunosuppressed postoperative patients. In such cases, physicians may need to suspect Mycoplasma infection and initiate appropriate antibacterial treatment as soon as possible in order to avoid persistent fever...|$|E
40|$|OPC- 20011, a new {{parenteral}} 2 -oxaisocephem antibiotic, has {{an oxygen}} atom at the 2 - {{position of the}} cephalosporin frame. OPC- 20011 had the best antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae: MICs at which 90 % of the isolates were inhibited were 6. 25, 6. 25, and 0. 05 μg/ml, respectively. Its activity {{is due to a}} high affinity of the penicillin-binding protein 2 ′ in MRSA, an affinity which was approximately 1, 050 times as high as that for <b>flomoxef.</b> Against gram-negative bacteria, OPC- 20011 also showed antibacterial activities similar to those of ceftazidime. The in vivo activities of OPC- 20011 were comparable to or greater than those of reference compounds in murine models of systemic infection caused by gram-positive and -negative pathogens. OPC- 20011 was up to 10 times as effective as vancomycin against MRSA infections in mice. This better in vivo efficacy is probably due to the bactericidal activity of OPC- 20011, while vancomycin showed bacteriostatic activity against MRSA. OPC- 20011 produced a significant decrease of viable counts in lung tissue at a dose of 2. 5 mg/kg of body weight, an efficacy similar to that of ampicillin at a dose of 10 to 20 mg/kg on an experimental murine model of respiratory tract infection caused by non-ampicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae T- 0005. The better therapeutic efficacy of OPC- 20011 was considered to be due to its potent antibacterial activity and low affinity for serum proteins of experimental animals (29 % in mice and 6. 4 % in rats) ...|$|E
40|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae NU 2936 was {{isolated}} {{from a patient}} and was found to produce a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase (MOX- 1) which conferred resistance to broad spectrum beta-lactams, including moxalactam, <b>flomoxef,</b> ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. Resistance could be transferred from K. pneumoniae NU 2936 to Escherichia coli CSH 2 by conjugation with a transfer frequency of 5 x 10 (- 7). The structural gene of MOX- 1 (blaMOX- 1) was cloned and expressed in E. coli HB 101. The MIC of moxalactam for E. coli HB 101 producing MOX- 1 was > 512 micrograms/ml. The apparent molecular mass and pI of this enzyme were calculated to be 38 kDa and 8. 9, respectively. Hg 2 + and Cu 2 + failed to block enzyme activity, {{and the presence of}} EDTA in the reaction buffer did not reduce the enzyme activity. However, clavulanate and cloxacillin, serine beta-lactamase inhibitors, inhibited the enzyme activity competitively (Kis = 5. 60 and 0. 35 microM, respectively). The kinetic study of MOX- 1 suggested that it effectively hydrolyzed broad-spectrum beta-lactams. A hybridization study confirmed that blaMOX- 1 is encoded on a large resident plasmid (pRMOX 1; 180 kb) of strain NU 2936. By deletion analysis, the functional region was localized within a 1. 2 -kb region of the plasmid. By amino acid sequencing, 18 of 33 amino acid residues at the N terminus of MOX- 1 were found to be identical to those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa AmpC. These findings suggest that MOX- 1 is a plasmid-mediated AmpC-type beta-lactamase that provides enteric bacteria resistance to broad-spectrum beta-lactams, including moxalactam...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of cefmetazole and <b>flomoxef</b> (CF) {{for the treatment}} of patients with extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) bacteremia (ESBL-CF group) was compared with that of carbapenem treatment for ESBL-EC patients (ESBL-carbapenem group) and with that of CF treatment in patients with non-ESBL-EC bacteremia (non-ESBL-CF group). Adult patients treated for E. coli bacteremia in four hospitals were retrospectively evaluated. The 30 -day mortality rates in patients belonging to the ESBL-CF, ESBL-carbapenem, and non-ESBL-CF groups were compared as 2 (empirical and definitive therapy) cohorts. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for mortality were calculated using Cox regression models with weighting according to the inverse probability of propensity scores for receiving CF or carbapenem treatment. The empirical-therapy cohort included 104 patients (ESBL-CF, 26; ESBL-carbapenem, 45; non-ESBL-CF, 33), and the definitive-therapy cohort included 133 patients (ESBL-CF, 59; ESBL-carbapenem, 54; non-ESBL-CF, 20). The crude 30 -day mortality rates for patients in the ESBL-CF, ESBL-carbapenem, and non-ESBL-CF groups were, respectively, 7. 7 %, 8. 9 %, and 3. 0 % in the empirical-therapy cohort and 5. 1 %, 9. 3 %, and 5. 0 % in the definitve-therapy cohort. In patients without hematological malignancy and neutropenia, CF treatment for ESBL-EC patients was not associated with mortality compared with carbapenem treatment (empirical-therapy cohort: aHR, 0. 87; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 11 to 6. 52; definitive therapy cohort: aHR, 1. 04; CI, 0. 24 to 4. 49).

40|$|Background/PurposeThe {{emergence}} of {{multiple drug resistance}} in Enterobacteriaceae is of particular concern. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility and screen for the ampC gene in three members of the Enterobacteriaceae family (Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens) found at Taichung Veterans General Hospital during the past 5 years using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MethodsThe susceptibility of thirty isolates from each of the three Enterobacteriaceae family members to five antimicrobial agents (ceftazidime, <b>flomoxef,</b> imipenem, moxifloxacin, and colistin) was assessed. The susceptibility was analyzed by disk diffusion, screening and confirmatory tests for extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and minimum inhibitory concentration tests according to the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The detection of ampC genes (3 families, including DHA, EBC and CIT) was performed by multiplex PCR. To detect the coexistence of ESBL genes, PCR was performed using five primer pairs: TEM, SHV, SHV- 5, CTX-M- 3, and CTX-M- 14. ResultsOf the 90 isolates, 53 (58. 9 %) were positive in the screening test for ESBL. Resistance genes were detected in 12 (22. 6 %) of these isolates: ampC gene of DHA type in one E. cloacae isolate and EBC type in three E. cloacae isolates; ampC gene of CIT type in four C. freundii isolates; CTX-M- 3 -like in one C. freundii isolate and one S. marcescens isolate; TEM in three E. cloacae isolates, three C. freundii isolates and two S. marcescens isolates; SHV in one C. freundii isolate. ConclusionAntibiotic phenotypes cannot accurately distinguish the resistance mechanisms caused by ampC or ESBL, and especially in ESBL-ampC combinations. However, PCR is a useful technique for the identification of the different types of resistance genes...|$|E
