We never lost a war and we never won a conference in our lives. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could without any degree of egotism, single-handed lick any nation in the world. But we can't confer with Costa Rica and come home with our shirts on.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} the game was {{composed}} by Inon Zur, whose previous works included [...] and Fallout Tactics. Inon Zur worked with Jeremy Soule, the composer for Icewind Dale, to maintain {{the tone of the}} music. Inon Zur also worked closely with Interplay audio director Adam Levenson while composing the music; Zur and Levenson had worked together on several previous titles. Inon Zur said that while composing the theme for the game, [...] "I wrote and rewrote the main theme several times", and [...] "we tried to create a piece that would preserve the sound of the first Icewind Dalewe made great efforts to convey the new elements also. Capturing all of this in 30-45 seconds was not easy however <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> eventually found the right path for this game's soundtrack." [...] Zur described the composing process, [...] "After learning the storyboard and getting additional insight from the producers/music supervisor I'll start to compose. The thematic idea (main melody or rhythmical groove) comes first. Then comes the accompaniment followed by the orchestration," [...] and that, [...] "each piece should have its own unique flavour so every step is carefully examined. I {{have to make sure that}} the main idea of the piece is reflected in all these steps." [...] He called the composing experience [...] "very pleasant and rewarding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ceppos {{noted that}} Webb {{did not agree}} with these conclusions. He concluded: [...] "How did these {{shortcomings}} occur? ... <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> fell short at every step of our process: in the writing, editing and production of our work. Several people here share that burden ... But ultimately, the responsibility was, and is, mine." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{anguish of}} mind that had been mine with so little cause just before we {{surprised}} the Kaskaskia garrison had taught me a lesson, and, in addition, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would continue our march in the same bloodless, triumphant fashion {{as it had been}} begun.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} the Laning and Zierler system on the {{development}} of FORTRAN is a question which has been muddled by many misstatements on my part. For many years <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had gotten the idea for using algebraic notation in FORTRAN from seeing a demonstration of the Laning and Zierler system at MIT.

2500|$|Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} Lieberman, saying, [...] "I've talked to Senator Lieberman, and unfortunately {{he is at}} a different place on Iraq than {{the majority of the}} American people." [...] House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi added, [...] "I completely disagree with Lieberman. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have a responsibility to speak out if we think that the course of action that our country is not making the American people safer, making our military stronger and making the region more stable." [...] Lieberman responded, [...] "I've had this position for a long time [...] that we need to finish the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cyril Veliath of Sophia University {{writes that}} the Ramakrishna Mission monks are a {{relatively}} orthodox set of monks who are [...] "extremely well respected both in India and abroad", and that they [...] "cannot be classified as just another sect or cult, such as the groups led by the gurus". Veliath writes that [...] "of the Hindu groups I have worked with I have found the Ramakrishna Mission {{to be the most}} tolerant and amenable to dialogue, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> Christians couldnâ€™t do better, than to cooperate wholeheartedly in their efforts towards inter-religious harmony. Bob Robinson writes, [...] "Unlike more militant Hindu organisations, the mission has consistently advocated and itself displayed a tolerant, friendly attitude towards minority religious traditions and a sympathetic acquaintance with at least parts of the scriptures of those faiths." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When the Six Day War ended, {{everyone}} {{thought that the}} 'mother of all wars' was over and we won. I was terrified and thought to myself, 'What would happen to our prisoners there if this story gets out?' Nevertheless, I feel that we must not be silent.... People say that these things happen in wartime {{and that there is}} loyalty to the army and loyalty among the troops, which causes these things to disappear beneath the carpet. But <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are betraying our real responsibility, which is to take these skeletons out of the closet, even if we think that the enemy has more skeletons than us. We must not be silent. We are all part of this terrible conspiracy of silence, and it is eating us up inside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{need not}} have any embarrassment in meeting in behalf of the poor {{creature}} who {{came to see me}} just after you left me.

2500|$|... {{at the age}} of 36, Abdel-Nasser felt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could ignore Egyptian {{public opinion}} until we had reached our goals, but with the caution of a 53-year-old, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed {{grassroots}} support for our policies, even if it meant postponing some of our goals. I differed with the younger officers on the means by which to reach our goals, never on the principles.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I had," [...] the {{minister}} persisted. [...] "I thought {{a great deal}} about you when I was away, and I went over our talks in my own mind a great many times. The more I thought about them, the more <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had felt our way to some important truth in the matter. I don't say final truth, for I don't suppose <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall ever reach that in this life." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{wonder you}} open your eyes," [...] said he. [...] "It must seem odd to you, unless you are very {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} the period, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should go from Europe to China in search of enlightenment and civilization; but <b>that</b> is what <b>we</b> did, and we found what we looked for. As the Pope had sent an envoy to China, and as some Nestorian missionaries had gone there, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could go.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have formed}} a {{different}} idea of their strength," [...] he answered.

6000|$|... "Attached!" [...] exclaimed Mrs Null. [...] "It {{would be}} {{impossible}} for us to be more attached than we are.

5000|$|... "I did {{not think}} it best for the South to secede and with two other members never signed the {{ordinance}} of secession. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would have a war that would be disastrous to the South and our best young men would all be sacrificed and the property of the South, which consisted mostly of negroes, would be lost. I had no idea at any time of separating myself from the South, preferring to be with them believing them to be wrong than to be with the Northern army knowing it to be right.|$|R

5000|$|We Capital {{signed a}} share {{acquisition}} agreement with GFH Capital {{at the end}} of last year.

Unfortunately, however, some of the consortium's backers ultimately didn't feel able to deliver the financial backing we had hoped was agreed to take the club forward. I have met many, many potential investors over the past year and, sadly, while many are keen to talk the talk, they have been unable or unwilling to deliver in financial terms.|$|R

60|$|My friends, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are in more {{danger of}} {{committing}} it in England just {{now than ever}} we were; that learned men especially {{are in danger of}} so doing, because they know so far more of the wonders and the vastness of God's creation than the heathens of old knew.|$|E
