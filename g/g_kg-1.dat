40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 29 SEP 2014 Solvent-extracted soybean meal (SESBM) {{has been reported}} to cause subacute enteritis in certain fish species. Two 34 -day experiments investigated the effects of SESBM and soy protein concentrate (SPC) on the intestinal mucus layer and development of subacute enteritis in the hindgut of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) at 22 and 18 °C. Fish were fed increasing levels of SESBM (Exp. 1 : 0 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹,</b> 100 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹,</b> 200 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹,</b> 300 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹)</b> and SPC (Exp. 2 : 0 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹,</b> 200 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹,</b> 300 g kg ⁻¹, 400 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹.</b> No visual signs of inflammation in the hindgut were observed in either experiment. However, increasing dietary SESBM significantly reduced mucus layer thickness. Neutral and acidic goblet cell mucin composition increased at 18 and 22 °C, respectively. A significant positive linear relationship was evident between goblet cell number and SESBM inclusion at 18 °C. SPC inclusion and water temperature had no significant effect on mucus layer thickness or mucin composition. However, at 18 °C, goblet cell numbers decreased with SPC inclusion. Results suggest the early stages of subacute enteritis may have been manifesting in SESBM fed fish. In the long term, mucus layer alterations associated with feeding SESBM may compromise fish health. Longer-term studies should investigate the effects of feeding SESBM to yellowtail kingfish, particularly at suboptimal water temperatures. M. S. Bansemer, R. E. A. Forder,G. S. Howarth, G. M.

40|$|Vanadium is a redox-sensitive {{metal that}} is {{released}} to soils by weathering and anthropogenic emissions. Swedish metallurgical slags are naturally high in vanadium {{and used as}} soil amendments and in road materials. However, understanding of vanadium chemistry and bioavailability in soils is limited. The aim of this thesis was to provide knowledge of vanadium in soils in terms of sorption, toxicity and speciation, in order to enable improved environmental risk assessments. Vanadium sorption to ferrihydrite was evaluated in batch experiments. Toxicity assays using microorganisms and plants were conducted to measure vanadium toxicity in different vanadium soil treatments; freshly spiked, aged and blast furnace slag (800 mg V kg⁻¹). Vanadium speciation in a podzolic soil amended with converter lime (14. 6 <b>g</b> V <b>kg⁻¹)</b> 26 years previously was assessed by using XANES spectroscopy and HPLC-ICP-MS. Ferrihydrite adsorbed vanadium strongly, but adsorption was reduced by large additions of phosphate. EXAFS spectroscopy revealed that a vanadate(V) edge-sharing bidentate complex formed on the ferrihydrite surface. In the toxicity assays, increasing vanadium sorption strength in the freshly spiked soils reduced the toxicity. Toxicity was also reduced by soil ageing, possibly because of vanadium incorporation into metal (hydr) oxides. No toxicity was observed when soils were amended with up to 29...|$|R

Sixteen highly-trained male cyclists/triathletes (age: 30. 6 ± 5. 6 y; VO₂max: 64. 8 ± 4. 7 ml kg min⁻¹ [mean ± SD]) undertook two cycle ergometry trials involving randomised consumption of a 10 % CHO beverage (15 mL kg⁻¹ hr⁻¹) or water (H₂O). Trials were undertaken 2 h after a breakfast providing 2. 1 <b>g</b> CHO <b>kg⁻¹</b> body mass (BM) (48 kJ kg⁻¹ BM) and consisted of 100 min steady state cycle ergometry at 70 % VO₂max followed by a time trial of ~ 30 min duration.

Time-trial performance was not substantially different between CHO and H₂O trials (4. 5 %, p = 0. 42). Neither IL- 6 nor IL- 8 responses were substantially reduced in the CHO compared to the H₂O trial. There was a substantial reduction in IL- 10 (32 %, p = 0. 05) and IL- 1 ra (43 %, p = 0. 02) responses at 1 h post-exercise with CHO compared to H₂O ingestion.

The ability of birnessite, ferrihydrite and green rust to abiotically transform insensitive munitions compounds (IMCs) parent (2, 4 dinitroanisole [DNAN] and 3 -nitro- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 5 -one [NTO]), and daughter products (2 -methoxy- 5 -nitro aniline [MENA], 2, 4 -diaminoanisole [DAAN]of DNAN; and 5 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 3 -one [ATO] of NTO) was studied in batch reactors under strictly controlled pH and ionic strength. The objectives {{of the study were}} to (i) assess the abiotic transformation potential of soluble DNAN, MENA, DAAN, NTO and ATO by birnessite, ferrihydrite and green rust, and (ii) identify inorganic reaction products. The study was carried out at metal oxide solid to IMC solution ratios (SSR) of 0. 15, 1. 5 and 15 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> for birnessite and ferrihydrite and 10 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> for green rust. Aqueous samples were collected at time intervals between 0 to 3 days after the reaction initiation and analyzed using HPLC with UV detection.

40|$|Soil {{degradation}} is a {{major problem}} in the agriculturally dominated country of Tajikistan, which makes it necessary to determine and monitor the state of soils. For this purpose a soil spectral library was established as it enables the determination of soil properties with relatively low costs and effort. A total of 1465 soil samples were collected from three 10 x 10 km test sites in western Tajikistan. The diffuse reflectance of the samples was measured with a FieldSpec PRO FR from ASD in the spectral range from 380 to 2500 nm in laboratory. 166 samples were finally selected based on their spectral information and analysed on total C and N, organic C, pH, CaCO₃, extractable P, exchangeable Ca, Mg and K, and the fractions clay, silt and sand. Multiple linear regression was used to set up the models. Two third of the chemically analysed samples were used to calibrate the models, one third was used for hold-out validation. Very good prediction accuracy was obtained for total C (R² = 0. 76, RMSEP = 4. 36 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹),</b> total N (R² = 0. 83, RMSEP = 0. 30 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹)</b> and organic C (R² = 0. 81, RMSEP = 3. 30 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹),</b> good accuracy for pH (R² = 0. 61, RMSEP = 0. 157) and CaCO 3 (R² = 0. 72, RMSEP = 4. 63 %).

Design: A multicenter randomized controlled trial with allocation to one of three intervention arms: (1) parent-centered nutrition lifestyle program; (2) child-centered physical activity skill development program; or (3) both the programs. Participants: One hundred and sixty-five overweight, pre-pubertal children 5 – 9 years of age (58 % female). Measurements: Dietary intake was assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months post-commencement of the program using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Results: After 6 and 12 months, all groups improved their dietary intake, with no differences detected between groups (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Salinity {{is a major}} {{constraint}} to {{crop production}} and also contributes to land degradation, particularly in arid and semiarid regions. Salinity has negative effects on soil microorganisms, reducing soil respiration, microbial biomass and microbial diversity. One {{of the main reasons}} for the negative impact of salinity is the low osmotic potential induced by high salt concentrations in the soil solution which reduces water uptake into cells and can cause water loss from cells. Some microorganisms can adapt to salinity by accumulation of osmolytes which is a significant metabolic burden. Rapidly decomposable plant residues contain high concentrations of easily available compounds which can be utilised by many soil microbes. Slowly decomposable residues on the other hand contain complex compounds which can only be utilised by few microbes, those capable of releasing specialised enzymes to break down these compounds. If salinity inhibits or kills some microbes, the decomposition of rapidly decomposable residues may be less affected than that of slowly decomposable residues because the loss of sensitive microbes can be compensated by a larger number of microbes with the former compared to the latter. If this is true, microbial activity after addition of slowly decomposable residues (high in lignin content and C/N ratio and low in water soluble carbon) should decrease more strongly with increasing salinity than after addition of rapidly decomposable residues. However, most previous studies on respiration in saline soils only used one or two types of plant residues (e. g. cereal or legume shoots). A further factor that may influence the impact of salinity on soil respiration is the frequency of residue addition. Frequent residue addition may provide soil microbes with a continuous supply of nutrients and therefore improve salinity tolerance compared to a single addition where easily available compounds are rapidly depleted. These two assumptions have not been systematically investigated. The aim of this project was to investigate the effect of the chemical composition of added residues, mixing of residues and addition frequency on soil respiration and microbial biomass in soils with different salinity. Three studies were carried out to address the aims in non-saline soil and naturally saline soils with different salinity levels. The aim of the first study was to investigate the impact of salinity on respiration in soil amended with residues differing in chemical composition (lignin concentration, water soluble organic carbon and C/N ratio). Three incubation experiments were conducted in this study. In the first experiment various residue types (shoots of wheat, canola, saltbush and kikuyu, saw dust, eucalyptus leaves) differing in C/N ratio, lignin and water extractable organic carbon concentration, were applied at 2 % w/w to a non-saline soil (EC₁﹕₅, 0. 1 dS m⁻¹) and three naturally saline soils with EC₁﹕₅ 1, 2. 5 and 3. 3 dS m⁻¹. Cumulative respiration decreased with increasing salinity but the negative effect of salinity was different among residues. Compared to non-saline soil, respiration was decreased by 20 % at EC₁﹕₅ 0. 3 dS m⁻¹ when slowly decomposable residues (saw dust or canola shoots) were added, but at EC₁﹕₅ 4 dS m⁻¹ when amended with a rapidly decomposable residue (saltbush). In the second experiment, the influence of residue C/N ratio and lignin content on soil respiration in saline soils was investigated. Two residues (canola and saw dust) with high C/N ratios but different lignin content were used. The C/N ratio was adjusted to between 20 and 80 by adding ammonium sulfate. Increasing salinity had smaller impact on cumulative respiration after addition of residues with C/N ratio 20 or 40 compared to residues with higher C/N ratio. In the third experiment, the effect of the concentration of water-soluble organic C (WEOC) of the residues was determined. WEOC was partially removed by leaching from two residues with high WEOC content (eucalypt leaves and saltbush shoots). Partial WEOC removal decreased cumulative respiration in saline soil compared to the original residues, but increased the negative effect of salinity on respiration only with saltbush shoots. The second study was conducted using the four soils from the first study (EC₁﹕₅, 0. 1, 1, 2. 5 and 3. 3 dS m⁻¹) to compare the impact of single and multiple additions of residues that differ in decomposability on the response of soil respiration to increasing salinity. Two residues with distinct decomposability were used; kikuyu with 19 C/N ratio (rapidly decomposable) and canola with 82 C/N ratio (slowly decomposable). Both residues were added once or 2 - 4 times (on days 0, 14, 28 and 42) with a total addition of 10 <b>g</b> C <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil and incubated for 56 days. Compared to a single addition, repeated addition of the rapidly decomposable residue reduced the negative effect of salinity on cumulative respiration, but {{this was not the case}} with slowly decomposable residues. The third study was carried out to investigate the effect of the proportion of rapidly and slowly decomposable residues in a mixture on the impact of salinity on soil respiration. This study included two experiments with two residues differing in decomposability (slowly decomposable saw dust and rapidly decomposable kikuyu grass). In the first experiment, both residues were added alone and in mixtures with different ratios into four soils having EC₁﹕₅ 0. 1, 1. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 3 dS m⁻¹. The addition of 25 % of rapidly decomposable residues in mixture with slowly decomposable residues was sufficient to decrease the negative impact of salinity on cumulative respiration compared to the slowly decomposable residue alone. In the second experiment, three soils were used (EC₁﹕₅ 0. 1, 1. 0 and 2. 5 dS m⁻¹), residues were added once or 3 times (on days 0, 14 and 28) to achieve a total of 10 <b>g</b> C <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil either with sawdust alone, kikuyu alone or both where final proportion of kikuyu was 25 %, but the order in which the residues were applied differed The negative effect of salinity on cumulative respiration was smaller when the rapidly decomposable residue was added early, that is when the soil contained small amounts of slowly decomposable residues. Salinity reduced soil respiration to a greater extent in treatments where rapidly decomposable residue was added to soil containing larger amounts of slowly decomposable residues. It is concluded that rapidly decomposable residues can alleviate salinity stress to soil microbes even if they make up only a small proportion of the residues added. By promoting greater microbial activity in saline soils and providing nutrients, rapidly decomposable residues could also improve plant growth through increased nutrient availability. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Four {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the role of nutrition in the periparturient breakdown of resistance to gastrointestinal parasitism in mature sheep. In the first trial pregnant ewes were housed seven weeks prior to parturition and fed either to gain (HE) or lose (LE) maternal body weight. From five weeks prior to parturition ewes were trickle infected with 4, 000 T. circumcincta larvae day⁻¹. Faecal egg counts were monitored throughout the infection period. Ewes were slaughtered either at partum (S 0) or six (S 6) or nine (S 9) weeks post partum for determination of worm burden. S 6 and S 9 groups received an additional challenge infection of 25, 000 T. circumcincta larvae, 21 days prior to slaughter. Live weight gain was significantly greater in HE than LE ewes viz. 15. 5 kg and 6. 0 kg, respectively. Despite this difference mean faecal egg counts were significantly higher in LE sheep only in the week preceding parturition viz. 23 and 252 eggs g⁻¹ faeces, for HE and LE groups, respectively. Nutrient supply {{had no effect on}} worm burdens at any of the three slaughter times. Trial 2 examined the combined effects of current nutrient intake and level of larval challenge on the magnitude of the periparturient breakdown. Ewes were housed nine weeks prior to parturition. One group was fed above the recommended energy requirements (H 10, n= 12) and trickle infected with 10, 000 T. circumcincta larvae day⁻¹ from 8 weeks before lambing. Groups LS, L 10 and L 20 (n= 12) were fed below their recommended energy requirement and trickle infected with 5, 000, 10, 000 and 20, 000 T. circumcincta larvae day⁻¹, respectively. Faecal egg counts were recorded throughout. Ewes were slaughtered at parturition. Again, despite significant differences in live weight gain and body condition score between Hand L groups, there was no effect of nutritional treatment on parasite status. Similarly, larval challenge did not affect parasite status. Results from Trials 1 and 2 thus questioned the role of dietary energy intake in maintaining resistance to gastrointestinal parasitism. The latter study also demonstrated the unimportance of larval intake on the periparturient breakdown. Trial 3 was undertaken to assess the relative importance of metabolisable energy and metabolisable protein supply. Utilising a 2 x 2 factorial design for energy (E) and protein (P) single and twin bearing ewes were fed either a basal ration (adequate E and P) or at a supplemented level (E and P in excess of requirements). Energy levels were altered by varying the hay:grain ratio of the diet. Protein supplementation was achieved by inclusion of 75 <b>g</b> fishmeal <b>kg⁻¹</b> dry matter in rations. Ewes were trickle infected with 10, 000 T. circumcincta and 7, 000 T. colubriformis larvae day⁻¹ from seven weeks before lambing. Larval dosing ceased at parturition and the ewes were slaughtered three weeks later. There was no effect of energy supplementation on worm burdens and only a short term effect on faecal egg counts in the week before lambing. Protein supplementation significantly reduced faecal egg counts from 21 days before lambing and throughout the remainder of the trial. Worm burdens in protein supplemented sheep were significantly lower than those on the basal protein ration viz. 1, 540 worms compared with 12, 020. Single bearing sheep had significantly lower worm burdens than twin bearing sheep (2, 300 compared with 8, 100). Worm burdens comprised mainly Teladorsagia spp. Less than 4 % of total worm burdens consisted of Trichostrongylus spp. There was no effect of nutritional treatment on lymphocyte stimulation in response to various parasite antigens and mitogens. Similarly, inhibition of larval migration in response to small intestinal mucus was unaffected by nutritional treatment. Results from Trial 3 indicated the relative importance of protein supply over energy intake in periparturient resistance to gastrointestinal parasitism. A fourth and final trial was undertaken to determine the appropriate threshold level of protein supplementation required to achieve reductions in the extent of the periparturient breakdown. Three treatment groups of twin bearing ewes (n= 10) were established ten weeks prior to parturition. Diets were designed to provide approximately the same level of metabolisable energy but to differ in their metabolisable protein provision. This was achieved by the inclusion of 0, 100 and 200 <b>g</b> of fishmeal <b>kg⁻¹</b> dry matter in the diet of groups F 0, F 10 and F 20, respectively. The ewes were housed eight weeks prior to parturition and trickle infected daily with 10, 000 T. circumcincta and 7, 000 T. colubriformis larvae, during the 42 days before parturition. Infective dosing ceased at parturition. Eleven days later five animals from each group were given a further single challenge infection of a 25, 000 T. circumcincta and 17, 500 T. colubriformis infective larvae. All ewes were slaughtered ten days later. Faecal egg counts of the F 20 group remained below 100 eggs g⁻¹ of faeces throughout the course of the experiment. Faecal egg counts immediately prior to slaughter were significantly lower in sheep which had received the post partum challenge infection. Worm burdens of both species decreased with increasing protein supply. Sheep which had received the post partum challenge infection had significantly higher numbers of L 4 larvae than those trickle infected only. Establishment of Trichostrongylus spp. from the post partum challenge infection was significantly higher in F 0 than F 20 sheep. Establishment rates were calculated to be 15. 2, 9. 4 and 5. 9 % in Teladorsagia spp. and 9. 3, 3. 4 and 0. 9 % in Trichostrongylus spp., for groups F 0, F 10 and F 20, respectively. These results confirmed that protein supplementation can moderate the periparturient breakdown. Results from the post partum challenge infection provided evidence that the effects of protein on worm burdens may have occurred at the establishment stage against incoming larvae. Results from this study indicate that protein supplementation may be an important component in strategies aimed at moderating the deleterious effects of the periparturient breakdown. Energy supplementation, ewe body condition and larval challenge appear to be less important but may impact under more intense conditions. The means by which protein supply affects resistance to parasitism in the mature ewe deserves further investigation...|$|R

Total daily energy intakes were similar between the two groups. Cytokine responses to cycle ergometry were assessed prior to and again following the dietary intervention period. The cycle ergometry protocol involved 100 min steady state cycling at 70 % VO₂max followed by a time trial of ~ 30 min. Athletes were provided with 15 mL. kg⁻¹. h⁻¹ of water during each trial. Blood samples were collected pre-, immediately post- and 1 h post-exercise for determination of plasma glucose and pro-inflammatory (IL- 6, IL- 8) and anti-inflammatory (IL- 10, IL- 1 ra) cytokine concentrations. Cytokine responses to cycle ergometry were not substantially altered following the 28 -day higher-CHO diet. In contrast, following the 28 -day moderate-CHO diet, there were ~ 30 - 50 % reductions (p= 0. 08 - 0. 11) in anti-inflammatory cytokine responses post-exercise. These findings suggest that increased dietary CHO content alone does not effectively attenuate the pro-inflammatory cytokine response to exercise, however, {{there may be a}} small reduction in the anti-inflammatory cytokine response...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance of soil carbon (C) {{content is}} {{important}} because a relatively small percentage change in the global soil C store {{has the potential to}} cause a large change in atmospheric CO₂ concentration. Losses of soil C can also lead to a decline in soil quality and its capacity to be productive and carry out other services such as the filtering of pollutants. Globally, research on soil C dynamics has largely focused on forests, croplands and natural grasslands, while intensively grazed pasture has received much less attention. In New Zealand, the dynamics of soil C content and C cycling in intensively grazed dairy systems are poorly understood but large losses of soil C (1 t C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) have recently been reported for grazed dairy pastures. The objective of this research was to build on current knowledge of the C balance of intensively grazed dairy farm systems. To achieve this objective, net ecosystem CO₂ exchange (NEE) and water use efficiency (WUE) were measured over intensively grazed dairy pasture using eddy covariance from 15 December 2007 to 15 December 2009. Net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) were then calculated for 2008 & 2009 from NEE measurements combined with measurements and estimates of C imports (feed) and C exports (milk, silage, methane). A further objective was to determine the impact of periodic cultivation of contrasting soils on the C balance of a dairy farm. To achieve this objective, measurements of soil CO₂ emissions were made using the closed chamber technique following the cultivation of three paddocks of Horotiu soil (Typic Orthic Allophanic) and three paddocks of Te Kowhai soil (Typic Orthic Gley). Annual NEE of the farm was - 1, 212 ± 500 kg C ha⁻¹ for 2008 and - 2, 280 ± 500 kg C ha⁻¹ for 2009. Including imports and exports of C to the farm resulted in an annual NECB of - 199 ± 500 kg C ha⁻¹ and - 1, 014 ± 500 kg C ha⁻¹ for 2008 and 2009, respectively. Applied uncertainty is at 90 % confidence bound and derived from previous studies reported in the literature. The site was a net sink of C during both 2008 and 2009 in agreement with EC studies performed over grasslands in Europe. The large difference in NEE and NECB between years was due to a drought in 2008, when the site was a C source for the first four months of this year. Average daily water use efficiency (WUE) for 2008 (4 g C kg⁻¹H₂O) and 2009 (4. 2 <b>g</b> C <b>kg⁻¹</b> H₂O) were not substantially different between years and agreed with international field and laboratory studies for pasture. Soil CO₂ loss following cultivation was measured using the closed chamber technique. During the period of cultivation photosynthesis ceased, and potential C input (NEE) to pasture during this time was estimated at - 750 kg C ha⁻¹from the adjacent EC study site. To calculate the maximum net soil CO₂₋C loss the potential C input from photosynthesis (NEE) must be added to measured CO₂ emissions. Total soil C loss from the Te Kowhai was between 2, 880 kg C ha⁻¹ (CO₂ flux only) and 3, 742 kg C ha⁻¹ (CO₂ flux + NEE) while the Horotiu soil lost between 2, 082 kg C ha⁻¹(CO₂ flux only) and 2, 944 kg C ha⁻¹ (CO₂ flux + NEE). The significant difference in C loss between the two soils was likely a result of their contrasting clay mineralogy and drainage. The Horotiu soil contains allophanic clays with a very high specific surface area, which protects soil C from decomposition. Additionally, poorly drained soils such as the Te Kowhai tend to lose more C following cultivation due to aeration caused by cultivation which increases oxygen penetration into the soil and accelerates decomposition of soil C. Based on these results this grazed pasture was a net sink of C for 2008 and 2009 which is in contrast to the measured decline of 1 t C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ from New Zealand’s flat to rolling dairy pastures. Cultivation of dairy pasture soil resulted in net C losses, however, these losses were not large enough to account for the measured decline in soil C from New Zealand’s flat to rolling dairy pastures. Further research is required to investigate long term soil C recovery following initial cultivation of pasture in order to be confident of this conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) is an {{essential}} plant nutrient that may limit plant growth and agricultural productivity if not available for crop plant uptake in sufficient quantities at the time required. Many Australian soils are deficient in available P, despite {{a long history of}} P fertilizer application, and this is due to fertilizer P rapidly becoming unavailable largely through biochemical fixation. The resulting low P fertilizer efficiency, coupled with rapidly rising cost of fertilizers, has increased interest in biological cycling of P from sources such as crop residues. However, to date, much of the Australian research has focussed on soils with relatively high organic matter content (> 2 %) and relatively heavy texture i. e. medium to high clay content. Furthermore, although there is information on pasture residue decomposition and P release for sandy soils with low organic matter in Australia, a recent shift to continuous cropping systems means that information for a range of crop residues is required but is not currently available. Therefore the aims of the work described in this thesis were to (i) increase the efficiency of P use when crop residue P are applied to crops and (ii) determine the effect of crop residue biochemical quality on decomposition rates, soil P dynamics and plant P uptake in light textured sandy soils with low organic matter which are typical of {{a large proportion of the}} southern Australian wheat growing area. A further aim was to investigate the effects of combined additions of plant residue and P fertilizer on P cycling in these soils, a scenario highly relevant to farming systems. A series of soil incubation and plant growth experiments were undertaken to characterize P dynamics in soil following addition of a wide range of crop residues (total 15) collected from agricultural sites throughout South Australia. The residues, differing in age and biochemical quality, were young shoots of canola, lupin, pea, lucerne and lentil; mature shoot residues of canola, lupin, pea and wheat and mature root residues of wheat, canola and lupin. The concentration of total and water soluble P, C, and N in the residues was measured using standard wet chemical analyses and the carbon chemistry was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Decomposition of crop residues was continuously monitored over a period of up to 140 days by measuring soil respiration. Available P and microbial biomass P and C were also assessed at different times during the incubations. The total P in residues ranged from 0. 16 % to 0. 32 % and 0. 05 % to 0. 08 % in young and mature shoots, respectively. Water-soluble P was related to residue total P and ranged from 29 % to 81 % and 13 % to 29 % of total P in young and mature shoots, respectively. The C: P ratio ranged from 133 : 1 to 253 : 1 and 504 : 1 to 858 : 1 in young and mature shoots, respectively. Phosphorus availability and microbial P uptake differed between soils amended with crop residues and soluble P fertilizer as triple super phosphate (TSP). Soil respiration rates were significantly higher in soils amended with crop residues than in the soils amended with TSP or the unamended control in the first 58 days of incubation. In an experiment in which residues and TSP were added at a rate of 10 mg P kg⁻¹, available P was greater for TSP than residue-amended soil, whereas microbial P showed the opposite trend. Respiration rate and microbial P were positively correlated with C addition rate, which was highest in mature wheat residue because it had the lowest P concentration. In order to assess when P released from the residues is available for plants, wheat was grown over three consecutive crop periods with each period lasting for 4 weeks. Young residues with high content of water soluble P, C, N and amide and low lignin and phenolic content decomposed faster than mature residues. The C type and amount added with residues controlled the dynamics of P availability. Surprisingly, canola mature root increased available P and plant growth as much as young shoot residues while root residues of wheat and lupin resulted in P immobilization and low plant growth. Compared to canola young shoot, canola mature root has a higher total P concentration and a lower C: P ratio. Plant P uptake was positively correlated with residue total and water-soluble P content and negatively correlated with residue C: P and C: N ratio and amount of C added with the residues. In another experiment where residue was added at 2. 5 <b>g</b> C <b>kg⁻¹</b> soil and compared with TSP (4 and 10 mg P kg⁻¹ soil), available P and plant P uptake decreased in the following order: TSP- 10 P > canola root ≥ young shoot ≥ TSP- 4 P > control > mature shoot. Microbial P was greater with residue addition than with TSP and in the control. Residues with low total P and high C: P ratio resulted in P immobilisation in the microbial biomass. Therefore, residues with high total P and low C: P ratio can be an important source of P for plants. Net P immobilisation of mature wheat residues (0. 07 % P) was significantly reduced by combining wheat residue (C: P ratio 615 : 1) with TSP leading to a C: P ratio of 155 : 1 to 310 : 1. Furthermore, the combination of wheat residue with TSP increased available P in residue and TSP-amended soils by 3. 0 mg P kg⁻¹ soil, which was shown to be sufficient to support wheat growth in the early stages of development in the other experiments. Although water-soluble P fertilizers provide plants with immediately available P, a large proportion becomes unavailable over time. Addition of low C: P residues on the other hand, may not result in high amounts of immediately available P, but the P supply is more sustained due to P release from decomposing residues and turnover of microbial biomass P. Phosphorus immobilization after addition of residues which have high C: P ratio (615 : 1) may be offset when residue is applied together with inorganic P fertilizer if the resulting C: P ratio is 300 : 1 or less. Overall, this study has highlighted the potential role that crop residues, either alone or in combination with inorganic P, can play in increasing P availability in the light textured, low organic matter, P-limited soils typical of many southern Australian farming systems. The results provide important quantitative information on the potential of a wide range of crop residues to supply wheat with P, and how additions of inorganic P interact with residue decomposition and influence available P supply. This quantitative information will be valuable for the construction or validation of mechanistic models of residue decomposition relevant to low organc matter light textured soils in farming systems of southern Australia, and will ultimately assist in the development of economic management strategies for minimizing P fertilizer inputs and maximizing the benefits of biological cycling of P.

40|$|Historic mine {{tailings}} pose a significant health risk to surrounding ecosystems and communities {{because of high}} residual concentrations of contaminant metals. The initial tailings mineral assemblage, metal sulfides, silicates, and carbonates are unstable at earth surface conditions and undergo oxidative and proton-promoted weathering. The weathering of metal sulfides generally produces acid that, if not balanced by protonconsuming dissolution of silicates and carbonates, leads to progressive acidification. The Klondyke State Superfund Site in Graham County, Arizona contains high concentrations of Pb (up to 13 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹)</b> and Zn (up to 6 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹),</b> and remains unvegetated 50 years after mining cessation. Field-scale investigation revealed {{a wide range of}} pH (2. 5 - 8. 0) and plant-available (DTPA-extractable) metals in the near surface of the tailings pile. Four samples were chosen for in-depth characterization ranging in pH, as denoted by subscript, from 2. 6 to 5. 4. The mineral transformations occurring in these four samples were investigated using a variety of techniques and the data indicated an increase in tailings weathering extent with increasing acidification (decreasing pH). Lead speciation, studied by a combination of chemical sequential extraction and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, was found to vary with tailings depth. The principle lead-bearing mineral was plumbojarosite (PbFe₆(SO₄) ₄(OH) ₁₂), with smaller amounts of anglesite (PbSO₄) and lead-sorbed iron-oxide. Anglesite, the most bioavailable mineral form of Pb in the tailings, was found to accumulate at the tailings surface, which has important implications for health risks. Total Zn content decreased by an order of magnitude (from 6 to 0. 4 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹)</b> and showed a change in molecular speciation with decreasing pH. Zinc-rich phyllosilicates and Zn-containing manganese oxides predominate at high pH, whereas low pH samples contained principally Zn-sorbed iron oxides. One of the overarching goals of the project is to remediate the Klondyke site using phytostabilization to keep contaminant metals from eroding offsite either by wind or water transport mechanisms. However, the impacts of plant growth on metal bonding environment are unknown. To address that gap in knowledge, we have developed a technique for the study of root-microbe-mineral-metal interactions that occur in the rhizosphere, the volume of soil surrounding, and affected by, plant roots. This technique involves the conjunctive use of fluorescence in-situ hybridization, X-ray fluorescence elemental mapping, XAFS and Raman micro-spectroscopies, and electron microscopy on single roots. Manganese and iron root plaques collocalized with elevated Pb, Zn, and Cr demonstrate that the rhizosphere can affect metal speciation. Metal speciation {{is an important factor in}} determining metal bioavailability, and thus is critical for understanding the health risk associated with {{mine tailings}}. The results of this research provides site-specific information about Pb and Zn speciation, which will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of site remediation within the context of metal toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Important to the {{evaluation}} of potential feed ingredients for inclusion in fish diets should be their digestibility and amino acid requirement so that feeds can be formulated on a digestible basis rather than a gross nutrient basis. This thesis established techniques for faecal collection, the validity of digestibility markers, it determined apparent digestibility coefficients for various novel feed ingredients, and it established the optimal lysine requirement for Argyrosomus japonicus, which was used to estimate each of the essential amino acid requirements by using the ideal protein concept. There {{were no significant differences}} in dry matter apparent digestibility coefficients when faeces were collected by stripping (77. 0 %), dissection (80. 1 %) or settlement (83. 5 %). Faecal collection by the settlement method produced the most reliable digestibility data. Apparent digestibility coefficients for dry matter, crude protein and energy calculated using acid-insoluble ash were higher (84. 0 %, 93. 2 % and 93. 0 %, respectively) than those using chromic oxide (55. 7 %, 79. 1 % and 78. 2 %) and titanium dioxide (58. 6 %, 79. 7 % and 80. 5 %). The magnitude of variation in digestibility coefficients obtained using acid-insoluble ash was always lower than that obtained with the other markers. Therefore, acid-insoluble ash was preferred as a dietary marker. Using the above protocol, protein and amino acid digestibility of some animal and plant protein ingredients were evaluated in a series of experiments. The first trial compared the apparent digestibility coefficients of some animal products included as single protein source in the test diets. Apparent protein digestibility values were 84. 5 %, 83. 8 %, 85. 8 % and 83. 1 % for fishmeal-prime, fishmeal-standard, poultry meal and pork meal, respectively. Apparent digestibility coefficients for poultry meal were comparable to those of fishmeal, which indicate its potential as a substitute for fishmeal in the diets of A. japonicus. The second trial determined the apparent coefficients of plant and animal protein sources included at 30 % into a practical reference diet (70 %). Apparent protein digestibility ranged from 92. 4 % in sunflower meal to 85. 5 % in corn gluten meal. Soybean meal is a promising feed ingredient in A. japonicus due to the high apparent digestibility of its protein (92. 0 %) and essential amino acid digestibility (mean average 91. 4 %). A fundamental assumption in fish feed formulation is that the digestibility of nutrients is additive, i. e., digestibility of a nutrient in one ingredient does not interact with the digestibility of the same nutrient in another ingredient. In the third trial, additivity of feed ingredients was tested using pork meal and poultry meal. The results indicate that the apparent digestibility coefficient of animal protein ingredients could be calculated from compound diets to accurately determine protein and amino acid digestibility in A. japonicus, and possibly other carnivorous fish species. Dietary essential amino acid requirements were determined for juvenile A. japonicus in two trials. A dose-response study was conducted using crystalline lysine to determine the optimal requirement of dietary lysine for A. japonicus. Optimal dietary lysine was estimated at 31. 7 <b>g</b> <b>kg-¹</b> dry diet, corresponding to 73. 5 <b>g</b> <b>kg-¹</b> of dietary protein, based on specific growth rate and broken-line segmented regression analyses. Dietary requirements for other essential amino acids ranged from 22 <b>g</b> <b>kg-¹</b> (histidine) to 71 <b>g</b> <b>kg-¹</b> (leucine) crude protein. The results of the present study provided a research tool that could be used to assess and verify the conclusions of earlier dietary work on A. japonicus and in further studies to develop least cost diet formulations for this species. The study also adds to the knowledge of the nutritional requirements of A. japonicus by providing information on the digestibility of plants and animal protein ingredients. It also contributes to future dietary research for this species because this study determines, for the first time, the most suitable methods for investigating the digestibility of raw materials for A. japonicus...|$|E
40|$|Management {{strategies}} that reduce ground water depletion and labour requirement, while maintaining yield are urgently needed in north-west India where ground water table is declining {{at an alarming}} rate. Dry seeded rice (DSR) has been proposed as one means of achieving these objectives, but optimal water management for DSR is not well understood. Therefore field experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of irrigation scheduling on water balance and land and water productivity of DSR relative to the current practice of puddle transplanted rice (PTR). The irrigation scheduling was based on soil water tension (SWT) ranging from continuous flooding (CF) /daily irrigation to alternate wetting and drying (AWD) at SWT thresholds of 20, 40 and 70 kPa. Data from the field experiments were used to parameterise and evaluate the ORYZA 2000 rice crop model which was then used to evaluate establishment method x water management practices. Grain yield of DSR and PTR was similar (6. 6 - 7. 4 t ha⁻¹) when irrigation was scheduled daily or at 20 kPa. Yield of both PTR and DSR declined under higher water deficit stress (40 and 70 kPa irrigation thresholds), but {{to a greater extent}} in DSR, and more so in the drier year possibly due to severe iron deficiency. There was a large reduction (47 - 82 %) in irrigation water input with irrigation at 20 kPa compared to daily irrigation in both crop establishment methods. Irrigation water use in DSR-AWD treatments was significantly lower than in respective PTR treatments (e. g. by 33 – 53 % when irrigation was scheduled at 20 kPa). Maximum irrigation water productivity (WPI) was obtained with 20 kPa SWT threshold, and was much higher for DSR (1. 46 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹)</b> than PTR (0. 85 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹).</b> Water productivity with respect to ET (WPET) was also highest with the 20 kPa threshold, with similar values (1. 18 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹)</b> for DSR and PTR. In both establishment methods, regardless of irrigation threshold, water saving was mainly due to reduced deep drainage, seepage and runoff. ORYZA 2000 predicted crop growth and yield well for CF and the 20 kPa irrigation threshold for both crop establishment methods, but predictions were sub-optimal for some parameters for PTR at higher irrigation thresholds. Model performance was unsatisfactory for DSR at thresholds > 20 kPa, at least partly because of iron deficiency, which is not simulated by ORYZA 2000. Based on the weather data for 40 rice seasons, the predicted yields for DSR were slightly higher than under PTR, and yield declined gradually but similarly for both establishment systems as irrigation threshold increased. As in the field experiments, there was a large reduction in irrigation input through changing from CF to AWD, primarily due to less deep drainage, and a small reduction in ET. Additional irrigation at panicle initiation and flowering reduced the yield penalty under AWD but did not eliminate it completely. Both the field and modelling studies suggest that DSR can be grown with comparable yield to PTR, and with lower irrigation input, provided that AWD water management with a low irrigation threshold (10 - 20 kPa) is used.

In situ application of soluble phosphates and organic matter {{is considered to be a}} cost effective remediation technique for immobilizing lead (Pb) and other heavy metals and reducing health and ecological risks associated with contaminated soils. However, a longterm assessment of risk reduction induced by metal immobilization is needed to verify efficacy and gain regulatory and public acceptance of phosphate-based and organic matter-based remedial technologies. The study sites included a smelter-contaminated urban site, a mill-waste contaminated site, and a mining-waste contaminated site within the Jasper County Superfund Site, Southwestern Missouri. Field plots at the urban site were treated with phosphoric acid at a rate of 10 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> using surface application (SA), rototilling (RT), and pressure injection (PI); plots at the mill-waste site were treated with phosphoric acid at rates of 7. 5 and 10 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> and incorporated using rototilling; plots at the mining-waste site were treated with different types of organic amendments, including biosolids and agricultural byproducts. The parameters chosen to assess long-term risk reduction were: (1) metal bioavailability to organisms; (2) metal availability to plants (i. e., phytoavailability); (3) toxicity of treated soils to microorganisms; (4) phosphate and metal stability; and (5) solid phase P and Pb speciation assessed using microscopic, spectroscopic, and chemical fractionation techniques. Results demonstrated that most of the phosphoric acid and OM treatments significantly reduced bioavailability, phytoavailability, and leachability of metals (Pb and Cd) in the contaminated soil. Analysis of P and Pb fractionation confirmed these reductions as well. In addition, most of treatments did not significantly impact toxicity in the soil to microorganisms. Thus, the in situ remediation of metal contaminated soil using phosphoric acid and OM is considered to be a practical remediation strategy with longterm benefits...|$|E

The objectives of this study were to: 1) determine how irrigation and trinexapac-ethyl (TE, a PGR) affect PM, HM, seed viability, and seed vigor of red clover at different stages of maturity, 2) evaluate the effect of irrigation, TE and their interaction on seed yield, its components, and the quality of red clover seeds at harvest, 3) investigate changes in gibberellic and abscisic acid contents in red clover during seed development and maturation, and 4) determine the potential of red clover seed storability under different storage conditions over two years. A field study was conducted over a two-year period at Hyslop Research Farm, Corvallis, Oregon. A single irrigation was applied at first flowering stage (BBCH 55). Five rates of TE, ranging from 0 to 700 g a. i. ha⁻¹, were applied at stem elongation and bud emergence stages (BBCH 32 and BBCH 51, respectively). Seed viability and vigor tests were conducted at Oregon State University Seed Laboratory to measure the effects of treatments on seed quality. Irrigation delayed PM by four days compared to the non-irrigated treatment. The TE applications did not alter seed maturation. At PM, the flower heads contained light brown petals with brownish-green sepals and seeds were pale green to pale yellow. Heads at HM contained dark brown petals and sepals, whereas seeds turned to yellow or yellow-dark grayish purple. Seed dry weight did not change significantly from PM to HM. Seed moisture content at maximum seed dry weight (PM) ranged from 340 to 540 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> and decreased to below 140 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> at HM.

Methods: Fourteen healthy males randomly completed 4 trials, each separated by 5 days. Participants either remained fasted (on 2 occasions) or ingested a high carbohydrate meal (2. 0 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> carbohydrate, 42. 4 ± 0. 6 kJ kg⁻¹) prior to consuming either 6 or 9 mg kg⁻¹ anhydrous caffeine. Venous blood was sampled for the analysis of serum caffeine at baseline and at 6 time-points over 4 h following caffeine intake. Results: Peak caffeine concentration occurred 60 min following ingestion for both the 6 and 9 mg kg⁻¹ fasted (p p p < 0. 001) in the 9 mg kg⁻¹ fasted trial (3262 μmol L⁻¹ h⁻¹), whilst areas were lowest in the 6 mg kg⁻¹ fed trial (1644 μmol L⁻¹ h⁻¹). Conclusions: A high carbohydrate meal consumed prior to caffeine ingestion significantly reduced serum caffeine concentrations and delayed time to peak concentration.

However, the relative importance of these properties for WEOC sorption differed among soils.

The majority of PCP removed by the Trametes isolates was in the first week after bioaugmentation. The maximum PCP removal by the fungi varied from 50 to 65 % from a 1065 mg kg⁻¹ PCP contaminated field soil. Pentachlorophenol was preferentially converted to pentachloroanisole (PCA) by the Phanerochaete isolates (> 60 %), while 2 to 9 % of the PCP removed by two Trametes isolates was converted to PCA. A pH increase was measured following bioaugmentation that was dependent on PCP concentration, fungal inoculum addition, and formulation. This, together with rapid initial PCP removal, possibly changed the bioavailability of the remaining PCP to the fungi and significantly decreased the sequestering of PCP in the contaminated field soils. The research supports the conclusion that New Zealand Trametes spp. can rapidly remove PCP in contaminated field soils. Bioavailability and extractability of PCP in the contaminated field soil may significantly increase after bioaugmentation...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that calcium (Ca²⁺) plays an {{important}} role in binding organic matter to clay. However, most previous studies were conducted with either topsoil or pure aluminosilicates. Less is known about the effect of Ca²⁺ on binding of organic matter to clay-rich subsoils, which have lower organic-matter contents than topsoils, and their clays are more strongly weathered than pure aluminosilicates. Two experiments were conducted with a Vertisol subsoil (69 % clay) : a laboratory incubation and a batch sorption. The mineral substrate in the incubation experiment was pure sand alone or sand amended with 300 g clay kg⁻¹. Powdered calcium sulfate (CaSO 4) at rates of 0, 5, 10, and 15 g Ca kg⁻¹ and mature wheat residue at a rate of 20 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> were added to this mineral substrate and the water content was adjusted to 70 % of water-holding capacity. Carbon dioxide release was measured for 28 days. Cumulative respiration per g soil organic carbon (C) (SOC from clay and residues) was increased by clay addition. Increasing Ca²⁺ addition rate decreased cumulative respiration in the sand with clay but had no effect on respiration in the pure sand. Clay and Ca²⁺ addition had no significant effect on microbial biomass carbon (MBC) per g SOC but clay addition reduced the concentration of potassium sulfate (K 2 SO 4) –extractable C per g SOC. For the batch sorption experiment, the subsoil was mixed with 0 to 15 g Ca kg⁻¹ and water-extractable organic C (WEOC) derived from mature wheat straw was added at 0, 1485, 3267, and 5099 mg WEOC kg⁻¹. Increasing Ca²⁺ addition rate increased sorption of WEOC, particularly at the greatest concentration of WEOC added, and decreased desorption. This study confirmed the importance of Ca²⁺ in binding organic matter to clay and suggests that Ca²⁺ addition to clay-rich subsoils could be used to increase their organic C sequestration. P.

40|$|Hazardous waste {{management}} practices at ten medical institutions in Cape Town were studied and tests undertaken to determine concentrations of specific chemicals and radioactivity in liquid effluent outflows, {{as well as}} emissions from incinerators. To investigate the sewage outflow for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), N, pH and heavy metals, a continuous sampler was installed at two hospitals and a Medical School. Samples were analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry for As, Hg, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and Fe. Mercury levels ranged from l- 70 μg l⁻¹, exceeding the Environmental Target Quality of 0. 04 μg l⁻¹, and the South African General Effluent Standard of 20 μg l⁻¹. All other heavy metals were below General Effluent Standard Limits. In addition, a sludge sample from the Athlone Wastewater Plant was tested for Hg, realising 6 mg kg⁻¹ on a dry weight basis, which was within Department of Health (DOH) Guidelines of 10 mg kg⁻¹. Samples of incinerator bottom ash analysed for heavy metal content gave Hg concentrations of 1. 1 - 4. 0 mg kg⁻¹, and Zn concentrations of 5. 1 - 11. 0 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹.</b> Incinerator ash was also analysed for radio-activity and substantial levels of ¹²⁵I (332 - 650 bq kg⁻¹), and Ga⁶⁷ (9186 bq kg⁻¹) recorded, which exceeded the South African limits of 200 bq kg⁻¹. In Cape Town, hospital incinerators are old, burn large amounts of plastics and produce toxic emissions. They are all situated in residential or inner-city areas, and {{even though there is}} legislation dealing with emissions and chemical waste, these laws are not being enforced. Based on the above results, an investigation was carried out to assess attitudes to and knowledge of hazardous waste in the ten institutions. One thousand questionnaires were administered to staff, and the data from the 80 % response rate statistically analysed. Results suggest that there is an urgent need for an holistic approach to toxic {{waste management}}, encompassing enforceable legislation coupled with on-going educational programmes and strong support from top management and all levels of staff...|$|E
40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] phenolic compounds in blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) fruit and leaf extracts (BLE) were determined based on HPLC analysis. Antimicrobial assays against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, as well as fungi isolated from the rotting blueberry fruit were conducted. The effects of chitosan coating incorporating different concentrations of BLE on the quality of fresh fruit during postharvest storage at 2 ± 1 °C and 95 ± 2 % relative humidity (RH) for 35 d and then at room conditions for 3 d were also investigated. Five different coating treatments were applied including 2 % (w/v) chitosan coating (T 1), 2 % (w/v) chitosan coating containing 4 % (w/v, T 2), 8 % (w/v, T 3), or 12 % (w/v, T 4) BLE, and 2 % (w/v) chitosan coating containing 12 % BLE plus modified atmosphere packaging (MAP at 3 kPa O₂+ 12 kPa CO₂) (T 5). A sample of blueberries dipped into distilled water was used as control (T 0). BLE had a greater variety of phenolic compounds than fruit extracts with syringic acid the highest concentration (0. 259 ± 0. 003 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹),</b> but the total phenolic content in BLE was lower (P < 0. 05) than in fruit extracts. BLE showed good antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms, with a minimum inhibition concentration from 25 - 50 g L⁻¹. The 2 % chitosan coating that incorporated 8 % or 12 % BLE showed some degree of decreasing decay rate of fruit compared with the control, and the coating with BLE plus MAP had more effective control of fruit decay. All treated samples maintained higher total phenolic content and radical scavenging activity than the control. This study suggested that chitosan coating incorporating BLE can be employed to extend shelf-life and maintain high nutritional value of fresh blueberries during postharvest storage...|$|E

The addition of several new herbicides labeled for pastures or hayfields has led many growers to question their options for weed management in these environments. In addition, {{little is known about the}} influence of common pasture weed species on total biomass yield and nutritive values in a pasture or hayfield setting. Therefore, research was conducted to 1) evaluate the effect of various herbicides on the control of tall goldenrod (Solidago canadensis subsp. altissima (L.)), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), and tall ironweed (Vernonia gigantea (Walt.) Trel), 2) evaluate the effect of herbicides on total biomass yield and nutritive values, and 3) evaluate the effects of increasing densities of common ragweed and common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.) on total biomass yield and nutritive values. Results from these experiments indicate that a variety of herbicide treatments will provide good control of several common pasture weed species, but that infestations of these weeds may not necessarily reduce the nutritive values or yield of the total biomass harvested. For example, biomass yield increased from 1 to 6 kg ha⁻¹ and crude protein decreased by 0. 4 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> as common ragweed or common cocklebur density increase within a tall fescue stand. In all experiments, nutritive values of pure weed species samples revealed that most pasture weed species provide greater values than pure tall fescue when forage harvests occur in June. Additional research is necessary to investigate why these species are not consumed by cattle and continue to be a problem in Missouri tall fescue pastures and hayfields...|$|E
40|$|The {{respiration}} flush upon rapid rewetting of {{dry soil}} {{has been studied}} extensively, but with inconsistent differences in cumulative respiration between drying and rewetting (DRW) treatments and the constantly moist (CM) control. Therefore, factors influencing respiration in DRW require further research. Three incubation experiments were carried out to assess the relationship between cumulative respiration {{and the number of}} moist or dry days in two soils of similar texture but different long-term management: permanent pasture and wheat-fallow soil with organic C content of 39 and 19 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹.</b> In the first experiment, the CM and DRW treatments had the same total length (10 days) with different proportions of moist and dry days in the DRW treatments. The second and third experiment had DRW cycles in which dry and moist periods were of equal length with one cycle in experiment 2 and two cycles in experiment 3. Total cumulative respiration per gram TOC was greater in wheat than in pasture soil. Total cumulative respiration in DRW treatments was lower than in CM except when the moist period was more than 50 % of the total length in pasture soil in experiment 1. In the first experiment, cumulative respiration in the dry period was not influenced by the number of dry days, but cumulative respirations in the moist period and in the total DRW cycle were positively correlated with the number of moist days. In both second and third experiment, total cumulative respiration increased with increasing number of days, with a greater increase in CM than in DRW treatments. When subjected to two DRW cycles in the third experiment, cumulative respiration in the dry period was not correlated with the number of dry days in the first cycle but negatively correlated in the second DRW cycle. We conclude that cumulative respiration in DRW cycles is strongly influenced by the number or proportion of moist days. When dry and moist periods are of equal length, the reduction in cumulative respiration in DRW compared to CM becomes greater with increasing DRW cycle length. Andong Shi, Petra Marschne...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Aral Sea Basin is a {{critical}} area for studying the influence of climate and anthropogenic impact {{on the development of}} hydrographic conditions in an endorheic basin. We present organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst analyses with a sampling resolution of 15 to 20 years from a core retrieved at Chernyshov Bay in the NW Large Aral Sea (Kazakhstan). Cysts are present throughout, but species richness is low (seven taxa). The dominant morphotypes are Lingulodinium machaerophorum with varied process length and Impagidinium caspienense, a species recently described from the Caspian Sea. Subordinate species are Caspidinium rugosum, Romanodinium areolatum, Spiniferites cruciformis, cysts of Pentapharsodinium dalei, and round brownish protoperidiniacean cysts. The chlorococcalean algae Botryococcus and Pediastrum are taken to represent freshwater inflow into the Aral Sea. The data are used to reconstruct salinity as expressed in lake level changes during the past 2000 years. We quantify and date for the first time prominent salinity variations from {{the northern part of the}} Large Aral Sea. During high lake levels, I. caspienense, representing brackish conditions with salinities of about 10 - 15 <b>g</b> <b>kg-¹</b> or less, prevails. Assemblages dominated by L. machaerophorum document lake lowstands during approximately 0 - 425 AD (or 100 ? BC- 425 AD), 920 - 1230 AD, 1500 AD, 1600 - 1650 AD, 1800 AD and since the 1960 s. Because salinity in the Aral Sea is mostly controlled by meltwater discharges from the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers, we interpret changes in salinity levels as a proxy for temperature fluctuations in the Tien Shan Mountains that control snow melt. Significant erosion of marine Palaeogene and Neogene deposits in the hinterland, evidenced between 1230 AD and 1400 AD, is regarded as sheet-wash from shore. This is controlled by the low pressure system that develops over the Eastern Mediterranean and brings moist air to the Middle East and Central Asia during late spring and summer. We propose that the recorded environmental changes are related primarily to climate, but perhaps to a lesser extent by humancontrolled irrigation activities. Our results documenting climate change in western Central Asia are fairly consistent with reports elsewhere from Central Asia...|$|E
40|$|Frc, a {{major gene}} on {{chromosome}} 8, conditions fructan levels in onions (Allium cepa L). In order to assist genetic dissection of this locus, this study aimed {{to determine the}} factors influencing varying fructan levels in high- and low-fructan genotypes. Mapping families were developed and analysed to study the genetic architecture for the fructan trait, and to check the association of the identified variables with the Frc locus. To facilitate reliable and practicable sugar assays in onions, a newly-adapted high-throughput microplate enzymatic assay was validated in this study. The reliability of using leaf sugars {{as a representative of}} bulb sugars in a mapping population was studied. Microplate enzymatic sugar assays were carried out on a segregating onion cross to validate the use of maltases in sugar analysis, and the results obtained were validated against HPLC-PAD. Sucrose measured in microplates employing maltases as the hydrolytic enzyme was in agreement with HPLC-PAD results. Maltase enzymes specifically hydrolysed sucrose in onions, providing an alternate tool in place of expensive sugar assay kits. Use of the microplate-enzymatic assay provided a rapid, cheap and practicable method for sugar analysis in onion. Differences in carbohydrate content, sucrose metabolising enzyme activities and their expression levels were monitored in developing leaf blades and leaf bases of four high- and four low-fructan genotypes. The variation in fructan accumulation between high- and low-fructan genotypes was due to the variation in sucrose metabolism. SPS expression and activity did not vary between high- and low-fructan genotypes. Acid invertase and 1 -SST showed significant variation in their activities between the two fructan groups. Post-transcriptional and translational regulation of AI and 1 -SST respectively, are suggested. Mapping populations analysed for non-structural carbohydrates showed very wide segregation for fructan (80 to 600 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹)</b> and other NSC content, and were well-suited for detailed genetic and physiological analysis. Single marker analysis was carried out to study the association between the combined enzyme activity (CEA; acid invertase + 1 -SST) and the Frc markers. Significant association between CEA and Frc markers has suggested genes regulating acid invertases or 1 -SST or both underlie Frc. Leaf blade NSC did not correlate with bulb sugars and thus cannot be used as a phenotypic marker for early selection of bulb NSC traits...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Compost {{maturity}} is {{an important}} determinant of end use for composted municipal yard debris, and generally refers to the effect the compost has on plants. The rate of microbial respiration is an indicator of compost stability. The objectives of this research were to: i) determine whether continuous aeration resulted in more rapid maturity of composted yard debris than windrow turning; ii) determine which maturity indicators distinguish between mature and immature compost; iii) measure rates of CO₂ evolution during active composting and curing; iv) adapt the CO₂ detection tube technique for compost; and v) evaluate rapid compost stability tests (Solvita test, self-heating test and CO₂ detection tubes) for potential use by commercial composters. Land Recovery, Inc. of Puyallup, WA, composted yard debris under careful process control. Two compost piles were studied for 113 d; one was subjected to continuous forced aeration and periodic turning. The other was managed as a turned windrow. We found that forced aeration resulted in mature compost about 20 days before windrowing. Compost pH, C content and respiration rate were all useful indicators of compost maturity. Carbon fell from 400 k kg⁻¹ to 250 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> and pH rose from 5 to 7. The CO₂ evolution rate fell from 16 to 2 mg CO₂-C g C⁻¹ d⁻¹. Maturity correlated somewhat with compost odor. Neither percent germination nor an odor/color scale were reliable indicators of maturity for theses composts. All the rapid tests were correlated with alkaline trapping of microbially respired CO₂. The Solvita test took 4 h to administer; values (1 to 8 Solvita scale) were 2 to 4 during active composting, 3 to 6 during early curing and 6 to 7 during late curing. Self-heating test values decreased from 20 °C above ambient {{at the start of}} composting to ambient (no heat production) at the end of composting. This test took two to six days to administer. We developed a method to measure CO₂ evolution rates of samples in sealed containers using CO₂ detection tubes. This method took 4 h to administer, correlated well with alkaline trapping, was quantitative and had excellent sensitivity at extreme compost maturity. The methods shows promise as a raid test for compost respiration and should be evaluated on a wider range of composts...|$|E
40|$|Peel and kernel often {{discarded}} during mango processing, {{are potential}} sources of antioxidants and could be utilised as additives to preserve meat products. The cultivar, physicochemical characteristics and stage of maturity are important factors that influence the antioxidant activity of mango flesh, peel and kernel. The cultivar Tommy Atkins, imported into New Zealand and the four cultivars; “Cat Hoa Loc”, “Cat Chu”, Ghep” and “Nam Dok Mai” grown in Vietnam were compared to determine which of the cultivars have antioxidant potential. Tommy Atkins and Nam Dok Mai were less mature than the other three Vietnamese cultivars based on maturity score, firmness, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and Vitamin C. The antioxidant capacity of the mango flesh from all the cultivars ranged from 252. 6 to 754. 4 GAE 100 g⁻¹ DW, (total phenolic content), 43. 6 to 70. 0 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (ABTS radical scavenging activity) and 30 to 51. 6 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (DPPH radical scavenging activity). Mango peel antioxidant capacity was higher than flesh and ranged from 822. 3 to 8084. 9 GAE 100 g⁻¹ DW (total phenolic content), 406. 3 to 1188. 3 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (ABTS radical scavenging activity) and 210. 6 to 735. 4 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (DPPH radical scavenging activity). The antioxidant capacity values of mango kernel was the highest and ranged from 6286. 0 to 13888. 8 GAE 100 g⁻¹ DW (total phenolic content), 1066. 3 to 2227. 6 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (ABTS radical scavenging activity) and 667. 4 to 2205. 7 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (DPPH radical scavenging activity). Flesh from Tommy Atkins and Cat Chu contained the highest antioxidant capacity than flesh from any other cultivar. Kernel from Tommy Atkins had the highest antioxidant capacity than any other cultivar whereas peel from Nam Dok Mai contained the highest antioxidant capacity than peel from any other cultivar. In all the cultivars investigated, kernel showed the highest content of total phenolic content and antioxidant capacities followed by peel then flesh, except for Nam Dok Mai whose kernel and peel contained similar antioxidant capacities. The tannin content was significantly higher in kernel (21. 3 - 54. 7 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> DW), than peel (7. 9 - 22. 9 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> DW) than flesh (0. 9 - 1. 1 <b>g</b> <b>kg⁻¹</b> DW) in all the cultivars. There were no oxalates detected in flesh {{in any of the}} cultivars. Small amounts of oxalates were detected in peel from all the cultivars and in kernel from Nam Dok Mai and Tommy Atkins. Peel and kernel from Cat Chu contained low levels of tannins and oxalates and are possible sources of antioxidants to prevent oxidative damage in food products. Drying is usually used to produce dried products that can be mechanically incorporated into foods. Freeze, sun, vacuum and microwave drying reduced the hydrophilic antioxidants and antioxidant capacity of mango flesh whilst forced-air drying increased the total phenolic content (TPC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). In the case of peel, all the drying treatments reduced hydrophilic and lipophilic oxygen radical absorbance capacity (H-ORAC and L-ORAC) whilst microwave and freeze drying increased TPC and FRAP. For kernel, vacuum, followed by freeze drying increased the H-ORAC values and antioxidant capacity as measured by ABTS, DPPH and FRAP whilst the other drying treatments reduced the antioxidant activities. The relationship between the physicochemical parameters (maturity) of Tommy Atkins mango fruits with the antioxidant capacity of their flesh, peel and kernel fractions as measured by their total phenolic content, ABTS, DPPH, FRAP, H-ORAC and L-ORAC activities was investigated. The physicochemical properties firmness, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, TSS:TA, vitamin C and moisture content were significantly correlated (p < 0. 05) with the stage of maturity of the Tommy Atkins mango fruits. Thus, any one of the measured physicochemical parameters could be used as an indicator of fruit maturity in Tommy Atkins. All the antioxidant assays TPC, ABTS, DPPH, FRAP and H-ORAC were significantly correlated (p < 0. 05) to each other indicating that phenolics in flesh, peel and kernel are good sources of antioxidants. In mango peel, only weak-to-moderate correlations were found between the lipophilic antioxidants (H-ORAC) and hydrophilic antioxidants (H-ORAC) or antioxidant capacity as measured by TPC, ABTD, DPPH and FRAP. Mango kernel from the less ripe mangoes with low maturity score, TSS, TSS:TA ratio and a high TA, firmness and vitamin C content were relatively high in antioxidant capacity relative to those from ripe mangoes. Peel colour was an unreliable index of the maturity of Tommy Atkins fruit or the antioxidant capacity of their peel, flesh and kernel. The incorporation of freeze dried mango peel (1 % w/w) or kernel (1 % w/w) into pork sausages or patties on inhibiting lipid oxidation was investigated over a 10 day chilled storage period. There were small changes in TBARS (2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and myoglobin over the first 4 days whilst off-odours and volatiles increased at day 4 in the control pork sausages and patties without any antioxidants. The volatiles, 1 -pentanol (44. 0 %) and 3 -hydroxyl- 2 -butanone (45. 8 %) in the sausages and hexanal (36. 6 %), pentanal (10. 8 %) and 1 -pentanol (14. 6 %) in the patties were all identified as products of lipid oxidation and were generated by day 4. More volatiles, particularly hexanal, were released in the patties than in the sausages. The addition of mango kernel (1 % w/w) or peel (1 % w/w) or synthetic antioxidant BHT (0. 01 % w/w) to the sausages and patties immediately changed TBARS (only observed in sausages), myoglobin and volatiles at day zero but there was no effect on colour or odour. The redness of sausages was reduced and the discoloration (hue) increased dramatically at day 2 and remained unchanged across the remainder of the storage period whilst the colour of the patties decreased gradually from day 0 to day 10. The addition of mango kernel, peel and BHT stabilised the colour of the sausages and patties especially the redness across the 10 day storage period. The antioxidative effects of the additives were more pronounced after day 4 when the addition of mango kernel or peel or BHT to the sausages and patties inhibited lipid oxidation as shown by the maintenance of stable TBARS, colour (a* and hue) and myoglobin and a reduction in off-odour and volatiles, compared to the controls. The addition of peel or BHT maintained the pleasant odour of pork sausages and patties for up to 4 days of storage and kernel for 6 days. At 10 days, the mean TBARS values of the low (9. 1 % fat), medium (22. 2 %) and high (47. 4 %) fat control sausages were between 12. 1 to 15. 0 µmol MDA kg⁻¹ DW and sausages with added kernel between 3. 1 to 3. 8 µmol MDA kg⁻¹ DW. For patties, at 10 days, the TBARS values of control low, medium and high fat patties ranged from 12. 3 to 29. 2 µmol MDA kg⁻¹ DW and those with kernel from 6. 9 to 7. 9 µmol MDA kg⁻¹ DW. Mango kernel was more effective than peel or BHT in inhibiting lipid oxidation over the 10 day storage period. There was also an effect of the fat content (9. 1 to 47. 4 % fat) of the product on the effectiveness of the added antioxidants to inhibit lipid oxidation. The TBARS in patties and the discoloration and loss in redness of the patties and sausages were higher in the high (47. 4 % fat) compared to low (9. 1 %) fat products. Furthermore, at 6 days for sausages and 4 days for patties the inhibitory effects on lipid oxidation was more effective with kernel than peel or BHT in the high and medium fat products. Pork sausages with added kernel under O₂- permeable film at 4 ºC were assessed to be microbiologically safe to consume over a 10 day storage period. Pork patties had a high TVC and were contaminated with E. coli and were assessed unsuitable for human consumption. The dried kernel and peel products themselves were judged microbiologically safe to use as food supplements. In addition, mango kernel exhibited antimicrobial effects against E. coli, staphylococci, coliforms, yeasts and moulds and TVC in the pork sausages. Freeze dried mango kernel or peel contained antioxidants and if added to pork products extended their shelf life by inhibiting lipid oxidation (TBARS) and preventing changes in colour and odour. Kernel showed the highest antioxidant capacity, compared to peel or synthetic BHT. Dried mango kernel extended the shelf life of pork products for an additional 4 (patties) or 6 (sausages) days compared to patties or sausages without mango additives. In summary, dried mango kernel is an excellent natural source of antioxidants and prevents undesirable oxidative damage in pork products...|$|E
