50|$|Many plant {{pathogens}} produce virulence factors (i.e., effectors) that modulate or {{interfere with}} normal host processes {{to the benefit}} of the pathogens. In 2009, a secreted protein, termed “tengu-su inducer” (TENGU), was identified from a phytoplasma causing yellowing of onions; this was the first phytoplasmal virulence factor to be described. TENGU induces characteristic symptoms (termed “tengu-su”), including witches’ broom and dwarfism. Transgenic expression of TENGU in Arabidopsis plants <b>induced</b> <b>sterility</b> in male and female flowers. TENGU contains a signal peptide at its N-terminus; after cleavage, the mature protein is only 38 amino acids in length. Although phytoplasmas are restricted to phloem, TENGU is transported from phloem to other cells, including those of the apical and axillary meristems. TENGU was suggested to inhibit both auxin- and jasmonic acid-related pathways, thereby affecting plant development. Surprisingly, the N-terminal 11 amino acid region of the mature protein triggers symptom development in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. TENGU undergoes proteolytic processing by a plant serine protease in vivo, suggesting that the N-terminal peptide (i.e., the 11 amino acid fragment) alone induces the observed symptoms. TENGU homologs have been identified in AY-group phytoplasmas. All such homologs undergo processing and can induce symptoms, suggesting that the symptom-inducing mechanism is conserved among TENGU homologs. TCP transcription factors normally regulate plant development, controlling the expression of lipoxygenase genes required for jasmonate biosynthesis. Jasmonate levels are decreased in phytoplasma-infected Arabidopsis plants and plants that transgenically express SAP11, an effector of AY-WB phytoplasmas. The downregulation of jasmonate production is beneficial to phytoplasmas because jasmonate is involved in plant defenses against herbivorous insects such as leafhoppers. Leafhoppers lay increased numbers of eggs on AY-WB-infected plants, at least in part because of SAP11 production. For example, the leafhopper Macrosteles quadrilineatus laid 30% more eggs on plants that expressing SAP11 transgenically than control plants, and 60% more eggs on plants infected with AY-WB. Phytoplasmas cannot survive in the external environment and are dependent upon insects such as leafhoppers for transmission to new (healthy) plants. Thus, by compromising jasmonate production, SAP11 'encourages' leafhoppers to lay more eggs on phytoplasma-infected plants, thereby ensuring that newly hatched leafhopper nymphs feed upon infected plants to become phytoplasma vectors.|$|E

Successful frost risk management requires an integrated approach involving {{many aspects of the}} farming system, such as sowing time, crop/cultivar selection, stubble management and plant nutrition. A number of commercial chemical products have become available in recent times offering potential crop protection to frost damage. During 2014 at Mintaro, South Australia, four protectant products (anti-transpirant and biochemical products) were applied and one plant growth regulator, Trinexapac-ethyl to wheat plots sown at seven weekly intervals to assess their potential to alleviate frost damage. Several frost events occurred during the growing season. The degree of frost damage varied across each time of sowing corresponding to frost events at susceptible stages of plant development. Of the chemical protectants tested, none provided any significant reduction in frost <b>induced</b> <b>sterility</b> or gains in yield compared to the untreated control.

40|$|Abstract There is {{currently}} {{renewed interest in}} assessing the feasibility of the sterile insect technique (SIT) to control African malaria vectors in designated areas. The SIT relies on the sterilization of males before mass release, with sterilization currently being achieved {{through the use of}} ionizing radiation. This paper reviews previous work on radiation sterilization of Anopheles mosquitoes. In general, the pupal stage was irradiated due to ease of handling compared to the adult stage. The dose-response curve between the <b>induced</b> <b>sterility</b> and log (dose) was shown to be sigmoid, and there was a marked species difference in radiation sensitivity. Mating competitiveness studies have generally been performed under laboratory conditions. The competitiveness of males irradiated at high doses was relatively poor, but with increasing ratios of sterile males, egg hatch could be lowered effectively. Males irradiated as pupae had a lower competitiveness compared to males irradiated as adults, but the use of partially-sterilizing doses has not been studied extensively. Methods to reduce somatic damage during the irradiation process as well as the use of other agents or techniques to induce sterility are discussed. It is concluded that the optimal radiation dose chosen for insects that are to be released during an SIT programme should ensure a balance between <b>induced</b> <b>sterility</b> of males and their field competitiveness, with competitiveness being determined under (semi-) field conditions.

40|$|Background : The {{success of}} the Sterile Insect Technique for areawide vector control relies crucially {{on the ability of}} sterile males to outcompete their wild {{counterparts}} for mating with wild females. Competitiveness tests are commonly performed for assessing quality sterile males intended for field release programs, but there are few reports on the optimal age and ratio for sterile Aedes albopictus male release in a SIT program. Objective : Here, a series of mating competitiveness experiments with different age (1, 3, and 5 d post-emergence) and ratios (1 : 1, 5 : 1, and 10 : 1) of sterile to wild males were carried out in a walk-in field cage under semi-field conditions to examine variations in the mating competitiveness of irradiated adult Ae. albopictus males. Methods : Pupae from laboratory-reared Ae. albopictus were irradiated at 35 Gy and introduced in field cages at different ages post emergence and at different ratios with a cohort of wild males and females. The mating competitiveness of sterile versus fertile males, and sterility induction into wild females measured through the egg hatch were observed. Results : The age of sterile males Ae. albopictus significantly affected their competitiveness when confronted with wild males of the same age. Competitiveness of sterile males was significantly lower after emergence (1 -day old) than when they were older (3 - 5 days old). Presumably, 3 -days old sterile males may be considered as the optimal age for sterile male releases. At this optimal age, <b>induced</b> <b>sterility</b> rates increased as the proportion of irradiated males relative to the wild male increased. Conclusion : Our study points to the fact that sugar feeding prior to field release, could be administered for 3 days post-emergence in order to enhance the performance of sterile males.

40|$|Effects {{on three}} {{sulfonate}} esters, a nitrosamine and γ-radiation have been compared {{on the basis}} of mutation rate, sterility and lethality. The most powerful mutagen was ethyl-methane-sulfonate (EMS) inducing up to 16 per cent chlorophyll mutants. After, we have respectively methyl-N-nitro-N′-nitrosoguanidine (MNG) 12 per cent, methyl-methane-sulfonate (MMS) 7 · 5 per cent, γ-radiation 5 · 5 per cent and butyl-methane-sulfonate 2 · 3 per cent. Increase of mutation frequency can arise from decreased lethality in treated plants. Mutagenic efficiencies compared with toxicity correspond fairly well to those obtained for <b>induced</b> <b>sterility.</b> By decreasing power we have EMS > MNG > MMS > γ BMS. Comparison of <b>induced</b> <b>sterility</b> related to chlorophyll mutation frequency showed a maximal efficiency for EMS, meaning that for the same number of induced mutations, this alkane sulfonate induced less sterility. Relations of mutagenic effects with concentration are linear after irradiation, exponential after MNG or EMS and rather sigmoidal after BMS and MMS. Evidence was obtained of preferential induction of some chlorophyllian phenotype with the mutagen utilized. EMS induced relatively few albina as compared with γ-rays. Chlorophyll mutation spectra differed not only with the nature of the mutagen but also with experimental conditions, temperature and pH. Genome itself can interfere to preserve or eliminate some mutations. Mean segregation ratios of M 2 chlorophyll mutations are widely lower than 25 per cent. Their values which is an indication of the mutated sector increases in the direction MMS < γ < MNG < EMS. The analysis of these segregation ratios made us consider the occurence of two or three initials as origin of the generative tissue. Some external conditions can increase the mutation rate. Temperature during the treatment increased the reactivity of MNG. In the case of EMS, seed presoaking has the same action. Increase of pH of the mutagenic solution results in an increase of mutated plants after MMS treatments. Differential sensitivity to EMS appeared in three strains of Arabidopsis from different geographical origins. These differences are concerned as well with the mutability as the biological reactions of the treated generation. © 1969. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

This sperm-mediated harm is pervasive across species, but idiosyncrasies in its magnitude implicate both independent histories of sexually antagonistic coevolution within species and differences in reproductive mode (self-fertilizing hermaphrodites versus females) in determining its severity. Consistent with this conclusion, in androdioecious species the hermaphrodites are more vulnerable, the males more benign, or both.

[...] The P elements have an extremely high transposition rate and <b>induce</b> <b>sterility</b> and abnormal gonad development in D. melanogaster (Johnson, 2). [...] The flies thus developed a maternally inherited technique for combating the invasive DNA and silencing the transposons, now known as P cytotype. P cytotype detects DNA sequences in areas of telomeric heterochromatin and silences those sequences when they are found elsewhere in the genome. This {{is referred to as}} the telomeric-silencing effect (TSE) (2). [...] Just two P elements in the telomere are enough to suppress over 80 other copies of the P element in the genome. [...] The cytoplasmic factor used for TSE builds up over generations and suppression of the transposons is not fully effective unless the fly’s female-line ancestors have had the P element for six generations (2).|$|R
