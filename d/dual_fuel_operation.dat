In addition CO 2 emission, a product of complete combustion also has become a serious issue due to global warming effect. Hence the search for cleaner alternative fuels has become mandatory.

Hence in the present work, an experimental investigation has been carried out using hydrogen in the dual fuel mode in a Diesel engine system. In the study, a Diesel engine was converted into a dual fuel engine and hydrogen fuel was injected into the intake port while Diesel was injected directly inside the combustion chamber during the compression stroke. Diesel injected inside the combustion chamber will undergo combustion first which in-turn would ignite the hydrogen that will also assist the Diesel combustion. Using electronic control unit (ECU), the injection timings and injection durations were varied for hydrogen injection while for Diesel the injection timing was 23 Â° crank angle (CA) before injection top dead centre (BITDC). Based on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics, the optimized injection timing was found to be 5 Â° CA before gas exchange top dead centre (BGTDC) with injection duration of 30 Â° CA for hydrogen Diesel <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>operation.</b> The optimum hydrogen flow rate was found to be 7. 5 lpm.

40|$|Because {{of global}} warming and {{increasing}} air pollution, alternative fuels are increasingly being considered for use in internal combustion engines (ICEs). Among the alternatives, alcohol fuels seem very interesting. They can be produced in a renewable way and possess certain advantageous properties that give them the potential to lower pollutants and CO 2 emissions from ICEs. Methanol and ethanol are the most researched alcohols today. In fact, {{in some areas of}} the world, gasoline is blended with methanol or ethanol for use in spark ignition (SI) engines. These alcohols are ideally suited for SI engines because of their high octane number (low tendency to knock). That makes them, however, not very well suited for compression ignition (CI) engines which require high cetane number fuels. There exist, however, CI engine technologies that burn alcohol fuels. One of these technologies is <b>Dual</b> <b>Fuel</b> (DF) <b>operation.</b> In DF operation, the engine runs effectively on two fuels. There exist several concepts to achieve this. One of these is to inject a mixture of diesel and alcohol fuel directly into the cylinder. Another is to separately inject diesel and alcohol fuel directly into the cylinder. A third concept (so-called fumigation) is to inject the alcohol fuel into the intake and the diesel directly into the cylinder (the homogeneous alcohol-air mixture is then ignited by a pilot injection of diesel). The paper will provide an overview of the literature regarding this fumigation concept. This work has been carried out {{as a part of the}} LeanShips project.

40|$|International audienceAnimal fats/vegetable oils (called biofuels) {{and their}} {{emulsions}} are quite promising alternative fuels for diesel engines. This article reports a comprehensive {{study on the}} use of animal fats/vegetable oils and their emulsions as fuel in compression ignition engines. Emulsions preparation method and their effects on engine performance, emission, and combustion characteristics have been studied in detail. Information indicates that biofuel emulsions in diesel engines enhanced the combustion efficiency with improved performance as compared to neat fuels. The maximum percentage of water addition to biofuel was found as 30 per cent by volume for maximum efficiency. They reduced NO,, smoke, and particulate emissions considerably. Emulsions resulted in higher ignition delay as a result of vaporization of water as compared to neat fuels. Peak pressure, rate of pressure rise, and premixed combustion rate in the heat release curve were found to be higher when compared to neat oils because of longer ignition delay. Further improvements could be achieved by adding oxygenated fuels like methanol, dimethyl carbonate, and cetane number improvers like diethyl ether with biofuels in small quantities. It has also been suggested that <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>operation</b> can significantly reduce particulate and NO., emissions with biofuels. Exhaust gas recirculation can reduce ignition delay considerably with reduced NO., emissions. Finally, modelling techniques were presented because they can help in in-depth analysis of the combustion process of biofuel emulsions in diesel engines...|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{pressure}} rise rate and thermal efficiency data are measured and presented for a <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine {{running on a}} <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> of Diesel and compressed natural gas and utilizing exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The maximum {{pressure rise}} rate during combustion {{is presented as a}} measure of combustion noise. The experimental investigation on the <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine revealed the noise generated from combustion and the thermal efficiency at different EGR ratios. A Ricardo E 6 Diesel version engine is converted to run on a <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> of Diesel and compressed natural gas and having an exhaust gas recycling system is used throughout the work. The engine is fully computerized, and the cylinder pressure data and crank angle data are stored in a PC for offline analysis. The effects of EGR ratio, engine speeds, loads, temperature of re-cycled exhaust gases, intake charge pressure and engine compression ratio on combustion noise and thermal efficiency are examined for the <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine. The combustion noise and thermal efficiency of the <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine are found to be affected when EGR is used in the <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine...|$|R
40|$|This {{contract}} {{is supported by}} DOE and DOD/DARPA funds. The objective of the DOE program is to advance the direct carbonate fuel cell technology to a level suitable for commercial entry. The specific objectives of the DOE's initiative on 2 MW Fuel Cell Fixed Base Power Plant are: (A) To provide a detailed engineering design, development and cost estimate of the 2 MW fuel cell fixed base <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> power plant for DOD applications. Installation and operational support systems will also be developed; and (B) To construct a full-size MW-class <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> power plant simulator. These objectives are planned to be achieved in the program coordinated with the Department of Energy, which has been funding a multiyear natural gas fueled direct fuel cell power plant program for civilian applications. Because many DARPA and DOE objectives are similar, the coordinated program activities are considered the most cost-effective for accomplishment of the program objectives. The DARPA/DOE joint program was launched in 1994. The DOE {{part of the program}} is expected to continue to the year 2000. The final output of this DOE program is to construct and operate a 2 MW power plant on an East Coast site. The site will be accessible to DOD energy/environmental systems base planners and logistics personnel as well as mission and policy planners to refine deployment configurations of this new power generation system for fixed base applications. A <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> fixed base design for military <b>fuels</b> <b>operation,</b> as well as support system logistics will be the key deliverables for the DARPA part of the program...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{effects of}} {{different}} engine parameters: engine speed, injection timing, loading, compression ratio and different pilot fuel to gases fuel ratio, were experimentally used {{to investigate the}} overall generated noise from the <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine. <b>Dual</b> <b>fuel</b> engine noises were reported for almost {{the first time in}} this study by direct sound pressure level measurements and compared to the maximum cylinder pressure rise rate with respect to the engine crank angle. The study was conducted for three different fuels: pure diesel <b>fuel,</b> and <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> of diesel-LPG or natural gas. The study reported the location (crank angle) corresponding to maximum cylinder pressure and max pressure rise rate. The present work reported much higher SPL generated form burning a <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> compared to burning diesel fuel only.
