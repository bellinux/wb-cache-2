40|$|The global <b>financial</b> {{crisis has}} {{magnified}} {{the role of}} <b>Financial</b> Sector Surveillance (FSS) in the Fund''s activities. This paper surveys the various steps and initiatives through which the Fund has increasingly deepened its involvement in FSS.

The preliminary stage {{dates back to the}} 1980 s and early 1990 s, and was mainly related to the Fund''s research and technical assistance activities within the process of monetary and <b>financial</b> deregulation embraced by several member countries. The first "official" phase of the Fund''s involvement in FSS started {{in the aftermath of the}} Mexican crisis, and relates to the international call to include <b>financial</b> sector issues among the core areas of Fund surveillance. The second phase focuses on the objectives of bringing the coverage of <b>financial</b> sector issues "up to par" with the coverage of other traditional core areas of surveillance, and of integrating <b>financial</b> analysis into the Fund''s analytical macroeconomic framework. By urging the Fund to give greater attention to its member countries'' <b>financial</b> systems, the international community''s response to the global crisis may mark the beginning of a new phase of FSS.

Specifically, we expect older consumers to demonstrate higher levels of both objective and subjective <b>financial</b> literacy, more desirable <b>financial</b> behaviors, a higher level of perceived <b>financial</b> capability, and a higher score on the <b>financial</b> capability index. Data from the 2012 National <b>Financial</b> Capability Study in the U. S. was used to examine the associations between age groups and <b>financial</b> capability variables. One-way ANOVAs were used to examine age differences in <b>financial</b> capability variables.

Following the season, the team released 18 players and Potteiger was fired {{and replaced by}} LeRoy Andrews. Before the 1929 season Mara purchased the entire squad of the Detroit Wolverines, including star quarterback Benny Friedman, a team which had finished in third place the year before. The rosters of the two teams were combined under the Giants name and this led to immediate improvement as the Giants record soared to 13–1–1 in 1929. [...] Friedman's arrival in particular boosted tickets sales and fan interest, which more than covered the expense of his high salary ($10,000).

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{apparent}} contradictions between two strands {{of the literature}} on the effects of <b>financial</b> intermediation on economic activity. On the one hand, the empirical growth literature finds a positive effect of <b>financial</b> depth as measured by, for instance, private domestic credit and liquid liabilities.
