This selectivity to spin causes deep minima in the magnetodrag at odd filling factors for matched electron densities at magnetic fields and temperatures at which the bare spin energy is only one tenth of the temperature. For mismatched densities the selectivity causes a 1 /B periodic oscillation, such that negative minima in the drag are observed whenever the majority spins at the <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies</b> of the two-dimensional electron gases are antiparallel, and positive maxima whenever the majority spins at the <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies</b> are parallel...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, carbon nanoscrolls (CNSs) {{that have}} a tubular {{structure}} {{similar to that of}} the open multi-wall carbon nanotube have received significant attention. Graphene nanoscrolls (GNSs) have also attracted significant attention, owing to their unique properties. These nanoscrolls are obtained by systematically winding graphene sheets into a spiral, and are expected to have high mechanical strength, high carrier mobility, and high thermal conductivity. In the present work, an analytical model was used to determine the band energy of (16, 0) GNS, and the normalized <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies</b> in the degenerate and non-degenerate regimes are modeled.

25|$|The <b>Fermi</b> <b>energy</b> is an {{important}} concept in the solid state physics of metals and superconductors. It {{is also a very}} important quantity in the physics of quantum liquids like low temperature helium (both normal and superfluid 3He), and it is quite important to nuclear physics and to understanding the stability of white dwarf stars against gravitational collapse.|$|E
25|$|What {{this means}} is that even if we have {{extracted}} all possible energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near absolute zero temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the <b>Fermi</b> <b>energy.</b> This is the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.|$|E
25|$|In quantum mechanics, a {{group of}} {{particles}} known as fermions (for example, electrons, protons and neutrons) obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This states that two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state. Since an idealized non-interacting Fermi gas can be analyzed in terms of single-particle stationary states, we can thus say that two fermions cannot occupy the same stationary state. These stationary states will typically be distinct in energy. To find the ground state of the whole system, we start with an empty system, and add particles one at a time, consecutively filling up the unoccupied stationary states with the lowest energy. When all the particles have been put in, the <b>Fermi</b> <b>energy</b> is the kinetic energy of the highest occupied state.|$|E

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} found both {{theoretically}} and experimentally that the differential gain in quantum well lasers is significantly affected by the unavoidable thermal population of injected carriers in the upper subbands of the quantum well structure, especially in the states of the separate confinement heterostructure region (state filling effect). The differential gain depends on the rate of increase of the quasi <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies</b> with increasing injected carrier density. The presence of upper subbands with large density of states tends to clamp the <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies</b> thus leading to a low differential gain.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{electronic}} structures of TiO 2 /Ti 4 O 7 and Ta 2 O 5 /TaO 2 interfaces using the screened exchange (sX-LDA) functional. Both of these bilayer structures are useful infrastructures for high performance RRAMs. We {{find that the}} system <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies</b> of both interfaces are just above the conduction band edge of the corresponding stoichiometric oxides. According to the charge transition levels of the oxygen vacancies in Ta 2 O 5 and TiO 2, the oxygen vacancies are stabilized at the - 2 charged state. We propose to introduce interfacial dopants to shift the system <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies</b> downward so that the + 2 charged oxygen vacancy can be stable, which {{is important for the}} controlled switching under the electrical field. Several dipole models are presented to account for the ability of Fermi level shift due to the interfacial dopants...|$|R
25|$|One {{model that}} {{estimates}} {{the properties of}} an electron gas at absolute zero in metals is the Fermi gas. The electrons, being Fermions, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical velocities, even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the <b>Fermi</b> <b>energy.</b> The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is {{of the order of}} 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical equipartition theorem for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Magnetism and nematic order {{are the two}} non-superconducting orders {{observed}} in iron-based superconductors. To elucidate the interplay between them and ultimately unveil the pairing mechanism, several models have been investigated. In models with quenched orbital degrees of freedom, magnetic fluctuations promote stripe magnetism which induces orbital order. In models with quenched spin degrees of freedom, charge fluctuations promote spontaneous orbital order which induces stripe magnetism. Here we develop an unbiased approach, in which we treat magnetic and orbital fluctuations on equal footing. Key to our approach is {{the inclusion of the}} orbital character of the low-energy electronic states into renormalization group analysis. Our results show that in systems with large <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies,</b> such as BaFe 2 As 2, LaFeAsO, and NaFeAs, orbital order is induced by stripe magnetism. However, in systems with small <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies,</b> such as FeSe, the system develops a spontaneous orbital order, while magnetic order does not develop. Our results provide a unifying description of different iron-based materials. Comment: 61 pages, 19 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The 124 Ba nucleus is {{investigated}} on {{the basis}} of the method of statistical mechanics by assuming the nucleons to move in triaxially deformed Nilsson potential. The variation in the <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies</b> of protons and neutrons is studied as a function of spin and temperature. The <b>Fermi</b> <b>energies</b> determined as a function of angular momentum is used to study the dependence of shell correction on angular momentum using the Strutinsky smoothing procedure. The most important observation is that the shell correction is almost the same for all spins for 124 Ba. The spin cutoff parameter and the single particle level density parameter are studied as a function of spin and temperature. Constant entropy lines drawn by plotting the excitation energy against angular momentum are found to be roughly at constant energy above the yrast line and are almost equally spaced. It is observed that no yrast traps are present for 124 Ba...|$|R
