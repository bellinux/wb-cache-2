5|$|Cucurbita (Latin for gourd) is a genus of {{herbaceous}} vines in {{the gourd}} family, Cucurbitaceae, {{also known as}} cucurbits, native to the Andes and Mesoamerica. Five species are grown worldwide for their <b>edible</b> <b>fruit,</b> variously known as squash, pumpkin, or gourd depending on species, variety, and local parlance, and for their seeds. Other kinds of gourd, also called bottle-gourds, are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria, {{which is in the}} same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe. These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels, and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the advent}} of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for <b>edible</b> <b>fruit,</b> nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers, {{scavenged}} for dead animals and hunted living ones for food. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing {{is thought to be}} the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed. While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus produce is used for exchange for other goods.|$|E

25|$|Citrus fruits — {{among them}} the bitter orange — were {{introduced}} to Sicily in the 9th century {{during the period of}} the Emirate of Sicily, but the sweet orange was unknown until the late 15th century or the beginnings of the 16th century, when Italian and Portuguese merchants brought orange trees into the Mediterranean area.

25|$|The {{cultivated}} {{forms are}} of the species sweet cherry (P. avium) to which most cherry cultivars belong, and the sour cherry (P. cerasus), which is used mainly for cooking. Both species originate in Europe and western Asia; they do not cross-pollinate. Some other species, although having <b>edible</b> <b>fruit,</b> are not grown extensively for consumption, except in northern regions where the two main species will not grow. Irrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive. Nonetheless, demand is high for the fruit. In commercial production, cherries are harvested by using a mechanized 'shaker'. Hand picking is also widely used to harvest the fruit to avoid damage to both fruit and trees.|$|E

500|$|Europeans first {{encountered}} cacti {{when they arrived}} in the New World late in the 15th century. Their first landfalls were in the West Indies, where relatively few cactus genera are found; {{one of the most}} common is the genus Melocactus. Thus, melocacti were possibly among the first cacti seen by Europeans. Melocactus species were present in English collections of cacti before the end of the 16th century (by 1570 according to one source,) where they were called Echinomelocactus, later shortened to Melocactus by Joseph Pitton de Tourneville in the early 18th century. Cacti, both purely ornamental species and those with <b>edible</b> <b>fruit,</b> continued to arrive in Europe, so Carl Linnaeus was able to name 22 species by 1753. One of these, his Cactus opuntia (now part of Opuntia ficus-indica), was described as [...] "" [...] (with larger fruit ... now in Spain and Portugal), indicative of its early use in Europe.|$|E

500|$|Almost any fleshy cactus {{fruit is}} edible. The word pitaya or {{pitahaya}} (usually {{considered to have}} been taken into Spanish from Haitian creole) {{can be applied to}} a range of [...] "scaly fruit", particularly those of columnar cacti. The fruit of the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) has long been important to the indigenous peoples of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States, including the Sonoran Desert. It can be preserved by boiling to produce syrup and by drying. The syrup can also be fermented to produce an alcoholic drink. Fruits of Stenocereus species have also been important food sources in similar parts of North America; Stenocereus queretaroensis is cultivated for its fruit. In more tropical southern areas, the climber Hylocereus undatus provides pitahaya orejona, now widely grown in Asia under the name dragon fruit. Other cacti providing <b>edible</b> <b>fruit</b> include species of [...] Echinocereus, Ferocactus, Mammillaria, Myrtillocactus, Pachycereus, Peniocereus and Selenicereus. The bodies of cacti other than opuntias are less often eaten, although Anderson reported that Neowerdermannia vorwerkii is prepared and eaten like potatoes in upland Bolivia.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} {{tree in the}} park is the yellowwood (Cladrastis lutea). [...] This tree typically does not grow further north than central Kentucky, and has been designated as a state threatened species in Indiana. [...] Other trees found in the park include at least four types of oak (black, chestnut, red, and white) and three types of hickory (bitternut, pignut, and shagbark). [...] The park also contains at least two types of maple trees: [...] black and sugar. Patches of paw paw trees can be found throughout the park, and these trees produce an <b>edible</b> <b>fruit.</b> In areas with good moist soil, the black walnut tree grows, and this tree is {{an excellent source of}} wood for lumber or furniture. [...] Among other trees growing in the park are the American beech, basswood, black cherry, black gum, and red elm. [...] Also the sassafras, sycamore, white ash. [...] The park also contains at least eight kinds of ferns and 20 types of wildflowers, including bloodroot and wild geranium.|$|E
500|$|Durian {{trees are}} large, growing to [...] in height {{depending}} on the species. The leaves are evergreen, elliptic to oblong and [...] long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and directly on the trunk with each flower having a calyx (sepals) and five (rarely four or six) petals. Durian trees {{have one or two}} flowering and fruiting periods per year, although the timing varies {{depending on the}} species, cultivars, and localities. A typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years. The durian fruit can hang from any branch and matures roughly three months after pollination. The fruit can grow up to [...] long and [...] in diameter, and typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species. Among the thirty known species of Durio, nine of them have been identified as producing edible fruits: D. zibethinus, D. dulcis, D. grandiflorus, D. graveolens, D. kutejensis, D. macrantha, D. oxleyanus and D. testudinarum. There are many species for which the fruit has never been collected or properly examined, however, so other species with <b>edible</b> <b>fruit</b> may exist. The durian is somewhat similar in appearance to the jackfruit, an unrelated species.|$|E
