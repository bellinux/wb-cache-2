6000|$|Mrs. Saddletree {{looked after}} her, {{and shook her}} head. [...] "I wish she binna roving, poor thing--There's {{something}} queer about a' thae Deanses. I dinna like folk to be sae muckle better than other folk--seldom comes gude o't. But if she's gaun {{to look after the}} kye at St. Leonard's, that's another story; to be sure they maun be sorted.--Grizzie, come up here, and tak tent to the honest auld man, and see he wants naething.--Ye silly tawpie" [...] (addressing the maid-servant as she entered), [...] "what garr'd ye busk up your cockemony that gate?--I think there's been enough the day to gie an awfa' warning about your cockups and your <b>fallal</b> duds--see what they a' come to," [...] etc. etc. etc.|$|E
6000|$|... "Noo ye're {{married to}} her, there's her bonnets and goons and under-clothin'--her ribbons, laces, furbelows, and <b>fallals.</b> A sair expense again!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm a plain man," [...] says John, [...] "and eat a plain dinner. I hate your kickshaws, though I keep a French {{cook for}} those who are not of my way of thinking. I'm no egotist, look you; I've no prejudices; and Miss there has her bechamels and <b>fallals</b> {{according}} to her taste. Captain, try the volly-vong." ...|$|R
60|$|And it was queer {{to remark}} {{the change that}} had taken place in Mrs. Hoggarty's {{character}} now: for whereas she was in the country among the topping persons of the village, and quite content with a tea-party at six and a game of twopenny whist afterwards,--in London she would never dine till seven; would have a fly from the mews to drive in the Park twice a week; cut and uncut, and ripped up and twisted over and over, all her old gowns, flounces, caps, and <b>fallals,</b> and kept my poor Mary from morning till night altering them to the present mode. Mrs. Hoggarty, moreover, appeared in a new wig; and, I am sorry to say, turned out with such a pair of red cheeks as Nature never gave her, and as made all the people in Bernard Street stare, where they are not as yet used to such fashions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor won't. Nor won't. You'll {{never see}} the things I've seen, never. Not if you live to be a 'undred... Well, as I was saying, that's how the Famine and Riotin' began. Then there was strikes and Socialism, things I never did 'old with, worse and worse. There was fightin' and shootin' down, and burnin' and plundering. They broke up the banks up in London and got the gold, but they couldn't make food out of gold. 'Ow did WE get on? Well, we kep' quiet. We didn't {{interfere}} with no-one and no-one didn't interfere with us. We 'ad some old 'tatoes about, but mocely we lived on rats. Ours was a old 'ouse, full of rats, and the famine never seemed to bother 'em. Orfen we got a rat. Orfen. But moce {{of the people who}} lived hereabouts was too tender stummicked for rats. Didn't seem to fancy 'em. They'd been used to all sorts of <b>fallals,</b> and they didn't take to 'onest feeding, not till it was too late. Died rather.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{some common}} sense, Barker. Do you suppose that I {{could go and}} stick up this one {{personal}} enemy of mine and escape detection? It was impossible. I was bound to make myself {{out to be just}} a common robber who had run up against him by accident. So I turned myself loose on the high road and took my chance. As the devil would have it, the first man I met was yourself. I was a fool not to recognise that old ironmonger's store of yours by the row it made coming up the hill. When I saw you I could hardly speak for laughing. But I was bound to carry it through. The same with the actresses. I'm afraid I gave myself away, for I couldn't take their little <b>fallals,</b> but I had to keep up a show. Then came my man himself. There was no bluff about that. I was out to skin him, and I did. Now, Barker, {{what do you think of}} it all? I had a pistol at your head last night, and, by George! whether you believe it or not, you have one at mine this morning!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was just}} going to {{commence}} a tirade regarding the aristocracy here, and to rage against that cool assumption of superiority which distinguishes their lordships' commerce with artists of all sorts: that politeness which, if it condescends to receive artists at all, takes care to have them altogether, so {{that there can be no}} mistake about their rank--that august patronage of art which rewards it with a silly flourish of knighthood, to be sure, but takes care to exclude it from any contact with its betters in society--I was, I say, just going to commence a tirade against the aristocracy for excluding artists from their company, and to be extremely satirical upon them, for instance, for not receiving my friend Morgiana, when it suddenly came into my head to ask, was Mrs. Walker fit to move in the best society?--to which query it must humbly be replied that she was not. Her education was not such as to make her quite the equal of Baker Street. She was a kind honest and clever creature; but, it must be confessed, not refined. Wherever she went she had, if not the finest, at any rate the most showy gown in the room; her ornaments were the biggest; her hats, toques, berets, marabouts, and other <b>fallals,</b> always the most conspicuous. She drops [...] "h's" [...] here and there. I have seen her eat peas with a knife (and Walker, scowling on the opposite side of the table, striving in vain to catch her eye); and I shall never forget Lady Smigsmag's horror when she asked for porter at dinner at Richmond, and began to drink it out of the pewter pot. It was a fine sight. She lifted up the tankard with one of the finest arms, covered with the biggest bracelets ever seen; and had a bird of paradise on her head, that curled round the pewter disc of the pot as she raised it, like a halo. These peculiarities she had, and has still. She is best away from the genteel world, that is the fact. When she says that [...] "The weather is so 'ot that it is quite debiliating;" [...] when she laughs, when she hits her neighbour at dinner on the side of the waistcoat (as she will if he should say anything that amuses her), she does what is perfectly natural and unaffected on her part, but what is not customarily done among polite persons, who can sneer at her odd manners and her vanity, but don't know the kindness, honesty, and simplicity which distinguish her. This point being admitted, it follows, of course, that the tirade against the aristocracy would, in the present instance, be out of place--so it shall be reserved for some other occasion.|$|R
