For such countries the standard models of exchange rate determination are not strictly appropriate.

In addition to the exchange rate there are two other jump variables in the model: Tobin's q and the shadow price of bank debt, which depends on expectations of future interest rates. It is shown that financing investment through intermediation helps to stabilize the economy following a domestic monetary shock but makes the economy more vulnerable to a foreign monetary shock.

40|$|Restrictions on <b>international</b> <b>capital</b> <b>transactions</b> {{and other}} {{payments}} are usually designed to limit volatile short-term capital flows (“hot money”) and stabilize the exchange rate. Their imposition, however, {{may have the}} opposite effect by inadvertently signaling the continuation of macroeconomic imbalances and inconsistent (“bad”) future policy (Bartolini and Drazen, 1997 a,b). This paper investigates these alternative hypotheses by testing the impact of restrictions on <b>international</b> <b>capital</b> flows and other payments controls on the likelihood of currency crises. We employ a comprehensive sample of 90 developing and emerging-market economies over the 1975 - 1997 period, identifying 160 currency crises. Restrictions on <b>international</b> <b>capital</b> flows, current accounts, and international payments {{are associated with a}} higher probability of the onset of a speculative attack on the currency. This finding is robust to alternative measures of liberalization on international payments and the exchange rate regime, controlling for macroeconomic determinants of currency instability, and taking into account instability emanating from the banking sector. There may be some individual exceptions but the weight of the evidence suggests that countries imposing capital restrictions are sending a “bad signal” to markets, in turn increasing the likelihood of a net capital outflow and a currency crisis. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the experience of}} the EU''s eight new member countries (EU 8) between 1995 and 2003 when the bulk of capital account liberalization took place, focusing on interest-rate-sensitive portfolio flows and financial flows. It takes stock of the lessons from capital flow patterns to draw policy conclusions. There were two distinct groups in terms of the speed of capital account liberalization: rapid liberalizers and cautious liberalizers. The speed of disinflation and the level of public debt were major determinants of the size of interest-rate-sensitive portfolio inflows. Monetary and exchange rate policies were the main instruments used to react to large interest-sensitive inflows, whereas fiscal tightening was seldom used as a direct reaction to inflows.

40|$|Opening {{the capital}} account allows financially {{constrained}} firms to raise capital from abroad. Since capital and skilled labor are relative complements, this increases the relative demand for skilled labor versus unskilled labor, leading to higher wage inequality.

In order to identify the mechanism, I use sectoral data and exploit variation in external financial dependence and capital-skill complementarity across industries.

40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Thomas Grennes.) According to classic economic theory, if global capital markets are fully integrated then arbitrage should force real interests rates to be equal among countries. How-ever, {{a large body of}} empirical evidence suggests that this parity is not achieved. One potential factor in this failure of economic theory is that <b>international</b> <b>capital</b> <b>transactions</b> are not frictionless. The costs involved in the purchase or sale of a cap-ital asset imply a neutral area in which arbitrage is not profitable and rates freely deviate from equality.

Section Two describes the data used in the analyses. Section Three uses a non-parametric regression method to analyze bilateral real interest rate relationships.

40|$|The {{literature}} on the benefits and costs of financial globalization for developing countries has exploded in recent years, but along many disparate channels and {{with a variety of}} apparently conflicting results. For instance, there is still little robust evidence of the growth benefits of broad capital account liberalization, but a number of recent papers in the finance literature report that equity market liberalizations do significantly boost growth. Similarly, evidence based on microeconomic (firm- or industry-level) data shows some benefits of financial integration and the distortionary effects of capital controls, while the macroeconomic evidence remains inconclusive. We attempt to provide a unified conceptual framework for organizing this vast and growing literature. This framework allows us to provide a fresh synthetic perspective on the macroeconomic effects of financial globalization, in terms of both growth and volatility. Overall, our critical reading of the recent empirical literature is that it lends some qualified support to the view that developing countries can benefit from financial globalization, but with many nuances. On the other hand, there is little systematic evidence to support widely cited claims that financial globalization by itself leads to deeper and more costly developing country growth crises.

40|$|In this paper, we adopt a {{cross-country}} perspective {{to examine the}} evolution of capital flows into China, {{both in terms of}} volumes and composition. China''s inflows have generally been dominated by foreign direct investment (FDI), a pattern that appears to be favorable in light of the recent literature on the experiences of developing countries with financial globalization. We provide a detailed documentation of the evolution of China''s capital controls, a proximate determinant of the pattern of capital inflows. We also discuss a number of other intriguing hypotheses that attempt to capture the "deeper" causes underlying China''s approach to capital flows. In particular, we argue that some popular mercantilist-type arguments are inconsistent with the facts. We also analyze the recent rapid rise of China''s international reserves and discuss its implications. Contrary to some popular perceptions, the dramatic surge in foreign exchange reserves since 2001 is mainly attributable to non-FDI capital inflows, rather than current account surpluses or FDI.

40|$|While the {{relationship}} between volatility and credit risk is central {{to much of the}} literature on finance and banking, it has been largely neglected in empirical macro studies on sovereign defaults. This paper presents new econometric estimates for a panel of 25 emerging market countries over 1970 - 2001, breaking down aggregate volatility into its external and domestic policy components. We find that countries with historically higher macroeconomic volatility are more prone to default, and particularly so if part of this volatility is policy-induced. Reducing policy volatility thus appears to be key to improving a country''s credit standing.

In this paper we review this policy of capital liberalization and integrate the analysis with {{an examination of the}} process of stabilization of the lira exchange rate in the 1980 s. Various indicators of capital controls’ effectiveness and target zone credibility are used to identify the temporal relations among capital liberalization, exchange rate stabilization and capital flows.
