The most complete design process, is composed of five elementary design stages. After a description of different theories and methods useful within the design process, we show how these five design stages may be convenient to naturally locate and connect them...|$|E

To realize knowledge based recommender systems user requirements and resources on web such as information, products and services need to be described as knowledge uniformly. This paper explores the semantic <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> and the automatic acquisition <b>of</b> <b>product</b> knowledge from heterogeneous databases. The product is modeled as a duple and is defined as an ontology using OWL. To acquire product knowledge from heterogeneous databases, we adopt the method of schema mapping and OWL transferring template. The database schema is mapped to XML schema to which {{the content of the}} XML documents generated from the data in the databases must conform. The XML documents are further transferred to OWL documents by the OWL transferring template. The generated OWL documents are the semantic <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> instances and can be provided as input to reasoner such as Racer to conduct ontology based reasoning or rule based reasoning.

This paper gives the specific storage mapping algorithm. The different XML documents are stored using a fixed relationship model and not limited by the document DTD(Document type definition).

40|$|Abstract. Electronic Product Catalogues are {{the basis}} for {{offering}} and selling products in online market places. To be efficient, these catalogues have to provide a semantically precise <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> features to allow for effective matchmaking of products and customer requests. At the same time, the description has to follow a common terminology that allows the integration with the catalogues of other providers on the same market place. In this paper, we argue {{for the use of}} ontologies as a basis for defining product catalogues. More precisely, we suggest using eClassOWL, an ontological model of the eClass Standard as a basis for encoding product information as formal class descriptions in the web ontology language OWL. We support our argument by presenting an ontology based implementation of a real product catalogue that uses eClass terminology and supports flexible matchmaking based on approximate logical reasoning. ...|$|E

This paper provides an extensive experimental test on the original algorithms developed by Prof. Mario Costa by analyzing a number of cases which differ on size and surface classes. From a conceptual point of view, the non-parametric, model-independent estimation of the Probability Density Function of a set of points closes the loop composed of design, manufacturing and inspection activities along the product development process.

30|$|In the {{practical}} applications, since the appearance modelings of many products in industry are quite complex, they often cannot be {{described by a}} single surface in many cases. Thus, {{there is a need}} to design such products using adjacent surfaces. The smooth continuity among multiple surface patches with certain smooth constraints is usually used to achieve the appearance design of complex products. The ultimate aim of smooth continuity is to make adjacent surface patches satisfy certain smooth conditions so that the complex piecewise surface composed of these surface patches has global smoothness visually. Parametric surfaces, which are not only the standard form for the mathematical <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> appearance in CAD/CAM, but also a powerful tool for various shape designs and geometric representations, have received much attention since the 1960 s. Thus the smooth continuity between parametric surfaces is an important method to construct complex surfaces and also significant research in the CAD/CAM system [1, 2].|$|E

The proposed framework contains an ontology based description of products and virtual humans enabling the access to 3 D models while accessing high level semantic information through the use of inference mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an overview about standard representation of product data for better communication and exchange between CAD / CAM systems. For mechanical parts, standard use for <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> data is ISO 10303 - Product data representation and exchange, {{also known as}} STEP. This make possible to use standard data during design, process planning and production stage to integrate CAD and CAM. The main barriers to realizing this concept is most of computer numerical control (CNC) machines, which use ISO 6983 G/M codes language. G/M codes lack the portability because of the following reasons. First it focus only on tool center path rather than machining process, second some vendors use language supplement with their own extensions programme which make it ambiguous. ISO 14649 called as STEP-NC is a new standards which extend STEP standard for NC. STEP-NC replaces G/M codes by remedies the above shortcomings. STEP-NC specifying machining processes rather than machine tool motion, using the concept of working steps. Working steps correspond to high-level machining features and associated process parameters. The controller of future CNC’s are responsible for translating Working steps to axis motion.
