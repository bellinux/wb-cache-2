5|$|The soundtrack {{is noted}} for its <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of trumpets.|$|E
5|$|Because of its <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> and {{practice}} by magicians, {{sleight of hand}} is often confused as a branch of magic, but is in reality a separate genre of entertainment, as many artists practice sleight of hand without the slightest interest in magic.|$|E
5|$|Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of {{rock music}} {{that began in}} the mid-1960s, with the garage, {{psychedelic}} and blues rock movements. It is typified by a <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with keyboards.|$|E

5|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews. Some critics {{praised the}} work of Lee Tamahori, while others criticised the film's <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of computer-generated imagery, which they found unconvincing and a distraction from the film's plot. Nevertheless, Die Another Day was the highest-grossing James Bond film {{up to that time}} if inflation is not taken into account.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{maintenance program}} intended {{to extend the}} service lives of M249s {{has been carried out}} to refurbish rifles, especially units that suffered from wear due to <b>heavy</b> <b>use.</b> In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models and is no longer present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than spot welding. Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, Victorian {{scholars}} such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt {{sought to}} understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued to make <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.|$|E

5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{critical}} acclaim, The Wire received poor Nielsen ratings, which Simon {{attributed to the}} complexity of the plot; a poor time slot; <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of esoteric slang, particularly among the gangster characters; and a predominantly black cast. Critics felt the show was testing the attention span of its audience and that it was mistimed {{in the wake of the}} launch of the successful crime drama The Shield on FX. However, anticipation for a release of the first season on DVD was high at Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to tell a story, but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E
5000|$|The theme has {{a slower}} tempo than the Buffy theme. It has <b>heavier</b> <b>use</b> of {{acoustic}} instruments such as cello and violin.|$|R
50|$|The overall {{structure}} of the Perfect Dark network broadly resembles recent versions of Freenet, only with a <b>heavier</b> <b>use</b> of distributed hash tables.|$|R
5000|$|It makes <b>heavier</b> <b>use</b> of {{the front}} tyres (i.e., accelerating, braking, and turning), causing more wear in the front than in a rear-wheel-drive layout.|$|R
5|$|Lemurs {{generally}} have thin tooth enamel compared to anthropoid primates. This {{may result in}} extra wear and breakage to the anterior (front) teeth due to <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> in grooming, feeding, and fighting. Little other dental health information is available for lemurs, except that wild ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit abscessed maxillary canines (seen as open wounds on the muzzle) and tooth decay, possibly due to the consumption of non-native foods.|$|E
5|$|Maneater {{is one of}} the few {{films in}} the series to break the {{standard}} formula of Syfy natural horror films with its use of a normal, living tiger rather than a CG animal or excusing its behavior by having it be a mutant or genetically altered. Critics heavily panned the film citing substandard acting, <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of stereotypical characters, a hole-filled plot, unused subplots, and the use of a live tiger resulting in almost all attacks being implied rather than seen.|$|E
5|$|Many Metro {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Chicago architect Harry Weese, and are examples of late-20th century modern architecture. With their <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs, Metro stations display aspects of Brutalist design. The stations also reflect the influence of Washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults. Weese worked with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based lighting designer Bill Lam on the indirect lighting used throughout the system. All of Metro's original Brutalist stations are found in Downtown Washington, D.C. and neighboring urban corridors of Arlington, Virginia, while newer stations incorporate simplified cost-efficient designs.|$|E

50|$|Kofi Annan, the UN special envoy, {{accused the}} Syrian {{government}} of <b>using</b> <b>heavy</b> weapons and helicopters {{in the village}}. Jihad Makdissi, spokesman for Syria's Foreign Ministry, denied that <b>heavy</b> weapons were <b>used</b> {{in the village and}} said the <b>heaviest</b> weapon <b>used</b> was an RPG.|$|R
5|$|Planet Terror makes <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> {{of digital}} effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.|$|E
5|$|Sunday never {{attended}} seminary {{and made}} no pretense of being a theologian or an intellectual, {{but he had a}} thorough knowledge of the Bible and was well read on religious and social issues of his day. His surviving Winona Lake library of six hundred books gives evidence of <b>heavy</b> <b>use,</b> including underscoring and reader's notes in his characteristic all-caps printing. Some of Sunday's books were even those of religious opponents. He was later charged with plagiarizing a Decoration Day speech given by the noted agnostic Robert Ingersoll.|$|E
5|$|The Eraser is {{the debut}} solo album by Thom Yorke of the English {{alternative}} rock band Radiohead, released on 10 July 2006 on the independent label XL Recordings. It {{was produced by}} longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich. The album comprises electronic music Yorke recorded during Radiohead's 2004 hiatus and between their 2005 rehearsals, and makes <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of original samples.|$|E

50|$|It {{was hoped}} {{that a new}} {{architecture}} making a <b>heavier</b> <b>use</b> of hardware resources, the cost of which was going down, could significantly simplify software development and reduce costs for both IBM and customers.|$|R
5000|$|... "Expectation" [...] {{was added}} to Tame Impala's setlist in late 2010 and heavily {{featured}} in 2011. Live, Tame Impala play the entire song, including the reprise, and have a <b>heavier</b> <b>use</b> of effects in the reprise.|$|R
5|$|The album {{features}} a <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes {{inspiration from the}} apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson. Stevens' use of electronics marked {{a radical departure from}} much of his previous work—most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan. Unlike Illinois, the lyrics do not explore events, characters or setting, but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level.|$|E
5|$|The first anime, Psycho-Pass, has {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} in both Japan {{and the west}} with critics praising the characters' roles and interactions set in the dystopia. The animation has also been praised despite issues in latter episodes which required to be fixed in the DVD volumes of the series. On the other hand, the second series, Psycho-Pass 2, received mixed critical response stemming from its <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of gore {{as well as the}} new villain.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the fiction is thought by Donald Tuck to have {{generally}} fallen during Santesson's period at the helm, though this was not entirely his faultthere were a great many other magazines competing for stories by the top writers. Santesson himself, despite a modicum of controversy over his <b>heavy</b> <b>use</b> of UFO and related material, was kind and helpful to writers, and was well liked as a result.|$|E
50|$|The {{thickness}} of subbase {{can range from}} 75 to 100 mm for garden paths through 100 to 150 mm for driveways and public footpaths, to 150 to 225 mm for <b>heavy</b> <b>used</b> roads, and more for highways.|$|R
50|$|Black Coats & Bandages is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by Irish-Australian band Clann Zú. This album has much sparser instrumentation and less electronic influence than Clann Zú's previous album, Rua, and a <b>heavier</b> <b>use</b> of the Irish language.|$|R
50|$|While the lyrical {{content of}} Judgement Day {{is similar to}} that of Esham's debut, Boomin' Words from Hell, the music {{features}} a <b>heavier</b> <b>use</b> of rock samples. The album's rock-based sound influenced rap rock artists such as Kid Rock.|$|R
