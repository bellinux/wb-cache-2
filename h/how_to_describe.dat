2500|$|The Reverend Thomas Smith (1638–1710) and Humfrey Wanley (1672–1726) both {{catalogue}}d the Cotton library (in {{which the}} Nowell Codex was held). Smith's catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley's in 1705. The Beowulf manuscript itself is identified by {{name for the}} first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the Beowulf script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley [...] "I can find nothing yet of Beowulph." [...] Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the Beowulf manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.|$|E

2500|$|Farrar {{was sent}} by Reveille to a press {{screening}} of the film Legend of the Witches. The screening was also attended by Alex Sanders and Maxine Sanders, the founders of Alexandrian Wicca, who had served as advisors during the film's creation. According to his biography at mystica.com, Farrar was [...] "skeptical about Witchcraft but was interested in Sanders upon meeting him". The paper requested that Farrar interview Sanders and published the interview as a two-part story. Sanders, [...] "impressed" [...] with the interview, invited Farrar to attend an Alexandrian Wiccan initiation ritual, and prompted Farrar to write an entire book on Wicca. According to mystica.com, Farrar [...] "found the ceremony both dignified and moving". Farrar began work on his first non-fiction book, What Witches Do, and began taking classes on witchcraft from the Sanders'. Maxine Sanders remembers Farrar as [...] "a charming man, a sincere student with an active flexible mind". Maxine Sanders also notes {{that it was in}} response to Farrar's questions about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> their practice in his book that the Alexandrian tradition was named.|$|E
2500|$|Biological {{signaling}} systems often rely on complexes {{of biological}} macromolecules that can undergo several functionally significant modifications that are mutually compatible. Thus, they can {{exist in a}} very large number of functionally different states. Modeling such multi-state systems poses two problems: The problem of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> and specify a multi-state system (the [...] "specification problem") and the problem of how to use a computer to simulate the progress of the system over time (the [...] "computation problem"). To address the specification problem, modelers have in recent years moved away from explicit specification of all possible states, and towards rule-based formalisms that allow for implicit model specification, including the -calculus, BioNetGen, the Allosteric Network Compiler and others. To tackle the computation problem, they have turned to particle-based methods that have in many cases proved more computationally efficient than population-based methods based on ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, or the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm. Given current computing technology, particle-based methods are sometimes the only possible option. Particle-based simulators further fall into two categories: Non-spatial simulators such as StochSim, DYNSTOC, RuleMonkey, and NFSim and spatial simulators, including Meredys, SRSim and MCell. Modelers can thus choose from a variety of tools; the best choice depending on the particular problem. Development of faster and more powerful methods is ongoing, promising the ability to simulate ever more complex signaling processes in the future.|$|E
