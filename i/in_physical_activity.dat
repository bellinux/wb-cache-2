However, {{under the direction}} of an expert, participation <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with MS. Research has supported the rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.|$|E

25|$|Flexibility can {{be simply}} {{defined as the}} {{available}} range of motion (ROM) provided by a specific joint or group of joints. For the most part, exercises that increase flexibility are performed with intentions to boost overall muscle length, reduce the risks of injury and to potentially improve muscular performance <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> Stretching muscles after engagement in any physical activity can improve muscular strength, increase flexibility, and reduce muscle soreness. If limited movement is present within a joint, the “insufficient extensibility” of the muscle, or muscle group, could be restricting {{the activity of the}} affected joint.|$|E

25|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Manchester Institute of Sport and Physical Activity (MISPA) at the Manchester Metropolitan University and the Youth Sports Trust, Wright Robinson has taken part in a ten-year research project. The project was designed to support the school's strategic aim of raising academic standards and increasing whole school participation in Physical Education and Sport. In ten years over 10,000 children and 1,000,000 hours of PE have been assessed. The evidence shows that participation <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> enables young people to significantly improve their physical competence, confidence and self-esteem. More active pupils were also found to generally achieve higher academic attainment with 62% of physically active pupils achieving five or more A*-C GCSE grades including mathematics and English compared to 38% of the least active pupils.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} {{preventive}} measure for type1 diabetes. Type2 diabeteswhich accounts for 85-90% of all casescan often be prevented or delayed by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> and consuming a healthful diet. Higher levels {{of physical activity}} (more than 90 minutes per day) {{reduce the risk of}} diabetes by 28%. Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish. Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can also help prevent diabetes. Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} reasons among the {{long-lived}} elderly for participating and continuing <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> programs. Methods: The {{participants in this}} study were eighty-seven elderly individuals, aged 80 or older, belonging to support groups in Florianópolis (SC). A semi-structured interview was applied and interpreted by means of thematic content analysis. Results: The reasons for participating <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> programs were: health promotion/maintenance; pleasure <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> activities; medical recommendation; incentives from friends, family and professionals; socialization; keeping oneself active; having an occupation/ diversion; feeling well; and esthetics. The reasons for continuing were: health promotion/maintenance; pleasure <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> activities; socialization; feeling well; remaining active; good professionals; and medical recommendation. Conclusion: The main factors that motivate the long-lived elderly to initiate and continue <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> programs are linked to health perceptions and psychosocial aspects.

Four hundred and forty-four participants (184 males, 260 females) aged 19. 1 ± 3. 3 years (mean ± s) completed self-report measures of intentions, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, volitional intentions, forced intentions, and past behaviour <b>in</b> a <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> context.

Results indicated that volitional intentions and forced intentions contributed {{to the prediction of}} effort over and above intentions, attitudes, subjective norms, perceptions of control, past behaviour, and the product terms of attitudes × intentions and subjective norms × intentions.

40|$|Background: The high {{prevalence}} of physical inactivity among {{children and adolescents}} (youth) and the associated negative health consequences make it critical to increase <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> levels. Social-ecological models suggest that the school environment may influence youth health behaviour. However, {{few studies have examined}} the school environment in relation to youth <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> Purpose: To 1) examine between-school variability <b>in</b> student <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> 2) identify school characteristics that account for between-school variability <b>in</b> student <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> and 3) examine the association between senior student participation rates <b>in</b> school <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> and junior student <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> Methods: The study consisted of secondary data analysis of the School Health Action, Planning and Evaluation System (SHAPES) Ontario project, which collected self-report data from 69, 511 students in 76 secondary schools from seven public health unit districts in Ontario. Multilevel modeling was used to examine between-school variability <b>in</b> student <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> as well as school characteristics associated with <b>physical</b> <b>activity.</b> Results: There was significant between-school variability <b>in</b> student <b>physical</b> <b>activity,</b> and the relationship between <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> and age and gender, respectively. School rates of physical education participation were associated with student <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> levels. Senior student participation <b>in</b> other <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> at school, such as playing outside, was associated with junior student <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> levels. Conclusions: These findings support the social-ecological notion that the school environment can influence adolescent <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> behaviour.

The aim of this study is to gain insight into the objective daily <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> pattern of patients with CFS in comparison with healthy controls. The secondary objective is studying the awareness <b>in</b> performing <b>physical</b> <b>activities.</b> Methods: The objective daily <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> pattern was measured with a tri-axial accelerometer in 35 patients with CFS and in 35 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The objective daily <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> level and distribution of <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> at low, medium and high intensity levels during the day were measured. Moreover, variability <b>in</b> performing <b>physical</b> <b>activities</b> within and between subjects was computed. Subjective ratings of self-reported daily <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> levels were assessed at a visual analog scale. Results: CFS patients were significantly less physically active in the afternoon and evening, and spent fewer activities at high intensity levels and more at low intensity levels. Moreover, CFS patients showed more variability <b>in</b> their own <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> pattern during the afternoon. The heterogeneity <b>in</b> the <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> pattern between subjects within the CFS and control group did not differ. Finally, CFS patients were more aware about their daily <b>physical</b> <b>activity</b> level than healthy controls.
