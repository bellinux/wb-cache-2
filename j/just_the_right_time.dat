25|$|In June 2013, Gleeson {{made his}} {{comeback}} to basketball after signing a three-year deal {{to be the}} Head Coach of the Perth Wildcats – the NBL's most successful franchise with five championships. In the months prior to joining the Wildcats, Gleeson was inches from turning his back on basketball for good. Feeling refreshed after his AFL stint, but unsure of his coaching future long-term, the chance to join the Wildcats in 2013 came at <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> Gleeson took over from coach Rob Beveridge, who had developed a winning-culture at the Wildcats (one championship and three grand finals in four years) behind a core group consisting of Shawn Redhage, Damian Martin, Jesse Wagstaff, Matthew Knight and Greg Hire.|$|E
25|$|Australia dug {{themselves}} out of the hole, however, Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey slowly accumulating to increase the rate. England clearly lacked a fifth bowler, opting instead for Vikram Solanki to bat down the order, so they used a combination of Michael Vaughan, Solanki and Collingwood to get through their ten required overs. That let Australia off the hook, with Clarke and Hussey adding 105, before Jon Lewis – who had been taken to the cleaners earlier on – dug out Michael Clarke with an inside edge onto the stumps, taking the fifth wicket of the game at <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> Shane Watson accumulated well with Hussey, however, hitting six an over as Lewis was smashed about again, but Harmison got his revenge by completing his first five-wicket haul in ODIs as Hussey was beaten by a slower ball – the first time Hussey had been dismissed in One Day Internationals, for a batting average of 229. Then, Andrew Flintoff was brought back, getting a splendid yorker in for Watson, who was out for 25 just as the Aussies were preparing to hit out – the score 220 for 7 after 44.1 overs. Jason Gillespie and Brad Hogg survived a couple of overs from Flintoff and Harmison – meaning that Harmison finished with five for 33 off ten overs. Towards the end, Australia built up again, before losing Gillespie to a top edge, but 244 for 8 with seven balls remaining still looked difficult for England to chase. Gough dug out Michael Kasprowicz with a yorker with two balls to spare, and four legbyes ended the innings to take Australia to 252 for 9.|$|E

2500|$|Within robotics, inverse {{dynamics}} algorithms {{are used}} to calculate the torques that a robot's motors must deliver to make the robot's end-point move in the way prescribed by its current task. The [...] "inverse dynamics problem" [...] in Robotics Engineering was solved by Eduardo Bayo in 1987. This solution calculates how each of the numerous electric motors that control a robot arm must move to produce a particular action. Humans can perform very complicated and precise movements, such as controlling the tip of a fishing rod well enough to cast the bait accurately. Before the arm moves, the brain calculates the necessary movement of each muscle involved and tells the muscles what to do as the arm swings. In the case of a robot arm, the [...] "muscles" [...] are the electric motors which must turn by a given amount at a given moment. Each motor must be supplied with {{just the right amount of}} electric current, at <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> Researchers can predict the motion of a robot arm if they know how the motors will move. This is known as the forward dynamics problem. Until this discovery, they had not been able to work backwards to calculate the movements of the motors required to generate a particular complicated motion., Bayo's work began with the application of frequency-domain methods to the inverse dynamics of single-link flexible robots. This approach yielded non-causal exact solutions due to the right-half plane zeros in the hub-torque-to-tip transfer functions. Extending this method to the nonlinear multi-flexible-link case was of particular importance to robotics. When combined with passive joint control in a collaborative effort with a control group, Bayo's inverse dynamics approach led to exponentially stable tip-tracking control for flexible multi-link robots.|$|E

5000|$|The Caulobacter {{cell cycle}} {{regulatory}} system controls many modular subsystems that organize {{the progression of}} cell growth and reproduction. A control system constructed using biochemical and genetic logic circuitry organizes the timing of initiation {{of each of these}} subsystems. The central feature of the cell cycle regulation is a cyclical genetic circuit—a cell cycle engine -- that is centered around the successive interactions of five master regulatory proteins: DnaA, GcrA, CtrA, SciP, and CcrM. [...] These five proteins directly control the timing of expression of over 200 genes. The five master regulatory proteins are synthesized and then eliminated from the cell one after the other {{over the course of the}} cell cycle. Several additional cell signaling pathways are also essential to the proper functioning of this cell cycle engine.
