5|$|The Brackish Groundwater National <b>Desalination</b> Research Facility, a Bureau of Reclamation {{laboratory}} {{doing research}} and development on <b>desalination</b> of brackish water, is located in Alamogordo.|$|E
5|$|<b>Desalination</b> is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. <b>Desalination</b> is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{temperature}} and salinity encompasses both the oceanographic range {{and the range of}} conditions encountered in thermal <b>desalination</b> technologies.|$|E
5|$|The Canning {{reservoir}} is {{also used}} to store water from the newly completed Kwinana <b>Desalination</b> Plant. Treated water can be pumped from the plant to the reservoir through the new Forrestdale Pumping Station.|$|E
5|$|There {{are limited}} natural fresh water {{resources}} on Nauru. Rooftop storage tanks collect rainwater. The islanders are mostly dependent on three <b>desalination</b> plants housed at Nauru's Utilities Agency.|$|E
5|$|When British troops left Malta in 1979, {{the fort}} was {{abandoned}} {{and fell into}} a state of disrepair. Parts of it were also vandalized. At some point it was also used as a <b>desalination</b> plant.|$|E
5|$|From hot springs, {{geothermal}} energy {{has been used}} for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for electricity generation. Worldwide, 11,700 megawatts (MW) of geothermal power is online in 2013. An additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, <b>desalination</b> and agricultural applications as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Titanium can be alloyed with iron, aluminium, vanadium, and molybdenum, {{among other}} elements, to produce strong, {{lightweight}} alloys for aerospace (jet engines, missiles, and spacecraft), military, industrial processes (chemicals and petrochemicals, <b>desalination</b> plants, pulp, and paper), automotive, agri-food, medical prostheses, orthopedic implants, dental and endodontic instruments and files, dental implants, sporting goods, jewelry, mobile phones, and other applications.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is {{resistant to}} corrosion by sea water, {{it is used}} to make propeller shafts, rigging, and heat exchangers in <b>desalination</b> plants; heater-chillers for salt water aquariums, fishing line and leader, and divers' knives. Titanium is used in the housings and components of ocean-deployed surveillance and monitoring devices for science and the military. The former Soviet Union developed techniques for making submarines with hulls of titanium alloys forging titanium in huge vacuum tubes.|$|E
5|$|These {{operations}} {{contributed to}} victory by diverting enemy attention from real targets to dummy ones, wasting enemy ammunition, preserving vital {{resources such as}} the single water <b>desalination</b> plant at Tobruk, and deceiving the enemy as to allied strength and intentions. Operation Bertram {{may also have been}} the last ever army-scale physical deception, since subsequent major deceptions, including those for the D-Day landings in Normandy, have included electronic measures.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar <b>desalination</b> pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare the diesel fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her <b>desalination</b> plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>desalination</b> {{plant was}} {{impossible}} to hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant {{to look as if}} it had been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted over the top and one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E
5|$|Across Oman, Phet's {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at over 300million rials (US$780million). Strong winds knocked down billboards, trees, and power lines, causing power outages. Water pipes and <b>desalination</b> plants were also damaged. Storm flooding washed away hundreds of cars, while also damaging roads and bridges. Nationwide, the cyclone wrecked thousands of homes. On the offshore Masirah Island, Phet's storm surge damaged or wrecked some boats, while strong winds damaged tin roofs and satellite dishes. The roof and compound wall of a resort hotel were damaged. Across eastern and northern Oman, heavy rainfall from Phet flooded low-lying areas and produced landslides. The Royal Oman Police helped direct or traffic after many roads were inundated or blocked. The floodwaters entered homes in Al-Ghubra and Al Athaiba, {{as well as the}} Qurum market in Muscat. According to Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence, Phet killed 16people in the country, although the IMD reported the death toll at 24.|$|E
5|$|Offshore the Arabian Peninsula, the cyclone {{produced}} rough {{waves that}} disabled an oil tanker; {{the crew was}} rescued by the Omani Coast Guard after being stranded for a few days. A fishing boat was damaged after being washed ashore near Ras Madrakah, killing {{one person in the}} crew of nine. Near where the storm moved ashore, the storm's strong winds heavily damaged the village of Ras Madrakah. Considered the worst storm in memory, the cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings, including damaging the roof of the <b>desalination</b> plant, leaving residents without water for several days. Strong winds of over 93km/h (58mph) knocked down 20trees in Rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings. Across the storm's track through Oman, the rains replenished water levels in aquifers, while also washing out roads and isolating villages. This lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work. The Jiddat al-Harasis desert was flooded for over a month due to the storm, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. The floods provided grazing for the endangered oryx population, although many livestock were killed. Three airports in the country were closed due to floods up to four days.|$|E
5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of desalinated water was interrupted, as both of Oman's <b>desalination</b> plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in oil exports. In the months after the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for Civil Defence set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as water and electricity were gradually restored, and people returned to their homes. By two weeks after the storm's passage, most of those remaining in shelters were from Qurayat, one of the most severely affected villages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Desalination,</b> which {{includes}} both <b>desalination</b> of sea water and <b>desalination</b> of brackish water, {{is another important}} non-conventional water resource for Jordan. The key project for sea water <b>desalination</b> is the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal project which {{is yet to be}} completed. The most important plant for <b>desalination</b> of brackish water is the Ma'in-Mujib system which supplies water to Amman.|$|E
25|$|<b>Desalination</b> is {{a process}} that {{extracts}} mineral components from saline water. More generally, <b>desalination</b> refers to the removal of salts and minerals from a target substance, as in soil <b>desalination,</b> which is an issue for agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Kuwait {{relies on}} water <b>desalination</b> {{as a primary}} source of fresh water for {{drinking}} and domestic purposes. There are currently more than six <b>desalination</b> plants. Kuwait was the first {{country in the world}} to use <b>desalination</b> to supply water for large scale domestic use. The history of <b>desalination</b> in Kuwait dates back to 1951 when the first distillation plant was commissioned.|$|E
25|$|Factors that {{determine}} the costs for <b>desalination</b> include capacity {{and type of}} facility, location, feed water, labor, energy, financing and concentrate disposal. <b>Desalination</b> stills control pressure, temperature and brine concentrations to optimize efficiency. Nuclear-powered <b>desalination</b> might be economical on a large scale.|$|E
25|$|The current {{trend in}} dual-purpose {{facilities}} is hybrid configurations, {{in which the}} permeate from reverse osmosis <b>desalination</b> is mixed with distillate from thermal <b>desalination.</b> Basically, two or more <b>desalination</b> processes are combined along with power production. Such facilities have been implemented in Saudi Arabia at Jeddah and Yanbu.|$|E
25|$|Geothermal energy {{can drive}} <b>desalination.</b> In most locations, {{geothermal}} <b>desalination</b> beats using scarce groundwater or surface water, environmentally and economically.|$|E
25|$|Carlsbad {{is home to}} the nation's largest <b>desalination</b> plant. Construction of the $1 billion Carlsbad <b>Desalination</b> Plant at the Encina Power Plant was {{completed}} in December 2015.|$|E
25|$|Saltwater is desalinated {{to produce}} water {{suitable}} {{for human consumption}} or irrigation. One by-product of <b>desalination</b> is salt. <b>Desalination</b> is used on many seagoing ships and submarines. Most of the modern interest in <b>desalination</b> is focused on cost-effective provision of fresh water for human use. Along with recycled wastewater, {{it is one of the}} few rainfall-independent water sources.|$|E
25|$|Estimates {{vary widely}} between 15,000–20,000 <b>desalination</b> plants {{producing}} more than 20,000m3/day. Micro <b>desalination</b> plants operate near almost every natural gas or fracking facility {{found in the}} United States.|$|E
25|$|Water {{resources}} in Israel consist of conventional water resources (surface water, groundwater) and non-conventional water {{resources in}}cluding the reuse of treated wastewater (reclaimed water), seawater <b>desalination</b> and the <b>desalination</b> of brackish water.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the Israeli {{facilities}} of Hadera, Palmahim, Ashkelon, and Sorek were desalinizing {{water for}} less than US$0.40 per cubic meter. As of 2006, Singapore was desalinating water for US$0.49 per cubic meter. The city of Perth began operating a reverse osmosis seawater <b>desalination</b> plant in 2006. A <b>desalination</b> plant now operates in Sydney, and the Wonthaggi <b>desalination</b> plant was under construction in Wonthaggi, Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Floating <b>desalination.</b> <b>Desalination</b> barges have {{operated}} since 2008 to meet high seasonal demand for potable water along the Red Sea {{coast of the}} Kingdom. In 2010 the largest floating <b>desalination</b> plant in the world, with a production capacity of 25,000 m3/day (9 million m3/year), was launched on a barge in Yanbu. It is sufficient to supply a city with more than 100,000 inhabitants with drinking water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Desalination</b> of {{seawater}} {{is expected}} to become {{more important in the}} future through a long-planned regional <b>desalination</b> plant that would provide desalinated water using the piped water network throughout the entire Gaza strip. For over 20 years, a major <b>desalination</b> plant for Gaza has been discussed. The Palestinian Water Authority has approved a $500 million facility. Israel supports it and has quietly begun to offer Palestinians <b>desalination</b> training. In 2012 the French government committed a 10 million-euro grant for the plant. Arab countries, coordinated by the Islamic Development Bank, committed to provide half of the necessary funds, matching an expected European financial commitment. The European Investment Bank provides technical assistance.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a <b>desalination</b> {{facility}} with {{a capacity of}} 54,800m3/d–82,200m3/d is planned in the Western Galilee. In Nitzanim in southern Israel, a plan is being studied for increasing {{the size of the}} 9,600m3/d <b>desalination</b> plant.|$|E
25|$|Seawater <b>desalination,</b> {{which already}} {{is used in}} some resorts on the Red Sea, {{is also likely to}} become an {{increasingly}} important source for municipal water supply in coastal areas of Egypt. For example, in October 2009 the West Delta Electricity Production Company awarded a contract for a power plant with a 10,000 m3/day seawater <b>desalination</b> plant near Alexandria. Brackish water <b>desalination</b> for irrigation may also become more important.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} is currently looking into seawater <b>desalination</b> {{as a national}} priority to adapting to decreasing water availability. Peru's Government in planning a US$1.5 billion investment to build two <b>desalination</b> plants on Lima's coast to supply water to 1.5 million people.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, the South Australian {{government}} {{announced it would}} build a seawater <b>desalination</b> plant {{for the city of}} Adelaide, Australia, located at Port Stanvac. The <b>desalination</b> plant was to be funded by raising water rates to achieve full cost recovery.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{approximately}} 100 industrial <b>desalination</b> {{plants were}} operational. Due to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, {{the import of}} spare parts – essential to operate the <b>desalination</b> plants of industry, communities and households – as well as necessary chemicals, is problematic.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{the first}} reverse osmosis <b>desalination</b> plant in Israel opened in Eilat. In 2002, under {{the impact of}} drought, the Government {{approved}} the construction of large seawater <b>desalination</b> plants along the Mediterranean coast. These installations would supply 305 million m3/yr of desalinated water by the year 2010 and 500 million m³/yr by 2015. By mid-2008 two of the new plants with a capacity of 130 million m3/yr were in operation. In parallel to the <b>desalination</b> program the cabinet also decided to promote water savings activities that could reduce household water use by at least 10 percent. In 2012, the Ashkelon <b>Desalination</b> Plant was converting 15,000 to 16,000 cubic meters of seawater to fresh water every hour, supplying 15 percent of Israel's annual water supply.|$|E
25|$|Nanotube {{membranes}} {{of higher}} permeability than {{current generation of}} membranes may lead to eventual reduction in the footprint of RO <b>desalination</b> plants. It has also been suggested {{that the use of}} such membranes will lead to reduction in the energy needed for <b>desalination.</b>|$|E
