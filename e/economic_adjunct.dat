40|$|Renal failure {{affects a}} wide global population; while {{acute renal failure}} may be {{reversed}} given prompt treatment, chronic renal failure often degenerates to end stage renal disease (ESRD). Dialysis is the main treatment modality for renal failure, but its long term use is associated with complications leading to morbidity and mortality events. In this thesis, a safe, <b>economic</b> and convenient <b>adjunct</b> consisting of microencapsulated active agents is formulated for oral administration. Probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria longum were metabolically induced for urea uptake, and the better adapted bacterium microencapsulated with activated charcoal in a calcium-alginate matrix with a chitosan membrane. The efficacy of the microcapsules was tested in-vitro in a simulated gastric media containing uremic analytes similar to pathological levels in ESRD patients. Results showed {{that the combination of}} probiotic bacteria and adsorbent not only trap uremic toxins such as creatinine and urea, but also, activated charcoal offer support in preserving the viability of the live bacterial cells in the gastric transit as well as in storage conditions for over a month...|$|R
