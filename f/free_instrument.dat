Characteristic features of the velocity and temperature fields in the Florida Current are isolated and discussed on the basis of time-averaged <b>free</b> <b>instrument</b> data obtained during approximately 40 transacts across the current at four separate sections during 1965 - 1966. The sections, from Marathon - Cay Sal Bank t 0 o Ft. Pierce - Matanilla Shoal, encompass a 225 km downstream distance within the Florida Straits. The dominant feature is a downstream acceleration of the subsurface current, associated with the convergent downstream cross-sectional area of the Straits. A uniaxial surface current and the cross-stream component of the subsurface current are also intimately linked with the convergence and divergence of the cross-channel width. The mass field adjusts to changes in current velocity as would be anticipated from Bernoulli's Equation.

40|$|The Geological Survey of Canada has {{designed}} {{a new type}} of low-cost strong motion seismometer and is currently updating its strong motion seismic network with the new instruments. As of January 2004 about fifty instruments are in operation in Southwestern British Columbia and in a dense urban demonstration network in the cities of Vancouver and Richmond. With a noise floor of 0. 5 mg (with g beeing the earth’s acceleration) and a range of +- 4 g over a frequency band 0 - 42 Hz the instrument is ideally suited for urban strong motion networks. The instrument can also be fitted with external velocity sensors for use in studies of building structural dynamics. Continuous full waveform data are recorded and stored in an internal ring-buffer by each instrument. Data can be retrieved with standard Internet protocols like FTP and SSH/SCP at any time. Parametric data such as peak ground acceleration (PGA), velocity (PGV) and spectral intensity (PSI) from an event as measured by an individual instrument are reported in near real time and are used to generate an experimental shake-map as a tool for emergency response agencies.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to provide}} a series of static and dynamic models of competitive multi-instrument, multi-sector, and multi-currency financial equilibrium which will yield the optimal composition of assets and liabilities in the portfolio of every sector of each country. The equilibrium market prices of every instrument in each currency, as well as the equilibrium exchange rate prices for each currency are also obtained. In addition, market imperfections such as taxes, transaction costs, price policy interventions, and the presence of financial hedging instruments, are taken into consideration. ^ The models presented here are based on the fundamental economic theory of finance, and relax many of the assumptions that much of the literature is based upon. For example, {{there is no need for}} a risk <b>free</b> <b>instrument</b> or a global portfolio, and all sectors in the economy do not have to share homogeneous expectations on prices. In the contrary, heterogeneity of opinions plays a critical role on the determination of the asset allocation as well as in the price derivation. Moreover, sectors do not hold the same amount of capital, and are not subjected to the same type of transaction costs and taxes, since the models under consideration have the ability to impose taxes and transaction costs that depend both on the identity of a sector and on the type of an instrument. Moreover, the monetary authorities of each country (or currency) have the ability to apply different price floors and ceilings on every instrument so that they can control the market according to their strategies. ^ All the models as well as the computational methods suggested here are based on the methodologies of finite-dimensional variational inequality theory for the exploration of statics and equilibrium states, and on projected dynamical systems theory for the study of dynamics and disequilibrium behavior. Simultaneously, visualization and formulation of financial problems as network flow problems provide one with the opportunity of applying network-based algorithms, coupled with the aforementioned methodologies, for computational purposes. ^ The models presented here are accompanied by a detailed qualitative analysis that provides conditions of existence and uniqueness of equilibrium patterns as well as general sensitivity analysis results. ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Coherence scanning interferometry (CSI) is a non-contacting optical technique which is widely used for the measurement of surface topography. CSI combines the lateral resolution of a high power microscope with the axial resolution of an interferometer. As with any other metrology instrument, CSI is calibrated to define measurement uncertainty. The traditional calibration procedure, as recommended by instrument manufacturers, consists of calibration of the axial and lateral scales of the instrument. Although calibration in this way provides uncertainties for the measurement of rectilinear artefacts, it does not give information about tilt-related uncertainty. If an object with varying slope is measured, significant errors are observed as the surface gradient increases. In this thesis a novel approach of calibration and adjustment for CSI using a spherical object is introduced. This new technique is based on three dimensional linear filtering theory. According to linear theory, smooth surface measurement in CSI can be represented as a linear filtering operation, where the filter is characterised either by point spread function (PSF) in space domain or by transfer function (TF) in spatial frequency domain. The derivation of these characteristics usually involves making the Born approximation, which is strictly only applicable for weakly scattering objects. However, for the case of surface scattering and making use of the Kirchhoff approximation, the system can be considered linear if multiple scattering {{is assumed to be}} negligible. In this case, the object is replaced by an infinitely thin foil-like object, which follows the surface topography and, therefore, is called the foil model of the surface. For an ideal aberration <b>free</b> <b>instrument,</b> the linear characteristics are determined by the numerical aperture of the objective lens and the bandwidth of the source. However, it is found that the PSF and TF of a commercial instrument can depart significantly from theory and result in a significant measurement error. A new method, based on modified inverse filter to compensate the phase and amplitude-related errors in the system PSF/TF, is demonstrated. Finally, a method based on de-warping to compensate distortion is discussed. The application of the linear theory as well as modified inverse filter is dependent on the assumption of the shift invariance. As distortion introduces a field dependent magnification, the presence of distortion for CSI with relatively large field of view, restricts the applicability of the linear theory. Along with this restriction, distortion also introduces erroneous height measurement for objects with gradients. This new approach, based on de-warping, resolves the problems associated with distortion...|$|E
