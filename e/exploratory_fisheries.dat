40|$|The marine {{resources}} of the Antarctic region are of global significance. In managing Southern Ocean {{marine resources}}, especially fisheries, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has adopted principles that aim: to balance harvesting and conservation; to protect the needs of dependent species, and to avoid changes that are irreversible in 20 - 30 years. CCAMLR has pioneered ecosystem approaches to fishery and environmental management, through the incorporation of precaution and uncertainty into its management procedures and by establishing an ecosystem monitoring programme using indicator species and processes. This pioneering application of precautionary and ecosystem approaches {{in the management of}} harvesting has met with some success, notably in applying conservative yield models for toothfish and krill stocks and in establishing strict rules for undertaking new and <b>exploratory</b> <b>fisheries.</b> However, toothfish management has been recently compromised by Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing which is driven by forces outside the Southern Ocean. Southern Ocean harvestable resources are also subject to other global forces such as environmental changes, and their management systems remain very vulnerable to rapid shifts in worldwide fishery economics, and to inadequate management in adjacent areas, particularly high seas. CCAMLR needs quickly to develop the basis of more flexible and effective management to cater for rapid shifts in capacity and demand. The complementary task, however, is to raise the management standard of other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) to those of CCAMLR if global high seas marine resources are to be sustainable {{for the rest of this}} century...|$|E
40|$|The cruise is a {{contribution}} to SEAFO resulting from a co-operation between SEAFO, the EAF-Nansen project, and the FAO Deep-sea programme. The aim is to facilitate activities {{in support of the}} efforts by RFMOs to meet objectives in relation to the United Nations General Asssembly (UNGA) resolution 61 / 105 and the associated FAO Guidelines on Bottom Fisheries in the high seas. Furthermore, the southeastern Atlantic ABNJ was selected by the recently initiated GEF-sponsored FAO ABNJ programme (“Common Oceans”) as an area of particular attention, involving the relevant RFMO with competent to regulate bottom fishing in that region is the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO). Despite a shortage of data on the occurrence of ‘vulnerable marine ecosystems’ (VMEs, as defined in the FAO Guidelines), SEAFO has introduced comprehensive measures to protect such ecosystems from significant adverse impacts within the convention area. The convention area consist of agreed limited ‘existing fishing areas’, i. e. areas were fisheries were conducted within a recent reference period, and more extensive ‘new fishing areas’ where this was not the case. Commercial harvesting is essentially restricted to the ‘existing fishing areas’, but further regulated by other measures such as species-specific TACs, gear restrictions and other measures aimed to conserve e. g. sharks. To conduct <b>exploratory</b> <b>fisheries</b> in ‘new fishing areas’ parties need to submit a notification and detailed plan and report to the Organization for approval. SEAFO has furthermore closed 10 subareas of the convention area to all fishing activity, a regulation most recently revised in 2011. Best available bathymetry data were compiled to locate subareas recognised in the FAO guidelines as VME features, essentially primarily seamounts. As fishing is restricted to the upper 2000 m of any feature, a map of areas shallower than 2000 m was the basis of further selection. In SEAFO such areas are seamounts or seamount complexes of various sizes and shapes. The spatial distribution of VME indicators such as corals and sponges (i. e. as given in FAO guidelines) is not well known in SEAFO, but the benthic and pelagic biogeographical patterns have been described. It was therefore decided to close 10 potential fishing areas that represented the range of features and the major biogeographical zones of the region. Some of these were actual fishing areas; others were either not fished or lightly fished. The end result was the set of ten closures with various shapes and sizes, ranging from single seamounts to rather wider areas comprising several seamounts or mid-Atlantic Ridge segments. While SEAFO took significant steps to ensure conservation of VMEs, the shortage of information on the distribution patterns of VME indicators remains unsatisfactory. Some new data were acquired by recent fishing experiments in existing and new fishing areas, and by Spanish-Namibian research activity on the Valdivia Bank. However, even within the relatively restricted actual fishing areas, the documentation remains scattered and limited. Similarly, the Scientific Committee of SEAFO struggles with data shortage on the fish resources actually harvested in the convention area, primarily Patagonian toothfish, pelagic armourhead, alfonsino, deep-sea red crab, and associated bycatch species. Stock assessments are generally highly uncertain and fully dependant on fisheries-generated data, hence conservation measures implemented by SEAFO remain largely precautionary rather than tuned to good estimates of abundances and productivity. Catches currently remain rather limited, i. e. collectively less than 1000 t, but some species are valuable and tend to attract interest from fishing parties that would value not only enhanced opportunities but also management based on more reliable stock assessments. This project thus aims to supplement and extend knowledge and databases on VME indicators as well as fisheries resources and will accordingly conduct targeted investigations in the currently used fishing areas of the convention area, primarily on the Walvis Ridge. In addition, some of the fishing closures will be visited to document presence-absence of VME indicators and describe distribution patterns. New data from these targeted studies will enhance the quality of fish stock assessments and help analyse the appropriateness of VME closures currently implemented solely based on feature characteristics and biogeographical affinity. Main conclusions: VMEs indicators were located in all seamounts prospected but differences in structure and development state were observed. In some seamounts coral rubble, sediment-clogged, mostly dead coral framework and living coral framework were observed from the base to the summit all along the slope. Current system associated to each seamount, depth and probably other depth-dependent environmental factors driven the presence and development of deep-water reefs. Continuous research efforts are needed to increase knowledge about biodiversity and structure. Understanding their dynamics will improve effective management and conservation of this vulnerable ecosystems. FAO, EAF-Nansen project / Deep-sea Norway projec...|$|E

40|$|This report {{utilizes}} {{a geographic}} information systems (GIS) modelling approach to simulate commercial groundfish trawling sponge by-catch {{in lieu of}} actual commercial observations {{within the confines of}} current management restrictions to fishing within the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization Regulatory Area (e. g., coral and sponge closed areas). Simulated trawl start locations (1500) were generated by using an aggregated 2008 - 2009 groundfishing effort raster asa probability surface. This effort surface was also used toset a heading for each of the lines following the direction corresponding to the maximum sum of effort. Combined and standardized sponge bycatch data from the Spanish and Canadian research vesseltrawls were used to create a by-catch sponge biomass surface. The model extracted the spongebiomass values to each line to calculate the total by-catch per line (kg). Artificially imposing a range of threshold values on simulated by-catch data showed very few simulated trawls (0. 4 %) would catch more than the 800 kg encounter threshold of sponge under current management conditions. The percentage of simulated trawls above the imposed range ofthreshold values does not start to increase quickly until the threshold was between ~ 30 and 50 kg. At 50 kg of simulated by-catch, only 5. 5 % of simulated tows would be affected and could be easily avoided as the areas impacted are localized. If the current encounter threshold for sponges was reduced from 800 kg to between 30 and 50 kg per tow it is unlikely to have a large effect on the commercial fishery within the fishing footprint and would serve as a more effective sponge conservation measure in un-fished areas under an <b>exploratory</b> <b>fishery.</b> Versión de edito...|$|R

40|$|During 1994 – 96, an {{experimental}} longline fishery for tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) {{was carried out}} in the Nuevo Gulf of northern Patagonia and, in the summers of 2000 – 2001 and 2002, three boats conducted an <b>exploratory</b> commercial <b>fishery</b> for this species, accompanied by a scientific monitoring program. This paper summarizes the results of these fishing trials, and provides information on the biology of tope shark. Catches were highest from February to April, when tope shark represented 36 % of the total fish caught, and elephant fish (Callorhynchus callorhynchus) and argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) accounted for 33 % and 23 %, respectively. Tope shark arriving in northern Patagonian waters during the summer are primarily mature males, immature and maturing females in their first and second non-gravid year. No gravid females were caught. These fish are part of the South-western Atlantic stock, which shows signs of over-exploitation, so we suggest that any longline fishery in Patagonia should remain on a small scale.

40|$|Tuna are of {{significant}} global economic importance and a prime food source. Increased levels of fishing {{have resulted in}} many stocks being under threat {{and a number of}} species are considered to be overfished. The South African tuna industry has had limited management attention from the South African fisheries management agency. A recent development has been {{an increase in the number}} of tuna caught by small vessels that target the fresh tuna market in South Africa and overseas. This has highlighted the importance of developing a holistic management plan for the sector and creating an awareness, among vessel owners, of the importance of compliance with initiatives such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). The South African tuna fishery comprises three sectors: baitboat, sport and longline, all of which are currently in need of acquiring more biological and fisheries data. This project was initiated to collate existing information and to collect additional information where possible. This encompassed a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the size and shape of the tuna fishing industry, which included estimates of total catch, effort, catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) and stock structure (obtained through comparative estimates of age and growth), as well as socio-economic and economic information. A technique involving an examination of specific vertebrae was used to obtain age-growth information for T. albacares. These data were used to estimate von Bertalanffy (VBGF) growth parameters: F 2 1., k 0. 1, and t₀ - 0. 1 year. No significant differences in growth parameters were found in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) from different localities around the South African coast, i. e. from the south eastern Atlantic and the south western Indian Ocean. In addition, growth did not differ between South Africa and other regions (Draganic and Pelzcarski 1984, Fonteneau 1980, Gascuel et al. 1992, LeGuen and Sakagawa 1973, Lehodey and Leroy 1999, Lessa and Duarte-Neto 2004, Shuford et al. 2007, Stequert et al. 1996, Wild 1986, Yang et al. 1969). Further substantiation of the above-mentioned observations was found by recording differences in the sizes of fish caught in the inshore (baitboat and sport fishery vessels) and offshore (large pelagic longline vessels) sectors of South African tuna fisheries. A significant difference between the regions — in terms of the size of fish caught inshore — was noted, with mostly-juvenile fish being caught in KwaZulu-Natal (5. 4 ± 3. 5 kg), sub-adult fish in the Eastern Cape (26. 2 ± 13. 4 kg), and adult fish in the Western Cape (42. 3 ± 14. 4 kg). Since mostly-adult fish were caught offshore by longliners, with no significant differences between regions, it is however possible th at adult fish predominantly inhabit the offshore region. Yellowfin tuna caught by the large pelagic longline fishery in the three managerial zones (A, B and C) were predominantly adult fish of similar size, namely Zone A: 38. 9 ± 6. 9 kg; Zone B: 28. 7 ± 4. 6 kg, and Zone C: 36. 0 ± 5. 1 kg. The recreational ski boat sport fishery has remained stable, in terms of participation, consisting mostly of white middle aged males in the top 25 % of household income distribution, having either permanent occupational status or being retired. Fishers within this sector are willing to incur great expense to partake in the fishery and they provide an important economic contribution to coastal towns, particularly in the Eastern Cape. The total catch (of 83 t) of yellowfin tuna by the competitive sport fishery within the Western and Eastern Cape regions was considerably lower than that of commercial tuna baitboat catches, which amounted to 186 t, and the large pelagic longline sector that caught t in 200. It is however likely that the competitive sport fishery's total yellowfin tuna catch (of 83 t in 2009) of the Eastern and Western Cape competitive sport fishery was considerably less than the total yellowfin tuna catches of the whole South African deep-sea sport fishery. Longfin tuna are the primary target species of South Africa‘s baitboat fisheries, comprising an average of 86 % of the total catch and generating ZAR 49 million in employment income in 2002. South Africa was responsible for 20 % of the total longfin tuna annual yield in 2004 in the southern Atlantic Ocean, behind Taiwan with 59 %. However, yellowfin tuna only contributes a small percentage towards total catches (8. 4 ± 8. 2 % between 1995 and 2009), generating ZAR 1. 3 million in employment income in 2002. Of the four vessel categories comprising the tuna baitboat fishery, ski boats had the highest yellowfin tuna CPUE in 2009 (117 ± 62 kg. vessel⁻¹. day⁻¹) and the lowest effort. The ski boats sector is the most opportunistic fishery as they are only active when either longfin or yellowfin tuna are in high abundance. At such times catches are guaranteed, so can be expected to offset expenses. In 2009 the CPUE for yellowfin tuna for 15 – 19 m vessels and freezer deckboats was 12 ± 20 kg. vessel⁻¹. day⁻¹ and 3 ± 6 kg. vessel⁻¹. day⁻¹, respectively. These vessels specifically target longfin tuna when they are in abundance. Since the start of the tuna baitboat fishery in 1995, there has been a substantial increase in the number of new entrants. In 2002 this sector had a fleet size of 82 vessels with a capital value of ZAR 163 million and a total employment income of ZAR 58 million, employing 2 173 fishers, of which 87 % were black African. The commercial tuna baitboat fleet has subsequently grown to 200 vessels and 3600 crew, with 110 active vessels fishing for a combined fleet average of 46 days per year. There are a high number of owner-operated vessels. Since 2007 the fishery's profit to cost ratio has been low due to the low abundance of tuna stocks off the coast of South Africa, which has resulted in poor catch returns, placing economic pressure on the fishery. The baitboat industry is a low-profit-margin fishery with a total net catch value worth ZAR 90 million in 2009 (Feike 2010). The abundance of yellowfin tuna influences profit margins, with very high profits being made when abundance and catches are high. The large pelagic longline fishery has a total allowable effort of 43 vessels of which only 30 vessels fished during 2009, when a reported 766 t of yellowfin tuna were caught, representing a total tonnage far in excess of that obtained by the combined effort of the baitboat and sport fishery. It is, however, assumed that considerable underreporting of catches takes place within this fishery, which means that the estimated total net catch value of ZAR 100 million could, in fact, be much higher. Such underreporting of catches is of great concern for this fishery, as is the high bycatch of Chondricthians spp. that significantly outweighs imposed regulatory limits (DEAT 2007). The present study demonstrates the current lack of comprehensive catch and effort data for the sport, baitboat and longline fisheries as well as the serious limitations and flaws associated with current databases. Results from the present study have drawn attention to a number of high-priority research needs, as outlined below. (1) A major lack of comprehensive catch and effort data for the sport fishery, which can be rectified by focussing on obtaining more competition data, as well as high-quality catch and effort and socio-economic information, as opposed to relying on information from non-club anglers (Gartside et al. 1999, Williams 2003, Cass-Calay 2008). Acquisition of such data is relatively inexpensive: the location of organized clubs and their frequent competition meetings provide widespread coverage along the Southern African coastline. Such data acquisition efforts have the potential to provide reliable information on spatial catch trends. (2) Validation of vessel catch return data is required for commercial fisheries and on some recent data that has emerged from studies of catch rates and trends for target species, particularly in the longline fishery. In this context it should be noted that the most recent peer-reviewed publications on this <b>exploratory</b> <b>fishery</b> were published more than a decade ago (Kroese 1999, Penny and Griffiths 1999). Additional studies need to be undertaken and journal articles published on the current stock status of South African catches of yellowfin and bigeye tuna and swordfish...|$|R
