Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the minor}} league team that last held Jim Thorpe's {{contract}} had disbanded in 1910, {{he found himself}} in the rare position of being a sought-after free agent at the major league level during the era of the reserve clause, and thus <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> of baseball teams for which to play. In January1913, he turned down a starting position with the American League cellar-dwelling St. Louis Browns, choosing instead to join the 1912National League champion New York Giants, who, with Thorpe playing in 19 of their 151games, would repeat as the 1913National League champions. Immediately following the Giants' October loss in the 1913 World Series, Thorpe and the Giants joined the Chicago White Sox for a world tour. Barnstorming across the United States and then around the world, Thorpe was the celebrity of the tour. Thorpe's presence increased the publicity, attendance and gate receipts for the tour. He met with Pope Pius X and Abbas II Hilmi Bey (the last Khedive of Egypt), and played before 20,000 people in London including King George V.|$|E
5|$|The {{first wave}} of forced {{conversions}} in the Crown of Aragon happened during the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. Rebellion bearing an anti-Muslim sentiment broke out among the Christian subjects of Valencia in the early 1520s, and those active in it forced Muslims to become Christians in the territories they controlled. Muslims joined the Crown in suppressing the rebellion, playing crucial roles in several battles. After the rebellion was suppressed, the Muslims regarded the conversions forced by the rebels as invalid and returned to their faith. Subsequently, King Charles I (also known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) started an investigation to determine {{the validity of the}} conversions. The commission tasked with this investigation started working in November 1524. Charles ultimately upheld the conversions, putting the forcibly converted subjects under the authority of the Inquisition. Supporters of this decision argued that the Muslims <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> when confronted by the rebels: they could have chosen to refuse and die, but did not, indicating that the conversions happened out of free will and must remain in effect.|$|E
50|$|Ernst Zermelo (1904) {{introduced}} choice {{functions as}} well as the axiom of choice (AC) and proved the well-ordering theorem, which states that every set can be well-ordered.

However, in the absence of either AC or ACω, some sets can still be shown to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> function.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} how <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> of health plans, HMO enrollment, and health status affect {{the use of}} preventive services.

Individuals who do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> of plans but are enrolled in HMOs are more likely to use preventive services than are individuals who choose HMOs.

25|$|Dedekind's second {{contribution}} is his proof of Cantor's second theorem.

25|$|Cantor's {{article also}} {{contains}} a proof {{of the existence of}} transcendental numbers. As early as 1930, mathematicians have disagreed on whether this proof is constructive or non-constructive. Books as recent as 2014 and 2015 indicate that this disagreement has not been resolved. Since Cantor's proof either constructs transcendental numbers or does not, an analysis of his article can determine whether his proof is constructive or non-constructive. Cantor's correspondence with Richard Dedekind shows the development of his ideas and reveals that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> between two proofs, one that uses the uncountability of the real numbers and one that does not.|$|E
