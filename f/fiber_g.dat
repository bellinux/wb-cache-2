40|$|Background: Bariatric {{surgery is}} {{considered}} the most effective immediate weight loss method for the morbidly obese, despite widely reported weight regain after a few years. Appetite, satiety and satiation control are essential to maintaining a long-term result post-surgery. Dietary fatty acids composition may be implicated in the satiety. As flaxseed is a food high in linolenic acid, we aimed to verify the influence of flaxseed fat on appetite and satiety of women after bariatric surgery. Material and methods: Six women who underwent bariatric surgery at least 2 years before participated in a single-blind crossover trial that compared the effect of two isocaloric meals on satiety, one containing whole golden flaxseed (high in polyunsaturated fatty acids and <b>fiber)</b> (<b>G</b> 1) and another withdefatted flaxseed (high in <b>fiber)</b> (<b>G</b> 2), with one week of washout period. This variable was estimated by visual analogue scales in both meals at baseline (T 0), immediately after ingestion (T 1) and 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the meal (T 60, T 120 and T 180). Fasting anthropometric, body composition, laboratory tests (glucose and lipids) and dietary variables, were evaluated while fasting. Results: The volunteers were obese and had excess central adiposity, even {{after two years of}} surgery and still showed habitual fibre intake below recommended levels. G 1 had reduced hunger after 180 minutes compared to G 2 (P=. 046). Other parameters related to appetite and satiety did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Less hunger was observed after 180 minutes in whole golden flaxseed meal compared with the defatted flaxseed meal, indicating that the whole golden flaxseed meal, possibly, supports obesity treatment in the long-term after bariatric surgery by controlling appetite and satiety sensations. </p...|$|E

Hour-glass shaped samples were obtained and submitted to a micro-tensile bond test. The bond strength data were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA), complemented by Tukey`s test (P <= 0. 05). The samples of sound dentine presented higher bond strengths than did samples of caries-affected dentine, except for the groups treated with the Er,Cr:YSGG laser. The highest bond strengths were observed with the sound dentine treated with burs and Carisolv. The bond strengths to caries-affected dentine were similar in all groups. Additionally, bonding to caries-affected dentine of the Er,Cr:YSGG laser and Carisolv groups was similar to bonding to caries-infected dentine. Thus, caries-affected dentine is not an adequate substrate for adhesion.

Adobe is a sustainable material but has limitations of building smaller room sizes and requires frequent maintenance {{which is not}} suitable for modern lifestyle. These become main reasons for rejection of adobe as a building material. Initial investigation comprising of water content analysis, specific gravity analysis, grain size analysis, plastic limit and liquid limit analysis, maximum dry density check reveals that soil is sand clay and its low compressive strength shall be increased for enhancing its sustainability. For this purpose, stabilization with natural fibers of Pinus roxburghii and Grewia optiva in 0. 5 %, 1 %, 1. 5 % and 2 % proportions is proposed.

The construction of these groups is straightforward; to an algebra B we assign the quotient R,,, G,/G,. The main effort comes in showing that these are the only possibilities. The key to this, and the basic technical idea in the paper, is the use of N&on blow-ups of group schemes over valuation rings.

The inner product on the cotangent space of infinitesimal deformations of M defines an invariant distance and volume form, or functional integration measure on the full configuration space. Then, by a simple change of coordinates parameterizing the gauge <b>fiber</b> <b>G,</b> the functional measure on the coset space M/ G is deduced. This change of integration variables leads to a Jacobian which is entirely equivalent to the Faddeev-Popov determinant of the more traditional gauge fixed approach in non-abelian gauge theory. If the general construction {{is applied to the}} case where G is the group of coordinate reparametrizations of spacetime, the continuum functional integral over geometries, i. e. metrics modulo coordinate reparameterizations may be defined. The invariant functional integration measure is used to derive the trace anomaly and effective action for the conformal part of the metric in two and four dimensional spacetime. In two dimensions this approach generates the Polyakov-Liouville action of closed bosonic non-critical string theory. In four dimensions the corresponding effective action leads to novel conclusions on the importance of quantum effects in gravity in the far infrared, and in particular, a dramatic modification of the classical Einstein theory at cosmological distance scales, signaled first by the quantum instability of classical de Sitter spacetime. Finite volume scaling relations for the functional integral of quantum gravity in two and four dimensions are derived, and comparison with the discretized dynamical triangulation approach to the integration over geometries are discussed.

A high estradiol level has been associated with higher risk of breast carcinogenesis. Objective To evaluate the influence of dietary factors on serum estradiol concentration {{in adolescent}} girls. Methods A community-based survey was conducted in female junior high school students in Jakarta from January 2014 to January 2015. Nutritional intake was assessed by semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), which included the intake of total energy (kcal), carbohydrate (g), protein (g), fat (g), <b>fiber</b> (<b>g),</b> and phytoestrogen (g). Based on the Indonesian recommended daily allowance (RDA), energy and nutrient intakes were categorized as minimal (< 70 %), low (70 - 99. 9 %), normal (100 - 129. 9 %), and high (≥ 130 %). Serum estradiol levels were measured during the follicular phase using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results A total of 189 girls aged 13 - 15 years were enrolled from 8 junior high schools across the municipalities of Jakarta. Twenty-eight (14. 8 %) subjects were overweight or obese. Median estradiol level was 41. 83 (range 13. 14 - 136. 5) pg/mL. Serum estradiol level was significantly correlated with energy, protein, and fat intake. Estradiol level was also significantly associated with carbohydrate (P= 0. 030) and fat (P= 0. 036) intake status. Multivariate analysis revealed that intake of energy, protein, and fat, as well as body mass index (BMI) were independent predictors of estradiol levels. However, due to its importance as energy source, we included carbohydrate intake in the final equation to predict estradiol level as follows: E 2 = 60. 723 – 0. 053 (energy) + 0. 185 (carbohydrate) + 0. 483 (protein) + 0. 491 (fat) – 1. 081 (BMI). Conclusion Serum estradiol levels in adolescent girls aged 13 - 15 years are influenced by diet, especially fat intake. Estradiol levels can be predicted from energy, carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake, as well as BMI. [Paediatr Indones. 2016; 56 : 134 - 8. ]...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass {{to avoid}} rapid gastric emptying, dumping {{syndrome}} and regained weight due to possible dilation of the gastric pouch, was proposed {{to place a}} ring around the gastric pouch. AIM: To compare weight loss, consumption of macronutrients {{and the frequency of}} vomiting among patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with and without the placement of a constriction ring around the pouch. METHOD: A retrospective study, in which an analysis of medical records was carried out, collecting data of two groups of patients: those who underwent the operation with the placement of a constriction ring (Ring Group) and those who underwent without the placement of a ring (No-Ring Group). The food intake data were analyzed using three 24 -hour recalls collected randomly in postoperative nutritional accompaniment. Data on the percentage of excess weight loss and the occurrence of vomiting were collected using the weight corresponding to the most recent report at the time of data collection. RESULTS: Medical records of 60 patients were analyzed: 30 from the Ring Group (women: 80 %) and 30 from the No-Ring Group (women: 87 %). The average time since the Ring Group underwent the operation was 88 &# 177; 17. 50 months, and for the No-Ring Group 51 &# 177; 15. 3 months. The percentage of excess weight loss did not differ between the groups. The consumption of protein (g), protein/kg of weight, %protein and <b>fiber</b> (<b>g)</b> were higher in the No-Ring Group.

40|$|We {{say that}} a metrizable space M is a Krasinkiewicz space if any map from a metrizable compactum X into M can be {{approximated}} by Krasinkiewicz maps (a map g X→ M is Krasinkiewicz provided every continuum in X is either contained in a <b>fiber</b> of <b>g</b> or contains a component of a <b>fiber</b> of <b>g).</b> In this paper we establish the following property of Krasinkiewicz spaces: Let f X→ Y be a perfect map between metrizable spaces and M a Krasinkiewicz complete ANR-space. If Y is a countable union of closed finite-dimensional subsets, then the function space C(X,M) with the source limitation topology contains a dense G_δ-subset of maps g such that all restrictions g|f^- 1 (y), y∈ Y, are Krasinkiewicz maps. The same conclusion remains true if M is homeomorphic to a closed convex subset of a Banach space and X is a C-space. Comment: 14 page...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this short}} note we give an {{elementary}} {{proof of the}} fact that connections and their geometric parallel-transport counterpart are equivalent notions. It is well known that a connection on a vector bundle over a manifold gives rise to a parametrization-independent parallel transport along (piecewise) smooth paths in the manifold. A converse of this result appears in the book of Walter Poor [2]. The definition of parallel transport used there is unnecessarily elaborate. In this note we adopt a more natural definition of parallel transport better suited to the “field theory ” paradigm and show how parallel transport gives rise to a connection. This fact seems to be known but we could not find it in print. We are aware of at least one other (unpublished) proof of this result due to Stephan Stolz. The applications of this theorem are quite surprising of which we will speak elsewhere. We formulate the result for connections on principal bundles but the reader can think of vector bundles instead of principal bundles if she prefers. Let Q be a principal G-bundle over a manifold M, with the <b>fiber</b> <b>G</b> a Lie group. Denote by P(M) the space of piecewise smooth paths in M. For a path γ in M, let i(γ) be the starting point of γ and e(γ) the ending point of γ. Consider the G-bundle QQ over M × M, whose fiber at (x,y) ∈ M × M is the space of G-invariant maps from Qx to Qy. Consider also the pullback bundle Q of the bundle QQ over M × M via the map P(M) − → M × M: γ ↦ → (i(γ),e(γ)). We define a parallel transport map associated to the bundle Q over M to be a section P of the bundle Q over P(M) that is the identity over constant paths, it is invariant under the action of the diffeomorphism group of intervals and is compatible with the diagram...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{give the}} proofs of some simple facts on parahoric subgroups and on Iwahori Weyl groups used in [H], [PR] and in [R]. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 11 E 95, 20 G 25; Secondary 22 E 20. Let G be a {{connected}} reductive group over a strictly henselian discretely valued field L. Kottwitz defines in [Ko] a functorial surjective homomorphism (1) κG: G(L) − → X ∗ (ˆ Z(G) I). Here I = Gal (¯ L/L) denotes the absolute Galois group of L. Let B be the Bruhat-Tits {{building of the}} adjoint group of G. Then G(L) operates on B. Definition 1. A parahoric subgroup of G(L) is a subgroup of the form KF = Fix (F) ∩ Ker κG, for a facet F of B. An Iwahori subgroup of G(L) is the parahoric subgroup associated to an alcove of B. Remark 2. If F ′ = gF, then KF ′ = gKF g − 1. In particular, since G(L) acts transitively {{on the set of}} all alcoves, all Iwahori subgroups are conjugate. We shall see presently that this definition coincides with the one of Bruhat and Tits [BTII], 5. 2. 6. They associate to a facet F in B a smooth group scheme GF over Spec OL with generic <b>fiber</b> <b>G</b> and the open subgroup G ◦ F of it with the same generic fiber and with connected special fiber, and define the parahoric subgroup attached to F as P ◦ F = G ◦ F (OL); from their definition it follows that P ◦ F ⊆ Fix(F). We denote by G(L) 1 the kernel of κG. For a facet F, let as above P ◦ F be the associated parahoric subgroup in the BT-sense. Our first goal is to prove the following proposition. Proposition 3. For any facet F in B, we have P ◦ F = KF...|$|E

This {{study was conducted to}} assess Food pattern and anthropometric indices of students in Kerman University of Medical Sciences. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 375 students (225 females, 150 males) with mean age of 20 ± 2. 5 years were selected by multistage cluster sampling method. Food pattern was determined using 24 -hour dietary recall questionnaire. Daily intake of energy and macronutrients, fiber and cholesterol were extracted by using nutritional software N 4 and compared with, DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) and RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowances). Weight, height, waist and hip circumferences were measured by standard instruments and methods and BMI and WHR were determined accordingly. Data analysis was performed using t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Mean daily intake of energy (Kcal), fat, Carbohydrate, protein (g), cholesterol (mg) and <b>fiber</b> (<b>g)</b> were respectively 2071 ± 584, 84 ± 29, 268 ± 80, 69 ± 22, 245 ± 126 and 16 ± 6. 8 in females and 2774 ± 638, 108 ± 27, 361 ± 95. 5, 97 ± 25. 5, 367 ± 185 and 19 ± 6. 3 in males. Mean daily intake of cholesterol in males was higher than the recommended amount. Mean daily intake of fiber was lower than adequate intake in both groups. The percentage of energy intake from fat sources was higher than the favorite amount in both groups. Mean BMI (Kg/m 2) and WHR were respectively 21. 6 ± 3. 1 and 0. 76 ± 0. 05 in females and 22. 1 ± 4. 3 and 0. 82 ± 0. 05 in males. A significant correlation was found between daily energy intake and WHR (r= 0. 25 and P= 0. 000). Conclusion: The daily diet composition of studied students is not balanced. Decrease of fat and increase of fiber consumption in both groups and reducing cholesterol intake in males for a balanced diet composition are recommended.

We show that the projectivization PT_d^* is compact and contractible; further, the shift locus in PT_d^* has a canonical locally finite simplicial structure.

40|$|The article {{provides}} {{a survey of}} (chiefly, theoretical) results obtained for self-trapped modes (solitons) in various models of one-dimensional optical waveguides based {{on a pair of}} parallel guiding cores, which combine the linear inter-core coupling with the intrinsic cubic (Kerr) nonlinearity, anomalous group-velocity dispersion, and, possibly, intrinsic loss and gain in each core. The survey is focused on three main topics: spontaneous breaking of the inter-core symmetry and the formation of asymmetric temporal solitons in dual-core fibers; stabilization of dissipative temporal solitons (essentially, in the model of a fiber laser) by a lossy core parallel-coupled to the main one, which carries the linear gain; and stability conditions for PT (parity-time) -symmetric solitons in the dual-core nonlinear dispersive coupler with mutually balanced linear gain and loss applied to the two cores.
