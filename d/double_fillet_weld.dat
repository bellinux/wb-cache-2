Important factors of innovation are the improvement in ntaterial and processes performances, coupled to the associated cost reduction. Titanium alloys, characterized by high mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, are particularly interesting for the aeronautical sector Their joining, from metal sheets with equal or different thicknesses, is mainly carried out by using laser or arc welding techniques. With the laser process, a high amount of energy is applied in a very limited area for a very short time, resulting in a reduced heat affected zone. With the arc welding, a large amount of heat is applied in a larger area for a longer time, obtaining a more extended heat affected zone. The combination of the process with high energy density (laser) with the high energy contribute (MIG) has been shown to enhance the beneficial effects of both processes (key-hole, ability to bridge sheet gap) while limiting their drawbacks (high thermal gradient, low mechanical resistance). In this paper, the hybrid Laser-MIG welding ofTi- 6 Al- 4 V was investigated. The welded joints were obtained from with 3 -mm thick sheets using the <b>double</b> <b>fillet</b> <b>welded</b> Tjoint.

40|$|<b>Fillet</b> <b>welding</b> {{is widely}} used in {{connections}} in civil engineering and marine structures. Thus, understanding the behavior of <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> under various types of loading is important, and numerical simulations can provide increased insight into this topic. This paper concerns finite element simulations of previous quasi-static and dynamic (impact) tests on <b>fillet</b> <b>welds.</b> The test specimens employed were structural steel components joined by either longitudinally or transversely oriented <b>fillet</b> <b>welds.</b> In the simulations, the material of the <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> was modeled using a shear-modified Gurson model, which accounts for material softening in both low and high stress triaxiality regimes. Additionally, strain rate and temperature dependencies were incorporated in the material model with a modified Johnson–Cook constitutive relation for the matrix material. Several types of material tests were conducted to identify the parameters entering the material model. For the quasi-static component tests and simulations, a good agreement was observed {{in terms of both}} force–deformation curves and failure mechanisms. The simulations of the dynamic tests predicted appreciably higher force levels and weld deformations at failure than those obtained in the corresponding experiments. A parameter study showed that these discrepancies may partly be due to inaccurate values used for the material parameters related to strain-rate hardening and thermal softening. Finally, a comparison was made between simulations with the shear-modified Gurson model and a simpler material model that does not account for void-induced softening. The simpler model employed the Cockcroft–Latham failure criterion, uncoupled from the constitutive relations. This model was unable to capture the response of the <b>fillet</b> <b>welds</b> to the same extent as the shear-modified Gurson model...|$|R

The two different fatigue life calculations methods yielded a different fatigue life for the weld toe, with inconclusive results regarding their conservatism. An increased weld toe radius gave a higher fatigue life for the weld toe, while the larger weld size increased the fatigue life in the weld root. Any weld size effect regarding fatigue life in the weld toe could not be established.
