5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s cracks had {{appeared}} in the wall built {{at the back of the}} Grosvenor Road End. The rear of the terracing was cordoned off, and the capacity of the ground reduced to under 13,500. The Grosvenor Road End was segregated and allocated to away supporters, and fencing was erected for the first time before the FA Cup match against Liverpool in February 1985. All the fencing had been dismantled by the early 2000s. During the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, problems had arisen in handling big crowds, due to the ground having only two of four sides available for entry and exit, and the home supporters <b>funnelling</b> through the car park to the Shipton Street End. Extensive improvements were made in the summer of 1985 for approximately £100,000, and eight new turnstiles were installed at the Shipton Street End. Further, the dressing rooms were refurbished to incorporate new baths and showers, and a new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's treatment room were readied. Hospitality boxes were built into the Main Stand during 1986–87, and video equipment was installed inside the ground. Crash barriers were strengthened, meaning ground safety requirements were met. These improvements meant that shortly before the Taylor Report was published, the ground's capacity was 14,109, including 3,059 seats. However, by September 1989, the capacity had been increased to 14,628.|$|E
5|$|Some large broad-winged birds rely on thermal {{columns of}} rising hot air {{to enable them}} to soar. These include many birds of prey such as vultures, eagles, and buzzards, but also storks. These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great {{difficulty}} crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the Strait of Messina, Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European honey buzzard Pernis apivorus, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause <b>funnelling,</b> particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck. Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth. Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains, hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi, Georgia. Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and harriers.|$|E

25|$|In Saint John {{the height}} {{difference}} from low to high tide is approximately 8 metres (28ft) {{due to the}} <b>funnelling</b> effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows.

25|$|Moncton grew rapidly {{during the}} early part of the 20th century, {{particularly}} after provincial lobbying saw the city become the eastern terminus of the massive National Transcontinental Railway project in 1912; this line would link Moncton with Edmundston, Quebec City, and on to Winnipeg where the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway continued to Saskatoon, Edmonton, and Prince Rupert. The First World War brought a halt to the era of railway expansion but the city would become an important trans-shipment point for materiel <b>funnelling</b> onwards to the port of Halifax.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, George Town {{retained}} its importance {{as a vital}} British entrepôt. The booming spice trade had led {{to the opening of}} spice farms all over Penang Island, making the island a centre of spice production in Southeast Asia; the export of spices also allowed the British East India Company to cover the administrative costs of Penang. Apart from <b>funnelling</b> the exports meant for global shipping lines which had bypassed other regional ports, the tin mining boom in neighbouring Perak {{towards the end of the}} 19th century transformed the Port of Penang into a major tin-exporting harbour in the Malay Peninsula, directly challenging the Port of Singapore. Simultaneously, George Town grew wealthier as mercantile firms and banks, including Standard Chartered and HSBC, flocked into the city.|$|E

25|$|However, the Port of Penang's initial pre-eminence {{was later}} supplanted by Singapore {{owing to the}} latter's {{superior}} geographical location. In spite of this, Penang remained an important feeder to Singapore – <b>funnelling</b> the exports meant for global shipping lines by ocean-going ships which had bypassed other regional ports. The replacement of sailing vessels by steamships in the mid-19th century cemented Penang's secondary importance after Singapore. The tin mining boom in neighbouring Perak {{towards the end of}} the 19th century also transformed the Port of Penang into a major tin-exporting entrepôt competing directly against the Port of Singapore, whilst also ushering in an influx of mercantile firms and banks. Penang's most important trading partners were China, India, Siam, the Dutch East Indies and the rest of the British Empire, including fellow Straits Settlements, Singapore and Malacca.|$|E

50|$|<b>Funnels</b> {{are usually}} made of {{stainless}} steel, aluminium, glass, or plastic. The material used in its construction should be sturdy {{enough to withstand}} {{the weight of the}} substance being transferred, and it should not react with the substance. For this reason, stainless steel or glass are useful in transferring diesel, while plastic <b>funnels</b> are useful in the kitchen. Sometimes disposable paper <b>funnels</b> are used in cases where {{it would be difficult to}} adequately clean the <b>funnel</b> afterwards (for example, in adding motor oil to a car). Dropper <b>funnels,</b> also called dropping <b>funnels</b> or tap <b>funnels,</b> have a tap to allow the controlled release of a liquid. A flat <b>funnel,</b> made of polypropylene, utilizes living hinges and flexible walls to fold flat.|$|R
5000|$|The {{required}} <b>funnel</b> {{cross-sectional area}} {{is determined by}} the volume of exhaust gases produced by the propulsion plant.

50|$|Because a <b>funnel</b> is {{automatically}} dropped when a thread blocks, {{care must be}} taken to ensure that synchronized resources are acquired again after any blocking operation. Specifically, acquiring a <b>funnel</b> can be a blocking operation, so if multiple <b>funnels</b> are needed, they must be acquired at once. This limits the utility of <b>funnels</b> because it increases the granularity of locking when multiple <b>funnels</b> need to be held at once.|$|R
25|$|On 8 December 1941, {{in concert}} with the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces invaded and {{occupied}} Thailand. Ananda Mahidol was away from the country, as he had returned to Switzerland to complete his studies, and Pridi Phanomyong served as regent in his absence. From 24 January 1942, occupied Thailand became a formal ally of the Empire of Japan {{and a member of the}} Axis. Under Plaek Pibulsonggram, Thailand declared war on the Allied powers. The regent refused to sign the declaration and it was thus legally invalid. Many members of the Thai government, including the Siamese embassy in Japan, acted as de facto spies in the Seri Thai underground on the side of the Allies, <b>funnelling</b> secret information to British intelligence and the US Office of Strategic Services. By 1944, it was apparent that Japan was going to lose the war. Bangkok suffered heavily from the Allied bombing raids. These, plus economic hardships, made the war and the government of Plaek Pibulsonggram very unpopular. In July, Plaek Pibulsonggram was ousted by the Seri Thai-infiltrated government. The National Assembly reconvened and appointed the liberal lawyer Khuang Aphaiwong prime minister. Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945, and Allied military responsibility for Thailand fell to Britain.|$|E

500|$|Invertebrates, {{particularly}} arthropods, {{have successfully}} made {{their homes in}} the desert. Flies, beetles, ants, termites, locusts, millipedes, scorpions and spiders have hard cuticles which are impervious to water and many of them lay their eggs underground and their young develop away from the temperature extremes at the surface. The Saharan silver ant (Cataglyphis bombycina) uses a heat shock protein in a novel way and forages in the open during brief forays {{in the heat of the}} day. The long-legged darkling beetle in Namibia stands on its front legs and raises its carapace to catch the morning mist as condensate, <b>funnelling</b> the water into its mouth. Some arthropods make use of the ephemeral pools that form after rain and complete their life cycle in a matter of days. The desert shrimp does this, appearing [...] "miraculously" [...] in new-formed puddles as the dormant eggs hatch.

2500|$|Johnston {{lost the}} 1991 general {{election}} to the NDP, {{under the leadership of}} Mike Harcourt, a former mayor of Vancouver. The NDP's unprecedented creation of new parkland and protected areas was popular and helped boost the province's growing tourism sector.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 There are no {{forecasting}} {{systems for}} <b>funnel</b> clouds for Alaska. The inability of forecasting is problematic because <b>funnel</b> clouds {{pose a threat}} to aviation, which serves as Alaska’s main form of transportation. Motivated by the lack of research on the formation of <b>funnel</b> clouds in Alaska, this research investigated characteristics of <b>funnel</b> clouds and atmospheric conditions under which <b>funnel</b> clouds form using operational Doppler weather radars and radiosonde soundings as well as synoptic weather maps. In Alaska, <b>funnel</b> clouds usually occur during the summer months May to September with a maximum of occurrence in July and around 1500 Alaska Daylight Time as shown in the <b>funnel</b> cloud observational data. The observed <b>funnel</b> clouds are usually not associated with severe thunderstorms and do not occur with strong synoptic scale forcing. As such, it was hypothesized that local effects from sea breeze fronts and orographic circulations might be the main forcing. Operational soundings indicate that some, but not all <b>funnel</b> cloud events occurred under large Convective Available Potential Energy (greater than 500 J) and strong lowlevel wind shear. <b>Funnel</b> clouds were difficult to identify in routine operational Doppler weather radars because the <b>funnel</b> clouds display small cross-sectional area compared to the radar resolution. An algorithm to retrieve similar vertical profiles from the entire radiosonde data than those observed during documented <b>funnel</b> cloud events was developed. By using similarity between radiosonde profiles of days of the observed <b>funnel</b> clouds and the similar radiosonde profiles scanned over the years, an idea of <b>funnel</b> cloud or severe storm occurrence can be ascertained. The mechanisms for <b>funnel</b> cloud formation differ by region. In Interior Alaska, the Alaska Range’s katabatic slope winds and the Tanana Valley wind create the needed vorticity. Along the west coast of Alaska, air-sea interaction plays a role. In Cook Inlet, topography and land-sea play a role. All <b>funnel</b> cloud events have weak synoptic scale forcing...|$|R
5|$|Tornadoes often {{begin as}} <b>funnel</b> clouds with no {{associated}} strong winds at the surface, {{and not all}} <b>funnel</b> clouds evolve into tornadoes.

50|$|For more emphasis, {{it makes}} sense why a <b>funnel</b> in {{analytics}} is called a <b>funnel.</b> An actual <b>funnel,</b> like the ones from a kitchen or garage, gets narrower along its length, allowing less volume to pass through it.
