When a <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> is under a static load, it is important to know their static displacement characteristic. The common static model for <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> is the Wahl’s factor equation, which assumes all design parameters such as spring radius, wire diameter, helix radius and pitch angle are constant. In this research, several mathematical models are used to the static displacement characteristic of automotive suspension <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> with design parameters.

In this study, the strain signal of <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> at different value of excitations is used to study the signals behavior. When a vehicle was driven on any road surfaces, the significant load is transmitted to the <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> to absorb loads. The load values were varied according {{to the type of}} the road surfaces. The signals were analyzed by statistical analysis and frequency-time domain.

For {{mechanical}} reliability design with more random variable parameters, if the parameters are queued with {{their impact on}} the sensitivity of {{mechanical reliability}}, which will be as random variables with relatively high impact, while low-impact will be determined variables, thus would simplify reliability analysis due to the random variable number reduced.

40|$|Abstract:- Optimal {{problem is}} often met in {{engineering}} practice. The method to solve complex optimal problem is always studied by people. Springs are important mechanical members {{which are often}} used in machines to exert force, to provide flexibility, and to store or absorb energy. <b>Helical</b> <b>spring</b> {{is the most popular}} type of springs. The method of <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> optimization is a typical one which can be used to solving other mechanical optimal design problem. Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is a good method in solving optimal problem. MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing and is an easy tool for us to simulate the optimization. In this paper, we mainly introduce the optimization of <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> based on particle swarm algorithms and simulation in MATLAB. Directed by the theory of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, with the minimum weight of <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> as objective function, with d, D 2 and n as design variables, with shear stress, maximum axial deflection, critical frequency, bucking, fatigue strength, coils not touch, space and dimension as constraint conditions, the complex <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> optimal design mathematics model with three design variables and fourteen inequality constraints conditions is established. When the model is simulated in MATLAB the minimal optimal value of variables and the minimal weight of <b>helical</b> <b>spring</b> can be obtained. Simulating Result shows that Particle Swarm Optimization is practical in solving complicated optimal design problems and effectively on avoiding constraint of solution.
