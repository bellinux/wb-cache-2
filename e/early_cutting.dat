50|$|Besides the {{modernisation}} of {{the style}} of shooting and the work required of gundogs, the situation was altered by the new developments that also took place in farming, which helped {{to bring about a}} marked reduction in the partridge population. This came about with the introduction of modernisation such as <b>early</b> <b>cutting</b> of silage, the use of fast-moving mechanical equipment, the burning or ploughing of stubble-fields soon after harvest, the destruction of hedgerows and the use of chemical sprays for weed-killing. The hedgerows had provided shelter and nesting sites; the weeds and other herbage supplied food and cover; whilst the stubble-fields had been a primary source of winter food; so the partridges were deprived of some important assets, whilst the wide use of chemicals on the land exercised a direct harmful effect.|$|E

Mezger gained the upper hand <b>early,</b> <b>cutting</b> Silva with several crisp {{combinations}} and outpointing Silva on the feet. However, he was ultimately knocked out at the 3:45 mark. Shortly before the knockout, Silva was catching the worse end of the punching exchanges and proceeded to throw an intentional, illegal headbutt to Mezger that eventually led to landing the knockout combination. Many people felt as though this was a cheap shot that affected the end result. Some people, including Kazushi Sakuraba, felt the bout should have been changed to a no contest. Mezger talked about his feelings on the matter in an interview: [...] "I am not going to cry foul, it is the fight game and things like that happen, get used to it.

40|$|An {{objective}} of every alfalfa grower is to maximize both yield and quality to receive optimum returns without jeopardizing stand life. However, yield and quality are typically inversely related; {{the highest quality}} is almost never associated with the highest yield. Since quality affects price and animal production, growers must discover a compromise between yield and quality to maximize profit. Achieving maximum returns involves a difficult balancing act weighing the benefits of <b>early</b> <b>cutting</b> for forage quality against {{the negative effects of}} <b>early</b> <b>cutting</b> on total yield and stand persistence. Quantification of the amount of yield gained vs. the amount of quality lost with each management decision will aid in optimizing profitability. While the implications of the yield/quality tradeoff cannot be completely avoided, strategies to consider for boosting profits are outlined. ‘Staggered ’ cutting schedules which target some harvests for quality and others for yield and stand life may be an effective approach. Using this strategy, fields are given ‘rest ’ periods, which benefit the health of the root and crown, and therefore improve stand persistence. Alternating the number of cuttings from one year to the next may also help maximize quality, while giving the plants a rest in the year fewer cuts are made. Producing a more dormant variety on some fields is an alternative strategy to produce high quality provided the yield penalty associated with the more dormant variety is not too great. We suggest that no single strategy (e. g. cutting only for yield or only for quality) is optimal, but mixed strategies which assure a supply of both high and medium quality hay may be reasonable and sustain crop production and profitability over time...|$|E

A cohort based age-structured {{mathematical}} model was developed to enable sugarcane growers to simulate the effect of various seasonal conditions on E. saccharina infestation levels.

Temperature dependence of the duration of each stage in the E. saccharina life cycle is an added parameter of the model. By running CANEGRO and E. saccharina models together, insight is gained on cutting cycle length determinations. Results show that the model generally under-estimates E. saccharina infestation levels but the timing of larval peaks coincides with field data.

40|$|Efficient {{management}} of the potato leafhopper (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) on alfalfa requires a procedure {{for dealing with the}} complexities of the ecological and economic system. We developed a mathematical model to represent this agroecosystem and demonstrated how systems analysis can help to make management more efficient and less risky.

40|$|Oat (Avena sativa) {{is grown}} to provide feed in winter for {{livestock}} {{production in the}} alpine area of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The effect of <b>early</b> <b>cutting</b> (T 1), late cutting (T 2) as well as once cutting and twice cutting (T 3) on forage yields and qualities were investigated for five oat varieties (YTA, CNC, B 3, Q 473 and Q 444). The cutting frequency and time significantly affected forage yield and quality of five varieties with the effects being different among the five varieties. T 3 increased hay yield and crude protein yield than T 2. The dry hay yield and crude protein yield of T 2 were all significantly lower when compared to T 1. YTA presented the maximum fresh grass yields, total hay yields and total crude protein yields under all cutting treatments among five varieties.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that a warming climate {{will have an impact}} on the future productivity of European spruce forests. In Scotland, Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) dominates the commercial forestry sector and there is growing pressure to develop alternative management strategies to limit potential economic losses through climate change. This review considers management options to increase the resilience of Sitka spruce dominated forests in Scotland. Given the considerable uncertainty over the potential long-term impacts of climate change, it is recommended that Sitka spruce should continue to be planted where it already grows well. However, new planting and restocking should be established in mixtures where silviculturally practicable, even if no-thin regimes are adopted, to spread future risks of damage. Three potentially compatible species with Sitka spruce are western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), grand fir (Abies grandis (Lamb.) Lindl.) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and all form natural mixtures in its native range in North America. The predicted windier climate will require a range of management inputs, such as <b>early</b> <b>cutting</b> of extraction racks and early selective thinning, to improve stability. The potential to improve resilience to particularly abiotic damage through transforming even-aged stands into irregular structures and limiting the overall size of the growing stock is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The use of ‘high quality ’ {{varieties}} {{has been}} proposed as a method to achieve high forage quality. However, there is strong evidence that high quality often comes {{at the expense of}} yield. Studies conducted at UC Davis indicate the powerful influence of Fall Dormancy (FD) on both yield potential and forage quality. More dormant varieties (FD 2 - 4) produce lower fiber (approximately 2 points ADF) and higher protein forage (approximately 2 points CP on the average) than nondormant lines (FD 8 - 10). However, yields were almost always lower with the more dormant varieties. The average yield penalty for each unit of FD ranged from about 0. 3 tons/acre to 0. 6 tons/acre per year in these studies—total annual yield differences of up to 3. 5 tons/A between some varieties. Cutting intervals varying from approximately 24 days to 33 days between cuts had a stronger influence on quality than did variety. <b>Early</b> <b>cutting</b> schedules resulted in 85 % production in the ‘Premium ’ and ‘Supreme ’ categories, whereas Medium and Late cutting schedules resulted in 53 % and 45 % of the production in those categories, respectively in 2002 (average of 18 varieties). Growers need to determine the amount of yield loss that can be sacrificed for higher quality under different market conditions, since under some market conditions the yield sacrifice is justified while in other market conditions it is not. While selecting varieties with lower FD has the potential to improve quality, the tradeoff between yield and quality are fundamental issues when choosing a variety for improved forage quality...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{miniaturization}} of many {{consumer products}} is extending {{the use of}} micro-milling operations with high-quality requirements. However, the impacts of cutting-tool wear on part dimensions, form and surface integrity are not negligible and part quality assurance for a minimum production cost is a challenging task. In fact, industrial practices usually set conservative cutting parameters and <b>early</b> <b>cutting</b> replacement policies {{in order to minimize}} the impact of cutting-tool wear on part quality. Although these practices may ensure part integrity, the production cost is far away to be minimized, especially in highly tool-consuming operations like mold and die micro-manufacturing. In this paper, an adaptive control optimization (ACO) system is proposed to estimate cutting-tool wear in terms of part quality and adapt the cutting conditions accordingly in order to minimize the production cost, ensuring quality specifications in hardened steel micro-parts. The ACO system is based on: (1) a monitoring sensor system composed of a dynamometer, (2) an estimation module with Artificial Neural Networks models, (3) an optimization module with evolutionary optimization algorithms, and (4) a CNC interface module. In order to operate in a nearly real-time basis and facilitate the implementation of the ACO system, different evolutionary optimization algorithms are evaluated such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithms (GA), and simulated annealing (SA) in terms of accuracy, precision, and robustness. The results for a given micro-milling operation showed that PSO algorithm performs better than GA and SA algorithms under computing time constraints. Furthermore, the implementation of the final ACO system reported a decrease in the production cost of 12. 3 and 29 % in comparison with conservative and high-production strategies, respectively...|$|E

A collection of vintage garments, neither dated nor identified, was donated by the Australian National Trust as inspiration to generate new ideas and projects.

When examining the garment it revealed fascinating details: the buckle was 'British Made', the fabric was 'homemade tapestry' yet the construction was professionally tailored. Was {{the origin of the}} garment British or Australian? The term 'Vest' is derived from the Latin word 'Vestis' meaning garment, from which the word vestment developed. The <b>early</b> <b>cutting</b> methods were 'direct methods' using individual measurements cut directly onto the fabric. These garments were 'bespoken' for the client. It was much later, in the mid 1800 's, that cutting systems (Drafting) became more scientific and pattern blocks were developed. Using as reference points the Cutters Practical Guide from 1850 to 1940 from the LCF tailoring archive I was able to establish that this vest was cut on the more modern scientific system rather than the direct method and establish the date of the vest with reasonable certainty. In addition there is a Fashion Plate showing 'The Newest Vest Styles For 1900 ' which includes a style almost identical to the garment.

40|$|Background. Superior cut-out of a {{lag screw}} remains a serious {{complication}} {{in the treatment}} of trochanteric or subtrochanteric fractures and it is related to many factors: the type of fracture, osteoporosis and the stability of fracture reduction. Little is known about the outcome after revision surgery for complications of the gamma nail. We assessed the outcome in patients who had revision surgery because of lag screw's cut out after gamma nailing for a trochanteric fracture. Material and Method. We present a study of 20 consecutive patients who underwent treatment after 20 cut-out of the lag screw ﬁxation of a trochanteric fracture with Gamma Locking Nail from September 2004 to November 2010. In 16 patients hip prothesis was performed, in 1 the removal of the implant and in 3 the reosteosynthesis. We reviewed 13 patients: 10 total hip arthroplasty, 2 endoprothesis and 1 reosteosynthesis of nail and lag screw (mean follow up: 26 months, mean age: 73 years old), 7 patients died. Patients were reviewed retrospectively by an independent observer. Clinical evaluation was performed, Oxford score and Harris Hip score were measured. X-Ray examination was performed after a minimum of 12 months of follow up. Results. Mean Harris Hip Score mean was 67 and mean Oxford score was 32 in hip prothesis group (12 patients). We had several complications, Implant-related complications were: 2 ipometria > 2 cm, 2 recurrent hip arthroplasty dislocations (1 reoperated), 4 persistent thigh pain. In only 4 patients none complications were observed. Another patient,  who had been subjected to reosteosinthesis, obtained better results (HHS: 95, Oxford score: 45) but with a 2 cm ipometria and occasional pain in the thigh. Conclusion. Cut out after gamma nail is consequent to biological or mechanical causes. Treatment of this complication is hip prosthesis (parzial or total hip arthroplasty), reosteosynthesis of the lag screw and/or the nail and the removal of the implant. Conversion to total/parzial hip arthroplasty may be a demanding operation with a higher complication rate respect to the standard, while reosteosynthesis is possible in selected patients and <b>early</b> <b>cutting</b> out...|$|E
