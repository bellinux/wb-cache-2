5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fight to the death.|$|E
5|$|The Nawabs of Bengal (full title, the Nawab Nizam of Bengal and Orissa) {{were the}} rulers of the then provinces of Bengal and Orissa. Between 1717 and 1765, they served as {{the rulers of}} the subah (or province) of Bengal. However, they were only {{nominally}} subordinate to the Mughal Empire. Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal was betrayed in the Battle of Plassey by Mir Jafar. He lost to the British, {{who took over the}} charge of Bengal in 1757, installed Mir Jafar on the Masnad (throne) and established <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> political power in Bengal.|$|E
5|$|With the {{disintegration}} of the Vijayanagara Empire in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the centres of Kannada literature moved to the courts of the emerging independent kingdoms, the Kingdom of Mysore and the Keladi Nayakas. Writers in these courts, many of whom were Veerashaiva by faith, were not only adept in Kannada but often also in Sanskrit and/or Telugu. Two such writers were Kalale Nanjaraja and Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bangalore. This multi-linguality was perhaps a lingering legacy of the cosmopolitan Vijayanagara literary culture and the emerging social responsibilities of the Veerashaiva monastic order which no longer confined <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Kannada only audience, but rather sought to spread its influence across southern India.|$|E

5|$|Interdigital {{filters are}} {{another form of}} coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, {{the advantage of a}} mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and Q values as low as 1.4 are possible.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of computer network communication lends <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E
5|$|The regime did {{not limit}} <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> purge of the SA. Having earlier imprisoned or exiled {{prominent}} Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used {{the occasion to}} move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on Göring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary Herbert von Bose without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate Edgar Jung, the author of Papen's Marburg speech; they disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch. The Gestapo also murdered Erich Klausener, the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate. Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests {{that he could not}} be arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor. Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.|$|E

25|$|With the {{development}} of oil painting, oil on panel began to replace tempera as a favoured method of enhancing a church. The oil paint lent <b>itself</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> richer and deeper quality of colour than tempera, and permitted the painting of textures {{in ways that were}} highly realistic.|$|E

25|$|Many socialist intellectuals, {{particularly}} those influenced by Christian socialism and similar {{notions of the}} ethical need for a restructuring of society, also saw the Liberals as the most obvious means for obtaining working-class representation.
