40|$|AbstractThe {{study was}} {{conducted}} to gain some important characteristics of the influence of the blade flap-bending/torsion elastic coupling stiffness on blade root flap-shear force and vibratory hub loads of a bearingless rotor. Based on the aerodynamic force, this paper presents a loose coupled aeroelastic analytical model by finite element method. Four sets of composite rotor with different elastic couplings were designed and investigated. The results of the investigation showed that flap-bending/torsion couplings {{have a significant effect on}} the rotor vibratory hub loads and the distribution of the couplings also critical for the degree of vibration reduction. Through the present research, it has been demonstrated that structural couplings can significantly <b>impact</b> <b>rotor</b> vibration characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{composite}} tailored couplings in {{rotor blades}} to reduce vibratory hub loads was studied through design, structural and aeroelastic analysis, fabrication, and {{wind tunnel test}} of Mach scale articulated composite rotors with tailored flap-bending/torsion couplings. The rotor design was nominally based on the UH- 60 BLACK HAWK rotor. The 6 -foot diameter blades have a SC 1095 profile and feature a linear twist of - 12 deg. The analysis of composite rotor was carried out using a mixed cross-section structural model, and UMARC. Five sets of composite rotor were fabricated, including a baseline rotor without coupling, rotors with spanwise uniform positive coupling and negative coupling, and rotors with spanwise dual-segmented coupling (FBT-P/N) and triple-segmented coupling. The blade composite D-spar is the primary structural element supporting the blade loads and providing the desired elastic couplings. Non-rotating tests were performed to examine blade structural properties. The measurements showed good correlation with predictions, and good repeatability for the four blades of each rotor set. All rotors were tested at a rotor speed of 2300 rpm (tip Mach number 0. 65) at different advance ratios and thrust levels, in the Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel at the University of Maryland. The test results showed that flap-bending/torsion couplings {{have a significant effect}} on the rotor vibratory hub loads. All coupled rotors reduced the 4 /rev vertical force for advance ratios up to 0. 3, with reductions ranging from 1 to 34 %. The mixed coupling rotor FBT-P/N reduced overall 4 /rev hub loads at advance ratios of 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3. At a rotor speed of 2300 rpm and an advance ratio of 0. 3, the FBT-P/N rotor achieved 15 % reduction for 4 /rev vertical force, 3 % for 4 /rev in-plane force and 14 % for 4 /rev head moment. The reductions in the 4 /rev hub loads are related to the experimentally observed reductions in 3 /rev and 5 /rev blade flap bending moments. Through the present research, it has been experimentally demonstrated that structural couplings can significantly <b>impact</b> <b>rotor</b> vibration characteristics, and with suitable design optimization (coupling strength and spanwise distribution) they can be used to reduce vibratory hub loads without penalties...|$|E
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demands for energy world-wide has prompted research into {{and implementation of}} devices to harvest power from renewable sources of energy, such as hydroelectricity. Large-scale hydroelectric plants have existed for over a century, and are capable of producing over 10000 MW of power. However, such facilities are expensive and generally {{have a significant impact}} on the local ecosystem; as such, there are relatively few locations and communities that can support their construction. Small-scale hydroelectric facilities, which produce power up to 30 MW, are increasing in popularity since they do not divert the natural flow of the river and are capable of harnessing energy from smaller sources than their large-scale cousins one of the main concerns being the negative effects they can have on the local fauna. Specifically, fish inadvertently passing through the facility can be hurt or killed by the inlet guide vanes or rotor assembly through a variety of mechanisms, including striking the structure, being caught between rotating and stationary parts, or through dramatic changes in fluid pressure. In order to mitigate injury to fish passing through small-scale hydroelectric facilities, AlphaStar Hydro has developed a novel vaneless swirl injector to replace current inlet guide vane stages, which allows the fish to travel through with minimal damage, while still imparting the necessary swirl component onto the flow for proper turbine operation. This swirl injector is made up of a single spiral flighting wrapped around a central shaft. The main focus of this work is on quantifying and optimizing the flow through the vaneless swirl injector. Of primary concern is the axisymmetry of the flow exiting the injector, the pressure drop across it, and the swirl that it provides, all of which directly <b>impact</b> <b>rotor</b> performance. Based upon a preliminary patented design provided by AlphaStar Hydro, the flow field generated by the injector was determined through a computational fluid dynamics study. This provided the foundation for a geometric optimization study to maximize flow axisymmetry and swirl, while minimizing pressure loss. A 5 by 4 grid was setup using number of revolutions and pitch angle as variables. Four metrics were measured: axial axisymmetry, tangential axisymmetry, swirl number and pressure loss. Using the four metrics, an objective function was created and was subsequently optimized using a line search algorithm. The study concluded that the number of revolutions is not as important as the pitch angle and that the optimal geometry is 4 revolutions at a pitch angle of 25 degrees. A test rig was designed and constructed in order to test the newly optimized design with the addition of the nose cone. The setup is composed of a reservoir, a pump, a gate valve, a circle-to-rectangle transition, flow conditioning elements, the swirl injector, a test section and return plumbing. The rig was commissioned and initially characterized by measuring the velocity drift with time, the change in temperature with time, and the inlet velocity profile upstream of the injector. The experimental facility was coupled with numerical simulations to explore the flow field downstream of the optimized swirl injector with an attached nose cone, as would be the case upon rotor installation. The pressure, axial velocity and tangential velocity contours were analyzed to assess the performance of the swirl injector in its operational configuration, in preparation for rotor installation. A recirculation zone on the nose cone was observed, which was due to the flow separation on the nose cone. The swirl numbers and the axisymmetry metrics were compared between the optimization model and the nose cone model, revealing that there were no significant differences between the two. The experimentally measured velocity profiles were found to match well with the numerical profiles, as did the pressure distributions within the test section. This provided cross-validation of the experimental and numerical studies. The experimental data exhibited relatively high fluctuations in the velocity signals, however...|$|E

30|$|During {{the process}} of {{inertial}} response emulation, a sudden boost in active power output {{can lead to a}} sharp deceleration in rotor speed due to the imbalance between the electrical and mechanical torques. The undesirable consequence is that the turbine may stall due to taking excessive kinetic energy from the rotor as well as the intensive structural load on the mechanical components of wind turbine. Moreover, the associated recovery process following temporary overproduction results in decreased WT power output. Consequently, a SFD is likely to occur.

At high advance ratios, the reverse flow region is large and its unique aerodynamics <b>impacts</b> the <b>rotor</b> performance and dynamics more than at conventional airspeeds where they are often ignored. The analysis is refined and augmented with improved modeling of the nearwake in reverse flow, a new aerodynamic model of the fuselage and the root cutout region and corrections to the airfoil properties for highly yawed flow.

High advance ratio performance is predicted satisfactorily for both tests, including predicting the onset of thrust reversal. Despite the high advance ratio, correctly modeling the wake is most important for predicting airloads and the resulting blade bending loads, while yawed flow, nearwake inflow and the fuselage flow disturbances are important for predicting high advance ratio thrust and power.

40|$|Wet {{compression}} cooling {{has become}} an extremely important gas cooling method for land based power generation installations. The {{reason for this is}} that many power stations are augmenting their standard power generation units with turbines. These turbines are generally used to help supply electricity during peak power occurrences, particularly during the summer months in many geographic areas. One of the main reasons for cooling this air is to increase the density as well to facilitate a cooler combustor inlet temperature. The increase in compressor air inlet density increases the overall compressor efficiency. An increase in combustor efficiency will also occur due to the lower combustor inlet air temperature. The general method for this inlet air-cooling is to use finely atomized drops in the air inlet duct leading to the turbine compressor. If the drops are of the appropriate size and atmospheric conditions are favorable (i. e. wet bulb temperature), the water will begin to evaporate prior to reaching the first compressor stage. In some instances the evaporation may be allowed to continue into the compressor itself. This can create some difficulties if the atomizers are not operating correctly. Large drops can <b>impact</b> the <b>rotor</b> blades of the compressor and can wear the compressor blades through erosion over time. It is also optimal to maintain a fairly tight drop size distribution from the atomizer. This facilitates a mor...|$|R
