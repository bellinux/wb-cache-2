40|$|Hydrodynamic <b>focusing</b> of {{particles}} is numerically studied by the immersed boundary – lattice Boltzmann method. Particle <b>focusing</b> entropy is proposed to quantitatively characterize processing performance and final results of hydrodynamic <b>focusing.</b> Simulations of hydrodynamic <b>focusing</b> in several straight microchannels {{are carried out}} to evaluate versatility of the <b>focusing</b> entropy. Time evolutions of <b>focusing</b> entropies and particle trajectories are analyzed contrastively. The results demonstrate that the <b>focusing</b> entropy is an effective scale to measure particles ordering degree and hydrodynamic <b>focusing</b> performance. Higher ordering degree determines lower <b>focusing</b> entropy, which indicates better <b>focusing</b> performance. Channel cross section, particle rigidness and channel Reynolds number are three major factors influencing <b>focusing</b> dynamics and final results. Rectangular microchannel is more advantageous than circular and square ones in hydrodynamic <b>focusing.</b> Particles of different rigidness in rectangular microchannel can be separated significantly with the flow mediation. Increasing channel Reynolds numbers can lead to higher efficiency and better <b>focusing</b> performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the quality of care rating for {{long-term}} care facilities in rural versus urban Illinois locations. Using quality of care data available on medicare. gov, 774 Illinois long-term care facilities were compared to determine if a difference in quality of care existed based on rurality. Each facility was classified as either urban <b>focused,</b> large rural city/town (micropolitan) <b>focused,</b> small rural town <b>focused,</b> or isolated small rural town <b>focused</b> using the Rural Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes provided by the Rural Health Research Center. Frequencies, ANOVA, and Scheffe tests were used to analyze the data. Significant differences were found between urban <b>focused</b> and small rural town <b>focused</b> long-term care facilities and also between urban <b>focused</b> and isolated small rural town <b>focused</b> in regards to inspection ratings. Significant differences were also found for general quality ratings between urban <b>focused</b> and large rural city/town (micropolitan) <b>focused,</b> small rural town <b>focused,</b> and isolated small rural town <b>focused</b> long-term care facilities. Urban <b>focused</b> locations had a mean inspection average of 2. 72 stars out of a possible five compared to small rural town <b>focused</b> facilities that had a mean rating of 3. 21 stars, and isolated small rural town <b>focused</b> facilities that had a 3. 33 star average. Results also showed that general quality ratings were high, an average of 3. 81 stars, for urban <b>focused</b> facilities, compared to an average of 2. 84 stars for micropolitan facilities, 2. 82 stars for small rural town <b>focused,</b> and 3. 03 for isolated small rural town <b>focused.</b> Findings from this study offer some initial evidence that while overall quality in Illinois long-term care facilities are not significantly different on the basis of rurality, there are significant differences in inspection ratings and general quality ratings that could be attributed to degrees of rurality...|$|R
