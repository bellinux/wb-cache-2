40|$|The {{notion of}} {{derivatives}} for smooth representations of GL(n) in the p-adic case {{was defined by}} J. Bernstein and A. Zelevinsky. In the archimedean case, an analog of the <b>highest</b> <b>derivative</b> was defined for irreducible unitary representations by S. Sahi and called the "adduced" representation. In this paper we define derivatives of all order for smooth admissible Frechet representations (of moderate growth). The archimedean case is more problematic than the p-adic case; for example arbitrary derivatives need not be admissible. However, the <b>highest</b> <b>derivative</b> continues being admissible, and for irreducible unitarizable representations coincides with the space of smooth vectors of the adduced representation. In [AGS] we prove exactness of the <b>highest</b> <b>derivative</b> functor, and compute <b>highest</b> <b>derivatives</b> of all monomial representations. We prove exactness of the <b>highest</b> <b>derivative</b> functor, and compute <b>highest</b> <b>derivatives</b> of all monomial representations. We apply those results to finish the computation of adduced representations for all irreducible unitary representations and to prove uniqueness of degenerate Whittaker models for unitary representations, thus completing the results of [Sah 89, Sah 90, SaSt 90, GS 12].

50|$|The Einstein-Hilbert {{action for}} general {{relativity}} was first formulated purely {{in terms of}} the space-time metric. To take the metric and affine connection as independent variables in the action principle was first considered by Palatini. It is called a first order formulation as the variables to vary over involve only up to first derivatives in the action and so doesn't overcomplicate the Euler-Lagrange equations with terms coming from <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> terms. The tetradic Palatini action is another first-order formulation of the Einstein-Hilbert action in terms of a different pair of independent variables, known as frame fields and the spin connection. The use of frame fields and spin connections are essential in the formulation of a generally covariant fermionic action (see the article spin connection for more discussion of this) which couples fermions to gravity when added to the tetradic Palatini action.|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} fate of flat {{directions}} in <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> gravity by studying two explicit examples, namely <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> gauged supergravity in five dimensions and <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> type IIB string theory in ten dimensions. In the first case, the supersymmetric spinning black hole solution in asymptotically AdS spacetime, found by Gutowski and Reall, is analyzed. In this case {{we find that the}} flat direction at the two derivative level is not lifted after addition of <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> terms, and as it turns out, this result holds even for non-supersymmetric deformations of the <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> action. For the rotating D 3 -brane solutions in type IIB theory, the dilaton parametrizes a flat direction at leading order, but its fate changes upon including order (Î±^') ^ 3 supersymmetric <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> corrections to the type IIB action, i. e. its leading value gets fixed.

40|$|We study cosmological {{perturbations}} in mimetic gravity in {{the presence}} of classified <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> terms which can make the mimetic perturbations stable. We show that the quadratic <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> terms which are independent of curvature and the cubic <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> terms which come from curvature corrections are sufficient to remove instabilities in mimetic perturbations. The advantage of working with the classified <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> terms is that we can control both the background and the perturbation equations allowing us to construct the <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> extension of mimetic dark matter and the mimetic nonsingular bouncing scenarios. The latter can be thought as a new <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> effective action for the loop quantum cosmology scenario in which the equations of motion coincide with those suggested by loop quantum cosmology. We investigate a possible connection between the mimetic cosmology and the Randall-Sundrum cosmology. Comment: 33 pages, references added, JCAP published versio...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> chiral models with four supercharges and BPS states in these models. The off-shell Lagrangian generically {{includes}} higher {{powers of the}} auxiliary fields F which causes distinct on-shell branches associated with the solutions to the auxiliary fields equation. We {{point out that the}} model admits a supersymmetric completion of arbitrary <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> bosonic models of a single complex scalar field and an arbitrary scalar potential can be introduced even without superpotentials. As an example, we present a supersymmetric extension of the Faddeev-Skyrme model without four time derivatives, in contrast to the previously proposed supersymmetric Faddeev-Skyrme-like model containing four time derivatives. In general, <b>higher</b> <b>derivative</b> terms together with a superpotential result in deformed scalar potentials.
