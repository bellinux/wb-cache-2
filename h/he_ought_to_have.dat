25|$|The {{ship had}} run aground on Pigeon Island, about 12 miles from Trincomalee. The {{subsequent}} Board of Trade enquiry found that Captain Kirton omitted to take proper precautions; instead of continuing the ship's course {{at full speed}} for two hours after the dark, <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> slackened speed, to have stopped the ship and hove the head. Had he adopted these proper and prudent measures the calamity which followed would have been averted.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E
25|$|Justice Chan {{relied on}} a United Kingdom case, Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council (1976), to {{ascertain}} the law with regard to this ground of judicial review. In this case, the House of Lords held that statutory provisions which are framed to include the word satisfaction may exclude judicial review on matters of pure judgment by the decision-maker, but judicial review will not be excluded in all cases. Lord Wilberforce held that when the judgment {{is dependent on the}} existence of relevant facts, the court has to ascertain if the facts truly exist and if they have been properly taken into account, although the evaluation of the facts is for the decision-maker alone. If these requirements are not met, an aggrieved person is entitled to challenge the decision, and the court can intervene {{on the grounds that the}} decision-maker acted outside its powers, outside the purpose of the legislation empowering it, unfairly, or upon an incorrect basis of fact. Lord Diplock mentioned it was also necessary to consider if the decision-maker had taken into consideration only matters which <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> considered.|$|E

25|$|After {{this had}} the king a large meeting, and very deep {{consultation}} with his council, about this land; {{how it was}} occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out 'How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> by the year from the shire.' Also he commissioned them to record in writing, 'How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;' and though I may be prolix and tedious, 'What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or in stock, {{and how much money}} it were worth.' So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ. And all the recorded particulars were afterwards brought to him.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} his {{seagoing}} naval career Rupert {{continued to}} be actively involved in both government and science, although he was increasingly removed from current politics. To the younger members of the court the prince appeared increasingly distant—almost from a different era. Count Grammont described Rupert as [...] "brave and courageous even to rashness, but cross-grained and incorrigibly obstinate... he was polite, even to excess, unseasonably; but haughty, and even brutal, when <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been gentle and courteous... his manners were ungracious: he had a dry hard-favoured visage, and a stern look, even when he wished to please; but, when he was out of humour, he was the true picture of reproof". Rupert's health during this period was also less robust; his head wound from his employment in France required a painful trepanning treatment, his leg wound continued to hurt and he still suffered from the malaria he had caught while in the Gambia.|$|E
500|$|Burne-Jones once {{admitted}} that after leaving Oxford he [...] "found himself at five-and-twenty what <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been at fifteen". He {{had had no}} regular training as a draughtsman, and lacked the confidence of science. But his extraordinary faculty of invention as a designer was already ripening; his mind, rich in knowledge of classical story and medieval romance, teemed with pictorial subjects, and he set himself to complete his set of skills by resolute labour, witnessed by innumerable drawings. The works of this first period are all more or less tinged by the influence of Rossetti; but they are already differentiated from the elder master's style by their more facile though less intensely felt elaboration of imaginative detail. Many are pen-and-ink drawings on vellum, exquisitely finished, of which his Waxen Image (1856) {{is one of the}} earliest and best examples. Although the subject, medium and manner derive from Rossetti's inspiration, it is not the hand of a pupil merely, but of a potential master. This was recognized by Rossetti himself, who before long avowed that he had nothing more to teach him.|$|E

60|$|Only {{the most}} {{superficial}} mind would assert nowadays {{that man is}} a reasonable creature. Man is an unreasonable creature, and it was entirely unreasonable and human for Mr. Britling during his nocturnal self-reproaches to mix up his secret resentment at his infatuation for Mrs. Harrowdean with his ill-advised attack upon the wall of Brandismead Park. <b>He</b> <b>ought</b> never <b>to</b> <b>have</b> bought that car; <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> never <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been so ready to meet Mrs. Harrowdean more than halfway.|$|R

500|$|At his peak in 1882, Crossland was {{considered}} one of the fastest bowlers in England, and his yorker were described as W. G. Grace as being [...] "exceedingly difficult to play." [...] In his Wisden obituary, it was reported that [...] "the majority of experts having no hesitation in describing him as a rank thrower." [...] Grace was scarcely kinder, noting that he was [...] "inclined to think that <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been no-balled in every over." [...] Despite the widespread opinion against his action, the umpires, themselves professional, were reluctant to no ball him. There was a feeling in the press that the biggest fault lay with the cricket authorities; both the umpires and the MCC; The Daily News, echoed by Cricket magazine, said that [...] "no blame can possibly attach to a bowler who continues a delivery which is habitual with him ... when the proper authorities decline [...] their disapproval of it." [...] As a batsman, he was an aggressive tail-ender, while he {{was considered}} a good fielder with a long throw. In all first-class matches, Crossland claimed 322 wickets at an average of 10.95. He took ten wickets in a match on six occasions, and five wickets in an innings 25 times. He scored 1,172 runs with a high score of 51.|$|E
500|$|In Britain, Gambier's conduct {{has been}} criticised by historians {{ever since the}} battle, such as William Laird Clowes, who wrote in 1901 that [...] "there can be no {{question}} that affair of Aix Road was mismanaged by the Admiralty at home and by the Admiral on the spot" [...] and that [...] "a great naval commander never loses an occasion to attack when conditions are favourable to him." [...] In 2007 historian Noel Mostert wrote [...] "Oh Nelson! Nelson, Nelson, where were you? Never could {{the absence of the}} man from a scene of action clearly designed for his drive and decision have been more painfully alive." [...] In the same year David Cordingly wrote that [...] "The boldness of the attack [...] [...] [...] was comparable with the exploits of a Drake, de Ruyter and Nelson. And yet the action at Basque Roads has come to be regarded as a wasted opportunity, a bungled and confused affair." [...] Perhaps the most damning response came from an enemy. Years later, Napoleon wrote to an English correspondent that Cochrane [...] "could not only have destroyed , [...] [...] [...] but he might and would have taken them out, had your admiral supported him as <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> done [...] [...] [...] The French admiral was a fool , but yours was just as bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|One other {{strain in}} {{criticism}} is {{to read in}} the story an almost Jamesian moral with Delano as the American who, [...] "confronted with evil in unescapable form, wanted only to turn over a new leaf, to deny and to forget the lesson <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> learned." [...] Such an American survives [...] "by being less than fully human," [...] while Europeans are [...] "broken {{by the weight of}} their knowledge of and complicity in human evil." [...] Literary historian Richard Gray calls the novella an interrogation of [...] "the American optimism of its narrator [...] and the European pessimism of its protagonist, Cereno, under the shadow of slavery." [...] Delano represents a version of New England innocence which has also been read as strategy to ensure colonial power over both Spain and Africans in the [...] "New World".|$|E

Ellis, for the first time, disregarded this rule, and on catching the ball, instead of retiring backwards, rushed forwards with the ball in his hands towards the opposite goal, with what result as to the game I know not, neither do I know how this infringement of a well-known rule was followed up, or when it became, as it is now, a standing rule." ...|$|E
