5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Scottish independence, Robert I {{turned his attention to}} building up a Scottish naval capacity. This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal man-of-war near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde. In the late 14th century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers. James <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> greater interest in naval power. After his return to Scotland in 1424 he established a shipbuilding yard at Leith, a house for marine stores, and a workshop. King's ships, one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429, were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war, and the office of Lord High Admiral was probably founded in this period. In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III received assistance from his two warships the Flower and the King's Carvel also known as the Yellow Carvel.|$|E
5|$|Among Denmark's most {{successful}} contemporary photographers are Jacob Aue Sobol, who gained recognition for captivating portraits of his Greenlandic girlfriend, and Per Bak Jensen, who {{introduced a new}} perspective to modern landscape photography. Press photography has prospered too under award-winning contributors such as Jan Grarup and Claus Bjørn Larsen, who have covered wars and conflicts of global importance over the past 20 years. Photography is an interesting hobby {{for most of the}} people in the world. In 1944, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> photo of a car from my digital camera and yesterday, I found that photo. Travelling back in time, photography wasn’t as simple as ‘smile and click’ as we see today. Back in 1820s, early cameras would take several hours to actually capture a film! Technology is great, isn’t it? The first every digital camera to be created was in December 1975. It was developed by an engineer in Kodak Company and took 23 seconds to create first photograph. The camera only recorded black and white photographs of 0.1 mega pixels. The camera weighed 8 pounds.|$|E
25|$|So I {{turned around}} and there's this {{beautiful}} Indian woman walking up; a Native American. She said 'Are you Glen Keane? The animator that's going to do Pocahontas?' I said 'Well, yeah.' And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said, 'Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, {{and this is my}} sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from Pocahontas.' And as they stood there, I mean <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> picture of both of them, and between their faces was Pocahontas' face in my mind – I could see her.|$|E

500|$|One {{month later}} he {{enrolled}} in a differential equations course ("mostly full of seniors") as well. When Einar Hille temporarily replaced the regular instructor, Gleason found Hille's style [...] "unbelievably different... He had a view of mathematics that was just vastly different... That {{was a very important}} experience for me. So after that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> lot of courses from Hille" [...] including, in his sophomore year, graduate-level real analysis.

500|$|Yeats delayed visiting Olivia in London a month later; he instead {{tended to}} Johnson who was {{involved}} in the Wilde case and descending into the alcoholism that would kill him. Yeats appeared to have persuaded himself that Olivia and her cousin shared a flaw, writing, [...] "here is the same weakness I thought... Her beauty... dark and still, had the nobility of defeated things, and how could it help but wring my heart. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> fortnight to decide what I should do". He constructed a plan to reconcile his desire with what he believed to be her wickedness: he would ask that she leave her husband to live with him. Until then their friendship would remain platonic.|$|E
500|$|The album's lyrical content {{included}} several themes of empowerment, inspired by an incident of sexual harassment, with Jackson recalling [...] "the danger hit home {{when a couple}} of guys started stalking me on the street... Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, {{out of a sense of}} self-defense." [...] Its innovative fusion of dance-pop and industrial music with hip-hop and R undertones influenced the development of the new jack swing genre by bridging the gap between the latter two styles. The accompanying music videos shot for the album's singles became popular on MTV, and obtained a then-unknown Paula Abdul a recording contract for her choreography work with Jackson. Billboard stated [...] " [...] accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV, and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader, beat-driven musical mix." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics were rewritten {{to convey}} Jackson's {{feelings}} about her recent annulment from James DeBarge. It {{was the last}} song to be recorded for Control, and was ultimately chosen as the lead single for the album, as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson's outlook on life: [...] "I {{think it was very}} representative of the sparseness and the funkiness {{that the rest of the}} album had and the attitude Janet had about being in control, being mature to the point where she had definite opinions about what she wanted to say". The song was inspired by one of her experiences in Minneapolis when a group of men made sexual advances towards her outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of Control. She recalled, [...] "They were emotionally abusive. Sexually threatening. Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, out of a sense of self-defense." ...|$|E
500|$|Lovato {{collaborated with}} Beckett on a song titled [...] "For the Love of a Daughter". Although not {{planning}} to write a personal song, a [...] "really long talk" [...] with Beckett resulted in the song being written. The song chronicles Lovato's relationship with her estranged birth father, who left the family when she was two years old. In the song, she pleads with her father to [...] "put the bottle down" [...] and questions him: [...] "How could you {{put your hands on}} the ones that you swore you loved?" [...] The song was set to appear on the album, but Lovato and her management felt of the song's subject would be too much for her young audience and later was removed from the album. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> step back, I realized I wouldn't like those subjects being talked about in somebody else's home, with a seven-year-old and their mom." [...] Several other [...] "emotional" [...] songs were also put on hold. The song was later selected and included on her third studio album Unbroken released in September 2011, when Lovato had left Disney Channel.|$|E
500|$|While {{vacationing in}} the Bahamas and Costa Rica in 2008, Saadiq {{observed}} people there listening to classic soul music and {{was inspired to}} pursue it as a musical direction for his next album. He recounted the experience in an interview for Blues & Soul, saying that [...] "I was like 'Wow, maybe I should tap into this vibe, because it’s actually what I LOVE!' ... I realised that, though {{you can hear it}} in many of the records I've done throughout my career, I'd never paid 100% attention to going in that direction before. So the difference this time is that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> more focused route." [...] As a part of Tony! Toni! Toné! during the late 1980s and 1990s, Saadiq had incorporated influences from the music of Motown in his songwriting for the group. Before recording The Way I See It, Saadiq signed to Columbia Records. Label executive Rick Rubin visited Saadiq's home studio and was impressed by his material there. He said of Rubin's visit and advice to him as a solo artist, [...] "He told me to never box myself in. I just have to be myself. You've got to follow your own path. I've always gone down the road less traveled, but now I do it even more aggressively." ...|$|E

500|$|Yankovic was {{inspired}} to write the song after he heard The Kinks' song [...] "Lola" [...] while driving in his car one day. He noted, [...] "I was driving a rent-a-car through Florida when the song 'Lola' came on the radio, and it got me thinking about how much fun I had doing 'Yoda' [...] where <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> then-current topic and combined it with a classic rock tune." [...] He soon {{turned his attention to}} the film Jurassic Park—about a park on a fictional island, where geneticists have succeeded in cloning dinosaurs. The film is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton—which had just come out and was already a blockbuster success. Yankovic decided to write a parody about the movie, and considered various songs that he could spoof. Eventually, he decided to parody the 1968 hit single [...] "MacArthur Park", which was performed by Richard Harris. Yankovic approached the original song's writer, Jimmy Webb, who agreed to the idea. In fact, Webb was so amused by the parody that he later penned a letter to Yankovic that read, [...] "Well, [...] oughta [...] bury that song once and for all!" [...] In addition, Yankovic received permission from Crichton and director Steven Spielberg to produce the track.|$|E
500|$|... "Billie Jean" [...] was {{recorded}} by American rock musician Chris Cornell for his Carry On album in 2007. Cornell {{said of his}} cover, [...] "I didn't plan on it. It just sort of happened organically. I changed the music quite a bit, I didn't touch the lyrics." [...] He added, [...] "And it's not a joke. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> completely different approach to it, musically." [...] Cornell had previously performed the song live in Europe, including an acoustic set in Stockholm, Sweden in September 2006. He later said, [...] "I {{was getting ready to}} do some acoustic shows on a promotional tour for Revelations and I just wanted to have fun with it." [...] The cover received favorable reviews from critics. MTV noted the [...] "bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel" [...] which stripped away [...] "any pop elements of the original". Los Angeles Times described the track as [...] "a grim, spooky take" [...] on Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean", and added that it was [...] "amusing enough, even if it sounds a lot more like Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters'". The newspaper concluded that [...] "Jacko's mega hit [...] the stunt translation". In 2008, Cornell's version was performed live by David Cook on the seventh season of American Idol, and this version charted on Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 47. In May of the same year, dance act Signature used [...] "Nachna Onda Nei" [...] on Britain's Got Talent in their audition and again in their final performance. In 2011, Patrick Stump covered the song in an a cappella mash-up tribute to Jackson along with several other songs over pre-recorded backing vocals.|$|E
500|$|For {{the song}} [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", which was {{originally}} penned {{for one of}} Jam and Lewis's own records, the lyrics were rewritten to convey Jackson's feelings about her recent annulment from James DeBarge. The song {{was chosen as the}} lead single for Control, as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson's outlook on life. [...] "Nasty", which in Jackson's opinion was the most innovative song on the album, was inspired by her experience with street harassment in Minneapolis by a group of men outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of Control. She recalled, [...] "They were emotionally abusive. Sexually threatening. Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, {{out of a sense of}} self-defense." [...] Jimmy Jam wrote and played the keyboard arrangement, with Jackson playing the accompaniment. Background vocals were sung by Jackson, Jam and Lewis. The distinctive triplet swing beat of the song was developed by Jam on an Ensoniq Mirage keyboard. [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] was centered on safe sex and abstinence, a subject of significant social commentary at the time. Jam commented that it is common practice for songwriters to use current events as a means of inspiration for lyrics and that the AIDS pandemic had raised awareness about sexually transmitted diseases. He commented, [...] "The theme of the song ('Let's Wait Awhile') was Janet's idea. She's not a preachy person. She's not telling people how to live their lives. All she's doing is offering an opinion." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first session}} was on 26 February, {{three of the}} first songs—fully {{recorded}}—attempted during the session were [...] "Baby Lemonade", [...] "Maisie" [...] and [...] "Gigolo Aunt". However, Gilmour thought they were losing the [...] "Barrett-ness". After [...] "Baby Lemonade" [...] was attempted, 2 takes of [...] "Maisie" [...] were recorded before Barrett went into 15 takes of [...] "Gigolo Aunt". The next day, two-track demos of [...] "Wolfpack", [...] "Waving My Arms in the Air", [...] "Living Alone" [...] and [...] "Bob Dylan Blues", were recorded. The former two {{made it to the}} album; the latter two didn't. On the recording sheet, it lists Gilmour as having taken home a copy of the latter two, Gilmour later returned and took the master tapes too. Gilmour has since said [...] "Those sessions were done so quickly. We were rushing to gigs every day and had to fit recording sessions in between. I probably took it away to have a listen and simply forgot to take it back. It wasn't intended to be a final mix. Syd knocked it off, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> tape home." [...] Despite some minor work made to [...] "Gigolo Aunt", Barrett wouldn't return to Abbey Road Studios until 1 April, due to Pink Floyd working on their 1970 album, Atom Heart Mother. On various occasions, Barrett would [...] "spy" [...] on the band as they recorded the album. Again, Barrett recorded some work to a song, [...] "Wolfpack," [...] on the 3rd, before the sessions were postponed until 5 June, this time due to Gilmour and Wright going on tour in the US with Pink Floyd.|$|E
500|$|On October 13, Luce's telegraphed {{report from}} Quebec was {{received}} at the Collins New York office. The {{news of his}} survival {{was the cause of}} celebration and thanksgiving. In its first paragraph Luce informed Edward Collins that the lost passengers likely [...] "included your wife, daughter and son, with whom <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> last leave the moment the ship was going down". That day, the Baltimore Sun reported the loss of the entire Brown party. [...] Luce's account of the rushing of lifeboats, and the early departures of officers and crew, caused considerable consternation in New York, which quickly turned to anger and condemnation as it became apparent that no women or children had been saved, and that most of the survivors were from the crew. The New York Times reported [...] "an entire lack of disciplined control over the whole of the ship", and that [...] "the officers and crew did not do their best towards saving the vessel, which they left too early". Paul Grann, from Dorian's boat, reported that [...] "all order and discipline ceased on board", and that Rogers had threatened passengers with firearms. [...] Later press accounts condemned the crew in increasingly harsh terms; The New York Times referred to [...] "a ghastly desertion of duty", and condemned the [...] "cowardly and dastardly conduct of the crew". [...] Scientific American adjudged that the behavior of the crew in saving themselves before their passengers had [...] "blackened the character of our marine {{in the eyes of the}} whole world". Captain Luce, however, was largely exculpated; he had not sought to save himself, had gone down with his ship, and had survived largely by chance. When he arrived in New York by train from Quebec, on October 14, he was greeted as a hero.|$|E
500|$|The fourteenth king of Tikal was Chak Tok Ich'aak (Great Jaguar Paw). Chak Tok Ich'aak built {{a palace}} that was {{preserved}} and developed by later rulers {{until it became}} {{the core of the}} Central Acropolis. Little is known about Chak Tok Ich'aak except that he was killed on 14 January 378 AD. On the same day, Siyah K’ak’ (Fire Is Born) arrived from the west, having passed through El Peru, a site to the west of Tikal, on 8 January. On Stela 31 he is named as [...] "Lord of the West". Siyah K’ak’ was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non-Maya hieroglyph of a spearthrower combined with an owl, a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. Spearthrower Owl may even have been the ruler of Teotihuacan. These recorded events strongly suggest that Siyah K’ak’ led a Teotihuacan invasion that defeated the native Tikal king, who was captured and immediately executed. Siyah K'ak' appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at Tikal itself; roughly {{at the time of the}} conquest, a group of Teotihuacan natives were apparently residing near the Lost World complex. He also exerted control over other cities in the area, including Uaxactun, where he became king, but did not take the throne of Tikal for himself. Within a year, the son of Spearthrower Owl by the name of Yax Nuun Ayiin I (First Crocodile) had been installed as the tenth king of Tikal while he was still a boy, being enthroned on 13 September 379. He reigned for 47 years as king of Tikal, and remained a vassal of Siyah K'ak' for as long as the latter lived. It seems likely that Yax Nuun Ayiin <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> wife from the preexisting, defeated, Tikal dynasty and thus legitimized the right to rule of his son, Siyaj Chan K'awiil II.|$|E
