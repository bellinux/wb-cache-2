5|$|In June 1717, Cosimo {{declared}} his {{wish that the}} House of Este should succeed the Electress. Charles VI had previously offered the Grand Duke territorial compensation—in {{the form of the}} State of Presidi—if he chose quickly, but reneged. In 1718, Charles VI repudiated Cosimo's decision, declaring a union of Tuscany and Modena (the Este lands) unacceptable. <b>Hereafter,</b> a stalemate existed between them.|$|E

5|$|In number theory, Znám's problem asks {{which sets}} of k {{integers}} have the property that each integer {{in the set}} is a proper divisor of {{the product of the}} other integers in the set, plus 1. Znám's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician Štefan Znám, who suggested it in 1972, although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time. One closely related problem drops the assumption of properness of the divisor, and will be called the improper Znám problem <b>hereafter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Let us not, therefore, be discouraged, though, for the present, {{we should}} see no great number of churches professedly unitarian....

5|$|Queen Catherine died {{in early}} 1464 during {{preparations}} for her husband's coronation with the Holy Crown, {{which had been}} returned by Emperor Frederick. The ceremony {{was carried out in}} full accordance with the customary law of Hungary on 29 March 1464; Archbishop of Esztergom Dénes Szécsi ceremoniously put the Holy Crown on Matthias's head in Székesfehérvár. At the Diet assembled on this occasion, the newly crowned King confirmed the liberties of the nobility. <b>Hereafter</b> the legality of Matthias's reign could not be questioned.|$|E
5|$|The Sweet <b>Hereafter</b> is a 1997 Canadian drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Atom Egoyan, starring Ian Holm, Sarah Polley and Bruce Greenwood and adapted from the novel of the same name by Russell Banks. The film {{tells the story of a}} school bus accident in a small town that results in the deaths of numerous children. A class-action lawsuit ensues, proving divisive in the community and becoming tied in with personal and family issues.|$|E
5|$|The said Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the City of Albany, {{and their}} {{successor}} shall and may forever <b>hereafter,</b> have one common seal to serve for the sealing of all and singular their affairs and business touching or concerning the said corporation. And it shall {{and may be}} lawful to and for the said Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the said city of Albany, and their successors, as they shall see cause, to break, change, alter and new make their said common seal, and as often as to them shall seem convenient.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece. However, he died before the invasion could begin. The throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I, who quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of Greece, including building two pontoon bridges across the Hellespont. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water {{as a gesture of}} their submission, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta (both of whom were at open war with Persia). Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed (<b>hereafter</b> referred to as 'the Allies'). This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E
5|$|Mom Luang Pin Malakul (<b>hereafter</b> {{referred}} to as ML Pin) was born on 24 October 1903 to Mom Rajawongse Pia (MR Pia) and Thanpuying Sa-ngiam Malakul. He was the sixth of thirteen children (although the fourth, and the only son, to survive past birth). His father, a nobleman and great-grandson of King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai, had served as King Vajiravudh's guardian during the King's overseas studies and held posts including Ambassador to the United Kingdom. MR Pia's work {{was instrumental in the}} establishment of higher education in Thailand (then known as Siam) and he later became the third Minister of Public Instruction under King Vajiravudh.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} K. guimarotae are stored at the Institute of Geological Sciences of the Free University of Berlin (<b>hereafter</b> IPFUB). Alongside the type {{specimen}} IPFUB Gui Croc 7308 - {{which consists of}} a partial skull with jaws, a vertebra from the sacrum, and two osteoderms - over 400 additional specimens are known, most of them consisting of single isolated bones. Among these, the more complete specimens are IPFUB Gui Gui Croc 7352 (tail vertebrae, femur, osteoderms); 7441 (osteoderms and ulna); 7545 (dorsal vertebrae, ischia, osteoderms); 7564 (femur, humerus, osteoderms); 7634 (dorsal vertebrae, rib, osteoderms); and 8037 (cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and osteoderms). More specimens are known, but they remain unprepared. Some specimens show the marks of scavenging.|$|E
5|$|These three works {{which we}} have {{composed}} we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities {{as well as in}} the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should <b>hereafter</b> be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or <b>hereafter.</b> If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hereafter</b> {{the simple}} name Pontus without {{qualification}} was regularly employed to denote {{the half of}} this dual province, especially by Romans and people speaking from the Roman point of view; it is so used almost always in the New Testament. The {{eastern half of the}} old kingdom was administered as a client kingdom together with Colchis. Its last king was Polemon II.|$|E
25|$|Later in the 19th century, winged cherubs {{begin to}} appear atop headstones, symbolizing the soul's escape from death's {{clutches}} into new life. In the 19th century, when white marble became the tombstone material of choice, this belief remained but was symbolized instead through neoclassical imagery of an urn and willow tree. The urn represented death, the tree rebirth in the <b>hereafter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dawkins {{finishes}} {{by arguing}} that atheism is not a recipe for despair but just the opposite; rather than viewing life as a trial that must be endured before reaching a mythical <b>hereafter,</b> an atheist sees this life as all we have, and by disclaiming a next life can take more excitement in this one. Atheism, Dawkins concludes, is life-affirming {{in a way that}} religion can never be.|$|E

It featured the same exhibits as Tutankhamen: The Golden <b>Hereafter</b> {{in a slightly different}} format. It was expected to draw more than three million people.|$|E
