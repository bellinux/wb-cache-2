2500|$|Constitutional scholar C.E.S. Franks of Queen's University {{suggested}} that the Governor General could have agreed to prorogue parliament, though {{on the condition that}} the government only manage day-to-day affairs until parliament was reconvened; the Governor General would not approve orders-in-council requiring Cabinet decisions, meaning that the government could not undertake any major policy initiatives, much like the way governments govern during an election campaign. However, a prime minister advising prorogation when facing an imminent confidence vote, as well a governor <b>general</b> refusing or <b>implementing</b> <b>conditions</b> on such a request, would all be unprecedented in Canadian history; [...] "there is no precedent whatsoever in Canada and probably in the Commonwealth," [...] Franks stated. Constitutional scholar and former advisor to governors general Ted McWhinney said that the Governor General would {{have no choice but to}} accept the Prime Minister's advice concerning prorogation, though the Prime Minister would have to defend to the electorate why he had advised this particular course.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{nuclear power}} plants, {{there are many}} cables that perform safety-related functions. These cables should <b>implement</b> <b>condition</b> {{monitoring}} during the operation period in the nuclear power plant, {{in order to assess}} the remaining qualified life and extend the qualified life. In this study we focused on the indenting method which can measure the hardness of the cable jacket. This method is selected because it is non-destructive and requires short testing time and small sized equipment. In order to address the problems with the existing indenting test equipment, we developed new indenting test equipment, which could automatically move {{on the surface of the}} object cable. The newly developed equipment is designed for a small-sized and light-weight robot using wireless communication in order to <b>implement</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring in a harsh environment or locations that are inaccessible to the tester. The developed wireless cable indenting robot is composed of three parts, which are mechanical and electrical hardware parts and remote-control part. In order to analyze the degradation tendency of the cable, we prepared four thermally aged specimens and one un-aged specimen. Using the developed robot, we measured the modulus of the cable jacket of each specimen. The test data showed that the modulus of the cable jacket increased linearly as the accelerated aging time increased. From these results, we can analyze the degradation trends pertaining to cables installed in nuclear power plant according to the operation period...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Conditioned slicing is a {{powerful}} generalisation of staticand dynamic slicing which has applications to many problems in software maintenance and evolution, including re-use, re-engineering and program comprehension.
