One study finds that interstate wars have important impacts on the fate of political regimes, and that the probability that a political leader will fall from power {{in the wake of a}} lost war is particularly high in <b>democratic</b> <b>states</b> [...]|$|R
5|$|A poorly educated but {{politically}} astute lawyer, Taylor began {{climbing the}} political ladder by holding local offices {{in his native}} Butler County. Though he was a Republican in an overwhelmingly <b>Democratic</b> <b>state,</b> divisions in the majority party resulted in his election as Attorney General of Kentucky on a ticket with the Commonwealth's first Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Four years later, Taylor was elected in 1899 to the governorship.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's {{political}} polarity {{continued to}} worsen after the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) made freeing the slaves a war goal. Many of the formerly pro-war Democrats moved to openly oppose the war, and Governor Morton began {{a crackdown on}} dissidents. During one notorious incident in May 1863, the governor had soldiers disrupt a <b>Democratic</b> <b>state</b> convention in Indianapolis, causing what would latter {{be referred to as}} the Battle of Pogue's Run. No regular session of the Indiana General Assembly was convened until June 1865.|$|E
5|$|A Republican in a {{predominantly}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>state,</b> Willson suffered several defeats in his canvasses for public office. His 1879 loss in an election for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky Senate marked the first in a string of political defeats. He failed in bids to represent Kentucky's Fifth District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1884, 1886, 1888, and 1892. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1884, 1888, 1892, 1904, 1908, and 1916.

40|$|This {{paper is}} written in {{response}} to John Horgan and Michael J. Boyle, whose article, ‘The Case Against a “Critical Terrorism Studies”’, appeared in the last {{issue of the journal}} Critical Studies on Terrorism. The paper addresses the claim that the call for a greater emphasis on state terrorism by liberal <b>democratic</b> <b>states</b> in terrorism studies constitutes a ‘reinventing of the wheel’. I show that there continues to be a selective application of definitions of terrorism so that state terrorism in which liberal <b>democratic</b> <b>states</b> are complicit continues to be widely ignored. This results in considerable gaps in the literature, which I identify. I argue that the absence of state terrorism by liberal <b>democratic</b> <b>states</b> from debate results from a complex range of factors that influence scholars across the social sciences, which I discuss in detail. I then show that a credible research agenda exists and is already being pursued by Critical Terrorism Studies scholars, and that that this goes well beyond simply reinventing the wheel. Finally I show that where work on state terrorism by liberal <b>democratic</b> <b>states</b> is concerned, an explicit aim is to explore the use of state terrorism within the broader context of the foreign policy objectives of liberal <b>democratic</b> <b>states.</b> Those objectives have consistently involved widening access to resources and markets in the global South, and competing for political and economic dominance. I show that a priority of those working on state terrorism by liberal <b>democratic</b> <b>states</b> should be to offer alternatives to foreign policy practices that involve state terrorism and other forms of repression...|$|R

5|$|A Republican in a {{primarily}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>state,</b> Willson suffered several defeats {{for public}} office, but was elected governor of Kentucky {{on his second}} attempt. Due to {{his handling of the}} Black Patch Tobacco Wars and his pardoning of several individuals involved in the assassination of Democratic governor William Goebel, Willson drew the ire of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. As a result, few of his proposed reforms were considered by the legislature. His term ended in 1911, and in 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Following this defeat, Willson retired to Louisville, where he died in 1931.|$|E
5|$|As Gingrich {{primed for}} another {{run in the}} 1978 elections, Flynt decided to retire. Gingrich {{defeated}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>State</b> Senator Virginia Shapard by 7,500 votes. Gingrich was re-elected six times from this district. He faced a close general election race once—in the House elections of 1990—when he won by 978 votes in a race against Democrat David Worley. Although the district was trending Republican at the national level, conservative Democrats continued to hold most local offices, {{as well as most}} of the area's seats in the General Assembly, well into the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very <b>Democratic</b> <b>state,</b> and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E

5|$|Clements {{began his}} {{campaign}} for re-election in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate favored by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly of a heart attack. With the Democratic primary already over, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>State</b> Central Committee was charged with selecting a candidate to run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had favored Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary {{had a very good}} chance of winning, but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the Republican candidates.|$|E

Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.|$|E

5|$|As a Republican in {{a heavily}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>state,</b> Bradley found little success {{early in his}} {{political}} career. He was defeated for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate twice each. After rising to national prominence with his speech seconding the presidential nomination of Ulysses S. Grant at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he was nominated for governor in 1887. Although he lost the contest to Simon Bolivar Buckner, he reduced the usual Democratic majority substantially. He was again nominated for governor in 1895. Capitalizing on divisions in the Democratic Party over the issue of free silver, he defeated Parker Watkins Hardin in the general election. His term was marked by political struggles and violence. He was an advocate for blacks and did much to advance their status in the state, but was unable to enact much of his reform agenda because of a hostile Democratic majority in the state legislature.|$|E

Crittenden maintained that he supported Clay for the presidency over anyone else, but he had believed that Clay {{did not intend to}} seek the Whig nomination in 1848. After Clay announced his candidacy, Crittenden said, he remained neutral in the Whigs' choice. In the gubernatorial election, Crittenden defeated Powell by a vote of 65,860 to 57,397. He resigned his Senate seat to assume the governorship.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher {{graduated}} from the University of Kentucky and joined the United States Air Force to pursue his dream of becoming an astronaut.

Deteriorating eyesight eventually ended those hopes, and he entered private practice as a physician and conducted services as a Baptist lay minister. He became active in politics and was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1994. Two years later he ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but lost to incumbent Scotty Baesler. When Baesler retired to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate, Fletcher again ran for the congressional seat and defeated <b>Democratic</b> <b>state</b> senator Ernesto Scorsone.
