40|$|<b>Franchising</b> {{is a form}} of {{business}} arrangement which has been claimed to offer a high possibility {{of business}} success. The reason for its growing support {{may be due to the}} benefits <b>franchising</b> offers to the individuals (franchisees), the organisations (franchisors), the public and the whole economy. The notion that <b>franchising</b> offers a successful guarantee for business operations warrants investigation into what factors contribute to likely success. The characteristics of <b>franchise</b> firms have been identified as a significant factor in ensuring <b>franchise</b> success. In this study, <b>franchise</b> firms were classified into four groups using hierarchical cluster analysis: the beginners, the developers, the growers and the matures. The profiles were tested against reported performance measures, indicating that <b>franchise</b> firms in the growing group outperform firms in other groups. However, this is only one component which may influence a successful <b>franchise</b> development. Relationship management is a second, critical area in building a strong <b>franchise</b> network. Some significant relationship building factors are explored in this thesis. Control, influence strategy, franchisee information asymmetry and communication strategy were found to be significant factors which lead to <b>franchise</b> competitive advantage. The results show that control and coercive influence strategy negatively influence <b>franchise</b> outcomes, while noncoercive influence strategy, information asymmetry and communication strategy positively enhance the <b>franchise</b> relationship. The results of multiple regression analyses also indicate that the combined effects of these <b>franchise</b> strategies have a significant impact on <b>franchise</b> outcomes; namely, financial performance, <b>franchise</b> goal congruence and franchisee satisfaction. The findings suggest that <b>franchise</b> firms can adjust their strategies to enhance their business success. Control, influence, information and information strategies can be used to maintain and induce healthy <b>franchise</b> relationships within the <b>franchise</b> dyad. The study also significantly extends the existing understanding of <b>franchise</b> heterogeneity theories, key criteria of <b>franchise</b> business competitiveness, the unique business relationship between franchisor and franchisee and <b>franchise</b> factors contributing to <b>franchise</b> success in the current <b>franchising</b> literature...|$|R
