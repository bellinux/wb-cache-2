5|$|The Split Agreement was {{a turning}} point in the Bosnian War as well as an {{important}} factor in the Croatian War of Independence. It led to a large-scale deployment of the HV <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina and the capture of strategic positions in Operation Summer '95. This in turn allowed the quick capture of Knin, the capital of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and the lifting of the siege of Bihać soon thereafter, during Operation Storm. Subsequent HV offensives <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, supported by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), as well as NATO air campaign <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, shifted the military balance in the Bosnian War, contributing to the start of peace talks, leading to the Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the RSK led the Bosnian Serbs to realise that a {{settlement}} <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina must be negotiated as soon as possible, and reversed the tide of {{the war against the}} Serbs, giving US diplomacy a strong boost. The success of Operation Storm also represented a strategic victory in the Bosnian War as it lifted the siege of Bihać, and allowed the Croatian and Bosnian leadership to plan a full-scale military intervention in the VRS-held Banja Luka areaone aimed at creating a new balance of power <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, a buffer zone along the Croatian border, and contributing to the resolution of the war. The intervention materialized as Operation Mistral 2 in September 1995. Combined with a NATO air campaign <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, it led to the start of peace talks that would result in the Dayton Agreement a few months later. The development also led to the restoration of the remaining Serb-held areas in eastern Slavonia and Baranja to Croatian control through the Erdut Agreement, ending the Croatian War of Independence in November.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the ICTY {{secretly}} indicted Arkan for {{war crimes}} carried out in Sanski Most in 1995, but not for those in Bijeljina.

In 1999, Milošević was indicted for carrying out a genocidal campaign that included Bijeljina and other locations <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, among other charges, but he died mid-trial in March 2006. In February 2000, Plavšić and Momčilo Krajišnik, the speaker of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, were indicted for the same genocidal campaign <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, among other charges. On 2 October 2002, Plavšić pleaded guilty to persecuting the non-Serb populations in 37 municipalities <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, including Bijeljina. This plea was entered under an agreement that involved the prosecution moving to dismiss the remaining charges. She was subsequently sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. On 27 September 2006, Krajišnik was found guilty on a five counts of crimes against humanity, including the same count as Plavšić regarding the persecution of non-Serb populations in municipalities including Bijeljina, but he was found not guilty of genocide. In 2009, he was handed a twenty-year prison sentence. After serving two-thirds of her sentence, Plavšić was released in October 2009. Krajišnik was released in August 2013, having served two-thirds of his sentence (including time spent in custody).|$|E
5|$|Izetbegović, who {{had hoped}} to prevent Bosnia Herzegovina from falling under the {{influence}} of Croatia or Serbia, signed the agreement after Stjepan Kljuić, president of the Croatian Democratic Union's (HDZ) branch <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, was replaced by Tuđman with Mate Boban, who blocked the delivery of supplies to Sarajevo where a siege was under way and had proclaimed an independent Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia (HR-HB). The agreement fell apart in October after a number of events including the assassination of Blaž Kraljević, leader of Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, the fall of the areas of Posavina, Bosanski Brod, and Jajce {{into the hands of the}} Army of Republika Srpska (VRS), and after a major battle broke out between the HVO and the ARBiH in Prozor.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{the limited}} scope of Operation Summer '95, the Split Agreement became a {{fundamental}} instrument to change the overall strategic situation <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina where Bosnian Serbs had had the upper hand {{since the beginning of}} the Bosnian war, as well as in Croatia, where the front lines had been largely static since the 1992 Sarajevo armistice. As Operation Summer '95 concluded, the RSK and Republika Srpska changed their priority from smashing the Bihać pocket to fending off a possible Croatian offensive to capture Knin (advancing from the recently gained territory <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina). RSK leaders Milan Martić and Mile Mrkšić agreed with UN Special Representative Yasushi Akashi to withdraw from the Bihać area on 30 July, hoping the move would contribute to averting the Croatian attack. Albeit, the attack materialized days later as Operation Storm, a decisive victory to the HV in the Croatian War of Independence.|$|E

5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} the acceptance and start of {{implementation of the}} Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February 1 March 1992 referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In {{the final days of}} March, the Bosnian Serb army bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the HV 108th Brigade in response. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina faced the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, as well as the HV, which occasionally supported HVO operations.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War, III Corps {{headquarters}} itself saw {{no major}} contingencies, however it saw numerous units under its command deploy to contingencies around the world. III Corps units were sent to Grenada, Panama, Honduras, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq. In the fall of 1990, two 6th Cavalry Brigade (Air Combat) units deployed to Iraq during Operation Desert Shield. One of those units was 2nd Battalion, 158th Aviation Regiment, a Chinook battalion from Fort Hood. Other corps units also provided humanitarian support for Operation Restore Hope in Somalia.

5|$|In March 1995, while NATO was {{planning}} {{a new strategy}} in support of peacekeeping operations <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, a ceasefire brokered by former US President Jimmy Carter between the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine; ARBiH) and the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske; VRS) expired and fighting resumed. As the struggle gradually widened, the ARBiH launched a large-scale offensive around Sarajevo. In response, the VRS seized heavy weapons from a UN-guarded depot and began shelling targets around the city, prompting the UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Rupert Smith, to request NATO air strikes against the VRS. NATO responded on 25 and 26 May 1995 by bombing a VRS ammunition dump in the Bosnian Serb capital, Pale. The mission {{was carried out by}} United States Air Force F-16s and Spanish Air Force EF-18A Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs. In response, the VRS seized 377 UNPROFOR hostages and used them as human shields for a variety of potential targets <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, forcing NATO to end the air strikes.|$|E
5|$|In November 1994, the Siege of Bihaća {{battle of}} the Bosnian Warentered a {{critical}} stage as the VRS and the RSK came close to capturing the town. A strategic area since June 1993, Bihać {{had been one of}} six United Nations Safe Areas established <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina. The US administration considered that if Serb forces captured the city, the war would intensify and cause the worst humanitarian disaster of the war to that point. The US, France and the UK were divided about protecting the area. The US called for airstrikes against the VRS, but the French and the British opposed them, citing safety concerns and a desire to maintain the neutrality of French and British troops serving with the UNPROFOR <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina. In turn, the US was unwilling to commit ground troops. According to David Halberstam, the Europeans recognized that the US was free to propose military confrontation with the Serbs while relying on the European powers to block any such move. French president François Mitterrand discouraged any military intervention, greatly helping the Serb war effort. The French stance reversed after Jacques Chirac became President of France in May 1995; Chirac pressured the British to adopt a more aggressive approach. Denying Bihać to the Serbs was also strategically important to Croatia, and Chief of the Croatian General Staff General Janko Bobetko considered that the fall of Bihać would end Croatia's war effort.|$|E

5|$|In {{a meeting}} of the Croatian and US Governments and {{military}} officials held on 29 November 1994, the Croatian representatives proposed an attack on Serb-held territory from Livno <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, in order to draw off part of the forces besieging Bihać and to prevent its capture by the Serbs. The U.S. officials gave no response to the proposal and Operation Winter '94 was ordered the same day. Besides contributing to the defence of Bihać, the attack advanced positions held by the HV and the HVO nearer to supply routes vital to the RSK.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1998, the {{division}} received notice {{that it would be}} serving as senior headquarters of Task Force Eagle, providing a peacekeeping force to support the ongoing operation within the Multi-National Division-North area of responsibility <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina. Selected division units began deploying in late summer, approximately 3,000 division soldiers deployed. After successfully performing their mission in Bosnia, the division units conducted a Transfer of Authority, relinquishing their assignments to soldiers of the 49th Armored Division, Texas National Guard. By early summer 2000, all 10th Mountain Division soldiers had returned safely to Fort Drum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, there were still some intermittent, mainly artillery, attacks from Serb-held areas <b>in</b> <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina on the Dubrovnik area and elsewhere.

Such a possibility was repeatedly stated by Tuđman after Storm. The threat was underlined by the movement of troops to the region in mid-October, as well as a repeat of an earlier threat to intervene militarily—specifically saying that the Croatian Army could intervene if no peace agreement was reached {{by the end of the}} month.|$|E
