5|$|Mackintosh's first Antarctic {{experience}} was as second officer on Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition, 1907–09. Shortly {{after his arrival}} in the Antarctic, a shipboard accident destroyed <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye,</b> and he {{was sent back to}} New Zealand. He returned in 1909 to participate in the later stages of the expedition; his will and determination in adversity impressed Shackleton, and led to his Ross Sea party appointment in 1914.|$|E

5|$|William D. Haywood {{was born}} in 1869 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. His father, a former Pony Express rider, died of {{pneumonia}} when Haywood was three years old. His maternal grandfather was an Afrikaner born in the Orange Free State in 1820. At age nine, he injured <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> while whittling a slingshot with a knife, permanently blinding <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye.</b> Haywood never had his damaged eye replaced with a glass eye; when photographed, he would turn his head to show his left profile. That same year, he began working in the mines, never having received much formal education. After brief stints as a cowboy and a homesteader, he returned to mining in 1896. High-profile {{events such as the}} gradual demise of the Molly Maguires, the Haymarket Massacre in 1886 and the Pullman Strike in 1894 fostered Haywood's interest in the labor movement.|$|E
5|$|Nicolls {{participated in}} an {{unsuccessful}} land and naval attack on Fort Bowyer on 15 September. In the fighting, Nicolls was wounded severely three times, and he lost the use of <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> for life. The taking of Pensacola in November by an American force under Andrew Jackson forced Nicolls to retreat to the Apalachicola River with freed slaves from Pensacola. There, Nicolls regrouped at Prospect Bluff, and rallied Indians and refugee ex-slaves living free in Florida, recruiting the latter into his detached unit of the Corps of Colonial Marines.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in McMurdo Sound on 29 January 1908, Nimrods progress southward to the Discovery base at Hut Point {{was blocked by}} frozen sea. Shackleton decided {{to wait a few}} days {{in the hope that the}} ice would break up. During this delay, second officer Aeneas Mackintosh suffered an accident that led to the loss of <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye.</b> After emergency surgery by Marshall and Mackay, he was forced to relinquish his shore party place and go back to New Zealand with Nimrod. He recovered sufficiently to return with the ship in the following season.|$|E

5|$|While Athens was {{preoccupied with}} the Social War (357–355 BC), PhilipII retook Amphipolis from them in 357BC and the {{following}} year recaptured Pydna and Potidaea, the latter of which he {{handed over to the}} Chalcidian League as promised in a treaty. In 356BC, he took Crenides, refounding it as Philippi, while his general Parmenion defeated the Illyrian king Grabos of the Grabaei. During the 355–354BC siege of Methone, PhilipII lost <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> to an arrow wound, but managed to capture the city and treated the inhabitants cordially, unlike the Potidaeans, who had been enslaved.|$|E
5|$|Disembarking at Port Melbourne in late February 1943, Derrick {{was granted}} a period of leave and {{travelled}} by train to Adelaide where he spent time with Beryl. He rejoined his battalion—now encamped in the outskirts of Adelaide—before they went by train to the Atherton Tableland for training in jungle warfare. Brought up to full strength {{by the end of}} April, the 2/48th Battalion completed its training following landing-craft exercises near Cairns. On 23 July, Derrick was attached to the 21st Brigade Headquarters but admitted to hospital for old injuries to <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> later the same day. After hospital, Derrick returned briefly to Brigade before rejoining the 2/48th Battalion on 27 August.|$|E
5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. <b>His</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} flashbacks reveals that an oracle had foretold that {{the demise of}} Olympus would come not by the revenge of the Titans, who had been imprisoned after the Great War, but by a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus and Ares {{believed}} this warrior to be Deimos, the brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand, and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but was swept aside and subsequently scarred across <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> by the Olympian. Athena stopped Ares from killing Kratos, knowing his eventual destiny. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured by Thanatos. In honor of his sibling, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark.|$|E
5|$|After Louise's death, {{and after}} bearing {{criticism}} of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox, a labor of five years that was published in 1896. His final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism {{and was unable to}} stand {{for more than a few}} minutes at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye,</b> and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery. He outlived most of his detractors, and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|The {{one great}} {{personal}} tragedy of Mitchell's {{life was a}} bizarre accident in 1872, when he was twenty years old. On a train journey from Bowdoin College to Bath, Maine, a hot cinder from the engine's smokestack flew {{in through the window}} and struck Mitchell's left eye, blinding it. After several weeks, while doctors attempted to restore this eye's sight, Mitchell's uninjured <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> suddenly underwent sympathetic blindness, rendering him completely blind. His burnt left eye eventually healed and regained its sight, but <b>his</b> uninjured <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> remained blind. The blind eye was later removed surgically, and replaced with a prosthetic glass eye. While recovering from this surgery, Mitchell wrote his story [...] "The Tachypomp".|$|R
5000|$|After a car accident, Herman {{receives}} an ocular implant {{with a camera}} to replace <b>his</b> damaged <b>right</b> <b>eye.</b> The doctor warns that he may experience [...] "glitches" [...] because the implant is still in an experimental stage, and Herman notices a young red-haired woman staring at him {{on the way out}} of the hospital. That night at his home, he is haunted by a man and young girl, both of whom appear dead. Herman calls the doctor to demand that he remove the implant, and spends the night locked in his bathroom.|$|R
5000|$|Margaret Goyder Kerr, in {{her book}} Colonial Dynasty - the Chambers family of South Australia, {{makes the point that}} the two men were {{physically}} quite different, both in build and temperament, and John wore a green satin patch over <b>his</b> blind <b>right</b> <b>eye,</b> so would never be confused by contemporaries. The historian however has great difficulty: they both signed their names [...] "J. Chambers" [...] and were involved in similar (and often the same) activities so that it is difficult if not impossible at many points to determine which brother is involved.|$|R
5|$|After {{realizing that}} no {{reinforcements}} would come, Thomas decided {{to launch a}} counter offensive. Early in {{the third week of}} September 634, Thomas drew men from all sectors of the city to form a force strong enough to break through the Gate of Thomas. He was there faced by Shurahbil with his corps of about 5,000 men. The Byzantine attack began with a concentrated shower of arrows against the Muslims. The Byzantine infantry, covered by the archers on the wall, rushed through the gate and fanned out into battle formation. Thomas himself led the assault. During this action, Thomas was struck in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> by an arrow. Unsuccessful in breaking the Muslim lines, the Byzantines retreated back to the fortress. The wounded Thomas is said to have sworn to take a thousand eyes in return. He ordered another great sortie for that night.|$|E
5|$|British forces {{landed at}} Calvi on 19 June, and {{immediately}} began moving guns ashore {{to occupy the}} heights surrounding the town. While Nelson directed a continuous bombardment of the enemy positions, Stuart's men began to advance. On 12 July Nelson was {{at one of the}} forward batteries early in the morning when a shot struck one of the sandbags protecting the position, spraying stones and sand. Nelson was struck by debris in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> and was forced to retire from the position, although his wound was soon bandaged and he returned to action. By 18 July most of the enemy positions had been disabled, and that night Stuart, supported by Nelson, stormed the main defensive position and captured it. Repositioning their guns, the British brought Calvi under constant bombardment, and the town surrendered on 10 August. However, Nelson's right eye had been irreparably damaged and he eventually lost all sight in it.|$|E
5|$|Cotto and Judah {{delivered}} an all-action brawl, {{but after}} weathering some difficult early rounds as he figured out Judah's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed, Cotto {{took over the}} bout. In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was bleeding from a cut over <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes, but Judah stayed upright. Early in the eleventh round, Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah to the canvas. He managed {{to get to his}} feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along the ropes as he continued to throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.|$|E
25|$|Drachma: A 55-year-old man {{who lost}} <b>his</b> <b>right</b> arm, <b>right</b> <b>eye,</b> and only son while {{fighting}} the giant arc-whale Rhaknam.

40|$|A 62 -year-old man {{underwent}} an uneventful cataract {{surgery in}} the left eye following retrobulbar anesthesia. Fifteen minutes after the surgery, the patient had visual loss in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> (unoperated) <b>eye,</b> headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. The bandage on the left (operated) eye was removed and the initial ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral dilated pupils with absence of light perception. His fundus examination and vital signs were unremarkable. Immediately, a computerized tomography (CT) was performed to scan both orbit and brain. The orbit CT revealed air bubbles within the left optic nerve sheath, which confirmed inadvertent injection and administration of anesthetic medications into the optic nerve sheath. Within three hours, meningeal irritation signs recovered spontaneously and visual acuity improved to 20 / 20 in the <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> and 20 / 40 in the left eye...|$|R
50|$|Turpin and Sennett both {{appeared}} as themselves (in Technicolor) in Hollywood Cavalcade (1939), a partly fictionalized {{movie about the}} silent-film era. This movie contains a sequence in which Turpin reports for work and prepares to go onto the set in character. In the dressing room {{he picks up a}} hand mirror and checks his reflection as he deliberately crosses his eyes as extremely as possible. In this sequence, {{it can be seen that}} Turpin's left eye was actually normal when he was not performing, and that he intentionally crossed it (to match <b>his</b> misaligned <b>right</b> <b>eye)</b> as part of his screen character.|$|R
5|$|In April and May 1794, seamen from Agamemnon, led by Nelson, helped {{capture the}} Corsican town of Bastia. The French {{surrendered}} on 21 May, after a 40-day siege. After this action, Agamemnon {{was forced to}} sail to Gibraltar to undergo urgent repairs, the ship having become very worn out after just 16 months at sea, despite having undergone a fairly extensive refit just prior to being recommissioned. Upon completion of her repairs, Agamemnon returned to Corsica, anchoring south of Calvi on 18 June. After Hood arrived with additional ships, Agamemnon contributed guns and men to the 51-day siege of Calvi, during which time Nelson lost the sight in <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> when a French shot kicked sand and grit into his face. The town surrendered on 10 August, Agamemnon having lost six men in the engagement. Shortly thereafter the inhabitants of Corsica declared themselves to be subjects of His Majesty King George III.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was born}} in Pinner, Middlesex on 4 March 1923 to Capt. Charles Trachsel Caldwell-Moore MC (died 1947) and Gertrude (née White) (died 1981). His family moved to Bognor Regis, and {{subsequently}} to East Grinstead where he spent his childhood. His youth was marked by heart problems, which left him in poor health and he was educated at home by private tutors. He developed an interest in astronomy {{at the age of}} six and joined the British Astronomical Association at the age of eleven. He was invited to run a small observatory in East Grinstead at the age of 14, after his mentor – who ran the observatory – was killed in a road accident. At the age of 16 he began wearing a monocle after an oculist told him <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> was weaker than his left. Three years later, he began wearing a full set of dentures.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1972, {{while driving}} {{home from a}} session of work on his injured {{shoulder}} with the Stoke physiotherapist, Banks lost control of his new Ford Consul (a re-badged Ford Granada Mk 1) car, which {{ended up in a}} ditch. He had attempted to overtake a car on a sharp bend and collided with an oncoming Austin A60 van. He was taken to the North Staffordshire Hospital and during an operation received 200 stitches in his face and over 100 micro-stitches inside the socket of <b>his</b> <b>right</b> <b>eye,</b> and was told the chances of saving the sight in his eye were 50–50. His sight never returned, and as the loss of binocular vision severely limited his abilities as a goalkeeper, he retired from professional football the following summer.|$|E
5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} LAX against Beer Money, Inc. {{in the next}} encounter. Jacqueline {{accompanied}} Beer Money to the ring, while Salinas and Héctor Guerrero accompanied LAX. The duration of the encounter was 14 minutes and 15 seconds. Filthee, Grandmaster Caz, and Melle Mel performed LAX's theme during their entrance. Near {{the end of the}} contest, Jacqueline and Salinas both interfered in the match. This led to Roode smacking Homicide in <b>his</b> injured <b>right</b> <b>eye</b> with a beer bottle while the referee was not looking. Storm then gained the pinfall to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship for his team.|$|R
