25|$|On 29 December 1993 Union Rotorua {{was about}} 27 {{miles south of}} Sydney Heads, en route for Melbourne, when a fire {{broke out in the}} gas turbine house. It was {{established}} that the seat of the fire was in one of the cubicles of the 6.6 kilovolt switchboard, which distributed power from the <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> to the propulsion motors and auxiliary electrical systems. Initial attempts to fight the fire with extinguishers proved to be ineffective and a decision was made to utilise the fixed fire fighting medium and flood the space with CO2. This was effective in extinguishing the fire. With the high voltage switchboard out of commission, the vessel was towed to Sydney, where it remained for three months undergoing repairs.|$|E

5000|$|Her {{diesel-electric}} plant {{includes four}} diesel generators and a <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generator.</b> The diesel generators are Wärtsilä 46 series common rail engines, {{two of the}} straight 9-cylinder configuration, {{and two of the}} straight 8-cylinder configuration. The 8- and 9-cylinder engines can produce approximately 8 and 9 MW of power respectively. These engines are fueled with Heavy Fuel oil (HFO or bunker c) and Marine Gas Oil (MGO) depending on the local regulations regarding emissions, as MGO produces much lower emissions but is much more expensive. The <b>gas</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>generator</b> is a GE 2500, producing a peak of 25 MW of power and being fueled by MGO. This generator is much more expensive to run than the diesel generators, and is used mostly in areas, such as Alaska, where the emissions regulations are strict. It is also used when top speed is required to make it to a port in a short time period. There are two propulsion electric motors which drive fixed-pitch propellers and six thrusters used during maneuvering; three bow and three stern. The propulsion electric motors (PEMs), are conventional synchronous motors made by Alston Motors. The two motors are each rated to 20 MW and have a maximum speed of 154 rpm.
