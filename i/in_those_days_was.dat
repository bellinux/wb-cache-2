25|$|Travelling from NSW to Victoria <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>was</b> very difficult. Supporters of {{federation}} {{included the}} NSW premier Sir Henry Parkes whose 1889 Tenterfield Speech (given in Tenterfield) was pivotal in gathering support for NSW involvement. Edmund Barton, later to become Australia's first Prime Minister, was another strong advocate for federation and a meeting held in Corowa in 1893 drafted an initial constitution.|$|E
25|$|The main {{societal}} {{function of}} the nobility <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>was</b> to provide military officers and civil servants for the grand ducal state. Competition for administrative, judicial and military positions ("offices") was the prevalent life of the Finnish nobility, {{and for the most}} part also their main source of income. New ennoblements were granted mostly on the basis of government career.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{the mining}} {{establishment}} of Delamar Ghost Town, Nevada was ruined by a dry-mining process {{that produced a}} silicosis-causing dust. After hundreds of deaths from silicosis, the town was nicknamed The Widowmaker. The problem <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>was</b> somewhat resolved with an addition of a nozzle to the drill which sprayed a mist of water, turning dust raised by drilling into mud, but this inhibited mining work.|$|E

His parents worked long hours and Piazzolla soon learned to take care of himself on the streets despite having a limp. At home he would listen to his father's records of the tango orchestras of Carlos Gardel and Julio de Caro, and was exposed to jazz and classical music, including Bach, from an early age. He began to play the bandoneon after his father spotted one in a New York pawn shop in 1929.|$|E
25|$|The {{meeting for}} {{nominations}} for the by-election {{was held in}} the Tokomairiro Court House in Milton—which <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>was</b> called Tokomairiro or Tokomairaro, as why the Court House is called that way—on 31 March 1865. This was following a report by the Otago Daily Times on 23 March 1865 that the Returning Officer had selected that date. Up until two years previously, the Court House in Dunedin hosted the nomination meeting, and this was the first Bruce election with the nominations held in Tokomairiro. The Returning Officer John Dewe—having read the election notice and the writ—called upon the various electors to declare their nominations of candidates. The number of electors present was approximately 30, yet for a considerable time no elector announced their nomination.|$|E
25|$|A good-sized mining camp {{developed}} at the site, which included a blacksmith shop, butcher shop, electric lighting, and at least 150 homes. There were four mining shafts, and a period photo of Shaft #1 shows a large enclosed headframe (shafthouse) tram and {{what appears to be}} a reduction works of some kind (smokestack and large building). It is said the mine produced about 100 tons of pyrite a day, and the iron sulfide was used to produce sulfuric acid, a commercially important chemical. Charlemont claims to be the first electrified town in Massachusetts, so it is possible that power was then run to the mining camp. The miners are said to have earned $12–15 per day (that claim has not been verified), which <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>was</b> excellent pay.|$|E

25|$|It was {{the vision}} of his mentor, Prof. C. Mahadevan of Andhra University, that {{launched}} him on his doctoral studies in what later {{came to be known}} as nuclear geology. Geology <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>was</b> just hammer and hand lens affair. He did doctoral research in radioactivity studies using the equipment that he built himself with the help of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. It was the first doctoral thesis on nuclear geology in India and was examined by Arthur Holmes, F.R.S. of UK, J. Tuzo Wilson, F.R.S., of Canada, and Louis Ahrens then at Oxford. Later he did post-doctoral work on lead isotopes with Clair Patterson in Caltech in 1957, and Rb – Sr and K – Ar dating with S. Moorbath in Oxford, England, in 1963.|$|E
25|$|She was {{the most}} extravagantly {{decorated}} warship in the Royal Navy, completely adorned from stern to bow with gilded carvings against a black background, made by John Christmas and Mathias Christmas after a design by Anthony van Dyck. The money spent making her, £65,586 (equal to £ today), helped to create the financial crisis for Charles I {{that contributed to the}} English Civil War. Charles had imposed a special tax, the 'Ship Money', to make possible such large naval expenditure. The gilding alone cost £6,691 (equal to £ today), which <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>was</b> the price of an average warship. She carried 102 bronze cannon (King Charles explicitly ordered such a high number) and was thereby at the time the most powerfully armed ship in the world. The cannon were made by John Browne.|$|E
25|$|The rabbis of the Talmud {{and later}} times {{interpreted}} the Shmita laws {{in various ways}} to ease the burden they created for farmers and the agricultural industry. The Heter Mechirah (leniency of sale), developed for the Shmita year of 1888–1889, permitted Jewish farmers to sell their land to non-Jews {{so that they could}} continue to work the land as usual during Shmita. This temporary solution to the impoverishment of the Jewish settlement <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>was</b> later adopted by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel as a permanent edict, generating ongoing controversy between Zionist and Haredi leaders to this day. There is a major debate among halakhic authorities as to {{what is the nature of}} the obligation of the Sabbatical year nowadays. Some say it is still biblically binding, as it has always been. Others hold that it is rabbinically binding, since the Shmita only biblically applies when the Jubilee year is in effect, but the Sages of the Talmud legislated the observance of the Shmita anyway as a reminder of the biblical statute. And yet others hold that the Shmita has become purely voluntary. An analysis by respected posek and former Sephardic Chief Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef in his responsa Yabi'a Omer (Vol. 10), accorded with the middle option, that the Biblical obligation holds only when a majority of the Jewish people is living in the Biblical Land of Israel and hence the Shmita nowadays is a rabbinic obligation in nature. This approach potentially admits for some leniencies which would not be possible if the Shemitah were biblical in origin, including the aforementioned sale of the land of Israel. Haredi authorities, on the other hand, generally follow the view of the Chazon Ish, that the Shmita continues to be a Biblical obligation.|$|E

500|$|Jack {{spent much}} of his youth in Youngstown. He {{observed}} in his autobiography that his experiences there molded his sensibilities. Warner wrote: [...] "J.

There was a murder or two almost every Saturday night in our neighborhood, and knives and brass knuckles were standard equipment for the young hotheads on the prowl." [...] Warner claimed that he briefly belonged to a street gang based at Westlake's Crossing, a notorious neighborhood located just west of the city's downtown area. Meanwhile, he received his first taste of show business in the burgeoning steel town, singing at local theaters and forming a brief business partnership with another aspiring [...] "song-and-dance man". During his brief career in vaudeville, he officially changed his name to Jack Leonard Warner. Jack's older brother Sam disapproved of these youthful pursuits. [...] "Get out front where they pay the actors," [...] Sam Warner advised Jack. [...] "That's where the money is." ...|$|E
500|$|Nenjil Or Aalayam {{received}} {{positive feedback}} from critics for its innovative storytelling. On 18 February 1962, the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan appreciated the film, mentioning {{it was an}} innovative film made like American films and a sincere attempt to improve the taste of filmgoers for quality films. Link commented, [...] "The film is, however, refreshingly different. What makes it better is, what it does not have. It has, for instance, no [...] "star value." [...] " [...] Randor Guy wrote, [...] "Sridhar proved that movies could be made with new faces, limited sets and low budgets if one had an interesting, emotionally rich story, tautly narrated on screen with pleasing music". Guy concluded his review by stating that the film would be [...] "remembered for its excellent music and impressive performances by Muthuraman, Devika, , Nagesh, Manorama and child artiste Padmini." [...] Dinamalar praised the film for showing love as a divine thing. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan wrote [...] "A Then Nilavu or a Nenjil Or Aalayam or a Kaadhalikka Neramillai, Sridhar films all, <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>was</b> considered {{the work of a}} genius with form." ...|$|E

McCartney explained: [...] "One {{of the things we}} were very much into <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>was</b> eye messages... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, {{if you look at it}} you'll see the big effort from the eyes." [...] The album's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper based on a statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover, a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges and a stand-up cut-out of the Beatles in their satin uniforms.
