Every state has {{different}} laws and traditions, but buyers typically make a written offer that, when accepted (signed) by the seller, is in most localities binding on the seller. This {{is known as a}} [...] "purchase and sale" [...] contract, which may have conditions.

The Federal Circuit held a taking had occurred on remand, the scope of which was limited because the United States waived several key issues. In doing so, the Federal Circuit utilized language that understates the limitations on takings recoveries in such cases. Both the result and the remand opinion will encourage downstream landowners, suffering inundation losses traceable to flood control dam operations, to bring takings claims. This Article analyzes the possible bases on which compensation can be granted...|$|R
