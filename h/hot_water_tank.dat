5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank.</b> Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
25|$|A {{hot water}} storage tank (also called a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank,</b> thermal storage tank, hot water thermal storage unit, heat storage tank and hot water cylinder) is a water tank used for storing hot water for space heating or {{domestic}} use.|$|E
25|$|Air-air heat pumps, that extract {{heat from}} outside air and {{transfer}} this heat to inside air, {{are the most}} common type of heat pumps and the cheapest. These are similar to air conditioners operating in reverse. Air-water heat pumps are otherwise similar to air-air heat pumps, but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit, floor heating being the most efficient, and they can also transfer heat into a domestic <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> for use in showers and hot water taps of the building. However, ground-water heat pumps are more efficient than air-water heat pumps, and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems.|$|E

500|$|Like other boletes, porcini can be dried {{by being}} strung {{separately}} on twine and hung {{close to the}} ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placing them in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer {{on top of a}} boiler or <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank.</b> Another method is drying in an oven at [...] for two to three hours, then increasing the temperature to [...] until crisp or brittle. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a pressure cooker or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, and they are a major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as carrettiere (carter's sauce). The drying process is known to induce the formation of various volatile substances that contribute to the mushroom's aroma. Chemical analysis has shown that the odour of the dried mushroom is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds.|$|E

50|$|It was a {{single-stage}} {{engine in}} that air was expanded in one piston and then exhausted. The air was reheated {{after leaving the}} tank and before entering the engine. The reheater bubbled air through a <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank,</b> picking up hot water vapor to improve the engine's range. An improved engine contained a high-pressure cylinder of 5 inches operating at 50-150 lb/sq.in and a low-pressure cylinder of 8 inches, with an 8-inch piston stroke.|$|E
50|$|This value {{depends on}} the size of the storage unit (<b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> or storage battery), the size of the {{harvesting}} surface (sun collection surface or surface area of photovoltaic modules), and on the amount of energy required.

25|$|Corrosion {{resistance}} {{is essential in}} heat transfer applications where fluids are involved, such as in <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>tanks,</b> radiators, etc. The only affordable material that has similar corrosion resistance to copper is stainless steel. However, the thermal conductivity of stainless steel is 1/30th that of copper. Aluminium tubes are not suitable for potable or untreated water applications because it corrodes at pH<7.0 and releases hydrogen gas.|$|R
