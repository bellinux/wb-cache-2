5000|$|Helper {{dependent}} viruses {{can also}} occur in nature without being [...] "gutted". The term satellite virus {{has been given}} to a large group of viruses that all require presence of another virus to replicate. Many of these are plant viruses, but animal viruses {{can be seen in the}} cases of dependoviruses. Within the family parvoviridae, the <b>dependovirus</b> genus was given a distinct classification due to their dependence on another virus. The most widely known <b>dependovirus</b> is adeno-associated virus (AAV) which was originally discovered as a contaminant of a sample of simian adenovirus. Though AAV is considered to be dependent on adenovirus, it is able to replicate in the presence of herpesvirus as well as certain cytotoxic events such as UV irradiation or some carcinogens During the course of a natural <b>dependovirus</b> infection, if the helper virus is not present, the <b>dependovirus</b> is often capable of integrating into the host genome and going into a latent phase of its life cycle—effectively waiting for the next helper virus infection. For gene therapy uses, the vector is stripped of its ability to integrate. Because AAV can deliver transgenic material in a non-replicating form, it is a strong candidate for gene therapy and is currently used in about 5% of clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|There is {{one family}} and one genus of viruses known to infect humans {{that have not}} been {{associated}} with disease: the family Anelloviridae and the genus <b>Dependovirus.</b> Both of these taxa are non-enveloped single-stranded DNA viruses.|$|E
50|$|Autonomous Parvoviruses do {{not require}} a helper virus like <b>dependoviruses.</b> The virus B19 was {{discovered}} in blood serum and infects red blood cell precursors.

40|$|The {{members of}} the family Parvoviridae are among the {{smallest}} of the DNA viruses, with a linear single-stranded genome of about 5 kilobases. Currently the family is divided into three genera, two of which contain viruses of vertebrates and a third containing insect viruses. This review concentrates on the vertebrate viruses, with emphasis on recent advances in our insights into the molecular biology of viral replication. Traditionally the vertebrate viruses have been distinguished by {{the presence or absence of}} a requirement for a coinfection with a helper virus before productive infection can occur, hence the notion that the <b>dependoviruses</b> (adeno-associated viruses [AAV]) are defective. Recent data would suggest that not only is there a great deal of structural and genetic organizational similarity between the two types of vertebrate viruses, but also there is significant similarity in the molecular biology of productive replication. What differs is the physiological condition of the host cell that renders it permissive. Healthy dividing cells are permissive for productive replication by autonomous parvoviruses; such cells result in latent infection by <b>dependoviruses.</b> For a cell to become permissive for productive AAV replication, it must have been exposed to toxic conditions which activate a latent AAV genome. Such conditions can be caused by helper-virus infection or exposure to physical (UV light) or chemical (some carcinogens) agents. In this paper the molecular biology of replication is reviewed, with special emphasis on the role of the host and the consequences of viral infection for the host...|$|R
40|$|Parvoviruses cause {{a variety}} of mild to severe {{symptoms}} or asymptomatic infections in humans and animals. During a viral met-agenomic analysis of feces from children with acute diarrhea in Burkina Faso, we identified in decreasing prevalence nucleic ac-ids from anelloviruses, <b>dependoviruses,</b> sapoviruses, enteroviruses, bocaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses, parechoviruses, ro-taviruses, cosavirus, astroviruses, and hepatitis B virus. Sequences from a highly divergent parvovirus, provisionally called bufavirus, were also detected whose NS 1 and VP 1 proteins showed< 39 % and< 31 % identities to those of previously known parvoviruses. Four percent of the fecal samples were PCR positive for this new parvovirus, including a related bufavirus species showing only 72 % identity in VP 1. The high degree of genetic divergence of these related genomes from those of other parvovi-ruses indicates {{the presence of a}} proposed new Parvoviridae genus containing at least two species.

Because the endogenous rep ORF has been replaced with transgene, exogenously provided rep genes encode the proteins required for genome replication and other viral life cycle components. The ITRs located 5' and 3' of the viral genome serve as the origin of replication.|$|E
40|$|We have {{compared}} the sequences of the putative polypeptides {{of the human}} pathogenic B 19 parvovirus with protein sequences in the National Bethesda Research Foundation Library, and have discovered a significant homology between a B 19 parvovirus non-structural (NS) protein and the T antigens of polyomaviruses and simian virus 40 (SV 40) and the putative E 1 proteins of papillomaviruses. The region of highest homology with e papovavirus proteins corresponds tothe region that is most highly conserved in the NS 1 proteins of several other parvoviruses. Studies with the T antigen of both polyomaviruses and SV 40 have implicated this region as having an ATPase activity and nucleotide-binding function. The Parvoviridae are a family of small viruses with single-stranded, linear DNA genomes approximately 5000 nucleotides in length (Siegl, 1984). The two groups of vertebrate parvoviruses are the <b>dependoviruses</b> [e. g. adeno-associated virus (AAV) ] which require a helper adenovirus or herpesvirus for replication, and the autonomously replicating parvoviruses [e. g. minute virus of mice (MVM), H-I] (Siegl, 1984). Human B 19 virus, which has recently been characterized as a parvovirus (Summers et al., 1983; Cotmore & Tattersall, 1984), is the causative agent of erythaema infectiosum and a type of reticulocytopenic aplastic crisis associated with several types of haemolytic anaemias.

40|$|Adeno-associated viruses {{are members}} of the genus <b>dependoviruses</b> of the parvoviridae family. AAV vectors are {{considered}} promising vectors for gene therapy and genetic vaccination as they can be easily produced, are highly stable and non-pathogenic. Nevertheless, transduction of cells in vitro and in vivo by AAV {{in the absence of a}} helper virus is comparatively inefficient requiring high multiplicity of infection. Several bottlenecks for AAV transduction have previously been described, including release from endosomes, nuclear transport and conversion of the single stranded DNA into a double stranded molecule. We hypothesized that the bottlenecks in AAV transduction are, in part, due to the presence of host cell restriction factors acting directly or indirectly on the AAV-mediated gene transduction. In order to identify such factors we performed a whole genome siRNA screen which identified a number of putative genes interfering with AAV gene transduction. A number of factors, yielding the highest scores, were identified as members of the SUMOylation pathway. We identified Ubc 9, the E 2 conjugating enzyme as well as Sae 1 and Sae 2, enzymes responsible for activating E 1, as factors involved in restricting AAV. The restriction effect, mediated by these factors, was validated and reproduced independently. Our data indicate that SUMOylation targets entry of AAV capsids and not downstream processes of uncoating, including DNA single strand conversion or DNA damage signaling. We suggest that transiently targeting SUMOylation will enhance application of AAV in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
50|$|Like AAV, scAAV is {{a member}} of the family Parvoviridae, {{commonly}} known as parvoviruses. These viruses are nonenveloped, single-strand DNA (ssDNA) viruses. Within Parvoviridae, scAAV further belongs to the <b>Dependovirus</b> genus, characteristically defined by an inability to replicate on their own. In nature, these viruses depend on another virus to provide replication machinery; adeno-associated virus can only replicate during an active infection of adenovirus or some types of herpesvirus. In lab use, this obstacle is overcome by addition of the helper plasmids, which exogenously expresses replication genes which AAV itself lacks.|$|E
50|$|A-MuLV {{causes a}} rapidly {{progressive}} lymphosarcoma known as Abelson disease in mice, {{which is a}} type of leukemia that does not involve the thymus. However, this is only possible when the host cell is co-infected with a helper virus which provides functions it {{needs to be able to}} replicate which it does not code for in its own genome such as a reverse transcriptase and some major structural proteins. As such, A-MuLV can be described as a <b>dependovirus.</b> A highly efficient helper virus commonly used when growing A-MuLV in vitro is Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). It causes leukemia directly by interfering with the normal growth and differentiation processes of lymphocytes. It can infect B-cells which was shown by the fact that some tumor cells can be seen to have immunoglobulins (Ig) on their surface although most tumor cells do not have characteristic receptors on their surface indicating that they are undifferentiated cells. In vitro studies have shown that lymphocyte infection produces tumor cell populations comprising three types of cells: stable productive cells, non-productive cells and cells which produced defective virus particles which are not infective.|$|E
40|$|The RNA {{transcription}} {{profile of}} the goose parvovirus (GPV) was determined, {{and it is a}} surprising hybrid of features of the Parvovirus and <b>Dependovirus</b> genera of the Parvovirinae subfamily of the Parvoviridae. Similar to the <b>Dependovirus</b> adeno-associated virus type 5, RNAs transcribed from the GPV upstream P 9 promoter, which encode the viral nonstructural proteins, were polyadenylated at a high efficiency at a polyadenylation site [(pA) p] located within an intron {{in the center of the}} genome. Efficient usage of (pA) p required a downstream element that overlaps with the polypyrimidine tract of the A 2 3 ′ splice site of the central intron. An upstream element required for efficient use of (pA) p was also identified. RNAs transcribed from the P 42 promoter, presumed to encode the viral capsid proteins, primarily extended through (pA) p and were polyadenylated at a site, (pA) d, located at the right end of the genome and ultimately spliced at a high efficiency. No promoter analogous to the <b>Dependovirus</b> P 19 promoter was detected; however, similar to minute virus of mice and other members of the Parvovirus genus, a significant portion of pre-mRNAs generated from the P 9 promoter were additionally spliced within the putative GPV Rep 1 coding region and likely encode an additional, smaller, nonstructural protein. Also similar to members of the Parvovirus genus, detectable activity of the GPV P 42 promoter was highly dependent on transactivation by the GPV Rep 1 protein in a manner dependent on binding to a cis-element located in the P 42 promoter...|$|E

The nucleotide sequence show little homology to other autonomous parvoviruses but 55 % homology to the <b>dependovirus</b> AAV 2. This homology to AAV 2 was also confirmed at the amino acid level (nonstructural protein 55 %, capsid coding region 51 %).

Through the use of large-scale bioinformatic screening for sequences homologous to exogenous mammalian viruses, we found several sequences related to human and animal parvoviruses (PVs) in the Parvovirus and <b>Dependovirus</b> genera within genomes of several mammals, including rats, wallabies, opossums, guinea pigs, hedgehogs, African elephants, and European rabbits. However, phylogenetic analysis of these endogenous parvovirus (EnPV) sequences demonstrated substantial genetic divergence from exogenous mammalian PVs characterized to date. Entire nonstructural and capsid gene sequences of a novel EnPV were amplified and genetically characterized from rat (Rattus norvegicus) genomic DNA. Rat EnPV sequences were most closely related {{to members of the}} genus Parvovirus, with > 70 % and 65 % amino acid identities to nonstructural and capsid proteins of canine parvovirus, respectively. Integration of EnPV into chromosome 5 of rats was confirmed by PCR cloning and sequence analysis of the viral and chromosomal junctions. Using inverse PCR, we determined that the rat genome contains a single copy of rat EnPV. Considering mammalian phylogeny, we estimate that EnPV integrated into the rat genome less than 30 million years ago. Comparative phylogenetic analysis done using all known representative exogenous parvovirus (ExPV) and EnPV sequences showed two major genetic groups of EnPVs, one genetically more similar to genus Parvovirus and the other genetically more similar to the genus <b>Dependovirus.</b> The full extent of the genetic diversity of parvoviruses that have undergone endogenization during evolution of mammals and other vertebrates will be recognized only once complete genomic sequences from a wider range of classes, orders, and species of animals become available...|$|E

Whereas the extreme {{left and right}} ends of this genomic clone are incomplete, the sequence clearly indicates that the two ends of viral DNA are related by inverted terminal repeats {{similar to those of}} the <b>Dependovirus</b> genus. The coding regions are complete in the cloned DNA, and the two large open reading frames which span almost the entire genome are restricted to one strand, as has been found for all other parvoviruses characterized to date. From the DNA sequence we conclude that the organization of the B 19 transcription units is similar although not identical to those of other parvoviruses. In particular, we predict that the B 19 genome may utilize a fourth promoter to transcribe mRNA encoding the major structural polypeptide, VP 2. Analysis of the putative polypeptides confirms that B 19 is only distantly related to the other parvoviruses but reveals that there is a small region in the gene probably encoding the major nonstructural protein of B 19, which is closely conserved between all of the parvovirus genomes for which sequence information is currently available...|$|E

The test material consists essentially of dead specimens collected randomly from private pet owners, local pet shops, or at occasional exotic pet fairs. Here we report the partial sequence of a putative novel parvovirus obtained from a dead checkerboard worm lizard (Trogonophis wiegmanni) that had been wild-caught in its native habitat. An in-house-developed PCR with consensus primers targeting the gene of the parvoviral capsid protein was used. Other PCRs, intended to detect certain large DNA viruses, remained negative.

40|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a small, DNA-containing <b>dependovirus</b> with {{promising}} {{potential as}} a gene delivery vehicle. Given the variety of applications of AAV-based vectors {{in the treatment of}} genetic disorders, numerous studies have focused on the immunogenicity of recombinant AAV. In general, AAV vectors appear not to induce strong inflammatory responses. We have found that AAV 2, when it infects the osteosarcoma cells U 2 OS, can initiate part of its replicative cycle in the absence of helper virus. This does not occur in untransformed cells. We set out to test whether the cellular innate antiviral defenses control this susceptibility and found that, in nonimmune normal human fibroblasts, AAV 2 induces type I interferon production and release and the accumulation of nuclear promyelocytic leukemia bodies. AAV fails to mobilize this defense pathway in the U 2 OS cells. This permissiveness is in large part due to impairment of the viral sensing machinery in these cells. Our investigations point to Toll-like receptor 9 as a potential intracellular sensor that detects AAV 2 and triggers the antiviral state in AAV-infected untransformed cells. Efficient sensing of the AAV genome and the ensuing activation of an innate antiviral response are thus crucial cellular events dictating the parvovirus infectivity in host cells.

To better understand the biology of AAV 5, we have cloned and sequenced its genome and generated recombinant AAV 5 particles. The single-stranded DNA genome is similar in length and genetic organization to that of AAV 2. The rep gene of AAV 5 is 67 % homologous to AAV 2, {{with the majority of}} the changes occurring in the carboxyl and amino termini. This homology is much less than that observed with other reported AAV serotypes. The inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) are also unique compared to those of the other AAV serotypes. While the characteristic AAV hairpin structure and the Rep DNA binding site are retained, the consensus terminal resolution site is absent. These differences in the Rep proteins and the ITRs result in a lack of cross-complementation between AAV 2 and AAV 5 as measured by the production of recombinant AAV particles. Alignment of the cap open reading frame with that of the other AAV serotypes identifies both conserved and variable regions which could affect tissue tropism and particle stability. Comparison of transduction efficiencies in a variety of cells lines and a lack of inhibition by soluble heparin indicate that AAV 5 may utilize a distinct mechanism of uptake compared to AAV 2...|$|E
40|$|The volume {{available}} in icosahedral virus capsids limits {{the size of}} viral genomes. To overcome this limitation, viruses have evolved strategies to increase their coding capacity by using more than one ORF while keeping the genome length constant. The assembly of virus capsids requires the coordinated interaction {{of a large number}} of subunits to generate a highly ordered structure in which the viral genome can be enclosed. To understand this process, it is essential to know which viral and nonviral components are involved in the assembly reaction. Here, we show that the adeno-associated virus (AAV) encodes a protein required for capsid formation by means of a nested, alternative ORF of the cap gene. Translation is initiated at a nonconventional translation start site, resulting in the expression of a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 23 kDa. This protein, designated assembly-activating protein (AAP), is localized in the host cell nucleolus, where AAV capsid morphogenesis occurs. AAP targets newly synthesized capsid proteins to this organelle and in addition fulfils a function in the assembly reaction itself. Sequence analysis suggests that also all other species of the genus <b>Dependovirus</b> encode a homologous protein in their cap gene. The arrangement of different ORFs that encode capsid proteins and an assembly factor within the same mRNA facilitates a timely coordinated expression of the components involved in the assembly process...|$|E
