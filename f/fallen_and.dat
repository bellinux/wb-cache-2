5|$|October 2011 polling showed Brown's {{approvals}} had <b>fallen</b> <b>and</b> {{he faced}} a competitive re-election if matched against Democrat Elizabeth Warren. However, his numbers in early March 2012 showed he led Warren by 8 {{points in the}} polls. In March 2012, Brown's lead had narrowed to 2.3%, within the margin of error. As of September 2012, several polls showed Warren with a lead over Brown (with one still giving Brown an edge).|$|E
5|$|Strobilurus tenacellus is a {{saprobic}} wood-rotting fungus. It fruits singly or {{in small}} groups on <b>fallen</b> <b>and</b> often partially buried cones of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), European black pine (Pinus nigra) and sometimes spruce (Picea) in coniferous and mixed forests. It is found in Europe and Asia, {{where it has been}} recorded in Japan and Jordan. In Europe, the fungus usually fruits from March to June. Its occurrence is occasional.|$|E

5|$|As of 1905, {{there were}} thirty-seven stones {{remaining}} in the circle. At the time there were conspicuous gaps on the northern and western sides of the ring, with the stones perhaps having been removed for use as road metal. In 1915 {{it was reported that}} one of the previously recorded stones had been removed but that three additional stones had been found in the circle. By 1988, Martin J. F. Fowler reported that there were only twenty-nine stones in the circle. Conversely, the following year Burl reported thirty stones, of which three had <b>fallen</b> <b>and</b> twenty-seven remained standing. Originally it may have included around a hundred stones, spaced about one metre (3 feet 6 inches) apart.|$|E
5|$|Being {{exceedingly}} {{alarmed at}} the misery into which I had <b>fallen,</b> <b>and</b> much more at that which threatened me {{in view of}} eternal death, I, duty bound, made it my first business to betake myself to your way, condemning my past life, not without groans and tears. And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me, but instead of defence, earnestly to supplicate you not to judge that fearful abandonment of your Word according to its deserts, from which in your wondrous goodness you have at last delivered me.|$|E

50|$|In 1906, Kemp {{chartered}} the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Northwest Railway Company of Texas {{and constructed}} a rail line into the wheat-producing region of Oklahoma, {{when it became}} the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Northwestern Railway. Kemp organized the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Southern Railroad, which connected Wichita Falls with the coal fields around Newcastle near Graham in Young County, Texas. He also established the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Wellington, which linked Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Wellington in Collingsworth County, Texas. Kemp {{served as president of}} each of these rail companies. In 1911, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas purchased Kemp's remaining lines, including the eighteen miles of the Wichita Falls Railway. Kemp hence helped to make Wichita Falls the hub city of northern and western Texas railroads.|$|R
40|$|Nurses help {{to ensure}} patient safety, which {{includes}} preventing <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> related injuries. The aging Veteran population, like the general population, {{is at risk}} for <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> related injuries whether at home, in hospitals or in long term care facilities. Nurses are leading practice innovations to systematically assess patients’ risk for <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> implement population based prevention interventions. To determine the effectiveness of programs, data can be analyzed {{using a variety of}} statistical measures to determine program impacts. Thus, data analysis of fall rates by type of <b>fall</b> <b>and</b> severity of <b>fall</b> related injury can help facilities examine the effectiveness of their interventions and program outcomes. Examples of actual <b>fall</b> prevention programs <b>and</b> their approaches to measurement are showcased in this article...|$|R
5|$|During a Twitter {{conversation}} with fellow comic writer Joe Hill in 2013, Moore mentioned sales of Rachel Rising had <b>fallen</b> <b>and</b> {{he may have}} to cancel it if they fell any further. Concerned fans responded by using the #SaveRachelRising hashtag in an effort to show support and promote the book. Afterwards the sales stopped falling, but they did not increase. In January 2016, Moore announced the series would end at issue 42.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942, Lindwall helped the St. George Dragons rugby league team to reach the grand final for the second {{consecutive}} year and also finished the season as the League's top point-scorer. Lindwall and his brother Jack, who played on the wing, scored all of the team's points in the grand final, Jack scoring a try and Ray kicking three goals. However they were denied by a last-minute penalty goal and St. George were defeated by Canterbury-Bankstown 11–9. All the while, the Japanese were inching ever closer to Australia. Malaya had <b>fallen</b> <b>and</b> the northern Australian city of Darwin had been the subject of Japanese air raids.|$|E
5|$|Gordon, {{operating}} out of Khartoum, helped extricate many loyal civilians who remained in Sudan, but refused ultimately to abandon the city. Contrary to his orders, he retained a small force in Khartoum and determined to give battle with the Mahdi before relinquishing control. Accordingly, Mahdist forces besieged Khartoum in March 1884, isolating the city {{from the outside world}} and placing a dire timer upon Gordon to surrender. After much delay, the British government reluctantly dispatched a relief expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley that would rapidly follow the Nile to Khartoum. Wolseley's column arrived on 28 January 1885, two days after Khartoum had <b>fallen</b> <b>and</b> General Charles Gordon's head delivered to the Mahdi.|$|E

5000|$|In 1911, the MKT {{purchased}} railroad lines {{held by the}} industrialist Joseph A. Kemp of Wichita Falls, Texas. These {{included the}} Wichita Falls Railway, an 18-mile line between Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Henrietta in Clay County; the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Northwest Railway Company of Texas; <b>and</b> the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Wellington, which provided service into Wellington in Collingsworth County. Kemp's brother-in-law, Frank Kell, was a partner {{in some of these}} lines, including the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Southern Railroad, which remained a Kemp-Kell property until it was abandoned in 1954. In 1923, the Katy acquired another Kemp/Kell property, the Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Northwestern Railway, which extended from Wichita Falls to Forgan in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The route to Forgan was abandoned in 1973, and Altus, Oklahoma, became the northern terminus of the railroad. The remaining 77-mile link between Wichita <b>Falls</b> <b>and</b> Altus was absorbed in 1991 by the Wichita, Tillman and Jackson Railway. [...] The Katy acquired the Beaver, Mead and Englewood Railroad in 1931.|$|R
5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their final offensive against {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the agony of the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow the Khmer Rouge advance.

In the new Year Zero, the Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E
5|$|Sunday was a rest day, so {{the match}} resumed on Monday, 10 February. As {{it was a}} working day, the crowd was much smaller. Rain had <b>fallen</b> <b>and</b> the sun had baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket, which caused erratic behaviour. Nat Thomson was out for a duck without {{addition}} to the overnight total, and a collapse ensued. New South Wales made only 49 in their second innings; Bannerman top-scored with 20 while six of his colleagues failed to score, while Emmett and Ulyett took four and five wickets respectively, including four wickets in four balls for the latter. England thus won by an innings and 41 runs.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{association}} between <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> fear-of-falling has been established by previous studies, the temporal ordering of the two is uncertain. Moreover, the common and unique risk {{factors that contribute to}} <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> to fear-of-falling have not been investigated in either primary health-care settings or Asian societies. The aims of this study were to examine the temporal sequencing of fear-of-falling <b>and</b> a <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> to identify the risk factors associated with the two. A prospective cohort study with three six-month measurement waves was conducted in primary-care settings in Hong Kong. The sample was derived from the waiting list control group of a randomised clinical trial, and 321 respondents participated in the three waves. They were evaluated with the Minimum Data Set for Home Care. It was found that <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> fear-of-falling at baseline were not independent predictors of respectively developing a fear-of-falling and becoming a faller, but that age was a common independent predictor for <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> the onset of a fear-of-falling. Individuals with a fear-of-falling were at risk of both <b>falling</b> <b>and</b> a fear-of-falling at 12 months. The good news is that no vicious cycle of <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> fear-of-falling was found, and modifiable risk factors, including IADL limitations, environmental hazards, and fear-of-falling were identified, so that effective prevention programmes for <b>falls</b> <b>and</b> for fear-of-falling can be designed. © 2007 Cambridge University Press. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|The fall of Melitene profoundly {{shocked the}} Muslim world: {{for the first}} time, a major Muslim city had <b>fallen</b> <b>and</b> been {{incorporated}} into the Byzantine Empire. Kourkouas followed this success by subduing parts of the district of Samosata in 936 and razing {{the city to the}} ground. Until 938, the East remained relatively calm. Historians suggest that the Byzantines were likely preoccupied with the full pacification of Melitene, and the Arab emirates, deprived of any potential support from the Caliphate, were reluctant to provoke them.|$|E
5|$|When {{the book}} edition of The Vicar of Bullhampton {{appeared}} in April 1870, it bore a preface; Trollope, who ordinarily scorned prefaces and dedications, {{felt compelled to}} justify the presentation of a character like Carry Brattle. He reiterated the points he had made regarding Formosa: that while depicting a fallen woman as glamourous or noble might lead impressionable readers to vice, a true depiction of such a woman's misery might deter readers from yielding to temptation; and might soften the hearts of parents whose daughters have <b>fallen,</b> <b>and</b> thus afford an opportunity of returning to decency.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} Houston's arrival on March 11, Andres Barcenas and Anselmo Bergaras arrived with {{news that the}} Alamo had <b>fallen</b> <b>and</b> all Texians were slain.

Realizing that the Mexican army would soon advance towards the Texian settlements, Houston advised all civilians {{in the area to}} evacuate and ordered his new army to retreat. This sparked a mass exodus, known as the Runaway Scrape, and most Texians, including members of the new government, fled east.|$|E
