25|$|In {{the case}} of a {{rebellion}} by the sepoys in Cawnpore, the most suitable defensive location for the British was the magazine located in the north of the city. It had thick walls, ample ammunition and stores, and also hosted the local treasury. However, General Wheeler decided to take refuge in the south of the city, in an entrenchment composed of two barracks surrounded by a mud wall. There was a military building site to the south of Cawnpore, where nine barracks were being constructed at the dragoon barracks. The British soldiers found it difficult to dig deep trenches, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> summer season. The area also lacked good sanitary facilities, and there was only one well (which would be exposed to enemy fire in case of an attack). Also, there were several buildings overlooking the entrenchment that would provide cover for the attackers, allowing them to easily shoot down on the defenders.|$|E
500|$|Green {{described}} {{the game as}} both [...] "exceedingly simple ... yet very addictive" [...] and rated it four of five stars. McGrath wrote {{that he wanted to}} have more control over his money, and added that a store for purchasing upgrades would have been useful. He thought that games such as Dunjonquest and Maces and Magic handled this aspect better. McGrath suggested that the player draw their own map {{in the absence of an}} overview mapping system. He felt that his appreciation for the game grew with time and that it had the necessary hook to make him continually return and play again. Tony Roberts of Compute! considered the Commodore 64 version of the game best for its enhanced graphics. The Commodore 64 GHome Companion agreed, stating that it [...] "has some fine sprite graphics and sound effects not found in other versions of the game". Scorpia in 1993 stated that while Telengard was [...] "interesting for its time, the game would be pretty dated today" [...] compared to the Gold Box games; [...] "back then, however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> stuff, and a fun way of passing the time".|$|E
500|$|The {{positions}} {{occupied by}} the Australians had been badly damaged by the Chinese assaults and bombardments in May and June, and recent rain had also collapsed some trenches and weakened many of the wire obstacles. Yet the extensive tunnel system—dug by the Canadians the previous winter—remained intact and afforded some protection. Efforts to repair the defences and assert control in no man's land began immediately, with an aggressive patrolling program by the Australians leading to numerous clashes with Chinese patrols, while they also endured heavy shelling during this time. By day <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> and humid making conditions in the bunkers uncomfortable, while by night the defenders worked hard digging, wiring and laying minefields. The Chinese focused most of their attention on the US 7th Marine Regiment, which was occupying positions south-west of 2 RAR after having relieved the Turkish Brigade there, and thereby allowed the Australians some time to prepare. Light mortaring hit 2 RAR on 11 July, while one 3 RAR soldier was killed instantly by a [...] shell when he was observed walking along the crest-line by a Chinese position less than [...] from the Australian perimeter. The gun crew was subsequently silenced by Australian sniper fire.|$|E

2500|$|A simpler method {{consisted}} {{in putting}} lighted coals {{on the floor}} and covering the heap with a dome-shaped cover ( [...] pnigeus); when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> enough, the coals were swept aside, dough loaves were placed on the warm floor, the cover was put back in place and the coals were gathered {{on the side of the}} cover. (This method is still traditionally used in Serbia and elsewhere in the Balkans, where it is called crepulja or sač). The stone oven did not appear until the Roman period. Solon, an Athenian lawmaker of the 6th century BC, prescribed that leavened bread be reserved for feast days. By the end of the 5th century BC, leavened bread was sold at the market, though it was expensive.|$|E

2500|$|Jefferson added {{a center}} hallway and a {{parallel}} set of rooms to the structure, more than doubling its area. He removed the second full-height {{story from the}} original house {{and replaced it with}} a mezzanine bedroom floor. The interior is centered on two large rooms, which served as an entrance-hall-museum, where Jefferson displayed his scientific interests, and a music-sitting room. The most dramatic element of the new design was an octagonal dome, which he placed above the west front of the building in place of a second-story portico. The room inside the dome was described by a visitor as [...] "a noble and beautiful apartment," [...] but it was rarely used—perhaps because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> in summer and cold in winter, or because it could only be reached by climbing a steep and very narrow flight of stairs. The dome room has now been restored to its appearance during Jefferson's lifetime, with [...] "Mars yellow" [...] walls and a painted green floor.|$|E
2500|$|A {{result was}} never {{likely in the}} 4th Supertest at Bourda. When the Australians landed at Guyana they {{discovered}} it had been raining for days. On the scheduled first day play was abandoned before the players had even left for the ground. That evening the pitch was still underwater. On the second day {{the rain had stopped}} and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hot</b> and sunny. Yet the two captains, Chappell and Lloyd, decided the condition of the outfield was unfit for play, Greg Chappell describing it as a [...] "quagmire". Unfortunately for the cricketers and officials at Bourda, thousands of spectators had been allowed into the ground that morning. Ian Chappell recalls how he was visited in the dressing-rooms by the local Chief of Police and told, [...] "If there is no play today, I am afraid to tell you that I can no longer guarantee your safety at the ground." [...] The consensus was that there must, therefore, be some sort of play. The captains and umpires agreed to start play at 4pm and play for roughly an hour until the light faded. However a misinformed PA announced to the crowd that play would begin at 3pm. This enraged the volatile Chappell who then reneged on the deal and refused to play. The crowd, many of whom had been drinking rum and partying all day, sensed no play and began a riot. Both teams and the officials were locked in their dressing rooms. The Australians donned their new batting helmets and took guard with their bats, behind the bolted door. The rioters attacked the pavilion causing major damage and a couple of unnamed West Indian cricketers suffered minor injuries from broken glass. Chappell recalls a conversation after the event with West Indian wicketkeeper Deryck Murray. Murray insisted that the riot was a result of growing unhappiness at the Guyanan president Arthur Chung and that they used the abandoned cricket as an excuse. He believed that the rioters would never have intentionally harmed any of the cricketers. The words reassured some of the Australians, but many wanted to leave Guyana immediately and head to the next island, while some (about eight, which is half the squad) were considering returning to Australia. Chappell demanded his players stay and play, making a statement to the West Indian fans that they are not intimidated and will play to win. Play proceeded on the third morning as if nothing had happened. The ground was cleared of broken glass and the game played out to a draw with a century from Greg Chappell confirming his status as the outstanding batsman of the series.|$|E
