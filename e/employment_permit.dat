About 10,000 Asian workers came to Korea under this program in 1992, and there were about 57,000 trainees in Korea in June 1996. However, the trainee program experienced problems: the trainees became undocumented workers due to a difference in wages and since they were not classified as laborers, they were not protected by the Labor Standard Law. The <b>Employment</b> <b>Permit</b> Program for foreigners (the government’s foreign-labor policy since 2004) is a product achieved by a decade of interaction between Korean citizens and foreign migrant workers. However, these issues have more details to be resolved.On the legal front, the Korean state still allows foreigners to apply for low-wage jobs and excludes them from social benefits. The social dimension of nationhood is shown by public-opinion polls of Korean citizens' attitudes towards foreign workers, which demonstrate discrimination.|$|E

50|$|R.A. 9208 is {{only one}} of the laws which give {{protection}} to workers, children, and women, inter alia. The Philippines has a long history of legislation aimed at protecting the rights and welfare of children. The 1974 Labor Code of the Philippines (Presidential Decree No. 442) set the minimum age of employment at 15 years and prohibited the employment of persons below 18 years of age in hazardous undertakings. Presidential Decree No. 603 (The Child and Youth Welfare Code) permits the employment of children aged 16 years and below only if they perform light work, which is not harmful to their safety, health or normal development, and which is not prejudicial to their studies. Strict rules and regulations were issued on their rates of pay, hours of work and other conditions of employment. An <b>employment</b> <b>permit</b> also has to be secured from the Department of Labor and Employment. The 1992 child protection law, Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act) provides protection of children against abuse, commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking, and employment in illicit activities. Republic Act No. 7658 (amending RA 7610) set minimum age of employment to 15 years, and 18 years and above for hazardous work. Republic Act 7160 (The Local Government Code of 1991) includes provisions for the proper development and welfare of children at the basic political level, the Barangay. It enjoins local officials to promote and support activities for the protection and total development of children, particularly those below seven years of age, and adopt measures to prevent and eradicate drug abuse, child abuse, and juvenile delinquency. Republic Act No. 9231 (19 December 2003 - An Act Providing for the Elimination of the WFCL and Affording Stronger Protection for the Working Child) - amends R.A. No. 7610 by embodying the State policy to provide special protection to children from all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation and discrimination, and conditions prejudicial to their development, including child labour and its worst forms. It also provides stiffer penalties for their commission. It spells out the WFCL, consistent with Convention No. 182; the hours of work of working children; and ownership, usage and administration of the working child’s income. Further, it ensures working children’s access to education and training, and immediate legal, medical and psychosocial services.|$|E

Zé Soares did not score a goal, but played very well and made an assist for Levski's first goal in the match. On 9 November 2007, he received his <b>employment</b> <b>permit.</b> He was registered at BFU {{and was ready to}} play in the championship. The week after his unofficial debut (against FC Haskovo), Zé Soares was included in the group for the match against Chernomorets Burgas (match on Saturday 10 November 2007). Anyway, the football match Levski vs. Chernomorets was postponed due to bad weather (this match was played later on 24 February 2008 and Levski won it). He made his official debut for PFC Levski Sofia in the match against Lokomotiv Sofia on 24 November 2007. Zé Soares was a substitute so he entered the game in the 61st minute. The Brazilian wing played very well, but the match ended in a 0:0 draw. His second appearance was in Bulgaria's [...] "Eternal Derby" [...] match against CSKA Sofia. Levski lost by 0:1. Zé Soares was a substitute but he played very good again. His first match for Levski in the starting eleven was against Slavia Sofia. Zé Soares played awesome but the stadium's awful condition declined the fast and creative Levski player so the match ended in a goalless draw. Zé Soares scored his first goal for Levski on 22 March 2008 in a match against Belasitsa Petrich. He scored the goal in the 40th minute. The result of the match was 4:0 with a home victory for Levski. Zé made his debut in Europe on 13 August 2008 in a match against FC BATE Borisov. He entered the match as a substitute. Levski lost the match 0:1. Da Silva was scouted by FC Kuban Krasnodar during the winter pause of Bulgarian League. He has played one friendly match as a right fullback, and Kuban won. On 9 May 2009, Zé Soares assisted for the first goal of Levski Sofia in The Eternal Derby against CSKA and later scored the second. The result of the match was 0:2 with a guest win for Levski. Filho was eventually chosen to be the man of the match, rated 8.5 (max. 10). Later, in a match of the oldest Metropolitan Derby against Slavia Sofia, Zé Soares was again the man of the match scoring the only and winning goal in 51st minute. The fans applauded him and after second metropolitan derby in which Soares was again the man of the match, he became a fans' favourite. He became a Champion of Bulgaria in 2009, after a contradictory but great season under the coaching of Emil Velev. Despite the bad results during the autumnal part of the season, after great matches in the spring, Levski Sofia fulfilled the plan before the term had set and became a champion for 26th time, before the last round has been played. Zé Soares was rumored to play his last match with Levski on 2 December 2009 against Villarreal CF. The fans stretched a transparent, which showed their gratitude for Soares' games for Levski. Before, he left Bulgaria, Zé told that he had never met such a great audience like Levski's one. Soares was expected to sign with Metalurg Donetsk. However, the transfer did not become a fact and Filho kept playing for Levski until 15 January 2010 when he became a Metalurg Donetsk for a transfer fee of €450,000 and signed a 3.5-year deal.|$|E

The overall mean blood ZPP levels and ALAU of migrant workers were significantly higher than those of native workers. In 2005, after new migrant worker regulations were instituted, the mean value of above lead biomarkers workers was still significantly higher than that of native workers, but the magnitude of the differences was smaller compared with the difference in 1997.
