50|$|Mechanical {{stopwatches}} are {{powered by}} a mainspring, which must be periodically wound up by turning the <b>knurled</b> <b>knob</b> {{at the top of}} the watch.|$|E
50|$|A typical design {{involves}} fastening {{the reed}} onto the tripper {{by using a}} flexible strip of steel, and adjusting {{the height of the}} reed by using a <b>knurled</b> <b>knob.</b> Once the reed is positioned at the desired height, a small lever is pulled, which clips off a sliver of material from the tip.|$|E
50|$|On the {{top right}} of {{the picture of the}} three-day {{barograph}} can be seen a silver <b>knurled</b> <b>knob.</b> This is to adjust the barograph so that it correctly reflects the station pressure. Barely visible below the knob is a small silver plunger. This is pressed every three hours to leave a time mark on the paper.|$|E
50|$|German {{instruments}} were actually fairly {{similar to the}} Norden, even before World War II. In the Lotfe 7, a similar set of gyroscopes provided a stabilized platform for the bombardier to sight through, although the more complex interaction between the bombsight and autopilot of the Norden was not used. The Lotfe 7 was dramatically simpler, consisting of a single metal box containing {{the vast majority of}} the mechanism, with a tube (Rohr) extending out the bottom with a mirror that reflected the image of the target into a small telescope in the box. The mechanisms within combined the functions of the Norden's stabilizer and optics, moving the mirror to stabilize the image as well as tracking the target. The controls were likewise much simpler than the Nordens', consisting primarily of three large <b>knurled</b> <b>knobs</b> to adjust aim.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the final}} version of the Telecaster Bass, which was {{discontinued}} in September 1979 [...] and reintroduced in 2011 as a part of the Modern Player series, featuring two Modern Player Wide Range Precision Bass pickups, three-ply parchment (Sunburst model) or single-ply black (Butterscotch Blonde model) pickguard, three <b>knurled</b> “chrome-dome” control <b>knobs</b> (neck volume, bridge volume, master tone), vintage-style bridge with four brass saddles, open-gear tuners and nickel/chrome hardware. Available in 2-Color Sunburst and Butterscotch Blonde.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to {{optimise}} the design of a milling machine control knob which is found to be difficult to operate. The independent variables include body positions, arm positions, finger positions, torque direction and tactile sensation. The size of the finger is also taken into account for designing the knob. The early study includes the feedbacks and data collections directly from the industrial manual workers from 8 manufacturing firms on the preference of body positions, arm positions, finger positions and the designs of knobs. The collected data were analysed via multiple regression analysis using Minitab 16 statistical software and narrowed down into three levels per variable. A number of shapes were selected based on literatures and this amount was reduced to one shape (<b>knurled</b> spherical <b>knob)</b> based on the survey and observational studies...|$|R
50|$|The Welrod {{took the}} form of a 1.25 in {{cylinder}}, about 12 in. The rear of the cylinder contained the bolt, the middle the ported barrel and expansion chamber of the suppressor, and the front the baffles and wipes of the suppressor. There was a <b>knurled</b> <b>knob</b> at the rear that served as the bolt handle, and the magazine was also the grip. Removing the magazine/grip made the weapon easier to conceal.|$|E
50|$|The pistol is {{manually}} operated using a rotary bolt, locking with two lugs. Loading is performed with a pull/push action using the round <b>knurled</b> <b>knob</b> {{to the rear}} of the weapon. The trigger is single stage with a simple safety at the back of the magazine housing. The detachable single stack magazine contains six or eight rounds (depending on calibre) and serves as a pistol grip with the bottom part enclosed into the plastic cover.|$|E
5000|$|Corrections {{in range}} were applied {{by turning the}} knob {{attached}} to a gear wheel (labeled [...] "pinion" [...] in Plate XXVI) {{at the center of}} the correction box, which slid the gun arm towards its circumference or back, with the adjustments indicated by index numbers visible through the window to the left of the pinion. Corrections in azimuth were achieved by turning the <b>knurled</b> <b>knob</b> at the right edge of the worm gear located at the bottom of the gun arm, with its pointer being used to read off index numbers and turn the gun arm through its arc.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{production}} models are distinguished by an enlarged, oblong trigger guard (which was introduced after Japanese soldiers reported difficulty in accessing the trigger while wearing gloves in Manchuria) and sometimes have a <b>knurled</b> steel cocking <b>knob</b> {{instead of the}} standard [...] "slotted" [...] cocking knob. An auxiliary magazine spring was added from mid-1940 to retain the magazine and aid the magazine follower. The safety is a lever {{on the left side}} and locks the barrel and barrel extension as well as stopping the sear from moving. A redesigned cocking knob was implemented in 1944 in order to simplify production. The Type 14 also lacks the grip safety used on the previous models. The Type 14 could be equipped with the Type 90 tear gas grenade with use of a special attachment.|$|R
5000|$|Modeled {{after the}} Telecaster guitar, the Squier Vintage Modified Telecaster and Telecaster Special basses feature a Telecaster guitar-shaped {{basswood}} body, Telecaster-style control plate and a 32"-scale maple neck/fretboard with 20 frets. The Vintage Modified Telecaster Bass sports a Duncan Designed PB-102 SCPB single-coil pickup and three-way switching among special tone circuits, which feature a modern bass sound (middle switch position, volume and tone controls), softer [...] "double bass" [...] sound (neck switch position, volume control only) and authentic tic-tac [...] "baritone" [...] sound (bridge switch position, volume control only). The Telecaster Bass Special {{has a large}} chrome-covered Fender-designed Wide Range humbucking neck pickup paired with a Duncan Designed JB-102B single-coil Jazz Bass bridge pickup and three-way blade switching. Other features include black [...] "barrel" [...] switch tip, <b>knurled</b> chrome control <b>knobs,</b> vintage style bridge with four chrome saddles, vintage-style tuners and strap buttons and a single-ply white or black pickguard. Available in Black and White Blonde finishes. Introduced in August 2012.|$|R
50|$|Small-hole gauges {{require a}} {{slightly}} different technique to the telescopic gauges, the small hole gauge is initially set smaller than the bore to be measured. It is then inserted into the bore and adjusted by rotating the <b>knurled</b> <b>knob</b> at the base, until light pressure is felt when the gauge is slightly moved in the bore. The gauge is then removed and measured with a caliper or micrometer. To accurately detect the maximal distance between {{the two halves of}} the gauge head, move the head of the gauge around while making the measurement to insure you get the maximal reading. Grasp the gauge near the head to aid in your maneuvering of the gauge while adjusting the micrometer so it just stops the gauge's motion at one spot only. A bit of practice will quickly give you the idea.|$|E
5000|$|... ”The {{volume and}} shape of this {{instrument}} are about those of a large pocket chronometer. The dial is movable and turns about an axis that is perpendicular to its plane and passes through its centre. When the Chronograph is operating, this dial makes one revolution per minute, and since its circumference is divided into 60 parts, the angular motion of one division corresponds to one second. A small window next to the hanging ring reveals a number, which is replaced by another number with each revolution of the dial and indicates the minutes; the Chronograph can run about three-quarters of an hour without stopping.To use this instrument, when it is mounted and in a resting state, one first sets the divisions marking the time to the starting points by turning a <b>knurled</b> <b>knob</b> with one’s hand. Through the intermediary of a gear train, the knob causes the minute and second dials to move. Having done this, when the moment to start timing arrives, one presses a small button next to the knob to set the machine in motion. The observer can give full attention to the phenomena whose successive time intervals he wishes to measure, {{and as soon as}} one of the divisions of these intervals is reached, he presses a second button next to the one we have just mentioned. At the moment when it is pressed a small pen, or metal point, passing through the open tip of a cone filled with black oil ink and placed opposite the moving dial’s fixed zero point, marks a point on the circumference that is divided into seconds. This point then indicates the second and fraction of a second corresponding to the beginning or end of the period of time being measured.Operation of the pen trigger mechanism neither stops nor slows the moving dial’s motion, so the button can be pressed several times while this motion lasts, making a number of black points on the scale divided into 60 parts; each point indicates, by its position, the moment when it was marked.To stop the chronograph quickly, one need only press the button that started it. The mechanism is arranged such that pressing this button abruptly changes {{the current state of the}} machine, making it pass from a resting state to movement or from movement to its resting state.We did not examine the inside of the instrument, and we do not think that it offers anything particularly remarkable, given the current state of watchmaking. Its principal merit lies in its ability to instantly indicate the first and last moments of several successive time intervals by means of permanent, visible signs on a moving dial, without requiring the attention of the observer’s eyes or ears.A chronograph with such a property unquestionably offers precious resources to physicians, engineers and, in general, anyone who measures phenomena. A highly satisfactory trial was recently made at public horse races; but its use can obviously extend to an infinite variety of other kinds of observations, the testing of moving machines, gauging of running water, and almost all hydraulic operations. The passage of a star over the cross-hairs of a telescope, when the astronomer has only one free hand, will be very precisely indicated by this new means, which will either serve to verify the count of the seconds on a clock, or will replace such a count if the distant location of the clock or poor hearing keeps the escapement from being heard. …We think that Mr. Rieussec’s Chronograph deserves the Academy’s approval.|$|E
40|$|Damage to {{workpiece}} by excessive {{current in}} electron-beam welder is prevented by mechanism that accurately adjusts anode-to-cathode spacing. Mechanism is installed on standard Sciaky (or equivalent) electron-beam gun with only minimal modification. By turning <b>knurled</b> <b>knob</b> and observing digital readout of anode/cathode separation, machine operator adjusts welder for safe maximum current before welding begins...|$|E
