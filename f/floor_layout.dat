The main staircase led to a foyer with a wood parquet floor in a herringbone pattern. The walls were plaster panels, separated by fluted marble pilasters on wood pedestals. The ceiling is white plaster with decorative moldings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first floor}} plan {{is similar to}} the Edwin H. Cheney House; both have a three part first <b>floor</b> <b>layout</b> that {{includes}} a library, a dining room and a living room. The interior spaces are separated by [...] "low decks set at the window heads." [...] In the living room the house is anchored by a Roman brick fireplace at its center and there are libraries on either side of two small setback pavilions. These features help the building's interior flow and symmetry. Copious use of glass brings natural light into the interior.|$|E

50|$|There are few {{documents}} that describe the Iglesia del Buen Suceso, especially {{in regard to}} the <b>floor</b> <b>layout.</b> The partial descriptions of its conditioning and some engravings and representations of the time give ideas about its presence. There contemporary descriptions of Herrera Maldonado and Ruiz de Altable. The church's entrance had a lonja. The <b>floor</b> <b>layout</b> was in Greek cross with a very developed chancel and four chapels in the corners of intersection of both arms.|$|E

GŚ worked on creating a graph model of the building {{on the basis of}} information about the building layout retrieved from IFC files. Both authors reviewed and analyzed the literature, and developed the algorithm to compute optimal routes accessible for disabled people. Strug designed a user interface prototype for a computer tool allowing for visualization search results on the building <b>floor</b> <b>layouts.</b> Both authors approved the final manuscript.|$|R

50|$|The <b>floor</b> joist framing <b>layout</b> looks {{similar to}} the ceiling joist layout. However, where the ceiling joists may consist of 2x6s, 2x8s, 2x10s and 2x12s, the <b>floor</b> joist <b>layout</b> will {{typically}} show 2x12 joists only. In some cases, where loads and spans dictate, and deeper floor joist system may be required. Deeper floor systems include wood I-joists and open web trusses.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{evolutionary}} technique is proposed {{as a method}} for generating new design solutions with genotypes represented {{in the form of}} hierarchical hypergraphs. Such hypergraph-based evolutionary design requires the adaptation of traditional evolutionary operators like cross-over and mutation. This paper presents an attempt at defining modified cross-over and mutation operators that act on hierarchical hypergraphs. The application of the proposed transformations is illustrated on examples of designing <b>floor</b> <b>layouts</b> and furniture {{with the use of the}} evolutionary method...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{designing}} multi-storey buildings {{with the use}} of a knowledge-based visual design support system. In this system two visual languages for creating design solutions by the designer are proposed. The first one allows the designer to design 2 D <b>floor</b> <b>layouts,</b> while the second one is dedicated to creating 3 D building structures. The generated design solutions in the form of drawings are internally represented as hierarchical hypergraphs gathering design knowledge on which reasoning about designs can be based. The approach is illustrated by example of designing a three-storey house...|$|R

50|$|Other {{than the}} basic <b>floor</b> <b>layout,</b> shotgun houses have many {{standard}} features in common. The house {{is almost always}} close to the street, sometimes with a very short front yard. In some cases, the house has no setback and is actually flush with the sidewalk. The original steps were wood, but were often replaced with permanent concrete steps.|$|E
5000|$|Conceptual designs {{embody the}} design {{recommendations}} or plans and should {{take into account}} [...] "what-if" [...] scenarios to ensure all operational outcomes are met in order to future-proof the facility. Conceptual <b>floor</b> <b>layouts</b> should be driven by IT performance requirements as well as lifecycle costs associated with IT demand, energy efficiency, cost efficiency and availability. Future-proofing will also include expansion capabilities, often provided in modern data centers through modular designs. These allow for more raised floor space to be fitted out in the data center whilst utilising the existing major electrical plant of the facility.|$|R
