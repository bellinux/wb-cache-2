500|$|Akodon spegazzinii, {{also known}} as Spegazzini's akodont or Spegazzini's <b>grass</b> <b>mouse,</b> is a rodent in the genus Akodon found in northwestern Argentina. It occurs in {{grassland}} and forest at [...] above sea level. After the species was first named in 1897, several other names were given to various populations now included in A.spegazzinii. They are now all recognized {{as part of a}} single, widespread and variable species. Akodon spegazzinii is related to Akodon boliviensis {{and other members of the}} A.boliviensis species group. It reproduces year-round. Because it is widely distributed and common, Akodon spegazzinii is listed as [...] "least concern" [...] on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

50|$|Cursor <b>grass</b> <b>mice</b> are omnivorous. Their primary diet {{consists}} of small arthropods, especially Hymenoptera, beetles, and spiders; this is supplemented by seeds of Cecropia and other plants. They search for food through leaf litter and patches of dense vegetation, and are strictly terrestrial. Individuals {{have a home}} range of 0.1 to 0.7 ha, with the ranges of males being larger than those of females. Although {{the size of their}} home ranges does not change, the population density of cursor <b>grass</b> <b>mice</b> becomes significantly higher during the rainy season, when insects are most abundant.|$|R

Morphologically, members {{of the genus}} are {{difficult}} to distinguish from two other genera found in the same region, the <b>grass</b> <b>mice</b> Akodon and the cane mice Zygodontomys. In 1987, the Argentine zoologist Osvaldo Reig listed the characteristics that distinguished the genus Bolomys from Akodon as; the braincase is broad and deep; the occipital region is short; the rostrum is fairly short; the rostrum tapers forwards when viewed from the side; the occiput is short and truncated; the zygomatic plate is broad, with the front edge straight or slightly concave; the upper incisors are orthodont or proodont; the molars are mesodont, broad and robust; the upper molars have transverse loops; and the lower molars have the lingual cusps slightly {{in front of the}} labial cusps.|$|R
25|$|Formerly {{the camel}} house, this {{enclosure}} adjoining the giraffe house was remodelled in 2006 to house okapi. Initially two males were kept: Dicky arrived from Marwell Wildlife in 2005 and Mbuti came from Bristol Zoo {{in the same}} year. In 2006 Dicky left for London Zoo {{to make way for}} a female named Stuma from Germany. In 2009 Mbuti and Dicky were swapped back, with Mbuti going to London Zoo and Dicky coming back to Chester. Other animals that can be seen here include Red forest duikers, Gambian pouched rats, butterfly barbs, Gaboon vipers and short-eared elephant shrews. Mount Kulal spiny mice and Mesic four-striped <b>grass</b> <b>mice</b> have also been kept here in the past along with various other small species.

40|$|African nonhuman primate and rodent {{erythrocytes}} {{were tested}} for agglutination by adenoviruses, reoviruses, and enteroviruses. Squirrel erythrocytes were agglutinated by reovirus serotypes and adenovirus types 3, 11, 16, and 21. Adenoviruses also agglutinated brazza monkey erythrocytes {{to the same}} titers as those obtained with either rhesus or grey monkey cells. Prototype reovirus types 1 and 2 agglutinated grey monkey erythrocytes to much lower titers than either squirrel or human group O red cells. Among the enteroviruses tested, only echovirus types 7 and 12 agglutinated grey, red-tail, brazza, and rhesus monkey erythrocytes. The specificity of agglutination of squirrel, grey, and brazza monkey erythrocytes by reoviruses, echoviruses, and adenoviruses, respectively, was confirmed by hemagglutination-inhibition tests. The titers obtained {{were similar to those}} obtained with erythrocytes usually used in these tests.

50|$|The {{mating season}} takes place from late May to August, with a {{gestation}} period of 60 days. Pups are born from July to October. Summer births {{are thought to}} be timed to coincide with population peaks of vlei rats and four-striped <b>grass</b> <b>mice,</b> while winter births are timed for ungulate calving seasons. Litters consist of 1-9 pups, which are born blind. For the first three weeks of their lives, the pups are kept under constant surveillance by their mother, while the father and elder offspring provide food. The pups open their eyes after 8-10 days and emerge from the den at the age of three weeks. They are weaned at 8-9 weeks, and can hunt by themselves at the age of six months. Sexual maturity is attained at 11 months, though few black-backed jackals reproduce in their first year. Unlike golden jackals, which have comparatively amicable intrapack relationships, black-backed jackal pups become increasingly quarrelsome as they age, and establish more rigid dominance hierarchies. Dominant pups will appropriate food, and become independent at an earlier age. The grown pups may disperse at one year of age, though some will remain in their natal territories to assist their parents in raising the next generation of pups. The average lifespan in the wild is seven years, though captive specimens can live twice as long.|$|R
