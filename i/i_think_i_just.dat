2500|$|In 1996, at the Ichthus music festival, Mullins cited {{personal}} {{reasons for his}} move. He {{was asked if he}} made the move because God had called him to proselytize and convert the Native Americans. To this Mullins responded, [...] "No. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> got tired of a White, Evangelical, middle class perspective on God, and I thought I would have more luck finding Christ among the Pagan Navajos. I'm teaching music." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 1, 2008, Redden {{signed a}} six-year, $39 million {{contract}} as an unrestricted free agent with the New York Rangers. Redden's performance continued to decline in New York, where he faced considerable criticism — one {{writer for the}} New York Post even called the contract [...] "the worst {{in the history of}} the NHL, if not in the history of hard-cap pro sports." [...] On September 25, 2010, the Rangers placed Redden on waivers in part due to the defenceman's declining play. The move also allowed the Rangers to fit under salary cap. Speaking in 2013 on his stint with the Rangers, Redden said, [...] "I think maybe making that money there and being the player I am… I felt like the first little while, things were going pretty good, and then they kind of fell off. I felt like I wasn’t doing enough, and like I should have been doing more. Once I started feeling that way, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> got away from the things that made me successful. Things just kind of snowballed from there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff {{was known}} for his {{technical}} ability, speed, acceleration, dribbling and vision, possessing an awareness of his teammates' positions as an attack unfolded. Despite his unimpressive stature and strength, Cruyff's tactical brain and reading of the game were exceptional. “Football consists of different elements: technique, tactics and stamina,” he told the journalists Henk van Dorp and Frits Barend, in one of the interviews collected in their book Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff. [...] "There are some people who might have better technique than me, and some may be fitter than me, but the main thing is tactics. With most players, tactics are missing. You can divide tactics into insight, trust and daring. In the tactical area, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> have more than most other players." [...] On the concept of technique in football, Cruyff once said: [...] "Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1,000 times. Anyone can do that by practising. Then you can work in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate." [...] As Van Basten noted, “Johan is so technically perfect that even as a boy he stopped being interested in that aspect of the game. He could do everything when he was 20. That’s why he’s been very interested in tactics since he was very young. He sees football situations so clearly that he was always the one to decide how the game should be played.” In 1997, Dutch journalist Hubert Smeets wrote, [...] "Cruyff was the first player who understood that he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sports." [...] Sports writer David Miller believed Cruyff superior to any previous player in his ability to extract the most from others. He dubbed him [...] "Pythagoras in boots" [...] for the complexity and precision of his passes and wrote, [...] "Few have been able to exact, both physically and mentally, such mesmeric control on a match from one penalty area to another." ...|$|E

40|$|What is a {{chameleon}} in {{the world}} of education? What defines her professionally, personally, and why? In this autoethnography, I explore the chameleon metaphor for meanings and implications in my personal and professional identity as a female educator by seeking answers to questions stemming from Mitchell and Weber (2005) : <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? <b>Just</b> who do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am? I analyzed my own autobiographical journals using the four-part Listening Guide (Gilligan, Spencer, Weinberg, 2 ̆ 6 Bertsch, 2003) coupled with theme-based family coding to examine changes by choice and changes by force particular to my personal and professional experiences. Notions of home, belonging, and change as a journey emerged as themes that served to frame my identity and highlighted the importance of self-inquiry for educators as an applied practice within the greater context of the profession...|$|R

The book, which also contains two new stories, was released in 2000 {{the year after the}} publication of his successful first novel No Great Mischief. When asked why, as a master short story writer, he had suddenly turned to the novel, MacLeod smiled and replied: [...] "Well, nothing I do is very sudden. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> wanted more space. I needed a bus rather than a Volkswagen to put my people in." ...|$|E

I think the best thing to do, even if you’re not vegetarian, is to juice vegetables. There’s no possible way to eat all that—you can’t consume it all. So you drink it and get all the nutrients, and also it gets in your body faster because your body doesn’t have to break it down or anything. Juicing {{is one of the best}} things to do to heal or replenish your body and get rid of all the toxins ...

5000|$|.....coming from a {{place where}} nothing was happening, Swindon, to {{suddenly}} this massive place, London, where there were huge amounts of things happening, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> ran around going, [...] "Oh my God, oh my God," [...] like {{a kid in a}} toy shop. It was a big thing for me to meet people who weren't living purely a consumer experience, because in Swindon, people rightly or wrongly live a very normal life. They go to work, they buy nice things and have nice holidays and bring up their kids. Unfortunately, there's something wrong with me which means that doesn't work, and I came to London and met loads of people for whom that doesn't work, either—where money wasn't an issue, where possessions weren't an issue, a whole different code of beliefs and faiths.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the time}} of Images, John Walker's musical {{influence}} on the Walker Brothers had waned (although he sang lead on a cover of [...] "Blueberry Hill" [...] and contributed two original compositions) and this led to tensions between him and Scott. For his part, Scott was finding the group a chafing experience - [...] "There {{was a lot of}} pressure. I was coming up with all the material for the boys, and I was having to find songs and getting the sessions together. Everyone relied on me, and it just got on top of me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> got irritated with it all." [...] Artistic differences and the stresses stemming from overwhelming pop stardom led to the break-up of the Walker Brothers in 1967, although they reunited briefly for a tour of Japan the following year.|$|E

Afterwards, Marvin told his brother, [...] "I didn't know how to fight before, but now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> have to do it my way. I'm not a painter. I'm not a poet.

[...] In the song, Joel Madden sings of meeting a tantalizing girl and then waking up with a foggy recollection of what happened next. Whether he {{had too much to drink}} or had something slipped into his drink is unclear, but the singer still says it might have been the time of his life. In the chorus, he sings: [...] "Last night, can't remember / What happened? Where'd we go? / I woke up this morning / Where's my car? Where's my keys? Where's my clothes? / I feel my head still spinning but I'm doing alright / Cause <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> had the best night of my life." ...|$|E

The actor said, [...] "Finn started off as the stereotypical dumb jock but as the show has gone on, Finn's not dumb anymore, really, he’s just a little naïve." [...] Early reviews of Finn from {{television}} critics were mixed; Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{said that he and}} Michele were [...] "both agreeable and a little desperate for an outlet" [...] in the pilot episode. Commenting on the fifth episode of the first season, Eric Goldman of IGN wrote, [...] "We got to see a bit of a darker side to Finn ... it's good to see this, because up until now, Finn's been a bit too straight-laced to totally invest in." [...] In the second season's eighth episode, [...] "Furt", Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack said, [...] "It's been a while since we’ve gotten some Finn focus, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> missed Cory Monteith. But I also forgot what a good, natural actor he can be." [...] Monteith as Finn won the 2011 Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Actor Comedy, and was nominated in the same category in 2010.|$|E
