Stand simulation is based on an individual-tree growth system. A scenario approach is applied when simulating the effects of catastrophic pest outbreaks. Insect damage is assumed to be a Poisson process with an average rate of 0. 1 per year. One hundred scenarios of insect damage are created using the Poisson process to simulate the distribution of bare land value of each of the optimal regimes. Numerical results show that the optimal rotation is shortened with an increasing probability of a catastrophe. The average bare land values in the stochastic case are approximately 14. 8 % to 22. 9 % lower. Numbers of thinnings are decreased for most plots when seeking a highest bare land value, compared to the deterministic optima.

40|$|When {{eucalyptus}} {{trees are}} felled, new stems often grow from the stumps to produce another crop of trees. This new crop {{is called the}} coppice crop to distinguish it from the seedling crop. Coppice crops can be important in growing eucalypts profitably. Replanting costs are saved and coppice crop rotations are usually shorter than those of seedling crops, because coppice stems grow faster than seedlings. Several successive coppice crops are possible, but getting a coppice crop depends on planting the right species in the right environment and harvesting with the right method. PLAN FOR COPPICE The time to plan for a coppice crop is before planting the seedling crop. Not all eucalyptus species coppice. Choose a species that coppices vigorously and predictably, that grows well, and has the desired wood qualities. Eucalypts For Planting (FAO 1979) describes coppicing ability of species commonly used for wood production. However, relying on a species ' reputation for good coppicing is risky, because it might not coppice reliably everywhere. Also, the species may coppice well on average, but some seed sources may not. Before planting a new species in a new environment on a large scale, establish enough experimental plantings to determine coppicing ability at different seasons and ages by periodic fellings. Spacing and harvesting methods need to be carefully considered in developing a coppicing system. The spacing pattern must allow harvesting equipment to move about without damaging stumps.

40|$|Forest {{fires and}} forest {{biodiversity}} are related issues of major concern in Mediterranean countries and require an integrated approach to landscape planning. The {{aim of this}} study was to develop a GIS approach for regulating forest production while promoting landscape diversity and mitigating fire hazard. A study area located in the centre of Portugal was chosen. The area was primarily occupied by maritime pine and had a high fire hazard, low tree species diversity and an extensive protection area. The classical area control method was used to assist in forest production regulation. Species suitability maps were produced for 21 recommended species for afforestation in the study area. Maritime pine management compartments were defined, and a 50 -year <b>harvesting</b> <b>plan</b> was proposed. In each harvested compartment, protection areas were identified for species conversion (e. g., native oaks and/or broadleaves). Afforestation species were proposed according to the species suitability maps produced earlier. Low flammability species that produce high-quality wood, non-wood products and landscape enhancement were preferred. A comparison of the land cover in the study area in 2007 to that anticipated in 2064 via the proposed plan showed that a more fragmented landscape structure could be achieved by introducing 16 species of lower flammability than maritime pine into the study area. This study proved the usefulness of this methodological approach for guiding sustainable changes in homogeneous, unmanaged forest landscapes prone to fire.
