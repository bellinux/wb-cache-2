40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 16) The potential glare from <b>rearview</b> <b>mirrors</b> was quantified in simulated encounters {{using data}} on the locations of mirrors and headlamps, and on the photometric output of low-beam headlamps. This was done for two classes of vehicles (passenger cars, and light trucks and vans [LTVs]) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roles of the vehicle subject to the glare and the vehicle producing the glare. The results indicate that, in many encounters with glare vehicles to the rear, {{there will be a}} substantial disparity in glare, both among vehicles of different classes and among different mirror locations on a single vehicle. The main reason for this is the strong role of mirror height in determining how much a mirror is exposed to the lower, and therefore stronger, portion of a low-beam light pattern. There is substantially greater potential for high glare values on the mirrors of passenger cars versus LTVs. and on the driver-side <b>mirror</b> versus <b>the</b> center <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror</b> on all vehicles. With upward misaim of headlamps, these disparities are increased, as is the absolute level of potential glare. The relatively low potential for glare on the center mirrors of LTVs will often be compounded by the low transmittance of privacy glass on those vehicles. The present results have implications for where glare light should be sensed in order to control automatic anti-glare mirrors. However, specific recommendations should incorporate two additional considerations: (1) the geometry of a given vehicle, including the actual heights of <b>the</b> <b>rearview</b> <b>mirrors</b> and how <b>the</b> potential fields of view of those mirrors are affected by opaque parts of the vehicle, and (2) quantification of the exposure to glare that vehicles experience in actual traffic, including the frequencies at which glare vehicles are encountered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields of view of the individual mirrors...|$|R

We investigated whether speeded responses to potential emergency driving situations could be facilitated by the presentation of spatially-predictive (80 % valid; Experiment 1) or spatially-nonpredictive (50 % valid; Experiment 2) vibrotactile cues. Participants responded significantly more rapidly following both spatially-predictive and spatially-nonpredictive vibrotactile cues from the same rather than the opposite direction as the critical driving events. These results highlight the potential utility of vibrotactile warning signals in automobile interface design for directing a driver's visual attention to time-critical events or information. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Quality {{control is}} one of <b>the</b> {{important}} steps <b>in</b> production process of <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror</b> industry. This activity can be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of product inspection. As {{an essential component of}} vehicle, <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror</b> must be observed especially in distortion assessment. During this time, <b>the</b> assessment of <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror</b> product is finished by experts. Thus, faults of inspection can be occurred. These faults could be caused by a decrease of accuracy which is an effect of eyes tiredness. The technique of image processing method is observed to solve this inspection problem. This study is proposed to construct the distortion inspection system on <b>rearview</b> <b>mirror</b> by using radial line method based on image processing...|$|R
