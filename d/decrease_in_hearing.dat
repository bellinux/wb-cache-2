5000|$|The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) {{specifies}} that {{engineering controls}} are preferential when reducing the noise levels at the source. The use of hearing protective devices {{is considered an}} [...] "interim protective measure" [...] while engineering controls are developed. The goal of these controls is to reduce ambient steady-state noise levels to 85 dBA regardless of TWA exposure and to reduce impulse noise levels to below 140 dBP. The DOD requires that personnel be entered into a hearing conservation program when continuous snd intermittent noise levels ale grs {{greater than or equal}} to 85 dBA TWA, when impulse SPL are at or in excess of 140 dBP, or when the personnel is exposed to ultrasonic frequencies. The DOD integrates all sound levels between 80 dBA to a minimum of 130 dBA when determining an individual or representative noise dose. When used, hearing protectors must be capable of attenuating worker noise exposure below 85 dBA TWA. Hearing protection is required to be carried by personnel who work in designated noise areas, such as those exposed to gunfire or ordnance tests and Service musicians. The DOD defines a significant threshold shift as a 10 dB average <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds at 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz in either ear, with no age corrections. It is further specified that a shift in 15 dB at 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hz is an early warning sign for an STS; follow-up retraining is required in this case. (DOD Instruction 6055.12).|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{intriguing}} recent {{findings on}} the mechanisms of drug induced hearing loss caused by two major classes of therapeutic agents: the aminoglycoside antibiotics and cisplatin. Both drug categories are nephrotoxic as well as ototoxic. Aminoglycosides and cisplatin target the outer hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea to cause high frequency sensorineural hearing loss in a substantial percentage of patients treated with these drugs. Each group of agents appears to generate reactive oxygen species within the cochlea that trigger downstream mechanisms leading to cell death. Various protective agents including antioxidants show promise in protecting the inner ear from damage in experimental animals. The only successful double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial using a protective agent to prevent ototoxicity {{was carried out in}} China. Aspirin or placebo was given in combination with gentamicin. A significant <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> loss was observed. Successful clinical implementation of protective agents will require a cautious approach, so that the therapeutic effect of the anti-infective agent or anti-neoplastic drug is not attenuated. This may require novel methods of administration of protective agents, such as injection within the middle ear. This would provide a maximal dose of protective agent without systemic interference with the desired effect of the ototoxic agent...|$|E
40|$|Dif®culty in ®ltering {{relevant}} auditory {{information in}} background noise {{is one of}} the features of autism. Auditory ®ltering processes can be investigated at the peripheral level as they are hypothesized to involve active cochlear mechanisms which are regulated by the efferent activity of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) system. The aim of the present work was therefore to assess these peripheral auditory processes in 22 children and adolescents with autism compared with age- and gender-matched normal controls. Active cochlear mechanisms were evaluated with transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and MOC system ef®ciency was assessed via TEOAEs which are decreased when stimulating the contralateral ear with noise. The MOC system evaluation was performed on 18 of the 22 children. In both studies, results were analysed according to age (from 4 to 10 years and from 11 to 20 years). The main result concerns the asymmetry of the efferent system which differs in individuals with autism. Several neural processes might be hypothesized as involved in the results obtained as the MOC system which originates in the brainstem received regulating controls from upper brain structures including auditory cortex. Lateralization abnormalities at the auditory periphery may re¯ect indirectly a problem at a higher level of auditory processing. A second important result shows a decrease in TEOAE amplitude with age, in patients, that may correspond to a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> sensitivity...|$|E

Design: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial of DFMO in participants with a prior adenomatous colonic polyp. Setting: Academic tertiary care referral center. Participants: One hundred twenty-three volunteer subjects with colorectal polyps and normal hearing for the frequencies 250 through 2000 Hz. Interventions: Subjects were randomized to receive placebo or oral DFMO at daily dosages between 0. 075 and 0. 4 g/m 2 of body surface area for 12 months. Outcome Measures: Pure-tone audiometric thresholds for the frequencies 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz and DPOAE levels were measured at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after starting treatment with DFMO or placebo and 3 months after cessation of treatment if there was a suggestion of possible changes at the 12 -month measurement. Results: At these low dosages, there was little evidence for shifts in auditory pure-tone thresholds, and there were no statistically significant shifts in DPOAE levels.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the clinical outcomes for acoustic neuroma treated with low-dose linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) > 10 years earlier at the Royal Adelaide Hospital using data collected prospectively at a dedicated SRS clinic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 1993 and December 2000, 51 patients underwent SRS for acoustic neuroma. For the 44 patients with primary SRS for sporadic (unilateral) lesions, {{the median age}} was 63 years, the median of the maximal tumor diameter was 21 mm (range, 11 - 34), and the marginal dose was 14 Gy for the first 4 patients and 12 Gy for the other 40. RESULTS: The crude tumor control rate was 97. 7 % (1 patient required salvage surgery for progression at 9. 75 years). Only 8 (29 %) of 28 patients ultimately retained useful hearing (interaural pure tone average ≤ 50 dB). Also, although the Kaplan-Meier estimated rate of hearing preservation at 5 years was 57 % (95 % confidence interval, 38 - 74 %), this decreased to 24 % (95 % confidence interval, 11 - 44 %) at 10 years. New or worsened V and VII cranial neuropathy occurred in 11 % and 2 % of patients, respectively; all cases were transient. No case of radiation oncogenesis developed.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the auditory toxicity associated with dose- and schedule- intensive cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung carcinoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients {{were treated with}} gemcitabine followed by cisplatin according to an interpatient dose-escalation scheme. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive treatment once a week for 6 weeks or once every 2 weeks for 4 weeks. The following cohorts of patients were treated with a reversed schedule once every 2 weeks, in which cisplatin was followed by gemcitabine. The dose-intensity of cisplatin was equal in both schedules. Audiometric evaluations were obtained for each ear at several frequencies. Mean hearing loss after cisplatin treatment was computed for each dose level at each tested frequency in each ear at baseline and subsequent follow-up audiometry. Pure tone averages (PTAs) were also calculated. The pharmacokinetics of cisplatin was determined to study the correlation among the maximum drug concentration, the area under the curve of unbound platinum, and the development of ototoxicity. RESULTS: A total of 328 audiograms were analyzed. At the higher frequencies, a more severe hearing impairment was recorded. Most patients showed a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> thresholds at dosages above 60 mg/m 2 cisplatin at the higher frequencies. PTAs at 1, 2, and 4 kHz show a mean hearing loss of 19 dB after cisplatin administration at dosages above 90 mg/m 2. Threshold shifts at 8 and 12. 5 kHz after cisplatin administration were experienced at dosages above 60 mg/m 2. CONCLUSION: Hearing loss after cisplatin therapy occurs mainly at high frequencies and at cisplatin dosages more than 60 mg/m 2. It is more pronounced when cisplatin is given once every 2 week...|$|E

All subjects were divided in four groups, based on presence/absence of AHI (simple snoring without OSAS, mild OSAS, moderate OSAS, severe OSAS). Sixty (37. 5  %) patients were not affected by OSAS, 58 (36. 25  %) presented a mild OSAS, 18 (11. 25  %) a moderate OSAS and 24 (15  %) a severe OSAS; the 57. 14  % of moderate to severe OSAS suffered from tinnitus {{with respect to the}} 31. 03  % of mild OSAS (P =  0. 024).

Tests of auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emissions revealed significant <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> the <b>hearing</b> sensitivities of the Atoh 1 -LKB 1 -/- mice. In Atoh 1 -LKB 1 -/- mice, malformations of hair cell stereocilliary bundles were present as early as postnatal day 1 (P 1), a time long before the maturation of the hair cell bundles. In addition, we also observed outer hair cell (OHC) loss starting at P 14. The impaired stereocilliary bundles occurred long before the presence of hair cell loss. Stereociliary cytoskeletal structure depends on the core actin-based cytoskeleton and several actin-binding proteins. By Western blot, we examined actin-binding proteins, specifically ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) proteins involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton of hair cell stereocilia. Our results revealed that the phosphorylation of ERM proteins (pERM) was significantly <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> mutant mice. Thus, we propose that the decreased pERM may be a key factor for the impaired stereocillia function, and the damaged stereocillia may induce hair cell loss and hearing impairments.

The parameters were recorded before and up to 56 hrs after the allergen challenge. Of the 38 patients in whom 109 NPTs were performed, 31 patients developed 76 positive nasal responses (NR) : 21 isolated immediate NR (IINR), 24 isolated late NR (ILNR), 15 dual late NR (DLNR = immediate + late NR), 11 isolated delayed NR (IDYNR), 5 dual delayed NR (DDYNR = immediate + delayed NR) and 21 negative responses (NNR). Seven patients did not develop any nasal response during 12 NPTs. The 61 positive NRs (80 %) and 5 negative NRs were accompanied by {{significant changes in the}} middle ear pressure (MEP), which means that the slightly negative MEP increased in negativity, by otalgia, mid-dle ear tension, and <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing.</b> In 6 patients the middle ear secretions increased through the monolateral ventilation tubes, during 13 positive NRs. These results suggest the possible causal {{role of the}} nasal mucosa and nasal allergy in some patients with chronic otitis media.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to define the {{demographic}} and clinical characteristics of geriatric patients who referred to physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) outpatient clinics and to detect the differences between these characteristics in regard to age, sex and education level. Materials and Methods: 820 patients over 65 years old who attended 20 outpatient clinics were included in the study. In addition to demographic data, the complaints, comorbid diseases, pain levels, drugs being used, exercise and medical status of the patients were recorded. The effects of age, sex and education level on complaints, comorbid diseases and exercise habits were investigated. Results: The mean age of the patients was 71. 7 ± 5. 5 years. 16. 7 % were living alone, 61. 7 % were housewives. 86 % of the patients had one or more comorbid diseases - hypertension, gastric problems and heart disease were mostly encountered. The most common complaints were joint pain, fatigue and widespread body pain. The average number of pills taken per day was 4. 02 ± 0. 9 (median 4), and the VAS pain score was 5. 1 ± 1. 3 (median 5. 0). History of falling was present in 16. 5 % of patients. 30. 1 % were routinely walking and 15. 4 % were performing exercise at home. In patients over 75 years, vertebral pain and deformity, urinary incontinence, eye problem, difficulty in swallowing, <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing,</b> as well as balance and teeth problems were significantly more frequent than in younger subjects. Conclusion: Aged population constitutes most of the PMR outpatient clinic patients. Considering comorbid diseases, high number of daily taken drugs and falls, PMR specialist should be cautious in prescribing drugs and planning rehabilitation programme. For independence in activities of daily living in this age group, besides the musculoskeletal system, all other systems should be evaluated and a comprehensive geriatric rehabilitation programme should be constructed.

Yet, the results also revealed significant racial/ethnic differences in knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes about the use of HPDs. Recent estimates suggest that more than 11 million individuals in the United States exhibit {{some degree of}} NIHL. Moreover, 40 million individuals work in environments that contain potentially harmful noise levels, and over 50 million Americans routinely use firearms [...] a common cause of noise-induced hearing impairment. A specific hallmark manifestation of NIHL is a permanent <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> sensitivity from 3, 000 - 6, 000 Hz, with a characteristic notch at 4, 000 Hz. Additional effects of exposure to high noise levels include physiological changes in heart rate and blood pressure, decrease in work productivity, and an interference with communication that results from the masking of speech. With these considerations in mind, the purpose of this study was to investigate the knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes of a young-adult population in the United States concerning the factors that contribute to NIHL and the use of hearing protection. Additionally, this study was interested in whether there were racial/ethnic differences or similarities in knowledge of hearing loss and the use of HPDs among African-American and caucasian young adults...|$|E
50|$|Cochlear {{implants}} {{are used}} to treat severe to profound hearing loss by electrically stimulating the hearing nerve. Clinical symptoms of cochlear implant failure include auditory symptoms (tinnitus, buzzing, roaring, popping sounds), non-auditory symptoms (pain, shocking sensation, burning sensation, facial stimulation, itching), and <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the patient's <b>hearing</b> performance. When such symptoms occur, the patient's clinical team evaluates {{the patient and the}} device using in-situ methods, and determines if revision surgery is necessary. The most commonly reported device failures are due to impacts, loss of hermeticity, and electrode lead malfunctions. Most manufacturers provide on their websites the survival rate of their marketed implants, although they are not required to do so. In order to improve and standardize failure reporting practices to the public, the AAMI is developing an American standard for cochlear implants in collaboration with the FDA, major cochlear implant manufacturers, the CALCE center for reliability, doctors, and clinicians.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: Unilateral {{hearing loss}} is {{characterized}} by a <b>decrease</b> of <b>hearing</b> <b>in</b> one ear only. In the presence of ambient noise, individuals with unilateral hearing loss are faced with greater difficulties understanding speech than normal listeners. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the speech perception of individuals with unilateral <b>hearing</b> loss <b>in</b> speech perception with and without competitive noise, before and after the hearing aid fitting process. METHODS: The study included 30 adults of both genders diagnosed with moderate or severe sensorineural unilateral hearing loss using the <b>Hearing</b> <b>In</b> Noise Test - <b>Hearing</b> <b>In</b> Noise Test-Brazil, in the following scenarios: silence, frontal noise, noise to the right, and noise to the left, before and after the hearing aid fitting process. RESULTS: The study participants had a mean age of 41. 9 years and most of them presented right unilateral <b>hearing</b> loss. <b>In</b> all cases evaluated with <b>Hearing</b> <b>In</b> Noise Test, a better performance in speech perception was observed with the use of hearing aids. CONCLUSION: Using the <b>Hearing</b> <b>In</b> Noise Test-Brazil test evaluation, individuals with unilateral hearing loss demonstrated better performance in speech perception when using <b>hearing</b> aids, both <b>in</b> silence and in situations with a competing noise, with use of hearing aids...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{mobilization}} of individuals across social networks {{is becoming increasingly}} influential in society. However, {{little is known about}} what traits of recruiters and recruits and affect the speed at which one mobilizes the other. Here we identify and measure traits of individuals and their relationships that predict mobilization speed. We ran a global social mobilization contest and recorded personal traits of the participants and those they recruited. We identified how those traits corresponded with the speed of mobilization. Recruits mobilized faster when they first heard about the contest directly from the contest organization, and <b>decreased</b> <b>in</b> speed when <b>hearing</b> from less personal source types (e. g. family vs. media). Mobilization was faster when the recruiter and the recruit heard about the contest through the same source type, and slower when both individuals were in different countries. Females mobilized other females faster than males mobilized other males. Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and older recruits mobilized slower. These findings suggest relevant factors for engineering social mobilization tasks for increased speed. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|The first {{documented}} case {{of improved}} hearing following chiropractic adjustment was by D. D. Palmer in 1895 {{in which he}} restored Harvey Lillard’s hearing. Mr Lillard had been deaf for seventeen years. This brought about {{the birth of a}} new profession called chiropractic (Terrett 2002). It has been postulated that dysfunction or spinal joint motion restrictions of the cervical spine may lead to irritation of the sympathetic nervous system which may cause decreased blood flow to the auditory nerve via the labyrinthine artery (also known as the internal acoustic artery or internal auditory artery), which in turn may lead to a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> acuity (Hawley 1964). The purpose of the dissertation was to determine whether cervical spine joint adjustment had an effect on the hearing acuity in individuals with some level of sensorineural hearing loss. Thirty symptomatic patients of either gender participated in this study. These patients were recruited by the use of advertisements placed in the Chiropractic Day Clinic, University of Johannesburg, Doornfontein Campus and by word of mouth. The inclusion criteria required the patients to present with some level of sensorineural hearing loss, be over the age of fifty years and have no contra-indications to chiropractic adjustments. Objective data was obtained by the Interacoustics Diagnostics Audiometer AD 229 b, which determined the level of auditory acuity before and after chiropractic treatment was administered. Middle ear function and acoustic reflex was also tested with the GSI 38 Auto Tymp acoustic reflex machine. The objective results demonstrated that there was no statistically significant increase in auditory acuity following either the chiropractic treatment, or the detuned ultrasound treatment. In conclusion, it was shown that chiropractic adjustments in some patients presenting with sensorineural hearing loss, in the same subjects, exhibited a clinical improvement in hearing acuity however, not a statistically significant improvement following the treatment protocol discussed in the chapters that follow. These improvements suggested that the adjustment resulted in a decrease in sympathetic nervous system stimulation and an increase in blood flow through the labyrinthine artery, and therefore an increase in auditory acuity. These improvements were noted to a larger degree in individuals with a greater sensorineural hearing loss and not across the entire sample population. Dr. M. Moodley Dr. S. M. Wilco...|$|E
40|$|In {{order for}} the mentally retarded {{population}} to achieve maximum benefit from rehabilitation efforts, {{it is essential that}} a complete picture of their abilities and disabilities be obtained. Consequently, the identification of hearing loss is an integral element in any diagnostic procedure. Vancouver School District 37 has directed increased attention toward speech and language training for children in the special education classrooms for the mentally retarded; however, differential hearing diagnosis has been inadequate or totally lacking. In order to more efficiently treat this problem, it was felt that a comprehensive investigation into the incidence and types of hearing loss of this population would provide a basis for program design. To adequately survey the previous investigations in the literature it was advantageous to divide them into categories according to likeness of criteria used in defining 2 ̆ 2 hearing loss. 2 ̆ 2 In this survey, a heterogeneous sample of 212 retarded subjects ranging in age from 6 years, 8 months to 19 years, 9 months was audiometrically tested at four frequencies: 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz. The retarded subjects encompassed MI levels I through IV on the c 1 assification system developed by the American Association on Mental Deficiency. Tests were administered at eight locations within the Vancouver School District 37 which offered adequate test environments. The criterion for hearing loss in this survey was a loss of 20 dB or more in two or more frequencies in either ear. The audiometric procedure used in both air and bone-conduction testing was the revised technique of Newhart and Reger (1945, revised 1956). Operant procedures were designed after Stewart (1970). Two examiners were used, and ten test scores of each correlated at approximately. 93 using the Pearson Product- Moment Correlation. Thirty-eight of the 212 subjects had hearing losses of 20 dB or more in two or more frequencies in either ear. This number established an incidence of 17. 9 per cent for this population. The present data indicate, in general, that the incidence of hearing loss is greater among the more severely retarded than among the less retarded. The audiometric data depict a general trend toward a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> loss incidence with increasing. age. Of those with hearing loss, slightly more males (53 per cent) than females (47 per cent) were represented. The pattern established by the current survey revealed a concentration of conductive losses at lower age levels and a concentration of sensori-neural losses at the higher age levels. The special education classrooms of Vancouver School District 37 reveal a three to six times greater incidence of hearing loss than among the normal classrooms of the district. The concentration of conductive losses at lower age levels leads to a recommendation that hearing levels be screened each year up to age 12...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10 % of the global population is impaired to a significant degree by a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> sensitivity. With the greatest proportion of these persons residing in developing countries where communities are grossly underserved, it is incumbent on hearing healthcare professionals to seek means of offering equitable hearing health care services to these communities. The delivery of conventional diagnostic hearing services to these population groups is challenged by limitations in human resources, financial constraints and by the dearth of audiometric testing facilities that are compliant with permissible ambient noise levels for reliable testing. Valid diagnostic hearing assessment without an audiometric test booth will allow greater mobility of services and could extend hearing healthcare service delivery in underserved areas. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the validity of diagnostic pure tone audiometry in a natural environment, outside a sound treated room, using a computer-operated audiometer with insert earphones covered by circumaural earcups incorporating real-time monitoring of environmental noise. A within-subject repeated measures research design was employed to assess elderly adults with diagnostic air (250 to 8000 Hz) and bone (250 to 4000 Hz) conduction pure tone audiometry. The study was of a quantitative nature and the required data was collected by testing subjects initially in a natural environment and subsequently in a sound booth environment to compare the threshold measurements. One experienced audiologist used audiometric KUDUwave test equipment to evaluate subjects in both environments. A total of 147 adults with an average age of 76 (± 5. 7) years were tested. Ears had pure tone averages (500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz) of ≥ 25 dB in 59 %, > 40 dB in 23 % and ˃ 55 dB in 6 % of cases. Analysis of collected data showed air conduction thresholds (n = 2259) corresponding within 0 to 5 dB in 95 % of all comparisons between testing in the natural and sound booth environments. Bone conduction thresholds (n = 1669) corresponded within 0 to 5 dB in 86 % of comparisons and within 10 dB or less in 97 % of cases. Average threshold differences (– 0. 6 to 1. 1) and standard deviations (3. 3 to 5. 9) were within typical test-retest reliability limits. Recorded thresholds showed no statistically significant differences with a paired samples t-test (p ˃ 0. 01) except at 8000 Hz in the left ear. Overall the correlation between the air-conduction thresholds recorded in the sound booth environment and the natural environment was very high (˃ 0. 92) across all frequencies while for bone conduction threshold correlation for the two environments fell between 0. 63 and 0. 97. This study demonstrates that valid diagnostic pure tone audiometry in an elderly population can be performed in a natural environment using an audiometer employing insert earphones covered by circumaural earcups with real-time monitoring of ambient noise levels. Mobile diagnostic audiometry performed outside of an audiometric sound booth may extend current hearing healthcare services to remote underserved communities where booths are scarce or inaccessible. In combination with Telehealth applications this technology could offer a powerful and viable alternate diagnostic service to persons unable to attend conventional testing facilities for whatever reasons.

5000|$|Some {{specific}} symptoms {{vary from}} {{one type of}} leukodystrophy to the next {{but the vast majority}} of symptoms are shared as the causes for the disease generally have the same effects. Symptoms are dependent on the age of onset, which is predominantly in infancy and early childhood, although the exact time of onset may be difficult to determine. Hyperirritability and hypersensitivity to the environment are common, as well as some tell-tale physical signs including muscle rigidity and a backwards-bent head. Botox therapy is often used to treat patients with spasticity. Juvenile and adult onsets display similar symptoms including a <b>decrease</b> or loss <b>in</b> <b>hearing</b> and vision. While children do experience optic and auditory degeneration, the course of the disease is usually too rapid, causing death relatively quickly, whereas adults may live with these conditions for many years. In children, spastic activity often precedes progressive ataxia and rapid cognitive deterioration which has been described as mental retardation. [...] Epilepsy is commonplace for patients of all ages. [...] More progressed patients show weakness in deglutition, leading to spastic coughing fits due to inhaled saliva. Classic symptomatic progression of juvenile x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is shown in the 1992 film, Lorenzo's Oil.|$|R
50|$|Hair {{cells are}} the sensory receptors {{of both the}} {{auditory}} system and the vestibular system in the ears of all vertebrates. Through mechanotransduction, hair cells detect movement in their environment. In mammals, the auditory hair cells are located within the spiral organ of Corti on the thin basilar membrane in the cochlea of the inner ear. They derive their name from the tufts of stereocilia called hair bundles that protrude from the apical surface of the cell into the fluid-filled cochlear duct. Mammalian cochlear hair cells are of two anatomically and functionally distinct types, known as outer, and inner hair cells. Damage to these hair cells results <b>in</b> <b>decreased</b> <b>hearing</b> sensitivity, and because the inner ear hair cells cannot regenerate, this damage is permanent.
