50|$|Kora Kagaz is that blank {{piece of}} paper upon which for centuries an Indian woman's destiny has been scripted by her parents, {{her husband and her}} family. Very rarely <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> an {{opportunity}} to rewrite it the way she wants it.|$|R

6000|$|Miss Macroyd laughed the more; {{then she}} {{purposely}} darkened her countenance {{so as to}} suit it to her lugubrious whisper, [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> it? Never mind. I'm {{not going}} to set you against her, if you're her {{favourite}} for the moment. She has a niece with her there,--hasn't she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Mr. Glover," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "At last there seems {{a chance of}} our picking up a prize this cruise. The {{question}} is, how <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> {{all them}} the'ries?" [...] marveled Uncle Whittier Smail; while Aunt Bessie inquired, [...] "Do you suppose there's many folks got notions like hers? My! If there are," [...] and her tone settled {{the fact that}} there were not, [...] "I just don't know what the world's coming to!" ...|$|R

5000|$|When Kansas farm girl Dorothy Gale and her pet dog Toto are {{swept away}} to the magical Land of Oz in a cyclone, she fatally {{flattens}} the Wicked Witch of the East, liberates a talking Scarecrow, meets a Tin Woodman, a Cowardly Lion and is hailed by everyone as a great sorceress! But all Dorothy really wants to know is: how <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> back home again? ...|$|R
6000|$|How <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> there? What strange spell [...] Kept her {{two hundred}} years so well, [...] Free from decay and mortal taint? [...] What but the prayers of a patron saint! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> hold of that--where <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> hold of that?" [...] Peter {{wondered}} {{while his}} whole sense vibrated. [...] "She hadn't {{got hold of}} it when I went away." [...] And the assurance flowed over him again that she had found the key to her box of treasures. In the summer, during their weeks of frequent meeting, she had only fumbled with the lock. One October day, while he was away, the key had slipped in, had fitted, or her finger at last had touched the right spring and the capricious casket had flown open.|$|E
6000|$|Her smile clouded. [...] "I'm only walking {{here in the}} avenue. How is Louise? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> home safely? It {{was good}} of her to come here. It isn't the place for a gay visit." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jordan {{is stuck}} in a hot room {{and seems to be}} [...] "melting" [...] like the witch <b>does</b> when <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> doused with water.|$|R

5000|$|Blackstone's portraits were {{praised for}} their individuality, directness, and mastery of technique. One art expert commented: [...] "How <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> that flesh color? It is as {{luminous}} as life itself." [...] Among those she painted were soprano Amelita Galli-Curci, singer Nadezhda Plevitskaya, architect D. Everett Waid, pianist Stell Andersen, Mrs. Frederick D. Underwood, Mrs. Andrew MacLeish, Mrs. John G. McCullough, and numerous midwestern businessmen {{and their wives}} and children.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where did ye find her? How <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> here?" [...] demanded Mrs. Muldoon. Never {{before had}} the Professor seen Mrs. Muldoon {{other than a}} placid, good-humoured body. She was {{trembling}} from head to foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah. I {{heard from}} Brander {{that she was}} shut up there, and I was {{wondering}} whether you had run against her. He is very savage at what he calls her vagaries. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> through the starvation all right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is quite}} exhausted," [...] said the physician. [...] "Sleep {{is a good}} remedy. When she wakes, give her a toddy--with an egg in it, if she can take it. How <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> that bruise upon her forehead?" ...|$|E
60|$|She seems a smart {{business}} woman, and <b>she</b> {{would probably}} <b>get</b> on very well {{if it were}} not for her friends and relations. Friends and relations are a trying class of people even in real life, as we all know, but the friends and relations of the stage adventuress are a particularly irritating lot. They never leave her; never <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> a day or an hour off from them. Wherever she goes, there the whole tribe goes with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{worry about}} it if I was you," [...] he remarked. [...] "She's hardly likely to find you now. And if <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> won't <b>get</b> much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, turning uneasily in my chair, {{and at last}} {{hitting on}} a bright {{masculine}} expedient, [...] "I'll tell you what must be <b>done.</b> <b>She</b> must <b>get</b> married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How the deuce <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> there?" [...] ejaculated Coventry, {{looking as}} if he had {{received}} another sensation. [...] "She has spirit, though, and upon my word I pity Sydney, if he did try to dazzle her, for he must have got a splendid dismissal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which?" [...] "Where is she?" [...] "How in {{the world}} <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> here?" [...] were the whispered remarks that {{followed}} her wherever she moved; and Mrs. Follingsbee, looking after her, could hardly suppress an exulting Te Deum. It was done, and couldn't be undone.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not yet}} time to go down, {{in spite}} of this gentleman’s saying so, and Littlemore and his friend passed out to the balcony of the foyer. “Headway—Headway? Where the deuce <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> that name?” Littlemore asked as they looked down into the flaring dusk.|$|E
50|$|Just when {{it looks}} like a toss-up as to what will prove his {{downfall}} first, the bad trip, the FBI, or the mob, Alan's other girlfriend (who is also his philosophy lecturer), Chesney Cort (played by Adams), saves the day. Not only <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> Alan to a doctor who can bring him back to sobriety, she reveals that she is in a sexual threesome with Carter and Morgan. Once he gets some photographic evidence for blackmail, Alan is extricated from his problems.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure she's gone. Wotcha {{expect her}} to <b>do?</b> <b>She's</b> gotta <b>get</b> {{over to the other}} side, ain't she? Cert'nly she's gone." [...] She looked at him interested. [...] "Do you want to be on board her?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... by Terrance Dicks (2002, Big Finish), {{which starts}} off the Sarah Jane Smith audio series, {{relating}} her exploits as an investigative journalist. The play mentions that Lavinia has died, and starts at her funeral. Brendan is mentioned as living in San Francisco {{and unable to}} attend the funeral. It also {{sets the stage for}} her journalistic [...] "independence" [...] by portraying her as the sole inheritor of Lavinia's estate. Not only <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> the sprawling manor and market garden shown in A Girl's Best Friend, but she also is the heir to the royalties from Lavinia's patents.|$|R
6000|$|... "My goodness, where <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> that stylish suit?" [...] whispered Miss Smith to Miss Jones, as Kitty floated {{into the}} station with all sail set, finding it {{impossible}} {{to resist the temptation}} to astonish certain young ladies who had snubbed her in times past, which snubs had rankled, and were now avenged.|$|E
6000|$|Tom laughed, {{and drew}} Polly closer {{as the crowd}} pressed, saying, with mock tenderness: [...] "Did n't she like to be chaffed about her sweethearts? Well, she shan't be if I can help it. Poor dear, <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> her little bonnet knocked into a cocked hat and her little temper riled at the same time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{at least}} five times as much as I expected, Hilda. I have heard all sorts of {{marvelous}} stories of the power of your old woman. Several people told me that she seemed to know all about them, and told them things that they believed were only known to themselves. But how <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>get</b> so much money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{wished to}} tell me," [...] 'said she, [...] "before my visitor left, {{that the name}} of the 'sweet' which she gave us at luncheon is la promesse, being merely a promise of what she is going to <b>do,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> about her {{everything}} she wants." ...|$|R
5000|$|The very {{annoying}} {{sister of}} Tiko and (she believes) Tickle. She loves {{nothing more than}} butting into whatever her [...] "sisters" [...] are <b>doing.</b> <b>She</b> often <b>gets</b> her comeuppance via Tickle's magic. Naturally, nobody believes her when she claims to have seen Tickle using magic.|$|R
50|$|She's Momoko's upperclassman, {{and lives}} in the same dorm. She has very {{particular}} mannerisms, and her head and mouth are always busy with her endless schemes. Even though she's aware of how Asafuki feels, she makes repeated, determined passes at her. However every time <b>she</b> <b>does,</b> <b>she</b> <b>gets</b> compared to Momoko, therefore she sees her as an enemy. She's short of stature, her hair is hard to style, her face doesn't have much charm, etc. The inferiority of her physical features compared to Momoko's causes her to feel compromised. However, she doesn't seem to mind that it's not ladylike that her pitching arm {{is good enough to}} hurl a chair one-handed.|$|R
