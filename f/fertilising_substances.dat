British sovereignty was proclaimed April 22, 1889. In 1903 the atoll was leased to Lever Brothers, [...] "for the purpose of removing guano or other <b>fertilising</b> <b>substances</b> therefrom, and of planting the land with coconuts, and for collecting pearl-shells, and for other purposes of a like nature." [...] They maintained about thirty persons on the island until a cyclone in 1914 so severely damaged operations that the island was abandoned.|$|E

The dunes appeared after the last ice age, approximately 10.000 years ago. Because the region was still without any vegetation at that time, the sand was blown into this area from an old river bed of the Rhine. The dunes are {{the remains of a}} former wider open sand area that is nowadays mostly covered by a residential zone. The body of the dunes is clearly visible because it sticks 2 - 3 meters out of the surroundings. The sandy soil distinguishes itself by being dry and poor in nutritions. A number of specific plants, such as the grey hair-grass and other endangered species are adapted to these extreme soil conditions. The half-open structure creates an impression that is so characteristic for dune vegetation. To preserve the specific biotope of the area, {{it is important not to}} add any <b>fertilising</b> <b>substances</b> into the soil. Next to the plants, the dunes also provide a viable habitat for rare animals. The sunny and dry spots are of special importance to particular insect types such as grasshoppers, wild bees and wasps.|$|E
