25|$|For these drives, at {{the highest}} exhaust speeds, {{energetic}} efficiency and thrust are all inversely proportional to <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> Their very high <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> means they require huge amounts of energy and thus with practical power sources provide low thrust, but use hardly any fuel.|$|E
25|$|Some drives (such as VASIMR or electrodeless plasma thruster) {{actually}} can significantly vary their <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> This {{can help reduce}} propellant usage or improve acceleration {{at different stages of}} the flight. However the best energetic performance and acceleration is still obtained when the <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> is close to the vehicle speed. Proposed ion and plasma drives usually have exhaust velocities enormously higher than that ideal (in the case of VASIMR the lowest quoted speed is around 15000m/s compared to a mission delta-v from high Earth orbit to Mars of about 4000m/s).|$|E

25|$|All current solar powered {{spacecraft}} use {{solar panels}} {{in conjunction with}} electric propulsion, typically ion drives as this gives a very high <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity,</b> and reduces the propellant over that of a rocket {{by more than a}} factor of ten.

25|$|Rocket exhaust {{generates a}} {{significant}} amount of acoustic energy. As the supersonic exhaust collides with the ambient air, shock waves are formed. The sound intensity from these shock waves depends {{on the size of the}} rocket as well as the <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> The sound intensity of large, high performance rockets could potentially kill at close range.|$|E
25|$|The great {{disadvantage}} is {{the limited}} operating time. The jet of steam and oxygen can provide significant thrust from fairly lightweight rockets, but the jet has {{a relatively low}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> and hence a poor specific impulse. Currently, such rocket belts can only fly for about 30 seconds (because of the limited amount of fuel the user can carry unassisted).|$|E
40|$|A set {{of burning}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the influence of smoke vent height and <b>exhausting</b> <b>velocity</b> on mechanical smoke exhausting efficiency. Results {{have shown that the}} smoke exhausting process becomes more efficient due to the increased smoke vent height and the decreased <b>exhausting</b> <b>velocity,</b> which eliminate the plug-holing issue with fewer disturbances on the smoke layer interface. For each certain <b>exhausting</b> <b>velocity,</b> there is a critical value of distance between the vent and the bottom of the smoke layer. When the distance is less than the critical value, the smoke exhausting is inefficient, and the efficiency decreases sharply as the distance decreases. Contrarily, when the distance is greater than the critical value, a good efficiency can be acquired and the exhausted smoke increased relatively slowly as the distance increases. A critical Froude number, proposed by Hinkley to predict the onset of plug-holing effect in gravity venting systems, was validated in the experiments. However, the experimental results indicate that in the tests without the plug-holing, the fresh air entrained due to smoke exhausting is up to 48 % of the mechanical exhausting rate...|$|R

25|$|The fourth is {{the maximum}} delta-v this {{technique}} can give (without staging). For rocket-like propulsion systems {{this is a}} function of mass fraction and <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity.</b> Mass fraction for rocket-like systems is usually limited by propulsion system weight and tankage weight. For a system to achieve this limit, typically the payload may need to be a negligible percentage of the vehicle, and so the practical limit on some systems can be much lower.|$|E
25|$|Variable-geometry or variable-nozzle turbochargers use {{moveable}} vanes {{to adjust}} the air-flow to the turbine, imitating a turbocharger of the optimal size throughout the power curve. The vanes are placed {{just in front of}} the turbine like a set of slightly overlapping walls. Their angle is adjusted by an actuator to block or increase air flow to the turbine. This variability maintains a comparable <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> and back pressure throughout the engine’s rev range. The result is that the turbocharger improves fuel efficiency without a noticeable level of turbocharger lag.|$|E

50|$|Rather {{than relying}} on high {{temperature}} and fluid dynamics to accelerate the reaction mass to high speeds, {{there are a variety}} of methods that use electrostatic or electromagnetic forces to accelerate the reaction mass directly.

25|$|Project Orion {{team member}} Freeman Dyson {{proposed}} in 1968 an interstellar spacecraft using nuclear pulse propulsion that used pure deuterium fusion detonations {{with a very}} high fuel-burnup fraction. He computed an <b>exhaust</b> <b>velocity</b> of 15,000km/s and a 100,000-tonne space vehicle able to achieve a 20,000km/s delta-v allowing a flight-time to Alpha Centauri of 130 years. Later studies indicate that the top cruise velocity that can theoretically be achieved by a Teller-Ulam thermonuclear unit powered Orion starship, assuming no fuel is saved for slowing back down, is about 8% to 10% {{of the speed of}} light (0.08-0.1c). An atomic (fission) Orion can achieve perhaps 3%-5% of the speed of light. A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range and pure matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would be theoretically capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the maximum speed. The concept of using a magnetic sail to decelerate the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity. Alternative designs utilizing similar principles include Project Longshot, Project Daedalus, and Mini-Mag Orion. The principle of external nuclear pulse propulsion to maximize survivable power has remained common among serious concepts for interstellar flight without external power beaming and for very high-performance interplanetary flight.|$|E
