Yamamoto spotted the bear resting near a <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak.</b> He approached to within 20 meters of the bear and shot at it. His first shot hit the bear's heart and the second shot his head, fatally wounding the animal. When measured, the bear was 340 kg (749 lbs) and 2.7 m (8.85 ft) tall. A necropsy was carried out on the bear during which parts of his victims were found in his stomach. While {{at the time the}} skull and some of the fur of the bear were kept, they later were lost and no traces of Kesagake are left.|$|E

40|$|We {{separately}} {{examined the}} temporal patterns of root production by <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus crispula) and dwarf bamboo (Sasa veitchii), {{which is a}} major understory species in cool temperate forests. We grew <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak</b> seedlings and Sasa stocks (i. e., the rhizome and connected culms) in organic‐free sand in rhizoboxes and then scanned roots that were visible through {{the sides of the}} rhizoboxes to measure the length of each root in images. <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak</b> root production peaked in July, but Sasa root production peaked in both July and October. Soil temperature was highly correlated with root production of <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak,</b> but less so with Sasa root. Leaves of Sasa expanded in late summer, and the photosynthetic rate of Sasa was highest in September, suggesting that the aboveground phenology influences the extensive root production of Sasa in October due to the supply of carbohydrate. These results demonstrate different temporal patterns of root production by <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak</b> seedlings and understory species (Sasa), even under similar environmental conditions...|$|E
30|$|From Figs.  1 and 2, it is {{apparent}} that the cesium concentrations on activated charcoal are lower than those on <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak</b> charcoal. In other words, the cesium-adsorption capacity of activated charcoal is inferior to that of <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak</b> charcoal. This agrees with our previous experimental observation for more concentrated cesium solutions [10].|$|E
30|$|In a {{previous}} work [10], we studied the cesium-adsorption behavior of commercially available <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak</b> and activated charcoal, whose manufacturing temperatures were {{estimated to be}} 600 – 800  °C and more than 1000  °C, respectively, based on the Raman spectroscopic data [10, 11]. Investigations into cesium adsorption from aqueous solutions were carried out with respect to pH and surface structures of adsorbent, indicating that <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak</b> charcoal has a considerable ability to adsorb cesium ions from neutral or weakly basic aqueous solutions. From our adsorption experimental data, {{it was suggested that}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak</b> charcoal is superior to activated charcoal, which has a large specific surface area, in terms of adsorbing cesium, despite its smaller specific surface area and predicted that the primary interaction for cesium adsorption onto charcoal is electrostatic attraction induced by surface potential of charcoal, in other words, functional groups on charcoal surface. Moreover, it was confirmed that sodium ions strongly obstruct cesium adsorption onto <b>Japanese</b> <b>oak</b> charcoal.|$|E
