40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>disbonds</b> significantly decreases {{the integrity of}} many laminated structures used in aerospace applications. Critical {{for the assessment of}} the effect of these <b>disbonds</b> on structural integrity is a determination of the disbond area. Thermography is able to detect local variations in temperature after external heating resulting from subsurface delaminations. One limitation of thermography is that the heat diffuses within the laminates, causing difficulty in determining the area of the disbond from the thermographic image. A technique has been developed for reducing the thermographic image to an image of subsurface delaminations for some laminated structures. The technique clearly delineates regions of disbond and is able to resolve <b>disbonds</b> which are unresolvable in the thermographic image. The limits of this technique for resolving the area and separation of <b>disbonds</b> are investigated using both experimental measurements and numerical calculations...|$|E

Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM), Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and optical microscopy have been combined to conduct this study. Several factors affecting the cathodic <b>disbonding</b> process: Film thickness, Cation mobility, Electrolyte concentration, Temperature, Paint composition, Polarisation and Open circuit potential, have been investigated.

Semi-immersion tests show that <b>disbonding</b> under full- and semi-immersion conditions have similar behaviours and both follow parabolic kinetics indicating the <b>disbonding</b> is likely to be controlled by a transport process along the coating/metal interface.

40|$|In {{this work}} a novel data {{collection}} and processing is proposed for the Infrared Non-Destructive Testing (IR-NDT) of interlaminar <b>disbonds</b> on Fibre Metal Laminate (FML) hybrid composites. The adopted active IR-NDT scheme uses a pointwise laser heat source that is moved along a raster scanning trajectory over the object surface. A Focal Plane Array IR camera is employed to acquire the thermal field generated by the moving heat source. <b>Disbonds</b> defect signatures are then searched by analysing the perturbations of the temperature distribution over a reference area following the heat source. The proposed methodology has been implemented on a GLARE sample, since this class of FMLs has gained extensive use in aerospace structures. In particular, a sample of GLARE 1 3 / 2 – 0. 3 was manufactured in-house, containing triangular shaped artificial <b>disbonds</b> at different interlayers.

50|$|This is {{a process}} of disbondment of {{protective}} coatings from the protected structure (cathode) due to the formation of hydrogen ions over the surface of the protected material (cathode). <b>Disbonding</b> can be exacerbated by an increase in alkali ions and an increase in cathodic polarization. The degree of <b>disbonding</b> is also reliant on the type of coating, with some coatings affected more than others.

40|$|Typical damage modes {{in light}} {{honeycomb}} sandwich structures include face sheet/core <b>disbonding</b> and core fracture, {{both of which}} can {{pose a threat to}} the structural integrity of a component. These damage modes are of particular interest to aviation certification authorities since several in-service occurrences, such as rudder structural failure and other control surface malfunctions, have been attributed to face sheet/core <b>disbonding.</b> Extensive studies have shown that face sheet/core <b>disbonding</b> and core fracture can lead to damage propagation caused by internal pressure changes in the core. The increasing use of composite sandwich construction in aircraft applications makes it vitally important to understand the effect of ground-air-ground (GAG) cycles and conditions such as maneuver and gust loads on face sheet/core <b>disbonding.</b> The objective {{of the present study was}} to use a fracture mechanics based approach developed earlier to evaluate the loading at the <b>disbond</b> front caused by ground-air-ground pressurization and in-plane loading. A honeycomb sandwich panel containing a circular <b>disbond</b> at one face sheet/core interface was modeled with three-dimensional (3 D) solid finite elements. The <b>disbond</b> was modeled as a discrete discontinuity and the strain energy release rate along the <b>disbond</b> front was computed using the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT). Special attention was paid to the pressure-deformation coupling which can decrease the pressure load within the <b>disbonded</b> sandwich section significantly when the structure is highly deformed. The commercial finite element analysis software, Abaqus/Standard, was used for the analyses. The recursive pressure-deformation coupling problem was solved by representing the entrapped air in the honeycomb cells as filled cavities in Abaqus/Standard. The results show that <b>disbond</b> size, face sheet thickness and core thickness are important parameters that determine crack tip loading at the <b>disbond</b> front. Further, the pressure-deformation coupling was found to have an important load decreasing effect [6]. In this paper, a detailed problem description is provided first.

40|$|There are {{currently}} no standard test methods for testing the cathodic <b>disbonding</b> properties of organic coatings at temperatures above 100 C.

The main goal of this work was {{the development of a}} new apparatus and testing procedure for high temperature cathodic <b>disbonding,</b> hereby referred to as HTCD (High Temperature Cathodic <b>Disbonding).</b> A test method for the cathodic <b>disbonding</b> of organic coatings from submerged steel subjected to high temperatures was studied. The test method requires the use of a specialized HTCD apparatus. In this test method, sample plates were mounted between two channels, one containing a hot (150 C) oil flow and the other containing a pressurized, cold, salt (3. 5 % NaCl) water flow. Accelerated conditions made it possible to test the cathodic <b>disbonding</b> properties of several coatings in four weeks. Four weeks is a typical duration for coating prequalification tests. Several commercial coating products of different generic types provided by different manufacturers were tested. The results indicate that adequate coating products for high temperature underwater exposure are available. The required cathodic protection current for the samples tested in the HTCD apparatus was continuously monitored. No correlation between the required cathodic protection current and the extent of cathodic <b>disbonding</b> was observed. A long term test with more field like conditions and a duration of 400 days was performed. Low levels of <b>disbonding</b> for most of the tested products in the 400 day test made comparison to the accelerated tests difficult. An attempt was made to determine the oxygen diffusion coefficient of five coating products. The attempt was unsuccessful. The same method had previously been used to study coatings with a thickness of up to 300 micro m, the coatings studied in this work were between 600 micro-metres and 1200 micro-metres. It remains uncertain whether the chosen method can be used for coatings this thick. Results from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, performed in a pressurized vessel, showed a large reduction in the ionic resistance of a submerged organic coating upon heating from 30 C to 150 C. This showed that elevated temperatures throughout the coating can reduce the ionic resistance to a level where even an intact coating is incapable of protecting the substrate. Studies of coating samples at ambient temperatures after exposure to higher temperatures showed that exposure to heat causes a lasting reduction in impedance. High impedances correlated with good performance in the HTCD tests.
