5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a dirty trick {{that even}} Falco wants {{no part of}} it, at least until Hunsecker {{promises}} {{to take a long}} vacation from his powerful column and turn it over to Falco in his absence. At a nightclub, Falco slips the marijuana cigarettes into a pocket of a coat belonging to Dallas, who is accosted by Kello outside the club.|$|E
5|$|Romeo and Juliet is {{sometimes}} {{considered to have}} no unifying theme, save that of young love. Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love. Since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> an obvious subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance of the play.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} Agnes Greys renewed {{interest}} in poetry is, however, the curate to whom she is attracted. William Weightman aroused much curiosity. It seems clear he was a good-looking, engaging young man, whose easy humour and kindness towards the sisters made a considerable impression. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing.|$|E
6000|$|When {{there was}} a debate, and I was kept out very late, it seemed so strange to me, as I was walking home, to think that Dora <b>was</b> at home! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a {{wonderful}} thing, at first, to have her coming softly down {{to talk to me}} as I ate my supper. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a stupendous thing to know for certain that she put her hair in papers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> altogether <b>such</b> an astonishing event to see her do it! ...|$|R

25|$|The {{legacy of}} the life lived by John Stephens is quite complicated. William Powell {{is not alone in}} his {{negative}} characterization of Stephens. Much local folk history characterizes Stephens as, at best, a misguided miscreant, and at worst a criminally craven opportunist. What is clear from all accounts is that Stephens did work extensively with the Freedmen's Bureau and the Union League. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> associations – as well as his political organization of the black population – that cause the wide divergence in popular opinion surrounding his legacy.|$|E
25|$|Bug {{management}} {{includes the}} process of documenting, categorizing, assigning, reproducing, correcting and releasing the corrected code. Proposed changes to software– bugs as well as enhancement requests and even entire releases– are commonly tracked and managed using bug tracking systems or issue tracking systems. The items added may be called defects, tickets, issues, or, following the agile development paradigm, stories and epics. Categories may be objective, subjective or a combination, such as version number, area of the software, severity and priority, {{as well as what}} type of issue <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>such</b> as a feature request or a bug.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> an {{interesting}} drama {{to see a}} nation create itself, that I – if I now had not been who I am – would go to America to follow up close every phase {{in the emergence of}} this new republic. – This perhaps is America's century. The new republic, which hardly has a population put together better than Rome had to begin with, may perhaps take advantage of Europe some day, {{in the same manner as}} Europe has taken advantage of America for two centuries. No matter what, I cannot help but admire their courage and enthusiastically appreciate their daring.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the sixth}} season, Willow struggles to allow herself to perform magic without the {{darkness}} within her taking her over. She {{is no longer}} able to abstain from magic as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> an integral part of her that doing so will kill her. In the instances when she is highly emotional the darkness comes out. Willow must control that part of her and is occasionally unable to do so, giving her a trait similar to Angel, a cursed vampire who fears losing his soul will turn him evil. In a redemptive turn, when Willow turns all the Potentials into Slayers, she glows and her hair turns white, astonishing Kennedy and prompting her to call Willow a goddess.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, {{to have made}} all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and say you are protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. It was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order {{the dog to}} sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler {{to walk away from}} the dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or getting up to walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E

500|$|This is {{the more}} prestigious of just two awards made by Norwich City itself each year to its players, the other being the 'Young Player of the Year' accolade. The 2003–04 winner Craig Fleming made clear just how {{important}} this award is to Norwich City players, [...] "It is something you dream of winning... <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a prestigious award". Other awards available are awarded by other bodies, namely the Capital Canaries, Norwich City Independent Supporters Association and the [...] "Ambassador Club".|$|E

Its value as an artifact is enhanced by the successful reuse which has retained {{the character of the}} building." [...] Dave Collins of The Day wrote, [...] "The Barns house is also especially important to New London because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a fine and rare example of the architectural fabric of the big swath of the downtown that was demolished in urban renewal in the 1960s." ...|$|E
500|$|Bhatti's {{departure}} was not announced. When a {{fire was}} reported to be happening around Christmas 2011, rumours emerged from an alleged EastEnders insider that [...] "Yusef has long been tipped as a possible fatality". The insider added [...] "This is the biggest fire EastEnders has ever seen and there will be casualties. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a huge disaster that it will affect most of the families on the show in one way or another. There is a great tradition at EastEnders of captivating Christmas Day storylines and this year is no different." [...] Yusef's death aired on 26 December 2011 concluding his storyline.|$|E

500|$|These {{cities were}} largely {{untouched}} during the nightly bombing raids and the Army Air Forces agreed {{to leave them}} off the target list so accurate assessment of the weapon could be made. Hiroshima was described as [...] "an important army depot and port of embarkation {{in the middle of}} an urban industrial area. It is a good radar target and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a size that a large part of the city could be extensively damaged. There are adjacent hills which are likely to produce a focusing effect which would considerably increase the blast damage. Due to rivers it is not a good incendiary target." ...|$|E
500|$|What makes [...] "Ray Of Light" [...] one of Madonna's best singles is {{the fact}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a bitch to sing. Filled with {{multiple}} octave changes, it forced Madonna to push her vocal as far as it could possibly go. The song demanded she make use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. It really is a techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts. After hearing a sample of {{it for the first time}} in the spring of 1998, I just knew that Madonna had outdone herself. The song brings the entire album of to a whole new level.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} {{is regarded as}} [...] "another of his comments {{on the way in}} which we view art." [...] The work, along with his Femme au Chapeau from 1962 mark the beginnings of Lichtenstein's presentations of art about art because it was among his first paintings that drew upon a predecessor artist. Lichtenstein noted his objection to the attempt to reduce art diagrammatically: [...] "I wasn't trying to berate Erle Loran ... but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> an oversimplification trying to explain a painting by A, B, C." [...] He also noted that [...] "The Cézanne is such a complex painting. Taking an outline and calling it Madame Cézanne is in itself humorous, particularly the idea of diagramming a Cézanne when Cézanne said, '... the outline escaped me.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{has stated}} {{that he had to}} {{overcome}} considerable resistance at Columbia Records to give the album its title. He told biographer Robert Shelton: [...] "I wanted to call that album Highway 61 Revisited. Nobody understood it. I had to go up the fucking ladder until finally the word came down and said: 'Let him call it what he wants to call it'." [...] Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues: [...] "Indeed the album title Highway 61 Revisited announces that we are in for a long revisit, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a long, blues-travelled highway. Many bluesmen had been there before , all recording versions of a blues called 'Highway 61'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{geography}} and {{ecology of the}} Everglades involve the complex elements affecting the natural environment throughout the southern region of the U.S. state of Florida. Before drainage, the Everglades were an interwoven mesh of marshes and prairies covering [...] The Everglades is simultaneously a vast watershed that has historically extended from Lake Okeechobee [...] south to Florida Bay (around one-third of the southern Florida peninsula), and many interconnected ecosystems within a geographic boundary. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a unique meeting of water, land, and climate {{that the use of}} either singular or plural to refer to the Everglades is appropriate. When Marjory Stoneman Douglas wrote her definitive description of the region in 1947, she used the metaphor [...] "River of Grass" [...] to explain the blending of water and plant life.|$|E
500|$|The {{model for}} the {{preliminary}} illustrations of Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was Potter's own pet hedgehog. [...] Potter wrote to Warne on 12 November, [...] "Mrs. Tiggy as a model is comical; so long as she can go to sleep on my knee she is delighted, but if she is propped up on end for half an hour, she first begins to yawn pathetically, and then she does bite! Nevertheless, she is a dear person; just like a very fat rather stupid little dog. I think the book will go all right when once started." [...] Three weeks later, she wrote, [...] "The hedgehog drawings are turning out very comical. I have dressed up a cottonwool dummy for convenience of drawing the clothes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> a figure of fun." [...] The dummy terrified her rabbit and her pet mouse pulled out the stuffing. [...] "I think it should make a good book," [...] she wrote, [...] "When I have learnt to draw the child." ...|$|E
