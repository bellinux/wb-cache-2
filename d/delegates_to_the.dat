Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the <b>delegates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure, and managed {{to persuade him to}} make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E

Despite winning the popular vote, McCarthy lost to Humphrey at the convention amidst protests and riots.|$|E
5|$|Keyes first {{stated that}} he was {{considering}} leaving the Republican Party during a January 2008 appearance on The Weekly Filibuster radio show. He did not withdraw his candidacy after John McCain won the necessary 1,191 <b>delegates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republican National Convention, {{even though he was}} no longer campaigning for the Republican nomination. On March 27, 2008, Keyes's campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party's logo, along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo {{in the form of a}} dead elephant. This appeared to be an indication of Keyes's intentions to quit the Republican party and to begin officially seeking the Constitution Party's presidential nomination.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opinion in}} Texas was divided. Editorials in the United States began advocating {{complete}} independence for Texas.
