5|$|Somatic {{recombination}} of immunoglobulins, {{also known}} as V(D)J recombination, involves the generation of a unique <b>immunoglobulin</b> variable region. The variable region of each <b>immunoglobulin</b> heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments. V, D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an <b>immunoglobulin</b> variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments {{can be used to}} generate each <b>immunoglobulin</b> variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different , and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain <b>immunoglobulin</b> is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.|$|E
5|$|After a B cell {{produces}} a functional <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a {{process known as}} allelic exclusion) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.|$|E
5|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} are structurally identical <b>immunoglobulin</b> molecules with identical epitope-specificity (all of them bind {{with the}} same epitope with same affinity) as against their polyclonal counterparts which have varying affinities for the same epitope.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of maternal <b>immunoglobulins</b> in the mouse uterus and embryo {{in the days}} after implantation has been studied on sections incubated with sheep Fab anti-mouse <b>immunoglobulins</b> labeled with peroxidase. At the time of implantation the blastocyst is already surrounded by <b>immunoglobulins</b> that are also present in the blastocoel and early endoderm; uterine glands contain large amounts of <b>immunoglobulins.</b> Later, <b>immunoglobulins</b> are concentrated in the vacuolated endoderm, then the visceral yolk sac and the embryonic gut. They are also present in the various cavities of the embryo. Trophoblast cells progressively contain increasing amounts of <b>immunoglobulins.</b> In the decidua, <b>immunoglobulins</b> coat the cells and also occasionally appear as cytoplasmic granules. The early presence of maternal <b>immunoglobulins</b> may represent the transfer of serum proteins as a means of nutrition for the embryo. It is also very likely to have an immunological significance in the protection of the embryo...|$|R
5000|$|Gamma globulins are a {{class of}} globulins, {{identified}} by their position after serum protein electrophoresis. The most significant gamma globulins are <b>immunoglobulins</b> (antibodies), although some <b>immunoglobulins</b> are not gamma globulins, and some gamma globulins are not <b>immunoglobulins.</b>|$|R
40|$|The human <b>immunoglobulins</b> {{currently}} recog-nized can {{be divided}} into three major classes: the 7 S y 2 -globulins (G <b>immunoglobulins,</b> IgG); the ylM-globulins (M <b>immunoglobulins,</b> IgM); and the 'ylA-globulins (A <b>immunoglobulins,</b> IgA) 1 (2). These proteins can be readily distinguished from each other with specific antisera directed against the antigenic determinants associated with the heavy chains characteristic of each class. In addition, M <b>immunoglobulins</b> have a sedimentation coefficient of 19 S (mol wt of about 1, 000, 000), and their antibody activity is destroyed by treat-ment with 2 -mercaptoethanol or other thiol com-pounds, whereas G <b>immunoglobulins</b> have a sedi-mentation coefficient of 7 S (mol wt of about 160,- 000), and their antibody activity is not significantly affected by treatment with thiol compounds.

5|$|The basic {{functional}} unit of each antibody is an <b>immunoglobulin</b> (Ig) monomer (containing only one Ig unit); secreted antibodies {{can also be}} dimeric with two Ig units as with IgA, tetrameric with four Ig units like teleost fish IgM, or pentameric with five Ig units, like mammalian IgM.|$|E
5|$|The membrane-bound {{form of an}} {{antibody}} may {{be called}} a surface <b>immunoglobulin</b> (sIg) or a membrane <b>immunoglobulin</b> (mIg). It {{is part of the}} B cell receptor (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation. The BCR is composed of surface-bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig-α and Ig-β heterodimers, which are capable of signal transduction. A typical human B cell will have 50,000 to 100,000 antibodies bound to its surface. Upon antigen binding, they cluster in large patches, which can exceed 1 micrometer in diameter, on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other cell signaling receptors.|$|E
5|$|The {{proteasome}} is {{also involved}} in Intracellular antibody-mediated proteolysis of antibody-bound virions. In this neutralisation pathway, TRIM21 (a protein of the tripartite motif family) binds with <b>immunoglobulin</b> G to direct the virion to the proteasome where it is degraded.|$|E

40|$|The {{main cause}} of death in the {{intensive}} care units is infectious complications, including sepsis and septic shock. <b>Immunoglobulins</b> are the most potent mechanisms in anti-infective defense. Whether intravenous <b>immunoglobulins</b> should be used in urgent situations remains to be solved. The mechanisms of action of <b>immunoglobulins</b> are diverse and depend on dosage and time of use. The paper analyzes the data available in the Russian and foreign literature on the possible points of use of intravenous <b>immunoglobulins</b> in the treatment of acute conditions accompanied by sepsis.

5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} {{can be called}} monovalent (or specific) if they have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous <b>immunoglobulin,</b> if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|Definitive {{laboratory}} {{identification of}} variola virus involves growing the virus on chorioallantoic membrane (part of a chicken embryo) and examining the resulting pock lesions under defined temperature conditions. Strains may {{be characterized by}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) analysis. Serologic tests and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), which measure variola virus-specific <b>immunoglobulin</b> and antigen have also been developed to assist in the diagnosis of infection.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{worsening}} kidney damage {{would normally}} prompt a kidney biopsy. Treatment may be indicated {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from oral steroids to a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid), cyclophosphamide and dipyridamole followed by prednisone. Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without heparin and warfarin). Intravenous <b>immunoglobulin</b> (IVIG) is occasionally used.|$|E

40|$|Enhancing {{maternal}} antibodies {{are among}} the various factors currently thought {{to play a role}} in protecting the mammalian embryo from rejection by the mother (1). <b>Immunoglobulins</b> having enhancing or immunosuppressive properties can actually be eluted from late placentae, in mice or in humans (2 - 4). While it is now well established that <b>immunoglobulins</b> are transferred from the mother to the fetus in the last third of pregnancy (for review see reference 5), little is known concerning the distribution of maternal <b>immunoglobulins</b> in the uterus and the embryo in the days after implantation. In this paper we report an immunoperoxidase study of such distribution in the mouse uterus and embryo from day 5 to 10 after fertilization. It is shown that the embryo is surrounded by maternal <b>immunoglobulins</b> at the time of implantation and continues to be invested by <b>immunoglobulins</b> throughout the period we studied. Trophoblast giant cells heavily concentrate <b>immunoglobulins,</b> adding support to their possible role as an immunological filter. Materials and Method...|$|R
40|$|<b>Immunoglobulins</b> form an {{important}} component of the immunological activity found in milk and colostrum. They are central to the immunological link that occurs when the mother transfers passive immunity to the offspring. The mechanism of transfer varies among mammalian species. Cattle provide a readily available immune rich colostrum and milk in large quantities, making those secretions important potential sources of immune products that may benefit humans. Immune milk is a term used to describe a range of products of the bovine mammary gland that have been tested against several human diseases. The use of colostrum or milk as a source of <b>immunoglobulins,</b> whether intended for the neonate of the species producing the secretion or for a different species, can be viewed in the context of the types of <b>immunoglobulins</b> in the secretion, the mechanisms by which the <b>immunoglobulins</b> are secreted, and the mechanisms by which the neonate or adult consuming the milk then gains immunological benefit. The stability of <b>immunoglobulins</b> as they undergo processing in the milk, or undergo digestion in the intestine, is an additional consideration for evaluating the value of milk <b>immunoglobulins.</b> This review summarizes the fundamental knowledge of <b>immunoglobulins</b> found in colostrum, milk, and immune milk...|$|R
5|$|If {{the disease}} is {{associated}} with cancer, direct treatment of the cancer often relieves the symptoms of LEMS. Other treatments often used are steroids, azathioprine, which suppress the immune system, intravenous <b>immunoglobulin,</b> which outcompetes autoreactive antibody for Fc receptors, and pyridostigmine and 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhance the neuromuscular transmission. Occasionally, plasma exchange is required to remove the antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Some immune deficiencies, such as X-linked {{agammaglobulinemia}} and hypogammaglobulinemia, {{result in}} partial or {{complete lack of}} antibodies. These diseases are often treated by inducing a short term form of immunity called passive immunity. Passive immunity is achieved through the transfer of ready-made antibodies {{in the form of}} human or animal serum, pooled <b>immunoglobulin</b> or monoclonal antibodies, into the affected individual.|$|E
5|$|The biliary tree is {{normally}} relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi {{acts as a}} mechanical barrier. The biliary system normally has low pressure (8 to 12 cmH2O) and allows bile to flow freely through. The continuous forward flow of the bile in the duct flushes bacteria, if present, into the duodenum, and does not allow {{the establishment of an}} infection. The constitution of bilebile salts and <b>immunoglobulin</b> secreted by the epithelium of the bile duct also has a protective role.|$|E
40|$|The {{isolation}} of guinea-pig <b>immunoglobulins</b> γ 1 G, γ 2 G and γM are described and methods for separating the polypeptide chains of each examined.

5000|$|The {{first step}} is {{identical}} for both techniques. It consists in depositing the <b>immunoglobulins</b> contained in the serum or urine on a gel and then separating the <b>immunoglobulins</b> according to their electrophoretic mobility by making them migrate under the effect of an electric field. This migration depends on the mass and charge of the antigen. Once the <b>immunoglobulins</b> are separated, we can {{move to the next}} step.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To study re-association {{pattern of}} human placental eluate <b>immunoglobulins</b> with acid treated isologous and third party {{trophoblast}} derived placental microvesicles. Design: Laboratory based experimentation. Setting: Biological Sciences Department and Discipline for Reproductive Medicine University of Newcastle, Australia and the Department of Biochemistry, University of Nairobi, Kenya. Results: Placental eluate <b>immunoglobulins</b> re-associated with isologous and third party acidified microvesicles in three distinct patterns. I: eluate <b>immunoglobulins</b> re-associated more strongly with isologous and third party acid treated placental microvesicles, II: eluate <b>immunoglobulins</b> re-associated strongly with isologous but weakly with third party acid treated placental microvesicles, III: eluate <b>immunoglobulins</b> {{did not show}} preferential re-association with isologous and third party acid treated placental microvesicles. Conclusion: Two types of antigenic epitopes I and II may be expressed on the human placentae. Type I antigens may be present on all human placentae while type II epitopes may be paternally derived hence unique to each pregnancy. Also, <b>immunoglobulins</b> produced to placental microvesicle antigens may be directed to some but not all antigenic epitopes expressed on the human placental trophoblast...|$|R
5|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{progressive}} multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients {{do not respond}} to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous <b>immunoglobulin,</b> cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Class {{switching}} {{occurs in}} the heavy chain gene locus by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, found in DNA upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity {{of a series of}} enzymes at two selected S-regions. The variable domain exon is rejoined through a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε). This process results in an <b>immunoglobulin</b> gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.|$|E
5|$|Each {{heavy chain}} has two regions, the {{constant}} {{region and the}} variable region. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four <b>immunoglobulin</b> domains. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but {{is the same for}} all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{intestinal}} lymphangiectasia (PIL) is rare disorder {{characterized by}} congenital malformation or obstruction of intestinal lymphatic drainage; it {{is responsible for}} protein losing enteropathy leading to lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia and hypogammaglobulinemia.

The administration of intravenous <b>immunoglobulins</b> does not always lead to satisfactory plasma levels and therefore the replacement therapy with <b>immunoglobulins</b> is controversial. We describe here the case of a patient with PIL and severe hypogammaglobulinemia treated with <b>immunoglobulins.</b> The striking aspect of this case is the clinical and serological benefit obtained with the subcutaneous compared to the intravenous <b>immunoglobulins</b> administration...|$|R
5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody <b>immunoglobulin</b> A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting {{over a long period of}} time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of <b>immunoglobulin</b> A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules.

Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|In mammals {{there are}} two types of <b>immunoglobulin</b> light chain, which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ). A light chain has two {{successive}} domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in other vertebrates like sharks (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Teleostei).|$|E
