Numerical results reveal that in general, there are four branches of IO phonon modes in the systems. The dispersions of the four branches of IO phonon modes are obvious only when the free wavenumber kt in xy plane is small. The degenerating behavior of all the four branches of IO phonon modes <b>in</b> the asymmetric <b>wurtzite</b> QWs has been clearly observed for small kt.

40|$|Based on the {{macroscopic}} dielectric continuum model, the interface-optical-propagating (IO-PR) mixing phonon {{modes of}} a quasi-zero-dimensional (Q 0 D) wurtzite cylindrical quantum dot (QD) structure are derived and studied. The analytical phonon states of IO-PR mixing modes are given. It is {{found that there}} are two types of IO-PR mixing phonon modes, i. e. ρ-IO/z-PR mixing modes and the z-IO/ρ-PR mixing modes existing in Q 0 D wurtzite QDs. Each IO-PR mixing mode also has symmetrical and antisymmetrical forms. Via a standard procedure of field quantization, the Fröhlich Hamiltonians of electron-(IO-PR) mixing phonons interaction are obtained. The orthogonal relations of polarization eigenvectors for these IO-PR mixing modes are also displayed. Numerical calculations for a wurtzite GaN cylindrical QD are focused on the quantum size effect on the dispersive properties of IO-PR mixing modes. The results reveal that both the radial-direction size and the axial-direction size have great effect on the dispersive frequencies of the IO-PR mixing phonon modes. The limiting features of dispersive curves of these phonon modes are discussed in depth. The phonon modes "reducing" the behavior of wurtzite quantum confined structures have been explicitly observed in the systems.
