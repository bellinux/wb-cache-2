50|$|In the 20th century, harmony {{explicitly}} {{built on}} <b>fourths</b> <b>and</b> fifths became important. This {{became known as}} quartal harmony for chords based on <b>fourths</b> <b>and</b> quintal harmony for chords based on fifths.In the music of composers of early 20th century France, fourth chords became consolidated with Ninth chords, the Whole tone scale, the Pentatonic scale, and polytonality {{as part of their}} language, and quartal harmony became an important means of expression in music by Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and others. Examples are found in Debussy's orchestral work La Mer (The Sea) and in his piano works, in particular La cathédrale engloutie (The Sunken Cathedral) from his Préludes for piano, Pour les quartes (For <b>Fourths)</b> <b>and</b> Pour les arpéges composées (For Composite Arpeggios) from his Etudes.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the morphological characteristics and lodging-related traits and comparison of improved cultivars of rice plant resistance to lodging, a field experiment {{was carried out in}} randomized complete block design with three replications in 2012 at the Rice Research Institute of Iran) Rasht(. Rice cultivars were Kadus, Khazar, Gohar, Dorfak, Sepidrood and Deylam and local rice cultivar (Hashemi; susceptible to lodging as a control). Plant height, stem length, internode length for the first, second, third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes, diameter, thickness and cross- section area of third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes, ratio of fresh weight and dry weight of third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes to internode length, breaking resistance, bending moment and lodging resistance of third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes <b>and</b> pushing resistance were examined. Khazar cultivar with greater thickness of third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes (4. 11 and 4. 26 mm), diameter of third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes (8. 33 and 9. 46 mm), cross- section area of the third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes (40. 96 and 52. 32 mm 2) and ratio of fresh weight of third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes to internode length (301. 48 and 444. 15 mg. cm- 1) and ratio of dry weight of third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes to internode length (49. 46 and 50. 38 mg. cm- 1), breaking resistance of the third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes (14. 43 and 20. 87 N, respectively) was found to be the most resistant cultivar. Khazar cultivar with a plant height of 121 cm was found to be the tallest among all studied cultivars. Considering the strong correlation found between thickness, stem diameter, cross- section area of third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes <b>and</b> ratio of fresh weight and dry weight of third <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes to internode length with breaking resistance and pushing resistance, it seems that these traits could be considered as indirect indices in selection for higher resistance of rice cultivars to lodging...|$|R
