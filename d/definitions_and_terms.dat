40|$|Background. Understanding {{the patient}} safety {{literature}} has been compromised by the inconsistent use of language. Objectives. To identify key concepts of {{relevance to the}} International Patient Safety Classification (ICPS) proposed by the World Alliance For Patient Safety of the World Health Organization (WHO), <b>and</b> agree on <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> preferred <b>terms.</b> Methods. Six principles were agreed upon—that the concepts <b>and</b> <b>terms</b> should: be applicable across {{the full spectrum of}} healthcare; be consistent with concepts from other WHO Classifications; have meanings {{as close as possible to}} those in colloquial use; convey the appropriate meanings with respect to patient safety; be brief and clear, without unnecessary or redundant qualifiers; be fit-for-purpose for the ICPS. Results. <b>Definitions</b> <b>and</b> preferred <b>terms</b> were agreed for 48 concepts of relevance to the ICPS; these were described and the relationships between them and the ICPS were outlined. Conclusions. The consistent use of key concepts, <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> preferred <b>terms</b> should pave the way for better understand-ing, for comparisons between facilities and jurisdictions, and for trends to be tracked over time. Changes and improvements, translation into other languages and alignment with other sets of patient safety definitions will be necessary.
