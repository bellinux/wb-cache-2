40|$|Abstract. The {{standard}} {{prediction process}} of SVM requires acquisition {{of all the}} feature values for every instance. In practice, however, a cost {{is associated with the}} mere act of acquisition of a feature, e. g. CPU time needed to compute the feature out of raw data, the dollar amount spent <b>for</b> gleaning <b>more</b> <b>information,</b> <b>or</b> the patient wellness sacrificed by an invasive medical test, etc. In such applications, a budget constrains the classification process from using all of the features. We present, Ace-Cost, a novel classification method that reduces the expected test cost of SVM without compromising from the classification accuracy. Our al-gorithm uses a cost efficient decision tree to partition the feature space for obtaining coarse decision boundaries, and local SVM classifiers at the leaves of the tree to refine them. The resulting classifiers are also ef-fective in scenarios where several features share overlapping acquisition procedures, hence the cost of acquiring them as a group is less than the sum of the individual acquisition costs. Our experiments on the standard UCI datasets, a network flow detection application, as well as on syn-thetic datasets show that, the proposed approach achieves classification accuracy of SVM while reducing the test cost by 40 %- 80 %...|$|R
40|$|Influence of pulsed {{electric}} field (PEF) simultaneous to pressure treatment on moisture expression from fine-cut cellular raw material has been investigated. Dependencies of specific conductivity σ, liquid yield Y, {{instantaneous flow rate}} v and qualitative juice characteristics at different modes of PEF treatment are discussed. Three main consolidation phases were observed {{in a case of}} mechanical expression. A unified approach is proposed for liquid yield data analysis allowing to reduce the data scattering caused by differences in the quality of samples. Simultaneous application of pressure and PEF treatment allows to reveal a passive form of electrical damage. Pressure provokes the damage of defected cells, enhances diffusion migration of moisture in porous cellular material and depresses the cell resealing processes. PEF application at a moment when a sample specific electrical conductivity reaches minimum and pressure achieves its constant value seemed to be the most optimal.
