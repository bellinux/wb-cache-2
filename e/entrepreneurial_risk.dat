In the presence of market frictions, better protection makes investors more {{willing to take on}} <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>risk</b> when lending to firms, thereby improving the degree of risk sharing between financiers and entrepreneurs. On the other hand, by increasing risk sharing, investor protection also induces more firms to undertake risky projects.

40|$|Abstract: Risk {{management}} {{is a central}} function of banks. Our model examines how banks use this ability to shift risk away from entrepreneurs. To create incentive compatibility, banks must assume some of the <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>risks,</b> e. g. by underwriting OTC hedging contracts or granting loans. The arising bankruptcy risk causes potential contagion. A conflict of interest emerges because banks prefer a diversified customer portfolio, whereas customers attach more importance to getting adequate contracts from the bank. We show that this conflict cannot be overcome by contractual arrangements between customer and bank. Therefore, banking regulation is desirable to reduce welfare losses. We identify three fundamental instruments for regulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{owners of}} small noncorporate {{businesses}} face substantial and largely uninsurable <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>risk.</b> They are {{also an important}} group of stock owners. This paper explores the role of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>risk</b> in explaining time variation in expected U. S. stock returns in the period 1952 – 2010. It proposes an entrepreneurial distress factor {{that is based on}} a cointegrating relationship between aggregate consumption and income from proprietary and nonproprietary wealth. This factor, referred to here as the cpy residual, signals when entrepreneurial income is low in relation to aggregate consumption and other forms of income in the economy. It is highly correlated with cross-sectional measures of idiosyncratic entrepreneurial and default risk, and it has considerable forecasting power for the expected equity premium. However, the correlation between cpy and the stock market started to decline {{at the beginning of the}} 1980 s. The decline in this correlation can be associated with increased stock market participation and with the progress of U. S. state-level bank deregulation. This pattern is consistent with the view that <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>risk</b> became more easily diversifiable in the wake of U. S. state-level bank deregulation...|$|E
