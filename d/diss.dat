The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. <b>Diss</b> Debar of Doddridge County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by <b>Diss</b> Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state's coat of arms. Despite {{the adoption}} of an official seal, the state did not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.|$|E

5|$|However, 70000 {{had been}} {{purchased}} privately from British Railways by the Britannia Locomotive Group, therefore {{ensuring that the}} doyen of the class was to survive into the preservation era. Subsequently, utilised on mainline railtours, the locomotive was out of use in the late 1990s, requiring work {{to bring it back}} to steam; it was eventually sold to Pete Waterman and stored at Crewe. After a spell in storage on the Bressingham Steam Museum in <b>Diss,</b> Norfolk, 70013 was moved to the Great Central Railway (preserved), following an ownership dispute between Bressingham and the National Railway Museum. The locomotive returned to steam in May 2008 on the Great Central Railway after the readers of Steam Railway magazine contributed towards its overhaul. In July 2008 it appeared in WCRC's Open Weekend at Steamtown, Carnforth. August saw the locomotive return to the main line. Its first turn was the 1T57 'Fifteen Guinea Special' re-run from Manchester to Carlisle, 40 years after it performed the same duty in 1968. As a result, both preserved members of the class have operated on the mainline in preservation.|$|E
