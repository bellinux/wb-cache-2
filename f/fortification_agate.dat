25|$|A common subtype of the <b>fortification</b> <b>agate</b> is the {{parallel}}-banded, onyx-fortification or water-level agate. Perfectly straight, parallel bands occur {{over all}} or part of these stones. The straight bands were produced by puddles of quartz-rich solutions that crystallized inside the gas pocket under very low fluid pressure. The parallel nature of the bands also indicates the agate's position inside the lava flow.|$|E

Each band, when traced around an exposed pattern or [...] "face," [...] connects with itself like the walls of a fort, hence the name <b>fortification</b> <b>agate.</b>|$|E

3000|$|Two <b>fortification</b> <b>agate</b> samples {{selected}} for elemental mapping {{are characterized by}} the colorful and bluish banding layers, respectively. The colorful agate sample consists mainly of two growth zones varying in color from pale orange-red brown to gray tones, whereas the blue agate sample simply shows alternating blue and white bands.
