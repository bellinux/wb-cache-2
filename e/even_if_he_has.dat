5|$|Though Murali {{does his}} best to cure Venu, Seetha is worried that Murali might take revenge on her by not {{providing}} proper treatment to Venu, who in the meantime, learms of Murali and Seetha's love. Venu requests Murali to marry Seetha in case the operation is unsuccessful as he does not wish for his wife to become a widow. Seetha becomes infuriated when she discovers Venu's request and tells Murali that if Venu dies, she would die as well. Murali promises Seetha that he will save Venu <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to risk his own life on the line.|$|E
25|$|A {{substitute}} can act for {{the injured}} or ill {{player in the}} field, although he may not bowl, bat or as captain, unless otherwise agreed by the captains. A player may bat, bowl and field <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had a substitute {{for part of the}} game, though they need to wait for a period equal to their time off the field until they bat or bow again.|$|E
25|$|The most {{defining}} {{property of}} modernity, according to Giddens, {{is that we}} are disembedded from time and space. In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now imagine what other spaces look like, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> never been there. In this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the field of knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Superman-Prime, {{surviving}} The Sinestro Corps War and now {{appearing as}} an adult wearing a black and silver variation of Superman's costume (like the one Superman himself wore when he was resurrected), continues his travels throughout the Multiverse {{in order to find}} the perfect universe. Superman-Prime attacks the Lex Luthor of Earth-15, while searching for his perfect universe, which he believes is owed to him. He brings Lex to that Earth's Fortress of Solitude, and kills that world's Superman (Zod) and his pregnant wife and then flies through the Justice League Satellite, killing Luthor and the Justice League members inside the satellite. Expressing his disgust over the League lacking the roster he desires, he returns to Earth and kills the Earth-15 Wonder Woman (Donna) and Batman (Jason). Realizing this is not the perfect Earth he is looking for, Superman-Prime dives through the planet and destroys it. He vows to find his perfect universe <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to tear apart the entire Multiverse to do so. Building a secret lair in the Source Wall itself, Superman-Prime captures Mister Mxyzptlk and Annataz Arataz, an evil analogue of Zatanna, and forces them to give him their magic powers as a replacement for the energies he temporarily absorbed from a Guardian. After her torture at Superman-Prime's hands, Annataz experiences a change of heart and, as a way to atone for her past, taunts Superman-Prime until he lets Mxyzptlk escape, facing his tantrums alone. Superman-Prime destroys his base, burns Annataz alive, and flees. Mxyzptlk orders Gsptlsnz, his girlfriend, to seal off the Fifth Dimension. Superman-Prime later travels to the Multiversal nexus where he finds Solomon and demands his aid. Forerunner arrives as Superman-Prime threatens to kill Solomon unless he shows him his perfect universe; Solomon then shows Superman-Prime the war transpiring on Earth-51. Superman-Prime then flies down to Earth-51 and smashes into Monarch's command center. After fighting for a while, Monarch mocks Superman-Prime as a child, causing Superman-Prime to tear a hole in Monarch's containment suit, which sets of a chain reaction that destroys Earth-51 and the surrounding universe. Nix Uotan, the Monitor of Earth-51 and sole survivor of the cataclysm, cries as he finds a sapling emerging from scorched ground.|$|E
500|$|More {{directly}} to the point, {{there has been no}} [...] "sale or other disposition" [...] of the stock. The taxpayer still owns the same asset (i.e., the same interest in the corporation) he owned prior to the stock dividend. So, even if his basis amount (generally, the amount he originally paid for the stock) is less than the $400 value (i.e., <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> an unrealized or potential gain), he still has not yet [...] "realized" [...] the gain. The Court ruled that this kind of stock dividend is not treated as [...] "income" [...] to a shareholder.|$|E
500|$|Goff {{looked at}} the {{relationship}} between nuisance and Rylands v Fletcher, particularly how they treat strict liability. In nuisance, liability is strict in that the defendant can be liable <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> taken reasonable care, but this is kept [...] "under control" [...] by the principle that a defendant is not liable for actions a reasonable user takes on his land. He took into consideration an article published by F.H. Newark in 1949, in which Newark called the decision in Rylands [...] "a simple case of nuisance" [...] rather than a revolutionary doctrine that established strict liability outside nuisance. Goff also found similarities between the principle of [...] "non-natural use" [...] under Rylands {{and that of the}} [...] "reasonable user" [...] requirement in nuisance, concluding that [...] "t would lead to a more coherent body of common law principles if the rule [...] were to be regarded essentially {{as an extension of the}} law of nuisance".|$|E

500|$|The {{first public}} {{recognition}} of Feynman's work came in 1954, when Lewis Strauss, {{the chairman of}} the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) notified him that he had won the Albert Einstein Award, which was worth $15,000 and came with a gold medal. Because of Strauss' actions in stripping Oppenheimer of his security clearance, Feynman was reluctant to accept the award, but Isidor Isaac Rabi cautioned him: [...] "You should never turn a man's generosity as a sword against him. Any virtue that a man has, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> many vices, should not be used as a tool against him." [...] It was followed by the [...] AEC's Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1962. Schwinger, Tomonaga and Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics [...] "for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles". He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1965, received the Oersted Medal in 1972, and the National Medal of Science in 1979. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences, but ultimately resigned and is no longer listed by them.|$|E
2500|$|A mysterious vampire called Dracula {{appears in}} the Brazilian telenovela [...] (2008-2009). In fact, he is a mutant vampire created by mixing his DNA with vampire bat DNA. Unlike in the novel, this Dracula is neither invincible nor undead, but he does possess superhuman {{strength}} {{and the ability to}} fly, and he also transforms some female characters into his vampire brides. His lieutenant is a ghoulish vampire called Bram, in homage to the original author. His nemesis is psychokinetic (and psychotic as well) vampire hunter Christiano Pena, who is bent on destroying Dracula, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to kill innocents to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Acting through {{administrative}} method (Fa), {{the ruler}} conceals his intentions, likes and dislikes, skills and opinions. Not acting himself, he can avoid being manipulated. The ruler plays no {{active role in}} governmental functions. He should not use his talent <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> it. Not using his own skills, he is better able to secure the services of capable functionaries. Creel argues that not getting involved in details allowed Shen's ruler to [...] "truly rule", because it leaves him free to supervise the government without interfering, maintaining his perspective. Seeing and hearing independently, the ruler is able to make decisions independently, and is, Shen says, able to rule the world thereby.|$|E

2500|$|In the 190s, the warlord Yuan Shu {{controlled}} the lands around the Huai River in Yang Province. He {{had heard of}} Zhang Cheng's elder brother, Zhang Fan, and wanted to recruit him as an adviser. However, Zhang Fan claimed that he was ill and sent Zhang Cheng to meet Yuan Shu instead. Yuan Shu asked Zhang Cheng, [...] "In the past, when the kings of the Zhou dynasty were weak, warlords such as Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin rose up and became the dominant powers; when the Qin dynasty was collapsing, the Han dynasty rose up and replaced it. Now, as I rule over many territories and its people, I hope to enjoy the same glory as Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin did, and {{follow in the footsteps}} of Emperor Gaozu of Han. What do you think?" [...] Zhang Cheng replied, [...] "It depends on virtue rather than power. If a man can embody everyone's hopes for a benevolent and virtuous ruler, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> nothing to his name, it won't be hard for him to achieve what you described. However, if a man doesn't know his place and decides to do something against the people's will, everyone will abandon him instead of helping him." [...] Yuan Shu was displeased by what Zhang Cheng said.|$|E
