2500|$|A {{descender}} or rappel {{device is}} a <b>friction</b> <b>device</b> or friction hitch that allows rope to be payed {{out in a}} controlled fashion, under load, with a minimal effort by the person controlling it. The speed at which the abseiler descends is controlled by applying greater or lesser force on the rope below the device or altering the angle at which the rope exits the device. Descenders can be task-designed or improvised from other equipment. Mechanical descenders include braking bars, the figure eight, the abseil rack, the [...] "bobbin" [...] (and its self-locking variant the [...] "stop"), the gold tail, and the [...] "sky genie" [...] used by some window-washers and wildfire firefighters. Some improvised descenders include the Munter hitch, a carabiner wrap, the basic crossed-carabiner brake and the piton bar brake (sometimes called the carabiner and piton). There is an older, more uncomfortable, method of wrapping the rope around one's body for friction instead of using a descender, as in the Dulfersitz or Geneva methods used by climbers in the 1960s.|$|E

50|$|The issue {{involves}} a <b>friction</b> <b>device</b> in the pedal {{designed to provide}} the proper “feel” by adding resistance and making the pedal steady and stable. This <b>friction</b> <b>device</b> includes a “shoe” that rubs against an adjoining surface during normal pedal operation. Due to the materials used, wear and environmental conditions, these surfaces may, over time, begin to stick and release instead of operating smoothly. In some cases, friction could increase {{to a point that}} the pedal is slow to return to the idle position or, in rare cases, the pedal sticks, leaving the throttle partially open.|$|E

50|$|According to Toyota, {{the tactile}} {{response}} <b>friction</b> <b>device</b> {{in the affected}} Toyota electronic accelerator pedals sometimes creates too much friction. This excess friction either slows the pedal return or completely stops it. In the worst case, once a pedal is pushed to a specific setting, it stays at the setting even if the driver removes their foot from the pedal. Early reports, inMarch 2007, involved the Tundra pickup truck, which used nylon 4/6 in the friction lever.|$|E

50|$|A pivot {{window is}} a window hung on one hinge on each of two {{opposite}} sides which allows the window to revolve when opened. The hinges may be mounted top and bottom (Vertically Pivoted) or at each jamb (Horizontally Pivoted). The window will usually open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and, once released, fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside. Modern pivot hinges incorporate a <b>friction</b> <b>device</b> to hold the window open against its own weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built in. In the UK, where this type of window is most common, they were extensively installed in high-rise social housing.|$|E

40|$|Joints between {{concrete}} and steel elements in constructions are typically designed to transfer static shear force and sometimes bending moment. To enhance a structure&# 039;s ability to suppress earthquake or wind-induced vibrations, this research attempts to incorporate <b>friction</b> <b>devices</b> to the joint. In this new design, a large diameter pin replaces bolts {{in the web}} which allows rotation of beam about its centroid. Two <b>friction</b> <b>devices</b> called Slotted Bolted Connection (SBC) are incorporated in the tension and compression flanges of the beam. The research begins with an experimental investigation of an individual SBC specimen. Force-displacement hysteresis is obtained under cyclic axial loads. Coefficient of friction is then obtained from a nonlinear finite element model which is calibrated against experimental results. The research continues with a full-scale experiment of steel beam-to-concrete column. Moment-rotation hysteresis is acquired, and stiffness, strength and equivalent damping ratio is then determined.

40|$|In {{the last}} 35 years, several {{researchers}} have proposed, developed and tested different <b>friction</b> <b>devices</b> for seismic control of structures. Their {{research has demonstrated}} that such devices are simple, economical, practical, durable and very effective. However, research on passive friction dampers, except for few instances, has not been given appropriate attention lately. This has caused some of the results of old studies to become out-of-date, lose their validity in the context of today's design philosophies or to fall short on the expectations of this century's structural engineering. An analytical study on the behavior of <b>friction</b> <b>devices</b> and the effect they have on the structures into which they are incorporated has been undertaken to address the new design trends, codes, evaluation criteria and needs of today's society. The present study consists of around 7, 000 structural analyses that are used to show the excellent seismic performance and economic advantages of Friction Damped Braced Frames. It serves, at the same time, to improve our understanding on their dynamic behavior.

40|$|Without seismic protection, {{precision}} equipments in high-technology factories can be {{fragile and}} vulnerable to earthquake attacks. In this study, a smart isolation system (SIS), {{which consists of}} sliding-type bearings and a variable <b>friction</b> <b>device,</b> is proposed and its performance for the seismic protection of precision equipment is investigated. Due to the static friction of the sliding bearings, motion of the SIS will not be activated nor amplified by a low-amplitude excitation, such as ambient vibration. When the SIS is activated by an earthquake, the slip force of the variable <b>friction</b> <b>device,</b> which provides a resistant and energy dissipating force to the system, can be regulated on-line by a controller. In order to suppress {{the response of the}} isolated equipment in a severe earthquake or a near-fault earthquake, SIS is able to effectively reduce the acceleration of equipment, {{and at the same time}} prevent a large isolator displacement that may damage the underlying piping system of the equipment. This is usually can not be achieved by a conventional passive isolation system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper investigates a {{new type}} of {{friction}} damper for improving the seismic performance of precast concrete frame structures. The friction damper is used externally at selected beam-to- column joints of the frame to dissipate energy during severe earthquakes. A simplified model describing the hysteretic behaviour of the <b>friction</b> <b>device</b> was developed and parametric analyses were carried out in order to establish the optimum value of the slip force of the device for the different precast structures. The effectiveness of the dissipative <b>friction</b> <b>device</b> was numerically assessed on different typologies of precast structures by performing nonlinear dynamic analyses. The results of the numerical investigations showed that the introduction of the devices caused an increase of the dissipative capacity of the buildings. The plastic deformation concentrated inside the device, protecting the columns from severe damage. A significant reduction of top displacements was observed and the formation of the plastic hinges at the column base was delayed with respect to the unprotected structures. A moderate increase of the base shear was observed for the buildings protected by friction devices...|$|E

In this paper we describe an experiment in which we explore cursor movements with an amplitude of 250 pixels, in eight different directions and with three different control devices (a mechanical mouse, an optical mouse, and an oplical trackball). The aim of this exploration was to find characteristics of the cursor path {{that could be used}} to creale a prediction algorithm. The focus was on the mean curvature and variability of the paths. It can be concluded that, on average, cursor paths are rather straight in all eight directions and with all three devices. The variability of the paths depends on three factors: (1) direction (the variability is higher in oblique directions than in horizontal and vertical directions); (2) friction of the control device (the variability is higher when a low <b>friction</b> <b>device</b> is used than when a higher <b>friction</b> <b>device</b> is used - the optical trackball having a lower friction than the two mice); and (3) the user.
