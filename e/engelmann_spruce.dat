5|$|Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, {{which consists}} mainly of dense forest, comprises 53percent of Banff's area. 27percent {{of the park}} is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at , with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce</b> are {{more common in the}} subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus olivaceoalbus creates mycorrhizae with conifers. In the West Coast of the United States, {{associations}} are most common with Sitka spruces and giant redwoods. In the Rocky Mountains it associates with <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce</b> and blue spruce, and in northeast North America with hemlocks. It usually favours acidic and chalky ground with mosses in higher altitudes {{as well as}} conifer forests and occasionally mixed forests. The fruit bodies are often found singly, but may also grow in clusters.|$|E
5|$|The alpine biome of {{the pass}} extends below it {{on either side}} to an {{elevation}} of approximately , or about the altitude of the Linkins Lake trailhead on the western side, Highway 82's uppermost crossing of the Roaring Fork. Below it is a subalpine zone where lodgepole pine, <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> subalpine fir and aspen dominate the forest. A few patches of those trees persist above that elevation, but they are mostly stunted krummholz.|$|E
50|$|Chrysomyxa ledi de Bary is a fungus. It {{occurs in}} Eurasia {{throughout}} {{the range of}} its broad-leaved hosts. The aecial stage is found on native and exotic spruces in Europe, including white and <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruces</b> (Crane 2001).|$|R
50|$|Picea engelmannii subsp. mexicana (Mexican spruce). Two {{isolated}} populations on high {{mountains in}} northern Mexico, on the Sierra del Carmen in Coahuila (Sierra Madre Oriental) and on Cerro Mohinora in Chihuahua (Sierra Madre Occidental). <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruces</b> of the Madrean sky islands {{mountains in the}} extreme southeast of Arizona and southwest of New Mexico also probably belong to this subspecies, though this is disputed.|$|R
50|$|As {{the route}} climbs onto the Markagunt Plateau at an {{elevation}} of nearly 10000 ft, it enters the town of Brian Head, Utah's highest incorporated city {{and the home of}} Utah's highest ski resort, Brian Head Ski Resort. From the top of this plateau, vistas open up allowing for views of over 100 mi in every direction. The area is populated with <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruces,</b> aspens, and alpine meadows full of wildflowers. SR-143 continues climbing southward, passing the northern edge of Cedar Breaks National Monument, a natural amphitheater canyon eroded out of {{the western edge of the}} plateau similarly to Bryce Canyon. Here, the route reaches its highest point at 10626 ft above sea level, the second-highest paved road in Utah behind the Mirror Lake Highway at 10715 ft. The route turns to the east here, while continuing south leads to the rest of Cedar Breaks National Monument and State Route 148 (the Cedar Breaks Scenic Byway).|$|R
5|$|Yellowstone {{forests are}} {{dominated}} by the lodgepole pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100years as a forest matures. In Yellowstone, a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce</b> and subalpine fir become established. The lodgepole pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980s much of the lodgepole pine forests in Yellowstone were between 200 and 250years old and approaching {{the end of their}} lifecycle.|$|E
5|$|Banff National Park has a subarctic climate {{with three}} ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests {{are dominated by}} Lodgepole pine at lower elevations and <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce</b> in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but {{only a limited number}} of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{elevation}} forests contain whitebark pine, <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> subalpine fir, and limber pine, including the largest individual whitebark pine in North America. Based on tree ring chronologies, {{some of the}} whitebark pines {{are believed to be}} 700 to 1000 or more years old. The {{highest elevation}} forests typically have understories of grasses and forbs that are resistant to freezing at any point of the growing season. Willows, alders, cottonwoods, and sedges are found in riparian areas. Ponderosa pine occupy the dry, lower elevations near {{the western edge of the}} forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. In the slightly moister ponderosa pine forests grasses such as pinegrass are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.|$|E
50|$|Hybrid <b>Engelmann</b> × white <b>spruce</b> is {{secondary}} to Douglas-fir, and occurs mainly in wetter subzones and at higher elevations transitional to the Montane Spruce, Sub-Boreal <b>Spruce,</b> and <b>Engelmann</b> Spruce-Subalpine Fir Zones.|$|R
50|$|In the Prairie Provinces, the spruce cone maggot (Delia anthracina Czerny), which Rose and Lindquist {{designated}} as Hylemya anthracina (Czerny), attacks cones of white, <b>Engelmann,</b> and black <b>spruces,</b> {{and in some}} years may destroy the entire seed crop. The spruce cone-axis midge (Dasineura rachiphaga) and cone maggots (Pegohylemia) were also found to be damaging white spruce cones and seed near Fairbanks.|$|R

5|$|As {{wildfire}} is {{a natural}} part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines —the most common tree species in the park— generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, <b>Engelmann</b> <b>Spruce,</b> Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.|$|E
5|$|Over 1,700 {{species of}} trees and other {{vascular}} plants are native to the park. Another 170 species {{are considered to be}} exotic species and are non-native. Of the eight conifer tree species documented, Lodgepole Pine forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. Other conifers, such as Subalpine Fir, <b>Engelmann</b> <b>Spruce,</b> Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Whitebark Pine, are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a fungus known as white pine blister rust; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. Quaking Aspen and willows are the most common species of deciduous trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce</b> (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E
40|$|This project uses {{long-term}} (20 yr) research installations {{established and}} {{maintained by the}} BC Ministry of Forests and Range and that extend across north-central British Columbia, Canada. Vegetation structure (% cover and height) was measured at regular intervals (1, 2, 3, 5, 10 and 20 yrs) after clearcut or slashburning disturbances. These measurements {{are being used to}} develop indicators of biodiversity (composition, richness and biomass) and define response curves for measuring ecological resilience of Sub-boreal <b>Spruce,</b> <b>Engelmann</b> Spruce-Subalpine Fir, and Interior Cedar Hemlock forest ecosystems. We hypothesize that the rate of recovery, as measured by the three biodiversity indicators, varies significantly among ecosystems and across environmental gradients. We also expect that site productivity and the historical fire regime are important in determining vegetation recovery rates after burns of varying severity. To test these hypotheses, we will use post-burn vegetation repeated measures and environmental data collected in the summers of 2007 / 08 to develop a structural equation model. Our model will be tested using plant community composition first by species and then according to plant functional types. This research will support BC’s Future Forest Ecosystems Initiative, which aims to protect and enhance the resilience of BC’s forests through an adaptive management strategy...|$|R
5|$|The {{range of}} {{altitude}} in Grand Teton National Park impacts {{the types of}} plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line {{to the base of}} the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce</b> are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
25|$|White spruce or <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce</b> {{and their}} hybrids occur in 12 of the 14 biogeoclimatic zones of British Columbia (Coates et al. 1994).|$|E
25|$|The two western {{varieties}} are distinguished by pubescent (downy) shoots, {{and may be}} related to extensive hybridisation and/or intergradation with the closely related <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce</b> found further south in the Rocky Mountains. White spruce also hybridises readily with the closely related Sitka spruce where they meet in southern Alaska; this hybrid is known as Picea × lutzii.|$|E
25|$|Biomes on {{the trails}} {{leading to the}} peak include alpine meadows, sub-alpine meadows, and taiga. Stunted and twisted Krummholtz trees, {{many of which are}} <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> are common at or just above the tree line. The wildflowers along its access trails include Indian Paintbrush, blue columbine, gentian, and harebell. The peak is located in a Special Botanical Area.|$|E
25|$|Land cover {{types in}} the Sawtooth Wilderness include pine and spruce-fir forests, meadows, and alpine tundra. Lodgepole pine forms nearly {{monotypic}} forests in lower elevations of the wilderness, while douglas fir and quaking aspen can also be found. Higher elevations contain whitebark pine, <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> subalpine fir, and limber pine. There are no known threatened or endangered plant species in the wilderness.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{communities}} {{range from}} low-elevation grasslands and ponderosa pine forest to alpine meadows. <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> mountain hemlock, subalpine fir and whitebark pine {{can be found}} in the higher elevations, with Douglas-fir, white fir, western larch, and lodgepole pine elsewhere. Wildflowers include clarkia, Indian paintbrush, sego lily, elephanthead, larkspur, shooting star, and bluebell. Rocky bluffs in the Hells Canyon area support prickly pear cactus and poison ivy.|$|E

25|$|The Winds {{are known}} to have a small grizzly bear population, {{primarily}} in the northernmost areas. Other mammals include the black bear, elk, moose, mule deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, and wolverine. Bald eagles, falcons and hawks {{are just a few of}} the 300 species of birds known to inhabit the region. The streams and lakes are home to Yellowstone cutthroat, rainbow, brook, brown, lake, and golden trout—about 2.5 million of which were stocked by a local explorer named Finis Mitchell and his wife during the Great Depression. The forests are dominated by lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, subalpine fir, and <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lower {{elevations}} of the Rocky Mountains {{and all but}} {{the highest}} elevations of the Cypress Hills have a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb). These areas have snowy but mild winters due to the warming effect of chinook winds, and cool summers due to their high elevation. As altitude increases and the subalpine zone is reached, this grades into a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc), with much harsher winters and even cooler summers. Above the tree line, an alpine/polar climate (Köppen climate classification ET) prevails. Conditions this high are even colder and very windy. Precipitation is higher in these elevated regions than elsewhere in Alberta, and this supports forests of lodgepole pine and trembling aspen mixed with fescue grasslands in the montane areas, <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce</b> and subalpine fir forests in the subalpine zone, and heather, sedges and mountain avens in the alpine zone above the tree lines.|$|E
500|$|Lodgepole pine dominates in cold, dry {{areas from}} [...] to [...] The {{understory}} in lodgepole pine forests can be sparse but includes grasses, forbs, huckleberries, and grouse whortleberry, although fires in these forests are typically lethal to trees and understories alike.

500|$|At middle elevations, the subalpine zone appears. [...] This forest has <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> {{mountain}} hemlock, and subalpine fir. [...] The understory {{is thick}} here with rhododendron and berry species, {{as well as}} deep beds of moss and lichens. At higher elevations, this forest opens up to meadows and slide chutes, which are covered in a lush growth of grasses, herbaceous shrubs, and alpine wildflowers. [...] Parks botanists and others have identified 546 species of flowering plants in the park. Late July to mid-September see an impressive display of alpine blooms.|$|E
500|$|More than 400 native {{plant species}} {{live in the}} park. There are three life zones in the park based on elevation: [...] The lowest areas of the park are {{dominated}} by dwarf forests of pinyon pine and juniper with manzanita, serviceberry, and antelope bitterbrush in between. aspen, cottonwood, water birch, and willow grow along streams. Ponderosa pine forests cover the mid-elevations with blue spruce and Douglas fir in water-rich areas and manzanita and bitterbrush as underbrush. Douglas fir and white fir, along with aspen and <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> make up the forests on the Paunsaugunt Plateau. The harshest areas have limber pine and ancient Great Basin bristlecone pine, some more than 1,600years old, holding on.|$|E
500|$|An {{estimated}} 76 {{percent of}} Boise National Forest is forest, {{which according to}} the Forest Service is considered land capable of supporting trees on at least 50 percent of its area. The forests are primarily coniferous evergreens, dominated by Douglas fir and ponderosa and lodgepole pines at lower elevations and <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> subalpine fir, and whitebark pine at higher elevations. Grand fir and western larch (a coniferous deciduous tree) grow {{in the northern part}} of the forest where there are moister conditions. Quaking aspen, a broadleaf deciduous tree, grows both in stands among conifers and in monotypic stands throughout the forest at elevations above [...] Non-forested areas occupy 23 percent of the forest, primarily on south-facing slopes, lower elevations in the forest's southern latitudes, or high-elevation areas and are dominated by grasses, forbs, or shrubs.|$|E
500|$|More than 1,600 {{species of}} plants grow in the Colorado River watershed, ranging from the {{creosote}} bush, saguaro cactus, and Joshua trees of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts to the forests of the Rocky Mountains and other uplands, composed mainly of ponderosa pine, subalpine fir, Douglas-fir and <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce.</b> Before logging in the 19thcentury, forests were abundant in high elevations {{as far south as}} the Mexico–U.S. border, and runoff from these areas nourished abundant grassland communities in river valleys. Some arid regions of the watershed, such as the upper Green River valley in Wyoming, Canyonlands National Park in Utah and the San Pedro River valley in Arizona and Sonora, supported extensive reaches of grassland roamed by large mammals such as buffalo and antelope as late as the 1860s. Near Tucson, Arizona, [...] "where now there is only powder-dry desert, the grass once reached as high as the head of a man on horse back".|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the ecology}} of the {{watershed}} has been affected by wildfires and forestry, and is considered to be in a seral phase. [...] The river travels through several different vegetation zones. [...] In its upper reaches, the Adams flows through the Interior Cedar Hemlock zone. [...] These forests are similar to the coastal forests of British Columbia and contain old-growth trees up to 1000 years in age. [...] Old-growth stands along the river also contain rare species of lichen, likely isolated by the last Ice Age. [...] The floodplain of the Upper Adams contains wetland species of deciduous trees such as black cottonwood as well as a dense layer of shrubs including black twinberry, red-osier dogwood, and thimbleberry. [...] The lower river is dominated by the drier Interior Douglas Fir vegetation zone. [...] Other conifer species present are Ponderosa pine, <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> and alpine fir. The area around the river mouth has been altered by human activities such as farming and livestock grazing.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} over 1,132 plant {{species have been}} {{identified}} parkwide. The predominantly coniferous forest is home to various species of trees such as the <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> Douglas fir, subalpine fir, limber pine and western larch, which is a deciduous conifer, producing cones but losing its needles each fall. Cottonwood and aspen are the more common deciduous trees and are found at lower elevations, usually along lakes and streams. The timberline {{on the eastern side}} of the park is almost [...] lower than on the western side of the Continental Divide, due to exposure to the colder winds and weather of the Great Plains. West of the Continental Divide, the forest receives more moisture and is more protected from the winter, resulting in a more densely populated forest with taller trees. Above the forested valleys and mountain slopes, alpine tundra conditions prevail, with grasses and small plants eking out an existence in a region that enjoys as little as three months without snow cover. Thirty species of plants are found only in the park and surrounding national forests. Beargrass, a tall flowering plant, is commonly found near moisture sources, and is relatively widespread during July and August. Wildflowers such as monkeyflower, glacier lily, fireweed, balsamroot and Indian paintbrush are also common.|$|E

Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from , which is more than , the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to [...] At higher elevations subalpine fir, <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.|$|E
2500|$|The subalpine fir {{forests in}} the North Cascades include Douglas fir, <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce,</b> subalpine larch, and whitebark pine. The <b>Engelmann</b> <b>spruce</b> and the subalpine fir are {{commonly}} found together. [...] In the higher boundaries of this ecoregion the subalpine fir takes on the krummholz form.
