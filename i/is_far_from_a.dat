Drawing parallels with Jovanović's earlier Orientalist works, which she says provide [...] "responses and commentaries", Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the triptych <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> simple vignette of everyday life. In describing it as a [...] "type of history painting", she argues that it was intended as more than a mere documentary piece. Jovanović's decision to use the triptych format would have been highly unusual otherwise.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics who {{called it a}} beautiful film and a complete entertainer, according to International Business Times India. Prabalika M. Borah of The Hindu praised the performances of the film's cast, {{the work of the}} technical crew, and Kumar's execution of the film's script in narrating a complex story without confusion. She summarised, [...] "The smile and laughter will not leave you while it still manage to moisten your eyes here and there". Sandhya Rao of Sify stated, [...] "Manam`s story is something new within Telugu films context, but the way the film showcases romance and emotion, it <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> regular fare.

[...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap said, [...] "Thor: The Dark World delivers the goods—action, otherworldly grandiosity, romance, humor—above and beyond its predecessor". Simon Abrams, writing for RogerEbert.com said, [...] "There's just enough tension and humor in Thor: The Dark World {{to make the}} film's otherwise listless proceedings worth watching, but only just." [...] Echoing other critics' sentiments, Frank Lovece of Film Journal International wrote, [...] "Is it wrong that the best relationship in Thor: The Dark World is between the titular Norse-god superhero and his adoptive brother Loki? To take nothing away from Oscar-winner Natalie Portman, ... it's the complicated love-hate between Thor and the trickster god Loki that you can't turn your eyes from." ...|$|E

Digital Spy editor Nick Levine gave the single a four out of five stars rating, writing that [...] "on first listen, it feels a bit too ordinary to be trailing such a potentially audacious long-player. However, after a few spins it becomes clear that this <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> flop". Sarah-Louise James from the UK Daily Star lauded the musical style of [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] but opined that it was overshadowed by the accompanying S music video.

He wrote, [...] "The Office <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> profound show when it just throws its characters in a room and observes their behavior, but there’s a certain charm to it." [...] McNutt noted that, despite feeling that the episode's description of [...] "Darryl teaches Nellie how to eat a taco" [...] was a poor move on NBC's part, he thought they [...] "could have spent more time with Nellie learning how to eat a taco." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote positively of the episode, noting, [...] "For the first time in forever this is an episode of The Office that actually has a lot going on.

[...] His focus on detail was justified, as [...] "The use of each trifling detail of structure <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> barren search to {{those who believe in}} natural selection." [...] The [...] "contrivances and beautiful adaptations" [...] slowly acquired through slight variations, subjected to natural selection [...] "under the complex and ever-varying conditions of life", far transcended the most fertile imagination. The mechanisms to transport the pollen of one flower or of one plant to another flower or plant underlined the importance of cross-fertilisation: [...] "For may we not further infer as probable, in accordance with the belief of {{the vast majority of the}} breeders of our domestic productions, that marriage between near relatives is likewise in some way injurious,—that some unknown great good is derived from the union of individuals which have been kept distinct for many generations?" ...|$|E

500|$|Despite viewing it {{imperfect}} and noting Songz had not {{mastered the}} balancing act [...] "between being a horny boy and ladies' man", Mark Edward Nero of About.com {{said it was}} the best album of Songz's career, commenting, [...] "Trey takes a big step toward establishing himself as an A-list singer." [...] Nero also commended consistent vocals as a plus, and complimented the eclecticity of the songs, saying no tracks are unlistenable. Tyler Lewis of PopMatters said that Songz continued his tradition of inconsistent albums, commenting that the album is best is when it departs from the R. Kelly template. Lewis recommended that the album needed to be trimmed down and included with some from his mixtape Anticipation for what could have been, [...] "the black pop record of the year." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave to the album a dud (...) rating, indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought. At the upper level it may merely be overrated, disappointing, or dull. Down below it may be contemptible". Ajitpaul Mangat of Tiny Mix Tapes called the album often [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "monotonous" [...] noting how Songz's work on freestyles and work ethic proves how the album could be better. Mangat did overall compliment the album, [...] "While Ready <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> perfect album, it seems Trey is learning how to inspirit his original works with the charm and inventiveness found in his freestyles and covers."

2500|$|The Tongan {{archipelago}} {{has been}} inhabited for perhaps 3000 years, since settlement in late Lapita times.

In the 19th century, {{with the arrival of}} Western traders and missionaries, Tongan culture changed dramatically. Some old beliefs and habits were thrown away and others adopted.

[...] However, he concluded that [...] "it's catchy, infectious, and overwhelmingly mellow." [...] Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music criticized his voice, writing: [...] "Adam Levine fires up that nasal yelp as soon as the song begins, and does not let up until the fadeout."

2500|$|Until recently, it {{was thought}} that no Greek Church Father had taken note of the passage before the 1100s. [...] However, in 1941 a large {{collection}} of the writings of Didymus the Blind (c. 313–398) was discovered in Egypt, in which Didymus states that [...] "We find in certain gospels" [...] an episode in which a woman was accused of a sin, and was about to be stoned, but Jesus intervened [...] "and said to those who were about to cast stones, ‘He who has not sinned, let him take a stone and throw it. [...] If anyone is conscious in himself not to have sinned, let him take a stone and smite her.’ [...] And no one dared," [...] and so forth. [...] This <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> direct quotation, but it may be a loose summary of the episode. [...] Barring the possibility that Didymus was referring to some other Gospel than the four-Gospel collection that was typically used in the churches in his time, this reference appears to establish that the passage was present in its usual place in some Greek manuscripts known in Alexandria and elsewhere from the 300s onwards.|$|E

However, they criticized Ruse for failing to acknowledge that {{it is a mistake to}} focus only on the origins of homosexuality. They also argued that Ruse, rather than try to evaluate various views of homosexuality, relied upon an implicit understanding of the subject. They criticized Ruse's discussion of social constructionism, writing that Ruse considered only the most extreme form and quickly dismissed it, and found Ruse to be guilty of inconsistency, noting that while Ruse at one stage suggested that there [...] "is no objective criterion for being gay" [...] he often disregarded that view. They found Ruse's discussion of bisexuality to be unsatisfactory and inaccurate. They also criticized Ruse's treatment of sociobiology, arguing that he failed to recognized the shortcomings of sociobiological theories, including their failure to explain bisexuality. They criticized the amount of space Ruse devoted to discussing psychoanalytic theories, arguing that their lack of empirical support meant that the attention was undeserved. Bloom and Stein concluded that Ruse's work <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> definitive discussion of its subject and is [...] "best viewed as a first attempt at addressing a range of deep and complex issues." ...|$|E
