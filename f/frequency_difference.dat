25|$|Perfect fifths may be justly tuned or tempered. Two notes whose {{frequencies}} {{differ by}} {{a ratio of}} 3:2 make the interval known as a justly tuned perfect fifth. Cascading twelve such fifths does {{not return to the}} original pitch class after going round the circle, so the 3:2 ratio may be slightly detuned, or tempered. Temperament allows perfect fifths to cycle, and allows pieces to be transposed, or played in any key on a piano or other fixed-pitch instrument without distorting their harmony. The primary tuning system used for Western (especially keyboard and fretted) instruments today, twelve-tone equal temperament, uses an irrational multiplier, 21/12, to calculate the <b>frequency</b> <b>difference</b> of a semitone. An equal-tempered fifth, at a frequency ratio of 27/12:1 (or about 1.498307077:1) is approximately two cents narrower than a justly tuned fifth at a ratio of 3:2.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectrum}} of the scattered photons is termed the Raman spectrum. It shows {{the intensity of the}} scattered light as a function of its <b>frequency</b> <b>difference</b> Δν to the incident photons. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks form a symmetric pattern around Δν=0. The frequency shifts are symmetric because they correspond to the energy difference between the same upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the lower state will be more populated than the upper state. Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the upper state (Stokes transitions) will be higher than in the opposite direction (anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks are stronger than anti-Stokes scattering peaks. Their ratio depends on the temperature, and can therefore be exploited to measure it.|$|E
40|$|The {{differences}} between observed solar p-mode frequencies and {{the frequencies of}} a reference model can be inverted to infer {{the structure of the}} Sun using a variety of linear inversion techniques. However, {{it is well known that}} the adiabatic description, which is often employed in frequency calculations, breaks down in the outermost layers of the Sun. This and other uncertainties in the treatment of the superficial layers introduce a slowly varying frequency-dependent function into the <b>frequency</b> <b>differences.</b> We present here a technique to pre-process the <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> prior to applying any of the standard inversion techniques in order to eliminate the frequencydependent component which arises from the near-surface uncertainties, suppressing also the corresponding contributions from the kernels relating <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> to differences in structure.

We examined primer extension analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry to screen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association by using DNA pools. We tested whether this method can accurately estimate allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> between pools while maintaining the high-throughput nature of assay design, sample handling, and scoring. We follow up interesting allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> in pools by genotyping individuals. We tested DNA pools of 182, 228, and 499 individuals using 16 SNPs with minor allele frequencies 0. 026 – 0. 486 and allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> 0. 001 – 0. 108 that we had genotyped previously on individuals and 381 SNPs that we had not. Precision, {{as measured by the}} average standard deviation among 16 semidependent replicates, was 0. 021 ± 0. 011 for the 16 SNPs and 0. 018 ± 0. 008 for the 291 / 381 SNPs used in further analysis. For the 16 SNPs, the average absolute error in predicting allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> between pools was 0. 009; the largest errors were 0. 031, 0. 028, and 0. 027. We determined that compensating for unequal peak heights in heterozygotes improved precision of allele frequency estimates but had only a very minor effect on accuracy of allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> between pools. Based on these data and assuming pools of 500 individuals, we conclude that at significance level 0. 05 we would have 95 % (82 %) power to detect population allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> of 0. 07 for control allele frequencies of 0. 10 (0. 50) ...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} found strikingly {{different}} allele frequencies between continents. This has been mainly interpreted as being due to local adaptation. However, demographic factors can generate similar patterns. Namely, allelic surfing during a population range expansion may increase the frequency of alleles in newly colonised areas. In this study, we examined 772 STRs, 210 diallelic indels, and 2834 SNPs typed in 53 human populations worldwide under the HGDP-CEPH Diversity Panel to determine to which extent allele frequency differs among four regions (Africa, Eurasia, East Asia, and America). We find that large allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> between continents are surprisingly common, and that Africa and America show {{the largest number of}} loci with extreme <b>frequency</b> <b>differences.</b> Moreover, more STR alleles have increased rather than decreased in frequency outside Africa, as expected under allelic surfing. Finally, there is no relationship between the extent of allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> and proximity to genes, as would be expected under selection. We therefore conclude that most of the observed large allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> between continents result from demography rather than from positive selection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Association {{studies are}} used to {{identify}} genetic determinants of complex human traits of medical interest. With {{the large number of}} validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) currently available, two limiting factors in association studies are genotyping capability and costs. Pooled DNA genotyping has been proposed as an efficient means of screening SNPs for allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> in case-control studies and for prioritising them for subsequent individual genotyping analysis. Here, we apply quantitative pooled genotyping followed by individual genotyping and replication to identify associations with human serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. The DNA from individuals with low and high HDL cholesterol levels was pooled separately, each pool was amplified by polymerase chain reaction in triplicate and each amplified product was separately hybridised to a high-density oligonucleotide array. Allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> between case and control groups with low and high HDL cholesterol levels were estimated for 7, 283 SNPs distributed across 71 candidate gene regions spanning a total of 17. 1 megabases. A novel method was developed to take advantage of independently derived haplotype map information to improve the pooled estimates of allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences.</b> A subset of SNPs with the largest estimated allele <b>frequency</b> <b>differences</b> between low and high HDL cholesterol groups was chosen for individual genotyping in the study population, as well as in a separate replication population. Four SNPs in a single haplotype block within the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene interval were significantly associated with HDL cholesterol levels in both populations. Our study is among the first to demonstrate the application of pooled genotyping followed by confirmation with individual genotyping to identify genetic determinants of a complex trait. </p...|$|R
