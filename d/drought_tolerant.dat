25|$|Since cotton is {{somewhat}} salt and <b>drought</b> <b>tolerant,</b> {{this makes it}} an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As water resources get tighter around the world, economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems. For example, improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan, where cotton is a major export. In {{the days of the}} Soviet Union, the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation, largely of cotton, and now salination is widespread.|$|E
25|$|It prefers heavy, gravelly {{soil with}} {{excellent}} drainage, {{in a sunny}} position. It is <b>drought</b> <b>tolerant,</b> and frost tolerant down to -7°C. Plants become straggly and untidy with age, so should be pruned when young. Propagation is by seed, as the hairy stems of this plant make it virtually impossible to strike stem cuttings, and heel cuttings have been met with limited success. Germination takes three to four weeks, and has an excellent success rate. Flowering usually begins at {{three to four years}} from seed.|$|E

2500|$|Kudzu {{is a very}} stress-tolerant plant. Kudzu is <b>drought</b> <b>tolerant</b> {{and only}} the above ground {{portions}} of the plant are damaged by frost. [...] Kudzu also forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonium {{which can be used}} by surrounding plants. [...] Now the dominant nitrogen-fixing plant in the eastern United States, kudzu fixes an estimated 235kg of nitrogen per hectare per year, which is an order of magnitude higher than the rates of native species. [...] This ability allows it to flourish in nitrogen-poor sites where other plants are unable to grow. [...] In the absence of other plants, nitrogen then builds up in the soil, allowing the maintenance of large leaf areas and high photosynthetic rates.|$|E
2500|$|Water stress (drought {{and salt}} stress) {{is one of}} the major {{environmental}} problems causing severe losses in agriculture and in nature. Drought tolerance of plants is mediated by several mechanisms that work together, including stabilizing and protecting the plant from damage caused by desiccation and also controlling how much water plants lose through the stomatal pores during drought. A plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), is produced in response to drought. A major type of ABA receptor has been identified. Future research is needed to test if these receptors can be used to engineer drought tolerance in plants. The plant hormone ABA causes the stomatal pores to close in response to drought, which reduces plant water loss via transpiration to the atmosphere and allows plants to avoid or slow down water loss during droughts. The use of <b>drought</b> <b>tolerant</b> crop plants would lead to a reduction in crop losses during droughts. [...] Since guard cells control water loss of plants, the investigation on how stomatal opening and closure are regulated could lead to the development of plants with improved avoidance or slowing of desiccation and better water use efficiency.|$|E

40|$|To evaluateresponse {{of bread}} wheat {{recombinant}} inbred lines to water deficit, a split plot experiment arranged in randomized complete block design (CRBD) was conducted using eight recombinant inbred lines and their parental cultivars (Roshan and Super Head) with three replications under three irrigation levels (80, 120 and 160 mm evaporation from class A pan) at the Agriculture Research Station of Islamic Azad University, Tabriz Branch during 2009. The results of {{analysis of variance}} data collected revealed significant difference among lines and irrigation levels for grain yield. While line × irrigation level interaction was non significant for grain yield. Based on SSI and TOL, drought tolerance indices lines number 1, 7, 41 and Roshan cultivar under 120 mm evaporation, and lines number 7 and 19 under 160 mm evaporation were the tolerant lines. Under both stress conditions according to STI, MP and GMP indices, lines number 37, 38 and Roshan cultivar were recognized as the tolerant lines to water deficiet. Cluster analyses based on grain yield and drought tolerance indices recognized the lines number 1, 30, 32, 37, 38, 41 and Roshan cultivar under 120 mm and lines number 30, 37 and 38 and Roshan under 160 mm evaporation as the most <b>drought</b> <b>tolerants</b> and higher producers...|$|R

2500|$|This drought was {{intensified}} by the exceptional heat that occurred all through it. Records were {{set for the}} heat {{as well as the}} lack of rain, resulting in very high evaporation rates. From 23 June, temperatures were over [...] for two consecutive weeks around the United Kingdom, peaking at [...] in June on the 28th at Mayflower Park in Southampton. This still is the highest ever June temperature since records began. The highest temperature in the summer was [...] at Cheltenham on 3 July. The effects of the drought included substantial and long-lasting changes to the tree composition of forests. European Beech was severely affected by the drought and took around twenty years to recover. To date, their growth has failed to recover completely, reaching only about 75% of their pre-drought growth rates, even decades after the drought. Additionally, death due to drought resulted in the loss of around 15% of the mature beech trees in the forest. In contrast, sessile oak did not suffer any death or growth suppression due to drought, but instead benefited from reduced competition with beech. Sessile oak growth increased suddenly after the drought and remained unusually high until the 1990s, when beech recovered and regained dominance. European Beech dominates temperate forests over large areas of Europe, but is considered to be particularly drought sensitive and is predicted to be outcompeted by more <b>drought</b> <b>tolerant</b> species in many regions as the climate warms.|$|E
