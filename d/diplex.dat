5000|$|The {{original}} 1640 expanded band station {{call sign}} was KXBT, {{put on the}} air by then KUIC Chief Engineer Alan McCarthy (now deceased). The original transmitter was a used Continental 316 Doherty layout converted by Contract Engineer Skipp May. The original antenna system was a <b>diplex</b> layout with sister station 1190, which was formerly KNBA Vallejo. The antenna system was designed by Rich Green and installed by Ralph Jones (and Skipp May). The problematic 316 transmitter was upgraded to a BE sometime circa 1996. Alan McCarty left [...] "Quick Broadcasting" [...] for a position at 1530 KFBK Sacramento. McCarthy died from a heart attack.|$|E
50|$|The station's {{transmitter}} {{was located}} in Chicago's Ashburn neighborhood, near the Evergreen Park, Illinois border, and operated as a <b>diplexed</b> operaration {{from one of the}} towers of its sister station, WGCI (now WGRB).

40|$|A double {{sideband}} receiver using a dual-polarization, dual-beam interferometer for LO <b>diplexing</b> is suggested as a suitable scheme {{for the high}} frequency ALMA bands.

50|$|Often an STA is {{necessary}} {{due to an}} unforeseen event. While one is no longer needed to replace a particular transmitter, it {{is necessary}} to replace a radio antenna with another one that has different characteristics. STAs are often issued for a particular mode of operation while a full application for a construction permit is pending. Station licensees must exhibit why the STA is necessary and serves the public good. For example, WANN-CD has a permit to use an omnidirectional antenna for digital TV, but received an STA to <b>diplex</b> into the same antenna used by analog WANN-LP, which has a slightly directional antenna. This obviously served the public good by getting the station on the air earlier (before the original full-power analog cutoff in June 2009), than waiting for the new antenna, even though coverage is somewhat less in some directions.|$|E

Add to that a comb generator with 4-6 CW tones, an HP Calan 1776 [...] "portable" [...] spectrum analyzer.. Not all amplifiers contained a good return path test point, so the repair lab was asked to modify some line extender <b>diplex</b> filters to pass the forward, and divert the return path to an F connector. A pad socket was also converted. Any signal entering an amplifier with an amplitude above -45 dBmV was located and fixed. CLI was reduced to under 5 uV/m. 2 years later, Milo Medin, CTO of @Home {{was reported to have}} said, [...] "Please show me the fiber receivers that are connected to the outside plant, these don't have enough noise, so they are certainly not connected or properly aligned." [...] Later, he was quoted as saying [...] "Cox San Diego return plant is so clean you could eat off it." [...] San Diego never had serious RF issues when it came to return path after 1995.|$|E
40|$|The RCAF has {{programmed}} a new antenna {{for their}} dual-channel radar, the AN/FPS- 508. Fitted to this antenna is a Vari-Polarizer which permits simultaneous operation of both channels of the radar, i. e., operation in a <b>diplex</b> mode. At {{the request of}} the RCAF, the National Research Council developed the <b>Diplex</b> Gating Unit which automatically selects the outputs of the receivers in the channel affected least in a jammed environment. These outputs are then fed to the AN/FST- 2 Data Transmission Equipment and the AJ Console. The construction and testing of the experimental and service test models are described in this report. A solution is given to the crosstalk problem that is likely to be encountered {{with the use of the}} Wide-Band Dicke Fix receivers when operating in the <b>diplex</b> mode.

50|$|<b>Diplexing</b> is used {{to prevent}} {{intermodulation}} and keep reflected power (VSWR) to a minimum for each input transmitter and frequency.

40|$|Frequency {{selective}} subreflectors (FSS) {{are often}} {{employed in the}} reflector antenna system of a communication satellite or a deep space exploration vehicle for multi-frequency operations. In the past, FSS's have been designed for diplexing two frequency bands. For example, the Voyager FSS was designed to <b>diplex</b> S and X bands and the TDRSS FSS was designed to <b>diplex</b> S and Ku bands. Recently, NASA's CASSINI project requires an FSS to multiplex four frequency (S/X/Ku/Ka) bands. Theoretical analysis and experimental verifications are presented for a multi-band flat pannel FSS with double-ring elements. Both the exact formulation and the thin-ring approximation are described for analyzing and designing this multi-ring patch element FSS. It is found that the thin-ring approximation fails to predict the electrically wide ring element FSS's performance. A single screen double-ring element FSS is demonstrated for the tri-band system that reflects the X-band signal while transmitting through the S- and Ku-band signals. In addition, a double screen FSS with non-similar double-ring elements is presented for the Cassini's four-band system which reflects the X- and Ka-band signals while passing the S- and Ku-band signals. To accurately predict the FSS effects on a dual reflector antenna's radiation pattern, the FSS subreflector's transmitted/reflected field variation as functions of the polarization and incident angles {{with respect to the}} local coordinates was taken into account. An FSS transmission/reflection coefficient table is computed for TE and TM polarizations at various incident angles based on the planar FSS model. Next, the hybrid Geometric Optics (GO) and Physical Optics (PO) technique is implemented with linearly interpolating the FSS table to efficiently determine the FSS effects in a dual reflector antenna...|$|E

Sample scan patterns are presented for the centerminous U. S. The signals will be broadcast from a multibeam offset Cassegrain reflector antenna to obtain a low sidelobe, wide angle scan.

50|$|The {{conversion}} to digital broadcasting means broadcast engineers {{must now be}} well-versed in digital television and digital radio, in addition to analogue principles. New equipment from the transmitter to the radio antenna to the receiver may be encountered by engineers new to the field.

50|$|A 2m signal {{goes to a}} relay {{and then}} the signals are <b>diplexed,</b> with 2m and < going to a lo-pass filter. The signal gets <b>diplexed</b> again using a hi-pass filter, {{separating}} out the 2 m signal from the HF-6 meter signal path. The rx signal passes through the VHF directional coupler/power detector (not used in rx) to a lo-pass filter and then passes by 2 PIN diodes (both HSU277). These diodes and related components form T/R isolation switches that operate {{similar to that of}} the 70 cm front end. Rx signal passes through the half which is not used for 70 cm and then to the RX RF output and is then passes to the MAIN unit. Here the signal enters and then passes through a transformer, along with a varactor and related components and forms an electrically-tuned filter/matching network, the 2 meter preamplifier. The output of the preamplifier goes through 2 electronically tuned transistors. Finally, the output goes through to get to the rx mixer. For 2 m rx, the PIN diode bias is provided by the PA unit to 2 m preamplifier.|$|R
