5|$|After {{nearly a}} century, the sole MacRory heir was Amy of Garmoran, who married John of Islay, {{leader of the}} MacDonalds, the most {{powerful}} branch of the MacSorley. A decade later, they divorced, and John deprived his eldest son, Ranald, {{of the ability to}} <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> MacDonald lands; as compensation, John granted Lordship of the Uists to Ranald's younger brother Godfrey, and made Ranald Lord of the remainder of Garmoran, including Rùm.|$|E

Razafindrahety's lineage, as niece to Queen Ranavalona II and great-grand{{daughter of}} King Andrianampoinimerina, qualified her to potentially <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> throne of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Her parents assigned the care of the infant Razafindrahety to a slave who served the family.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been {{described}} as being, in effect, an assertion of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more pervasive form. While this contradicted the British statement that paramountcy would lapse on the transfer of power, the Congress position had always been that independent India would <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> position of being the paramount power.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of Pokémon breeding, Pokémon are assigned {{to one or two}} breeding groups. When a male and female Pokémon that share at least one breeding group are left at a Pokémon Daycare, they may produce an egg, which will hatch into a young Pokémon. The young Pokémon will <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> species of its mother, and moves from its father. However, legendary Pokémon, among certain other species, cannot breed.|$|E

5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|Areas annexed by France {{during the}} Napoleonic era {{were the first}} to <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> metric system. In 1812, Napoleon {{introduced}} a system known as mesures usuelles, which used the names of pre-metric units of measure, but defined them in terms of metric units – for example, the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g and the toise metrique (metric fathom) was 2metres. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary units of measure, others such as Baden adopted {{a modified version of the}} mesures usuelles, but France kept her system of measurement intact.|$|E
50|$|His surname {{was changed}} from Cherry to Cherry-Garrard {{by the terms}} of his great-aunt's will, through which his father <b>inherited</b> <b>the</b> {{enormous}} Lamer Park estate near Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire.

50|$|Miseroni <b>inherited</b> <b>the</b> {{workshop}} {{from his}} father Ottavio (1588-1624), who had been Treasurer before him at the Prague court. His first-born son Jan Octavius (with a beard and leaning towards his father) <b>inherited</b> <b>the</b> workshop in turn from him.|$|R

5|$|Eadbald and Ymme had a daughter, Eanswith (who {{founded the}} very first nunnery on English soil at Folkestone, 15 miles from Canterbury), and two sons, Eorcenberht and Eormenred. Eormenred was the older of the two, and may have held the title of regulus, perhaps {{implying}} that he held the junior kingship of Kent. He appears to have died before his father, leaving Eorcenberht to <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> throne. An additional son, Ecgfrith, is mentioned in a charter of Eadbald's, but the charter is a forgery, probably dating from the eleventh century.|$|E
5|$|Horatio Alger Huntington-Ackerman, a {{successful}} businessperson, marries Mousey Huntington-Ackerman (née Malone), a striving actor, {{and has a}} child named Sandy. They move with their butler Bentley and his wife Flossie to a new country estate called Eclipse with no neighbors except the residents of Walnut Manor, a convalescent home. One evening when Sandy is a young adult, his uncles Bart and Bernie visit Eclipse. The uncles feed the family a poisoned birthday cake {{in an attempt to}} <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> family fortune, sending everyone but Sandy and Bentley into a coma.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{he stood}} to inherit his elder brother's baronetcy, {{together}} with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to <b>inherit.</b> <b>The</b> legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E
50|$|He <b>inherited</b> <b>the</b> {{titles of}} Earl Nelson, Viscount Merton and Baron Nelson from his uncle William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson, {{who died on}} 28 February 1835 without {{surviving}} male issue. Bolton {{changed his name to}} Nelson on <b>inheriting</b> <b>the</b> earldom.|$|R
50|$|Harford County {{is named}} for Henry Harford, the illegitimate son of Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore.

5|$|In {{reality the}} House of Hohenzollern, of which Albrecht was a member, the ruling {{family of the}} Margraviate of Brandenburg, had been {{actively}} expanding its territorial influence; for example already in the 16th century in Farther Pomerania and Silesia. Motivated by a current political expediency, Sigismund Augustus in 1563 allowed the Brandenburg elector branch of the Hohenzollerns, excluded under the 1525 agreement, to <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> Prussian fief rule. The decision, confirmed by the 1569 sejm, made the future union of Prussia with Brandenburg possible. Sigismind II, unlike his successors, was however careful to assert his supremacy. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled after 1572 by elective kings, was even less able to counteract the growing importance of the dynastically active Hohenzollerns.|$|E
5|$|Karl Borromäus Egon's oldest son, Joseph Maria Wenzel (16 August 1754 – 14 July 1759), {{died as a}} small child. The second son, Philipp Nerius Maria (Prague, 21 October 1755 – 5 June 1790), {{married in}} 1779 to his first cousin, Josepha Johanna Benedikta von Fürstenberg (sister of {{the third and fourth}} princes), at Donaueschingen. Only one of their sons survived childhood, but {{died at the age of}} 15 years. The other {{children}} of this second son were all daughters, and thus not eligible to <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> title Prince of Fürstenberg. Consequently, the title devolved to the agnatic male descendants of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg.|$|E
5|$|Later King Shantanu, {{captivated by}} her {{fragrance}} and beauty, {{fell in love}} with Satyavati. She married Shantanu on condition that their children <b>inherit</b> <b>the</b> throne, denying the birthright of Shantanu's eldest son (and crown prince) Bhishma. Satyavati bore Shantanu two children, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. After Shantanu's death, she and her prince sons with the help of Bhishma ruled the kingdom. Although both her sons died childless, she arranged for her first son, Vyasa, to father the children of the two widows of Vichitravirya through niyoga. The children, (Dhritarashtra and Pandu) became the fathers of the Kauravas and Pandavas respectively. After Pandu's death, Satyavati went to the forest for penance and breathed her last before witnessing the Kurukshetra War.|$|E
