25|$|On January 14, 1910, the Rev. E. A. Schell {{came forward}} with a {{confession}} that he said Lamphere had made to him when the minister was comforting the dying man. In it, Lamphere revealed Gunness' crimes and swore {{that she was still}} alive. Shortly before his death, Lamphere had told the Reverend Schell and a fellow convict, Harry Meyers, that he had not murdered anyone, but that he had helped Gunness bury many of her victims. When a victim arrived, she made the man comfortable, charming him and cooking a large meal. She drugged <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and,</b> when the man was in a stupor, she split his head with a meat chopper. Sometimes she would wait for the suitor to go to bed and enter the bedroom by candlelight and chloroform her sleeping victim. A powerful woman, Gunness would carry the body to the basement, place it on a table, and dissect it. She bundled the remains and buried these in the hog pen and the grounds about the house. She had become an expert at dissection, thanks to instruction she had received from her second husband, the butcher Peter Gunness. To save time, she sometimes poisoned her victims' coffee with strychnine. She also varied her disposal methods, sometimes dumping the corpse into the hog-scalding vat and covering the remains with quicklime. Lamphere said that if Gunness was overly tired after murdering one of her victims, she chopped up the remains and, {{in the middle of the}} night, fed the remains to the hogs.|$|E
500|$|Mystery Train was {{the first}} American {{independent}} film to be financed by Japanese conglomerate JVC, and was produced on a budget – $2.8 million – that was considerable by Jarmusch's modest standards. The company was enthusiastic about underwriting the film despite the director insisting on retaining full creative control, {{and went on to}} fund his next three features. The substantial budget and time available gave Jarmusch the opportunity to shoot in color and to rehearse with the actors many scenes not in the script, including several from the courtship of Mitsuko and Jun. At a Memphis nightclub with the Japanese actors during production, the director had Masatoshi Nagase – who spoke little English but was an accomplished mimic – try chat-up lines on the female clientele as an acting exercise. Jarmusch took advantage of the production to make the second installment of <b>his</b> <b>Coffee</b> <b>and</b> Cigarettes series, a collection of short vignettes featuring acquaintances of the director sitting about drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. The [...] "Memphis Version", titled Twins, starred bickering twins Cinqué and Joie Lee alongside Steve Buscemi as an obtuse waiter who expounds his theory of Elvis having an evil twin to a hostile reception.|$|E

2500|$|The {{same year}} the fledgling film writer and {{director}} Mel Brooks pitched his project, Springtime for Hitler to Glazier, having previously made numerous unsuccessful attempts to interest movie producers. [...] Over lunch in Glazier's office, Brooks acted out all the parts and began singing Springtime for Hitler. Glazier {{reported that he had}} never laughed so hard in his life. [...] "He spit out <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tuna sandwich and couldn't stop laughing," [...] recalled Brooks. [...] "He said [...] "I vow to get this movie made. The world must see this picture."" [...] Glazier struggled at first to interest movie studios in the show business satire, but with perseverance Joseph E. Levine at Avco Embassy accepted the project and agreed to let Brooks direct the movie. [...] Filming was not without its challenges. Brooks was an anxious, perfectionist and difficult novice director, who had problems communicating with the actors. [...] Zero Mostel was also often angry and demanding, and Glazier had to mediate between the director, Mostel and others. [...] Despite frequent requests from Brooks for extra money and resources, Glazier succeeded in bringing the film in under budget. [...] Brooks remembered Glazier as a producer was [...] "very bright, warm and a bit of a bon vivant. Sidney {{was the first one to}} say, [...] "The dailies look good, let's have a party." [...] He'd have a party about anything – have a few drinks, canapés and pretty girls. He was right out of a black-and-white Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie." [...] The film, renamed ...|$|E
