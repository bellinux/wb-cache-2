However, {{the existence of}} many 4-hydroxycoumadin anticoagulants (for example phenprocoumon) that possess no ketone group in the 3-substituent to form such a structure, suggests that the hemiketal must tautomerise to the 4-hydroxy form in order for warfarin to be active.|$|E

5|$|Yttrium {{isotopes}} {{are among}} the most common products of the nuclear fission of uranium in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In the context of nuclear waste management, the most important isotopes of yttrium are 91Y and 90Y, with half-lives of 58.51days and 64hours, respectively. Though 90Y has a short half-life, <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> secular equilibrium with its long-lived parent isotope, strontium-90 (90Sr) with a half-life of 29years.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. <b>It</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry, as <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> {{various forms}} {{all over the}} world, has a {{membership}} estimated by the United Grand Lodge of England at around six million worldwide. The fraternity is administratively organised into independent Grand Lodges (or sometimes Grand Orients), each of which governs its own Masonic jurisdiction, which consists of subordinate (or constituent) Lodges. The largest single jurisdiction, in terms of membership, is the United Grand Lodge of England (with a membership estimated at around a quarter million). The Grand Lodge of Scotland and Grand Lodge of Ireland (taken together) have approximately 150,000 members. In the United States, total membership is just under two million.|$|E

5|$|The {{most stable}} oxide of {{samarium}} is the sesquioxide Sm2O3. As many other samarium compounds, <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high (2345°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry {{can be grown}} by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from the Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.|$|E

25|$|Carbon in the Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{exists in}} two main forms: {{carbon dioxide and}} methane.

25|$|In mathematics, the {{dimension}} of an object is an intrinsic property independent of the space in which the object is embedded. For example, a point on the unit circle in the plane can be specified by two Cartesian coordinates, but a single polar coordinate (the angle) would be sufficient, so the circle is 1-dimensional even though <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> the 2-dimensional plane. This intrinsic notion of dimension {{is one of the}} chief ways the mathematical notion of dimension differs from its common usages.|$|E
25|$|Indian {{surnames}} {{may often}} denote caste, profession, and village and are invariably mentioned {{along with the}} personal names. However, hereditary last names are not universal. In Indian passports the surname is shown first. In telephone directories the surname is used for collation. In North Indian states the surname is placed after given names where <b>it</b> <b>exists.</b> <b>In</b> parts of south India, surname is placed before personal name {{and in most cases}} it is only shown as an initial (for example 'S.' for Suryapeth).|$|E
25|$|Hermeticists {{believe in}} a prisca theologia, the {{doctrine}} that a single, true theology exists, that <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> all religions, {{and that it was}} given by God to man in antiquity. In order to demonstrate the truth of the prisca theologia doctrine, Christians appropriated the Hermetic teachings for their own purposes. By this account, Hermes Trismegistus was (according to the fathers of the Christian church) either a contemporary of Moses or the third in a line of men named Hermes—Enoch, Noah, and the Egyptian priest-king who is known to us as Hermes Trismegistus.|$|E
