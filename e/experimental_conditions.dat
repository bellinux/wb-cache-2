40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of adaptive word retrieval intervention on a classroom vocabulary program on children's vocabulary acquisition in kindergarten. In the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition,</b> word retrieval was provided in a classroom vocabulary program, combining implicit and explicit vocabulary instructions. Children performed extra word retrieval activities and received semantic feedback for words they did not learn during the classroom vocabulary program. Eighty-seven children were in the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition,</b> and 115 children were in the classroom vocabulary control condition. Results showed the adaptive word retrieval intervention to stimulate higher learning gains than the classroom vocabulary program on the learning of the target words. Children in the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> also showed transfer effects; they described more words on a standardized expressive vocabulary test than children in the control condition. The research findings suggest additional value of word retrieval with feedback for classroom vocabulary learning...|$|R

5|$|The northernmost {{populations of}} Oryzomys couesi, those in southernmost Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico, are {{classified}} as the subspecies aquaticus, which {{was described as a}} separate species, Oryzomys aquaticus, in 1891. Here the range of O.couesi meets that of the marsh rice rat; in parts of Kenedy, Willacy and Cameron counties, Texas, and in far northeastern Tamaulipas, the two are sympatric (occur in the same places). In the contact zone, couesi occurs further inland, while the marsh rice rat lives along the coast. In <b>experimental</b> <b>conditions,</b> the two fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of gene flow or hybridization in the wild. Compared to populations further to the south, aquaticus is larger and paler and has a more robust skull. Specimens from Tamaulipas are slightly darker than those from Texas. The Cytb sequences of specimens of aquaticus form a separate group, but cluster among specimens of O.c.couesi from further south.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we explore}} {{the effect of}} social prompts offered by a {{computer}} supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment on student attitudes and behavior towards each other. We do this by experimentally contrasting collaboration in two configurations, one that presents students with social questions in between math problems and then uses the answers to those problems to tailor the cover story and associated hints for the next problem, and a control condition that uses the same problems, but does not use social questions for tailoring. Our finding is that the social prompts changed the attitude students displayed towards one another. Whereas {{in the control condition}} students took on a more competitive attitude, in the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> students were more playful. On the questionnaire students reported exchanging more help in the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition.</b> An analysis of the corpus reveals no significant differences in amount of help exchanged, but {{there was a significant difference}} in terms of non-help-related conversation such that the proportion of episodes where help was provided was higher in the <b>Experimental</b> <b>condition.</b> In terms of learning gains, the trend was consistently in favor of the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> in terms of learning between the pretest and the quizzes after each lab session as well as the posttest, however these trends were not statistically significant overall. The strongest learning result is that students in the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> learned marginally more on one unit of the material on the second lab day than students in the control condition (p=. 06, effect size. 55 standard deviations) ...|$|R
40|$|Research reportInternational audienceThis study {{aimed to}} observe the {{influence}} of the monotonous consumption of two types of fibre-enriched bread at breakfast on hedonic liking for the bread, subsequent hunger and energy intake. Two groups of unrestrained normal weight participants were given either white sandwich bread (WS) or multigrain sandwich bread (MG) at breakfast (the sensory properties of the WS were more similar to the usual bread eaten by the participants than those of the MG). In each group, two 15 -day cross-over conditions were set up. During the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> the usual breakfast of each participant was replaced by an isocaloric portion of plain bread (WS or MG). During the control condition, participants consumed only 10 g of the corresponding bread and completed their breakfast with other foods they wanted. The results showed that bread appreciation did not change over exposure even in the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition.</b> Hunger was lower in the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> than in the control condition. The consumption of WS decreased energy intake while the consumption of MG did not in the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> compared to the corresponding control one. In conclusion, a monotonous breakfast composed solely of a fibre-enriched bread may decrease subsequent hunger and, when similar to a familiar bread, food intake...|$|R

40|$|Rationale Since {{implicit}} {{attitudes toward}} alcohol {{play an important}} role in drinking behavior, a possible way to obtain a behavioral change is changing these implicit attitudes.

Methods Participants were randomly assigned to an <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> and a control <b>condition.</b> In the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition,</b> participants were subjected to an evaluative conditioning procedure that consistently pairs alcohol-related cues with negative stimuli. In the control condition, alcohol-related cues were consistently paired with neutral stimuli during the evaluative conditioning phase. Implicit attitudes, explicit attitudes, and drinking behavior were measured before and after the evaluative conditioning phase. Results Following the evaluative conditioning procedure, participants in the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> showed stronger negative implicit attitudes toward alcohol and consumed less alcohol compared to participants in the control condition. However, this effect was only found when the evaluative conditioning task paired alcohol-related cues with general negative pictures, but not when using pictures of frowning faces...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to identify the effectiveness of an AVG on elementary school students' science knowledge learning, physical activity (PA) level, and interest-based motivation. MethodsIn this randomized controlled study, 53 elementary school students were assigned to an <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> or a comparison <b>condition.</b> The <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> provided an AVG learning environment, whereas the comparison condition was based on sedentary educational video games. ResultsThe results of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the knowledge test showed that students in both groups performed better on the post-test than they did on the pre-test (p <  0. 001, η 2  =  0. 486), and their post-test scores did not differ significantly. The <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> provided a more active environment since the students' average heart rates (HRs) were in the Target-Heart-Rate-Zone (HR =  134  bpm), which was significantly higher than the average HR (103  bpm) from the comparison condition (t =  7. 212, p <  0. 001). Students in the <b>experimental</b> <b>condition</b> perceived a higher level of situational interest than their counterparts in the comparison group (p <  0. 01, and η 2  =  0. 301).
