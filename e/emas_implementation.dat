40|$|The {{way people}} are doing {{business}} are changing fast under pressures such as growing number of environmental concerns, public pressure, regulatory measures, demands of consumers and shareholders for environmentally friendly products and services, so it {{is becoming more and}} more important for organizations/companies to demonstrate sustainability of their investment strategies and operations. A management tool for companies and other organizations to evaluate, report and improve their environmental performance is eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS), regulated by Regulation (EC) No 1221 / 2009. Having in mind intentions of Serbia to join European Union (EU), as well as a fact that Regulation 1221 / 2009 allows participation in EMAS also for organizations in non EU member countries, it is quite obvious that <b>EMAS</b> <b>implementation</b> will create necessary conditions for more intensive participation of our country in all European processes. In this article, we present Serbian companies included in calculation of stock market index Belgrade Stock Exchange Index (Belex 15) and their stage in <b>EMAS</b> <b>implementation.</b> Research results shows at what stage of <b>EMAS</b> <b>implementation</b> are Serbian “blue chip ” companies and future activities needed for them to apply this important EU regulation...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the tools}} set by the European Community (EC) to reduce the {{environmental}} impact of firms is EMAS Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1221 / 2009), setting up an Environmental Management System (EMS), which aims for a continuous improvement of environmental performances. Italy has the highest number of certified organization among all European Member States, accounting for over one thousand registrations. The paper presents the result of a survey conducted through a questionnaire about <b>EMAS</b> <b>implementation</b> and targeted to all Italian registered organizations. Of nearly 1000 organizations, over 500 answers were collected. The main goal is to understand how organizations experience the scheme, focusing on main drivers for its adoption, main difficulties encountered, and perceived benefits. In particular, survey results contribute to define a reflection on the difficulties regarding EMAS diffusion among European companies. Aspects identified as critical can lead to a contraction of registration requests, especially those formulated by SMEs, which constitute the majority of Italian companies. Moreover, perceived difficulties might affect the firms’ willingness to renew EMAS registration. Data provided by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA) recently highlighted the increasing rate of firms who decide to withdraw from registration. This study offers interesting inputs related to main critical issues in <b>EMAS</b> <b>implementation,</b> which can be the baseline for future research on companies that abandon the certification scheme, in order to provide suggestions for the improvement of its effectiveness both for national and communitarian institutions...|$|E
40|$|The Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) was {{established}} in 1993 in the European Union as a voluntary instrument facilitating the implementation of organisational environmental policies and management of environmental aspects. We present a comprehensive literature review on EMAS research, organized according to three broad questions: Why do organisations choose EMAS? How is the scheme implemented and adapted to organisational characteristics? And what results are achieved? We have built analysis matrices to critically review 80 articles published {{over the past two}} decades and to identify the recurrent research themes addressing each question. We found that the decision to adopt EMAS is motivated by a set of internal and external factors, compounded by the potential of an organisation to combine the scheme with other EMS standards and environmental management tools. These themes are the ones most extensively covered by existing literature. To answer the question on how organisations implement and adapt to the scheme, two themes have been identified covering EMS planning and operation issues and sectoral approaches. Results show that the focus has been put on development of methods for assessing the significance of environmental aspects, implementing environmental policies and developing indicators for tracking performance and elaborating environmental statements. The development of sectoral approaches that adapt EMAS to characteristics of different economic activity sectors is also emerging as a critical research development. Finally, the themes addressing results achieved with <b>EMAS</b> <b>implementation</b> have only recently surfaced in the literature. The achievement of sustained environmental performance improvements through EMAS adoption is both contested and supported in the reviewed studies. On the other hand, improvements in the relationships with stakeholders arise as one of the most important intangible outcomes of the scheme. We conclude our review by advancing a systematic set of future research opportunities in this field...|$|E
40|$|While the {{pressure}} of legitimacy was found to greatly influence companies’ environmental reporting (ER) practices, being environmentally responsible, however, is not necessarily reflected through positive and descriptive ER. Unless companies begin to truly commit to their business environmental impacts, the issue of incomprehensiveness and incredibility of ER will remain. Given {{it has been suggested}} that the deficiency of conventional accounting practices to capture environmental information contributes to the non-disclosure of complete and reliable information, the implementation of environmental management accounting (EMA) is thus necessary. Through <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation,</b> both monetary and physical environmental information can be generated, enabling the integration of environmental information into decision makings as well as reporting practices. A review of literature suggests that there has been very little research conducted on <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation</b> and the effect its hold on ER practices. Therefore, the present study seeks to examine the extent to which companies implement EMA and whether such implementation is influenced by corporate characteristics. The present study also examines whether the extent of <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation</b> influences the quantity and quality of ER. Using a contingency model, five corporate characteristics, namely, environmental sensitivity of industry, company size, ownership status, environmental management system (EMS) adoption and the proportion of non-executive directors (NEDs) were examined for their associations with the extent of <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation.</b> To explain the association between <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation</b> and quantity and quality of ER, social issue life cycle theory was employed. For consistency purposes, companies were segmented into three social issue life cycle phases: Policy, Learning and Commitment; with Policy represents the lowest and Commitment the highest extent of <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation.</b> Data were collected using postal questionnaires and content analysis of corporate annual reports. The results, derived from a sample of 78 Malaysian public listed companies (PLCs), indicate that the extent of <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation</b> was moderate and that more emphasis was placed on environmental cost effectiveness activities. From the social issue life cycle phases standpoint, the majority of companies were in the Learning phase. Additionally, the differences in the extent of <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation</b> were significantly explained by environmental sensitivity of industry and EMS adoption. The results also showed that companies in the Commitment phase reported a greater quantity of ER than those in the Policy and Learning phases. However, no similar effect was observed in the quality of ER. These findings confirm the assertion that a lack of regulation on ER leads to incomprehensiveness and incredibility of ER. In fact, remarks made by the respondents in the questionnaire indicate their inclination towards the development of a comprehensive approach to EMA and refinement of existing ER legislation. This is because, the lack of standardisation makes the measuring and reporting processes very challenging. Despite this however, the regulatory requirement on EMA should be limited to environmentally sensitive industries while others should be on a cost-benefit basis. Taken together, the results of the present study offer important implications for both policymakers and companies. Policymakers will be better informed on the needs of companies pertaining to EMA and ER practices. Companies will be enlightened on the importance of being environmentally responsible and that such practice benefits the companies in many ways, socially and economically...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} level of <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation</b> in companies within environmentally sensitive industries in Malaysia, as well as gaining insights into pressures for implementation. It was found that there are elements of environmental-related management accounting within some of the organizations in which interviews were conducted. Implementation was driven by a motivation to reduce costs rather than environmental conservation. Apart from that, companies' reactions to environmental issues stem from pressures from customers who demand environmentally sensitive workplaces, procedures and processes in the companies {{with which they are}} in business...|$|R
40|$|Environmental Management Accounting (EMA) is a system, which collects, records, evaluates and {{disseminates}} {{information about}} environmentally induced financial impacts and {{environmental impacts of}} the system itself. EMA is {{an important source of}} information for decision-making processes such as management of an organization, for EMS or environmental reporting. Identified barriers were included in the study which was conducted in three phases – in organizations espousing to Responsible Care, in selected companies with ISO 14000 and in companies with environmental management systems, validated by European EMAS. In early 2010 research was completed in the field of environmental management accounting and barriers defending the implemention of EMA to organization’s information system and the subsequent use of EMA. Primary data obtained from this study were subjected to cluster analysis and the results are presented in this scientific thesis. In practise there are many obstacles to full-fledged <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation</b> process into practice organization and its functioning. Findings of the study give answers to the question: „What barriers act as obstacles to the <b>implementation</b> of <b>EMA</b> into the practise of the organization and its functioning?...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesPrescription errors occur {{frequently}} in pediatric emergency departments (PEDs). The effect of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) with electronic medication alert system (EMAS) on these is unknown. The {{objective was to}} compare prescription errors rates before and after introduction of CPOE with EMAS in a PED. The hypothesis was that CPOE with EMAS would significantly reduce the rate and severity of prescription errors in the PED. MethodsA prospective comparison of a sample of outpatient, medication prescriptions 5  months before and after CPOE with <b>EMAS</b> <b>implementation</b> (7, 268 before and 7, 292 after) was performed. Error types and rates, alert types and significance, and physician response were noted. Medication errors were deemed significant {{if there was a}} potential to cause life‐threatening injury, failure of therapy, or an adverse drug effect. ResultsThere was a significant reduction in the errors per 100 prescriptions (10. 4 before vs. 7. 3 after; absolute risk reduction = 3. 1, 95 % confidence interval [CI] =  2. 2 to 4. 0). Drug dosing error rates decreased from 8 to 5. 4 per 100 (absolute risk reduction = 2. 6, 95 % CI =  1. 8 to 3. 4). Alerts were generated for 29. 6 % of prescriptions, with 45 % involving drug dose range checking. The sensitivity of CPOE with EMAS in identifying errors in prescriptions was 45. 1 % (95 % CI =  40. 8 % to 49. 6 %), and the specificity was 57 % (95 % CI =  55. 6 % to 58. 5 %). Prescribers modified 20 % of the dosing alerts, resulting in the error not reaching the patient. Conversely, 11 % of true dosing alerts for medication errors were overridden by the prescribers: 88 (11. 3 %) resulted in medication errors, and 684 (88. 6 %) were false‐positive alerts. ConclusionsA CPOE with EMAS was associated with a decrease in overall prescription errors in our PED. Further system refinements are required to reduce the high false‐positive alert rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} commensuration - 'making things the same' - is {{receiving}} increased attention {{in studies of}} fields of social practice such as climate regimes, accounting and medical error reporting. The part played by analogy in common law is well known, but the way cognate processes work through regulatory institutions and regimes (ie commensuration) is less recognised. Connected to commensuration and arising from it, one can propose a concept of 'proliferation' to capture instances of enactment of law (institutional design, development and practices) where commensuration is not possible or attempted, or where it is challenged in some way. This paper will explore and review recent more or less explicit developments {{of the concept of}} commensuration, propose the related concept of institutional proliferation, and explore the application of these to recent developments in the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The focus will be on <b>EMA's</b> <b>implementation</b> of the EU's Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Regulation, how 'combination products' (medicine/device combinations) are being managed in that evolving regime, on EMA's design of a number of innovative institutional forums for stakeholder inclusion and linkages to scientific societies (proliferation), and its recent involvement in proposals for a 'recast' of medical device regulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} article is {{the draft of}} ISO 14051 -Environmental Management 2 ̆ 013 Material flow cost {{accounting}} 2 ̆ 013 General framework, whose final form should be finished {{at the end of}} 2011 or later. This standard does not take in consideration the national particularity. Therefore, the main aim {{of this paper is to}} review how the concept of MFCA meets the Czech conditions. The MFCA (as one of cost accounting methods) is in Czech Republic a part of management accounting (MA), which coincides with the Anglo- Saxon concept. MA is a skeleton for other components of information system, closely connected with the physical process. The environmental management accounting (EMA) is based on the same concept: it could be defined as a 2 ̆ 01 cgreen MA 2 ̆ 01 d. When defining EMA, we encounter many misleading inaccuracies and misunderstandings. Firstly, some believe that traditional management accounts generally detect only actual costs. From this, MFCA is defined as a (solely) accounting method. Secondly, EMA is segmented to physical part (PEMA) and monetary part (MEMA). This leads to obscure the substance of <b>EMA.</b> <b>Implementation</b> of costing methods has a long tradition in Czech Republic. Basic types of traditional costing methods (unlike MFCA) have been derived from the conditions, under which specific production process continues. MFCA adoption in our conditions should be comprehended as an upgrading and enhancement of the traditional methods, not as their suppression...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the use of Environmental Management Accounting (EMA) and identify environmental costs and their impact on environmental performance. Over the last two decades, EMA has emerged as an important approach by organizations wanting to improve their environmental and economic performance. However, despite the many pilot projects conducted that demonstrated the positive impact that EMA has on an organization, <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation</b> remains slow and lagging behind in South Africa. EMA is an environmental management tool that traces environmental costs directly to the processes and products that are responsible for those costs, thereby highlighting problem areas that need to prioritized when considering the adoption of cleaner production. Previous research identified that traditional costing systems did not adequately account for the actual environmental costs incurred by companies as much of these costs were hidden under overhead accounts. Hence, production costs were high, resulting in incorrect profit margins being set and ultimately impacting on company profitability. This paper is based on a case study of a paper manufacturing company in KwaZulu- Natal. The scope of this study was limited to the steam generation process and focused mainly on the efficiency of the current coal-fired boilers used in the boiler plant. The research methodology used in the study was both quantitative and qualitative involving triangulation. The results of the study show that EMA can improve environmental and economic performance of an organization by providing managers with more accurate values of their environmental costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} damage has become popular {{issue to be}} concerned by society, government and business industries sectors, recently. Some studies found that most pollutions contributed by industrial sectors, therefore many tools have been applied by companies to minimize the waste. However, not for profit organization, government and society should also {{be responsible for the}} occurrence of {{environmental damage}} for their miss-consumption on fuel, paper, electricity, water, etc. University as academic institution consumes some resources mostly on paper and electricity, to support their daily learning and administration activities. In managing the resources consumption and minimising the waste, university may also apply environmental management accounting (EMA), which have been implemented at most industrial sectors. This study aims to determine the level of readiness of <b>implementation</b> of <b>EMA</b> on academic institution which most deal with resources such as paper, water and electricity. The research object of this case study is Faculty Ebiz in Surabaya, focusing on the way they consume and manage the use of paper, electricity, and water. As a qualitative research, the study uses some methods to collect data, which consists of deep interviews with some keypersons, documents analysis on the policy and data of resources’ consumption level, and observation some activities on location as non-participant observer. The results reveal that Faculty Ebiz has not been fully implemented EMA concept in the way of paper, electricity, and water consumptions.

40|$|Development and <b>implementation</b> of <b>EMAs</b> has {{increased}} rapidly {{during the last}} years {{in the context of}} the “more electrical aircraft”. One of the main technical key issues for the <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation</b> is the jamming. It can appear due to metalmetal contact of load transmission (in gearboxes, bearings and ball/roller screws). This problem penalizes the reliability although with very low failure rate. To overcome this problem in aeronautical EMAs are actually several ways investigated, where one of the most attractive and with more promising is the implementation of advanced monitoring systems. This implementation of “smart” monitoring systems will imply a clear economical profit in the final product and in the complete system: envisaged benefits will be lower maintenance costs with higher reliability, instead of increasing maintenance costs and decreasing reliability for classical components without Health Monitoring. At the end, the selection of the Health Monitoring and Management system will be able to establish different levels of validation: failure detection, diagnostic and prognostic; this will provide a proactive maintenance strategy in order to replace EMA before failure. A demonstrator prototype of an innovative electromechanical actuator with real time health monitoring capability has been designed and developed by SENER. This actuator type can be taken as a reference for typical secondary control surface applications. This development is based on previous work performed by SENER in AWIATOR project where one of the tasks was the design and calculation of the new flap trailing edge with MINITEDs. In addition, this work included the supports and linkages of the current actuator to the MINITED. This compact electromechanical actuator shows innovations with respect to current state-of-the-art electrical actuators as lightness and compactness of the resulting actuator, with high power density within small dimensions. As an added value, an additional plug module is under development for real time health monitoring to detect potential working incidents: “smart actuator”. One of the additional key points will be the health management in order to solve the introduction of these systems in EMAs, and to check the compatibility with the aircraft systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{humanoid}} robot is being developed, intended to operate robustly {{in a typical}} day-to-day human environment. Its ability to react quickly to stochastic disturbances, especially its ability to avoid falling, termed stability in this context, is of prime importance. The choosing of a suitable actuator that affords such stability {{is seen as a}} challenge in the current stage of the humanoid project. A novel method for comparing various actuators in terms of humanoid stability is investigated, to aid with this choice. A common method for comparing actuators is the use of low-level actuator parameters, e. g. power density. With a low-level parameter, a specific actuator property can be compared between multiple actuators. To incorporate relevant properties of all actuators, a large set of actuator parameters is required. This becomes even more challenging when comparing a heterogeneous collection of actuators, e. g. muscle and hydraulics. Besides subjectiveness in parameter definitions and comparisons, the multidimensional set of actuator parameters needs to be related to a one-dimensional measure of humanoid stability. As low-level parameters and high-level humanoid stability are not directly relatable, subjective weighting factors are traditionally employed to reduce dimensionality. Step time is introduced as a one-dimensional criterion for comparing different actuators. The ability to make fast movements is a critical component in defining humanoid stability. Therefore, by comparing step times of different actuators in a fixed test case, a measure of humanoid stability is obtained. The step movement represents a simplified motion of the lifting of a foot, in which essential elements of humanoid motion are incorporated. A framework is developed, with which step times of Human Muscle (HM), ElectroMechanical Actuators (EMAs) and Hydraulic Actuators (HAs) are computed. While EMAs are often thought to have limited potential for humanoid applications, step times {{are similar to those of}} muscle. Supplemented with recent examples of successful <b>EMA</b> <b>implementations,</b> step time demonstrates the potential of EMAs. Furthermore, HA capability is also demonstrated, as step times can obtain lower values than those of HM and EMA. Step time as developed in this thesis appears to be a powerful tool for comparing vastly different actuators. It provides a one-dimensional measure related to humanoid stability, evaluated directly for each specific actuator. <br/...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Business Administration. Business School. Despite {{the growing}} concern of {{environmental}} issues including climate change and green house gas emissions as demonstrated {{in a number of}} global conventions such as the recently concluded climate change conference in Copenhagen Denmark in December 2009, little {{attention has been paid to}} how the service sector impacts the environment and how related environmental costs are accounted for. Conversely, there is a general lack of consideration given to environmental impacts, environmental responsibility, accountability, environmental costs and potential cost savings within university settings. The overall objective of the study is to assess the application of environmental management accounting (EMA) at Tshwane University of Technology (TUT). This was achieved by investigating the environmental impacts associated with the operations of TUT as a service organization and examine how the institution manages, account and report environmental cost. The study employed a case study and data was collected by means of exploratory and explanatory research techniques using two data sets; documentary and in-depth individual face-to-face interviews employing a semi-structured questionnaire with closed and open ended questions to collect primary data. Fourteen interviews were conducted with personnel of two main divisions involved with EMA related information Building and Estate and Finance. Documentary and interview data was transcribed and reduced through descriptive statistics and a process of selection, focusing, simplification, abstraction and transformation of the data enabling categories, themes and patterns to be identified. vi The results indicate that; the <b>implementation</b> of <b>EMA</b> and general governance for environmental responsibility and accountability is extremely weak. The potential use of EMA is neglected and, as such, <b>EMA</b> <b>implementation</b> is not considered a priority. Three barriers to the adoption of EMA within TUT were identified as: institutional pressures, a low profile of accounting for the environment, and management’s attitudes. There is a need to improve the quality of information by restructuring the classification in the income and expenditure report and introducing further classifications. Such classifications should relate to responsibility centres. There is further need to create incentives geared to promote environmental awareness and behavior change and to monitor non-financial information on resources used especially electricity, water, fuel and paper to facilitate the <b>implementation</b> of <b>EMA</b> at TUT.
