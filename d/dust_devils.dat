5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. <b>Dust</b> <b>devils</b> are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to {{pose a threat to}} both people and property.|$|E
5|$|Meso{{cyclones}}, tornadoes and <b>dust</b> <b>devils</b> {{lie within}} the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without {{the presence of}} a surface low, and can pinch off {{from the base of the}} tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Streaks {{are common}} across Mars and new ones appear {{frequently}} on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark {{at first and}} get lighter with age. The streaks can start in a tiny area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or <b>dust</b> <b>devils.</b> Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.|$|E

Meanwhile, Mukurob releases Mark from prison and together they search for Wendy. As they try to drive through a <b>dust</b> storm, <b>Dust</b> <b>Devil</b> attacks them, causing the car to flip over. Mukurob handcuffs Mark {{to the car and}} heads into the storm, telling him that he has a chance since the naghtloper only takes those who have nothing to live for. Wendy reaches the abandoned town of Kolmanskop where Mukurob finds her and searches for <b>Dust</b> <b>Devil.</b> He runs into <b>Dust</b> <b>Devil,</b> who stabs him.

25|$|On March 9, 2005 (probably {{during the}} Martian night), the rover's solar panel {{efficiency}} jumped from around 60% {{of what it}} had originally been to 93%, followed on March 10, by the sighting of <b>dust</b> <b>devils.</b> NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending {{the duration of the}} mission.

50|$|As {{available}} extreme hot air {{near the}} surface is channeled up the <b>dust</b> <b>devil,</b> eventually surrounding cooler air will be sucked in. Once this occurs, the effect is dramatic, and the <b>dust</b> <b>devil</b> dissipates in seconds. Usually this occurs when the <b>dust</b> <b>devil</b> is not moving fast enough (depletion) or begins to enter a terrain where the surface temperatures are cooler, causing unbalance.|$|R
50|$|Wendy {{runs her}} car {{off the road}} and finds an {{abandoned}} camper (which <b>Dust</b> <b>Devil</b> had hitched a ride with at Bethanie) with a strange man, who she asks to help her push her car out of the sand. She then sees <b>Dust</b> <b>Devil</b> {{on the side of the}} road, and stops for him. Cpl. Dutoit (Russell Copley) and Cpl. Bates (Andre Odendaal) find the abandoned camper with dismembered body parts inside. Mukurob drives to Joe's home, the former Bethanie cinema, and asks him about the symbols that were in the house. He responds that it was the work of magic, to which Mukurob scoffs. Wendy and <b>Dust</b> <b>Devil</b> continue driving and pass another hitch-hiker, but <b>Dust</b> <b>Devil</b> tells Wendy not to stop. As they pass the hitch-hiker, <b>Dust</b> <b>Devil</b> disappears from the car.|$|R

25|$|In January 2004, the NASA twin Mars Exploration Rovers named Spirit (MER-A) and Opportunity (MER-B) {{landed on}} the surface of Mars. Both have met or {{exceeded}} all their targets. Among the most significant scientific returns has been conclusive evidence that liquid water existed at some time in the past at both landing sites. Martian <b>dust</b> <b>devils</b> and windstorms have occasionally cleaned both rovers' solar panels, and thus increased their lifespan. Spirit Rover (MER-A) was active until 2010, when it stopped sending data because it had fallen into a sand dune.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{some other}} places visited on Mars with landers (Viking and Pathfinder), {{nearly all the}} rocks near Phoenix are small. For {{about as far as}} the camera can see, the land is flat, but shaped into polygons between 2–3 meters in {{diameter}} and are bounded by troughs that are 20cm to 50cm deep. These shapes are due to ice in the soil expanding and contracting due to major temperature changes. The microscope showed that the soil on top of the polygons is composed of flat particles (probably a type of clay) and rounded particles. Also, unlike other places visited on Mars, the site has no ripples or dunes.O at the Phoenix Landing Site. 2009. Science:325. p58-61 Ice is present a few inches below the surface {{in the middle of the}} polygons, and along its edges, the ice is at least 8inches deep. When the ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere it slowly sublimates. Some <b>dust</b> <b>devils</b> were observed.|$|E
25|$|As drought {{conditions}} continue, groundwater levels {{drop and}} this provides excellent conditions for fires to develop. With hot, dry weather and no moisture underground, trees lose moisture and become very flammable in dry conditions. This leads to wildfires which usually {{is the main}} impact of drought in the United Kingdom, with moorland vegetation such as heather badly affected as the peat bogs dry out. Also, these fires can continue, even when seemingly put out, as the smoldering peat re-ignites the dry vegetation. However, during severe droughts, many trees can burn, and people's lives can be at risk, as in the 1976 drought when a fire encroached on a hospital, and only a wind direction change saved the patients' lives. As embers can be transported easily, and if drought is severe enough, fires can start miles away from their original position as they are transported by wind and even <b>dust</b> <b>devils.</b> With these situations, roads are often closed to prevent loss of life and further damage. These fires also can destroy wildlife habitats, and this can also threaten wildlife.|$|E

500|$|When the air {{has little}} {{moisture}} or when an inversion stops {{the warm air}} from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or <b>dust</b> <b>devils</b> to mark the thermals, thermals are not always associated with any feature on the ground. The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a variometer that quickly indicates climbs and descents. Occasionally reliable thermals {{can be found in}} the exhaust gases from power stations or from fires.|$|E
500|$|Steam devils {{were first}} {{reported}} by Lyons and Pease in 1972 concerning their observations of Lake Michigan in January 1971. [...] This month {{was a particularly}} cold one for Wisconsin (one of the coldest in the 20th century) which, combined with Lake Michigan staying mostly ice-free, produced good conditions for steam devil formation. [...] Lyons and Pease named steam devils by comparison to the <b>dust</b> <b>devils</b> on land {{to which they have}} a comparable size and structure. [...] They were also motivated by the need to distinguish steam devils from the much more powerful waterspout whose land equivalent is the tornado. [...] Lyons and Pease wrote their article with the aim of persuading the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to include steam devils in the International Field Year for the Great Lakes which was imminently to occur in 1972-3.Holle (2007), p.9Lyons & Pease, pp.235, 237 ...|$|E
500|$|A {{waterspout}} {{is defined}} by the National Weather Service as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish [...] "fair weather" [...] waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar to <b>dust</b> <b>devils</b> and landspouts. They form at the bases of cumulus congestus clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth laminar walls, and typically travel very slowly. They occur most commonly in the Florida Keys and in the northern Adriatic Sea. In contrast, tornadic waterspouts are stronger tornadoes over water. They form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes, or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water. Since they form from severe thunderstorms and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are more dangerous. In official tornado statistics, waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land, though some European weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together.|$|E
