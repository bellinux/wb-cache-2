5|$|A {{virus has}} either a DNA or an RNA genome and {{is called a}} <b>DNA</b> <b>virus</b> or an RNA virus, respectively. The vast {{majority}} of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{important}} pathogens of livestock. Diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue {{are caused by}} viruses. Companion animals such as cats, dogs, and horses, if not vaccinated, are susceptible to serious viral infections. Canine parvovirus {{is caused by a}} small <b>DNA</b> <b>virus</b> and infections are often fatal in pups. Like all invertebrates, the honey bee is susceptible to many viral infections. However, most viruses co-exist harmlessly in their host and cause no signs or symptoms of disease.|$|E

50|$|Superfamily 3 (SF3): Superfamily 3 {{consists}} of helicases encoded mainly by small <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses</b> and some large nucleocytoplasmic <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> They have a 3’-5’ translocation directionality, {{meaning that they}} are all type A helicases. The most known SF3 helicase is the papilloma virus E1 helicase.|$|R
5|$|Many viruses can be {{synthesised}} de novo ("from scratch") and {{the first}} synthetic virus was created in 2002. Although somewhat of a misconception, {{it is not the}} actual virus that is synthesised, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a <b>DNA</b> <b>virus),</b> or a cDNA copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesise viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. , the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
25|$|Bat {{adenovirus}} TJM (Bt-AdV-TJM) {{is a novel}} {{species of}} the Mastadenovirus genus isolated from Myotis and Scotophilus kuhlii in China. It is a double stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>virus</b> with no RNA sequence. It is most {{closely related to the}} tree shrew and canine AdVs.|$|E
25|$|CPV2 is a non-enveloped {{single-stranded}} <b>DNA</b> <b>virus.</b> The {{name comes}} from the Latin parvus, meaning small, as the virus is only 20 to 26 nm in diameter. It has an icosahedral symmetry. The genome is about 5000 nucleotides long. CPV2 continues to evolve, {{and the success of}} new strains seems to depend on extending the range of hosts affected and improved binding to its receptor, the canine transferrin receptor. CPV2 has a high rate of evolution, possibly due to a rate of nucleotide substitution that is more like RNA viruses such as Influenzavirus A. In contrast, FPV seems to evolve only through random genetic drift.|$|E
50|$|The {{mutation}} {{rate in the}} genome has been estimated to be ~1.4 x 10−4 substitutions/site/year. This is considerably higher than the rate in the double stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses</b> and similar to that found in RNA viruses. It is also similar to the rate found in other single stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Megaviridae are a {{proposed}} family of double-stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses</b> {{that have not}} been recognized by the ICTV. The members of this proposed family are the <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses</b> with the largest known genomes. The classification of this group is ongoing but its members include Megavirus, Mimivirus, Phaeocystis globosa virus and Cafeteria roenbergensis virus.|$|R
50|$|These viruses {{consist of}} two types, however both share {{the fact that}} {{replication}} is primarily in the cytoplasm, and that replication is not as dependent on the cell cycle as that of <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> This class of viruses {{is also one of}} the most-studied types of viruses, alongside the double-stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses.</b>|$|R
25|$|An HPV {{infection}} {{is caused by}} human papillomavirus, a <b>DNA</b> <b>virus</b> from the papillomavirus family, of which over 170 types are known. More than 40 types are transmitted through sexual contact and infect the anus and genitals. Risk factors for persistent HPV infections include early age of first sexual intercourse, multiple partners, smoking, and poor immune function. HPV is typically spread by sustained direct skin-to-skin contact with vaginal and anal sex being the most common methods. Occasionally, it can spread from a mother to her baby during pregnancy. It does not spread via common items like toilet seats. People can become infected {{with more than one}} type of HPV. HPV only affects humans.|$|E
25|$|A Pap smear is {{performed}} by opening the vaginal canal with a speculum, then collecting cells at the outer {{opening of the}} cervix at the transformation zone (where the outer squamous cervical cells meet the inner glandular endocervical cells). The collected cells are examined under a microscope to look for abnormalities. The test aims to detect potentially pre-cancerous changes (called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cervical dysplasia; the squamous intraepithelial lesion system (SIL) {{is also used to}} describe abnormalities), which are caused by human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted <b>DNA</b> <b>virus.</b> The test remains an effective, widely used method for early detection of pre-cancer and cervical cancer. While the test may also detect infections and abnormalities in the endocervix and endometrium, it is not designed to do so.|$|E
25|$|HPV {{associated}} cancers {{are caused}} by high-risk strains of HPV, mainly HPV-16 and HPV-18. HPV is a small non-enveloped <b>DNA</b> <b>virus</b> of the papillomavirus family. Its genome encodes the early (E) oncoproteins E5, E6 and E7 and the late (L) capsid proteins L1 and L2. The virus gains access to the mucosa through microlesions, where it infects the basal layer of cells, which are still able to proliferate. While the virus does not replicate in these cells, expression of its early genes stimulates proliferation and lateral expansion of the basal cells. As this moves the virus particles into the overlying suprabasal layers, late viral gene expression occurs, enabling replication of the circular viral genome (see figure) and structural proteins. As these are pushed into the most superficial mucosal layers, complete viral particles are assembled and released.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background One {{important}} {{mechanism by}} which large <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses</b> increase their genome size is the addition of modules acquired from other viruses, host genomes or gene duplications. Phylogenetic analysis of large <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses,</b> especially using methods based on alignment, is often difficult due {{to the presence of}} horizontal gene transfer events. The recent composition vector approach, not sensitive to such events, is applied here to reconstruct the phylogeny of 124 large <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses.</b> Results The results are mostly consistent with the biologist's systematics with only a few outliers and can also provide some information for those unclassified viruses and cladistic relationships of several families. Conclusion With composition vector approach we obtained the phylogenetic tree of large <b>DNA</b> <b>viruses,</b> which not only give results comparable to biologist's systematics but also provide a new way for recovering the phylogeny of viruses. </p...|$|R

25|$|There is {{a diverse}} {{classification}} scheme {{for the various}} genomic changes that {{may contribute to the}} generation of cancer cells. Many of these changes are mutations, or changes in the nucleotide sequence of genomic DNA. There are also many epigenetic changes that alter whether genes are expressed or not expressed. Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is one genomic change that is not a mutation, and may involve either gain or loss of one or more chromosomes through errors in mitosis. Large-scale mutations involve the deletion or gain of a portion of a chromosome. Genomic amplification occurs when a cell gains many copies (often 20 or more) of a small chromosomal region, usually containing one or more oncogenes and adjacent genetic material. Translocation occurs when two separate chromosomal regions become abnormally fused, often at a characteristic location. A well-known example of this is the Philadelphia chromosome, or translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22, which occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and results in production of the BCR-abl fusion protein, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Small-scale mutations include point mutations, deletions, and insertions, which may occur in the promoter of a gene and affect its expression, or may occur in the gene's coding sequence and alter the function or stability of its protein product. Disruption of a single gene may also result from integration of genomic material from a <b>DNA</b> <b>virus</b> or retrovirus, and such an event may also result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its descendants.|$|E

[...] In a monogamous couple, a seronegative female runs a greater than 30% per year risk of contracting an HSV infection from a seropositive male partner. If an oral HSV-1 infection is contracted first, seroconversion will have occurred after 6 weeks to provide protective antibodies against a future genital HSV-1 infection.

500|$|A University of Montana and Montana State University team of {{scientists}} headed by Jerry Bromenshenk {{and working with the}} US Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center published a paper in October 2010 saying that a new <b>DNA</b> <b>virus,</b> invertebrate iridescent virus type 6 (IIV-6), and the fungus Nosema ceranae [...] were found in every killed colony the group studied. In their study, they found neither agent alone seemed deadly, but a combination of the virus and N. ceranae was always 100% fatal. Information about the study was released to the public in a front page article in The New York Times. A few days later, an article was published in Fortune Magazine with the title, [...] "What a scientist didn't tell the New York Times about his study on bee deaths". Professor of entomology at Penn State University James Frazier, who was researching the sublethal impact of pesticides on bees, said that while Bromenshenk's study generated some useful data, Bromenshenk has a conflict of interest as CEO of a company developing scanners to diagnose bee diseases. A few months later, the methods used to interpret the mass spectrometry data in the Bromenshenk study were called into question, raising doubts as to whether IIV-6 was ever correctly identified in any of the samples examined.|$|E

Zamilon is restricted in its range of helper viruses; it can be supported by viruses from [...] Mimivirus-like Mimiviridae lineages B and C, but not from lineage A.

Unlike the Sputnik virophage, Zamilon does not appear to impair the replication of its helper virus.|$|E

There were probably several such inclusion events. Besides the well-established endosymbiotic theory of the cellular origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts, there are theories that cells led to peroxisomes, spirochetes led to cilia and flagella, and that perhaps a <b>DNA</b> <b>virus</b> led to the cell nucleus, though none of them are widely accepted.|$|E
