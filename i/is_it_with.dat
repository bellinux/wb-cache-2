5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork. As described by Blatty, this new, updated edition features new and revised material. The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in {{it as part of}} an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, <b>is</b> <b>it.</b> <b>With</b> forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I would like to be remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E
500|$|Babe's baby farming {{secret was}} met with shock and disgust by viewers on Twitter. All About Soap said that Babe's illegal baby-selling {{business}} run from a [...] "grubby caravan in Ramsgate is pretty murky". Deen (Metro) said the storyline was [...] "one of [...] darkest storylines" [...] and praised the scenes where Babe set her caravan alight, writing, [...] "Like all good soap villains, Babe hit the self-destruct button in spectacular fashion, making her family believe (briefly) that she had perished inside the caravan fire." [...] Shelley (Daily Mail) was critical of Babe's excuse for baby farming, [...] "We were victims of our own success!", and struggled {{to understand why the}} Carter family invited Babe to live with them in Walford, describing it as [...] "inexplicable". He was disappointed that the week-long episodes had ended on a shot of Babe moving her marijuana plants and noted that it [...] "confirmed nothing much will have changed when she gets back home with the family." [...] Comparing the baby farming storyline and Abi's fake pregnancy, Brown (Radio Times) questioned Babe's [...] "baby-obessed" [...] nature, writing, [...] "what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> her keen interest in other people's newborns?".|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] “If a woman conceives,” Rabbi Levi {{said three}} things: [...] It is {{only natural that}} if a person has given into another’s keeping an ounce of silver in private, and the latter returns a pound of gold in public, the former will surely be {{grateful}} to the latter; and so <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> God. [...] Human beings entrust to God a drop of fluid in privacy, and God openly returns to them completed and perfected human beings. [...] Rabbi Levi said a second thing: [...] It is natural that, {{if a person is}} confined without attention to a chamber, and someone comes and kindles a light for the person there, the former should feel gratitude towards the latter. [...] So too <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> God. [...] When the embryo is in its mother’s womb, God causes a light to shine for it there with which it can see {{from one end of the}} world to the other. [...] Rabbi Levi said a third thing: [...] It is natural that, if a person is confined without attention to a chamber, and someone comes and releases the person and takes the person out from there, the former should feel gratitude to the latter. [...] Even so when the embryo is in its mother’s womb, God comes and releases it and brings it forth into the world.|$|E

He would attain Buddhahood (...) [...] For those who have made mistakes, if we see the harm we cause, we can still get by. But what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Thailand?

2500|$|The long {{obligatory}} prayer {{can be said}} anytime {{during the}} day. It includes a series of positions and movements from one position to the next, along with specific supplications. The prayer also includes parts where says the Greatest Name of God {{in the form of}} [...] "Allah-u-Abha" [...] at several points. About this prayer, Bahá'u'lláh has stated: [...] "...the long Obligatory Prayer should be said at those times when one feeleth himself in a prayerful mood. In truth, it hath been revealed in such wise that if it be recited to a rock, that rock would stir and speak forth; and if it be recited to a mountain, that mountain would move and flow. Well <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the one who reciteth it and fulfilleth God's precepts. Whichever prayer is read will suffice." [...] The text of the long obligatory prayer can be found in Bahá'u'lláh's Prayers and Meditations. This prayer is known in Arabic as salat and as namaz in Persian, and is similar to the Islamic salat.|$|E
