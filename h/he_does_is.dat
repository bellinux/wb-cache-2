5|$|After {{the school}} bus is destroyed, Homer is forced to drive several {{students}} to school. Along the way, he listens to a classic rock radio station and is shocked to discover {{that all of the}} kids hate it. After several more days of the kids hating his music, Homer visits a music store and realizes that what he likes is no longer considered cool. As a result, Homer decides to take Bart and Lisa to the Hullabalooza music festival. At the festival, Homer tries to act cool by wearing a Rastafarian hat, but all <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> humiliate himself and is confronted by an angry crowd of Generation Xers who mistake him for a narc. After being tossed out by the crowd, Homer angrily kicks a cannon, which shoots one of Peter Frampton's inflatable pigs at his stomach. The festival head is impressed and Homer is hired {{as a part of the}} festival's freak show.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Greek {{thought about}} poetry considered the theogonies {{to be the}} prototypical poetic genre—the prototypical mythos—and imputed almost magical powers to it. Orpheus, the archetypal poet, also was the archetypal singer of theogonies, which he uses to calm seas and storms in Apollonius' Argonautica, and to move the stony hearts of the underworld gods in his descent to Hades. When Hermes invents the lyre in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, the first thing <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> sing about {{the birth of the}} gods. Hesiod's Theogony is not only the fullest surviving account of the gods, but also the fullest surviving account of the archaic poet's function, with its long preliminary invocation to the Muses. Theogony also was the subject of many lost poems, including those attributed to Orpheus, Musaeus, Epimenides, Abaris, and other legendary seers, which were used in private ritual purifications and mystery-rites. There are indications that Plato was familiar with some version of the Orphic theogony. A silence would have been expected about religious rites and beliefs, however, and that nature of the culture would not have been reported by members of the society while the beliefs were held. After they ceased to become religious beliefs, few would have known the rites and rituals. Allusions often existed, however, to aspects that were quite public.|$|E

25|$|Lou has a tempestuous {{relationship}} with her children-in-law Kathy and Arthur, blaming Kathy for Pete's first divorce (something Lou regards as unnatural, despite her fervent dislike of Pat), and showing displeasure at Arthur's unemployment; nothing <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> ever good enough for her daughter Pauline. In February 1985, she is furious to discover that Pauline is pregnant for the third time, her family already financially crippled by Arthur's long stint of unemployment. Lou isn't adverse to speaking her mind or scolding her family if she disapproves of their actions, but she soon comes to celebrate her grandson Martin's (Jon Peyton Price) birth – although she would have preferred him to be named Albert after her late husband. She is a strict traditionalist and moralist but she believes in strong family-values most of all, and will defend her family if any outsider dares to criticise them. She provides a warm shoulder to cry on when 16-year-old Michelle finds out she is pregnant in late 1985 and is supportive of her favourite grandchild, Ian, on his plans {{to work within the}} catering trade rather than following in his father's footsteps in a more masculine occupation. Lou collapses in late 1985, prompting Dr Legg to send Lou into hospital for some tests and she is diagnosed with angina. The family have to make changes within the household to accommodate Lou's health problems, such as moving her bedroom downstairs, however, Lou doesn't take well to the changes.|$|E

Veteran catcher Luke Carlin said: They bring up Kipnis from Akron, {{and we look at}} this little guy and say, 'Where did he come from, and what is he doing here?' We were teasing him, and all <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> go out and hit about a million. I mean, here's this little infielder and they put him in the fifth spot ... What's that about?

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film an [...] "A-" [...] rating and praised it in [...] "The romanticism has a {{personal}} dimension – for Edward is, of course, Burton's surreal portrait of himself as an artist: a wounded child converting his private darkness into outlandish pop visions. Like Edward, he finds the light." [...] He also commented very positively on character of Edward, [...] "... who is Burton's purest achievement as a director so far." [...] Of Depp he wrote, [...] "Depp may not be doing that much acting beneath his neo-Kabuki makeup, but what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> tremulous and affecting." [...] As well as Eflman's score of the piece by saying it to be, [...] " [...] lovely, storybook score highlights the pop romanticism of Burton's conception.

500|$|Scenes showing Kristy McNichol innocently burying {{her hands}} in the dog's fur and his normal loving {{behavior}} when alone with her provides a stark image of [...] "how hatred can be familiar, reassuringly close." [...] J. Hoberman argues that the film [...] "naturalizes racism in an unnatural way" [...] in the contrasting depictions of white characters horrified by the dog's behavior, and black characters who grimly accept it as a fact of life. The film's ending has been argued to emphasize Fuller's own view that racism is something that is learned, but that once learned is a [...] "poison" [...] that can never truly [...] "be banished from those it infects." [...] But on the other hand, the dog is actually cured of attacking blacks, but not cured of his own hatred since the last thing <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> to attack a white man, and without being provoked into doing so at that. The ending implies therefore that it is hatred (and not racism) that cannot be banished from those it infects.|$|E

500|$|The Eagles {{finished}} the 2004 {{season with a}} 13–3 record and earned a trip to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they were to play the AFC Champion New England Patriots. During the week {{leading up to the}} game, Mitchell sat for a short ESPN interview conducted by Dan Patrick. [...] Asked to identify the members of the Patriots' secondary, Mitchell claimed he did not know them by name, only by number, and then deliberately stated each of their numbers incorrectly. Finally, he said he [...] "had something" [...] for safety Rodney Harrison. Harrison responded by calling Mitchell a [...] "jerk." [...] Normally tight-lipped coach Patriots head coach Bill Belichick later said of Mitchell, [...] "ll <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> talk. [...] He's terrible, and you can print that. [...] I was happy {{when he was in the}} game." [...] Mitchell caught only one pass for 11yards in the 24–21 loss. After the Super Bowl, Mitchell continued to sound off in interviews in which he criticized the Patriots, as well as Belichick, saying that the way the Patriots reacted reminded him of [...] "little girls." ...|$|E
500|$|Western {{critics have}} also {{directed}} significant praise towards Spike. In {{his review of}} Cowboy Bebop, Anime News Network's Mike Crandol praised the character portrayals, especially Spike's, stating that [...] "Spike's character in particular runs the gamut from goofy to blasé to teeth-gnashing tough; {{he is one of}} most three-dimensional anime leads in recent memory." [...] Christi of THEM Anime Review 4.0 complimented Spike's story arc in the series, saying that [...] "the underlying theme of Spike Spiegel and his motivations for what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> absolutely intriguing." [...] DVDTalk's Kyle Mills called Spike the epitome of a good lead protagonist, referring to him as [...] "composed, always cool, and is essentially the ultimate badass", although his true nature is gradually shown throughout the series. In an article in The Atlantic, writer Alex Suskind was positive about Spike's portrayal and development, saying that the word [...] "cool" [...] was the most apt way of describing him and referring to him as [...] "a space-age samurai-cum-Marlboro Man". Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku, writing a retrospective on the series, praised the relationship between Spike and Faye, especially the way it evolved through the series without overt verbal expressions of affection.|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

500|$|The {{captain of}} Serenity is Malcolm [...] "Mal" [...] Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and the episode [...] "Serenity" [...] {{establishes}} that {{the captain and}} his first mate Zoe Washburne, née Alleyne (Gina Torres) are veteran [...] "Browncoats" [...] of the Unification War, a failed attempt by the outlying worlds to resist the Alliance's control. A later episode, [...] "Out of Gas", reveals that Mal bought the spaceship Serenity to continue living beyond Alliance control. Much of the crew's work consists of cargo runs or smuggling. A main story arc centers on River Tam (Summer Glau) and her brother Simon (Sean Maher). River is a child prodigy, whose brain was subjected to experiments {{at the hands of}} Alliance scientists at a secret government institution. As a result, she displays symptoms of schizophrenia and often hears voices. It is later revealed that she is a [...] "reader", one who possesses telepathic abilities. Simon gave up a career as a highly successful trauma surgeon in an Alliance hospital to rescue her, and they are both wanted fugitives. In the original pilot, [...] "Serenity", Simon joins the crew as a paying passenger with River smuggled on board as cargo. As Whedon states in an episodic DVD commentary, every show <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> about creating family. By the last episode, [...] "Objects in Space", the fractured character of River has finally become whole, partly because the others decided to accept her into their [...] "family" [...] on the ship.|$|E
500|$|When Fenmore {{and female}} {{character}} Summer Newman (Hunter King) were rapidly aged to teenagers {{at the same}} time, Deanna Barnert of MSN Entertainment previewed: [...] "These two kids may learn {{about some of the}} insane things their parents have done – as fans know, that says a lot!" [...] She also wrote that given who their parents are, [...] "that can only mean trouble". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: [...] "Everything <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>is</b> for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that." [...] In another interview, he stated of their relationship: [...] "I think Fen’s first love is Summer; he falls in love; he’s infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it’s going is – will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he’s still the same kid, it’s just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase." [...] Tracey Bregman (who portrays his mother Lauren) stated that she [...] "was always hoping they would show the dark side of our child, because both Lauren and Michael have dark sides. That is something they both work hard on to suppress, that comes out now and them." [...] Christian LeBlanc (who portrays his father Michael) stated Michael has [...] "troubled youth to deal with", saying: [...] "It’s the first time on Y that such a young storyline has pulled such focus. It’s going to be really fascinating. The whole family gets drawn in. The trouble with Fenmore affects Lauren and Michael. [...] rippling effect, like every good story." [...] The character was later involved in a cyberbullying storyline with Summer and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo). Michael Logan of TV Guide previewed the storyline, writing: [...] "Adding fuel to the fire is young Fen Baldwin (Max Ehrich), who is so infatuated with Summer that he becomes her partner in crime — in fact, he takes things a few dangerous steps further once he sees Summer's growing fondness for Jamie." [...] Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: [...] "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone. To have a storyline that addresses it, it’s like, [...] "This is real; this is what happens". People need to know the truth {{of what is going on}} out there." ...|$|E
