25|$|In a 2006 interview, Ristar {{designer}} Akira Nishino said:Will Ristar come back? Probably not. Of course, {{as a game}} developer, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it happen. At {{the time}} of the original, I was thinking of a sequel. It got as far as a character design for that sequel, but it didn't happen for various reasons. But since fans have a say in such matters, your input is greatly appreciated.|$|E
500|$|Yahoo! Voices {{wrote that}} Stevens [...] {{in the third}} season [...] "has become more condescending and passive {{aggressive}} herself, more than anyone else." [...] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.|$|E
500|$|Loeb talked {{further on}} the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of {{scheduling}} by saying [...] "if I'm shooting a television series and that's {{going to go on}} over a six-month or eight-month period, how am I going to get [...] {{to be able to go}} be in a movie?" [...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 25, 2012, Mase {{featured}} alongside Diddy on Wale's [...] "Slight Work" [...] remix, {{marking the}} first {{appearance of the}} Harlem rapper on record since 2010. Rumors began to start that Mase, as well as singer Omarion, were both signing to Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group. It was later revealed that Bad Boy artist French Montana was the reason Mase was making his third comeback. According to Montana, Mase is serving as an A representative on Montana's forthcoming Bad Boy debut, [...] "Excuse My French," [...] as well as appearing on the remix of Montana's [...] "Everything's a Go." [...] "I'm not sure what kind of decisions he's going to make," [...] Montana says, [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him in my camp." [...] Mase is currently resigned to Bad Boy Records but has yet to announce whether he is resigned {{as part of a}} joint venture deal between Bad Boy and MMG.

2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them." ...|$|E
