5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles were <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid.</b> Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first}} to distinguish between the cerebrum and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound of {{the thyroid}} {{may be used}} to reveal whether {{structures}} are solid or <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid,</b> helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. It may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy may be taken concurrently of thyroid tissue to determine the nature of a lesion. These biopsies are then sent for histopathology and cytology. When further imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan may take place. This can determine {{the size and shape of}} lesions, reveal whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{a ring of}} four ganglia, {{positioned}} around the rhynchocoel near its front end. At least a pair of ventral nerve cords connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. Most nemerteans have various chemoreceptors, and on their heads some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli. These ocelli can detect light but can not form an image. Nemerteans respire through the skin. They have at least two lateral vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop, and these and the rhynchocoel are <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid.</b> There is no heart, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of muscles in the vessels and the body wall. To filter out soluble waste products, flame cells are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels, and remove the wastes through a network of pipes to the outside.|$|E

25|$|Ultrasonographic {{examination}} can {{be useful}} in evaluating questionable asymptomatic kidney tumours and cystic renal lesions if Computed Tomography imaging is inconclusive. This safe and non-invasive radiologic procedure uses high frequency sound waves to generate an interior image of the body on a computer monitor. The image generated by the ultrasound can help diagnose renal cell carcinoma based on the differences of sound reflections on the surface of organs and the abnormal tissue masses. Essentially, ultrasound tests can determine whether the composition of the kidney mass is mainly solid or <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid.</b>|$|E
500|$|At birth, the baby's lungs are <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid</b> {{secreted}} by {{the lungs}} {{and are not}} inflated. After birth the infant's central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature and environment. This triggers the first breath, within about 10 seconds after delivery. Before birth, the lungs are filled with fetal lung fluid. [...] After the first breath, the fluid is quickly absorbed into the body or exhaled. The resistance in the lung's blood vessels decreases giving an increased surface area for gas exchange, and the lungs begins to breathe spontaneously. This accompanies other changes which result in an increased amount of blood entering the lung tissues.|$|E
500|$|The side {{protection}} system incorporated five compartments divided by torpedo bulkheads {{and a large}} anti-torpedo bulge that {{ran the length of}} the [...] "armored raft". The outer two compartments, the innermost compartment and the bulge would remain empty, while the third and fourth compartments would be filled with liquid. The system was reduced in depth at either end by the forward and rear gun turrets. In these areas, the fifth compartment was deleted; instead, there was an outer empty compartment and two liquid-filled spaces, backed by another empty compartment. To compensate for the reduced underwater protection system, these sections received additional armor plating, up to [...] in thickness. The complete system was designed to withstand warheads of up to [...] of TNT. Underwater protection was rounded out by a triple bottom that was [...] deep. The bottom layer was [...] thick and was kept <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid,</b> while the upper [...] thick layer was kept empty. The triple bottom was also heavily subdivided to prevent catastrophic flooding should the upper layer be penetrated.|$|E
50|$|Pneumonia {{can cause}} {{respiratory}} failure by triggering {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome (ARDS), which results {{from a combination of}} infection and inflammatory response. The lungs quickly <b>fill</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid</b> and become stiff. This stiffness, combined with severe difficulties extracting oxygen due to the alveolar fluid, may require long periods of mechanical ventilation for survival.|$|R

50|$|When {{the space}} between the pleurae starts to <b>fill</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid,</b> as in pleural effusion, the chest pain can be eased but a {{shortness}} of breath can result, since the lungs need room to expand during breathing. Some cases of pleuritic chest pain are idiopathic, which means that the exact cause cannot be determined.|$|R
2500|$|Surgical {{drainage}} (tendon splitting) of core lesion {{tissue is}} controversial, but likely has some benefit {{in the early}} phases where the tear is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid.</b> [...] Once the lesion has granulated, this procedure is of questionable benefit.|$|E
2500|$|So, {{this theory}} {{is found to}} be {{unsatisfactory}} as an explanation of drag on a body moving through a fluid. [...] Although it can be applied to so-called cavity flows where, instead of a wake <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid,</b> a vacuum cavity is assumed to exist behind the body.|$|E
2500|$|Pilocytic astrocytoma are Grade I tumors. They are {{considered}} benign and slow growing tumors. Pilocytic astrocytomas frequently have cystic portions <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid</b> and a nodule, {{which is the}} solid portion. Most {{are located in the}} cerebellum. [...] Therefore, most symptoms are related to balance or coordination difficulties. [...] They also occur more frequently in children and teens.|$|E

2500|$|The second autopsy was {{performed}} in Mexico City where an FBI forensics expert was to observe the autopsy. Toxicology reports showed that True had a higher than normal blood alcohol level {{at the time of}} his death and [...] detected trace amounts of aminovalerico, which is an over-the-counter derivative of a local plant used as a stimulant in the Sierra. True could have used this medication to suppress the effects of high altitude and low temperatures. An injury not located in the first autopsy report was a blow to the back, behind his right lung, which could have caused True to lose consciousness and to stop breathing while his lungs <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid.</b> The report could also be interpreted as a fall caused the blunt trauma.|$|E
2500|$|The main symptom is pain, causing loss {{of ability}} and often stiffness. [...] "Pain" [...] is {{generally}} described as a sharp ache or a burning sensation in the associated muscles and tendons, and is typically made worse by prolonged activity and relieved by rest. Stiffness is most common in the morning, and typically lasts less than thirty minutes after beginning daily activities, but may return after periods of inactivity. Osteoarthritis can cause a crackling noise (called [...] "crepitus") when the affected joint is moved or touched and people may experience muscle spasms and contractions in the tendons. Occasionally, the joints may also be <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid.</b> Some people report increased pain associated with cold temperature, high humidity, or a drop in barometric pressure, but studies have had mixed results.|$|E
2500|$|Most insects breath passively {{through their}} spiracles (special {{openings}} in the exoskeleton) and the air reaches {{every part of the}} body by means of a series of smaller and smaller tubes called 'trachaea' when their diameters are relatively large, and 'tracheoles' when their diameters are very small. The tracheoles make contact with individual cells throughout the body. They are partially <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid,</b> which can be withdrawn from the individual tracheoles when the tissues, such as muscles, [...] are active and have a high demand for oxygen, bringing the air closer to the active cells. This is probably brought about by the buildup of lactic acid in the active muscles causing an osmotic gradient, moving the water out of the tracheoles and into the active cells. [...] Diffusion of gases is effective over small distances but not over larger ones, {{this is one of the}} reasons insects are all relatively small. Insects which do not have spiracles and trachaea, such as some Collembola, breathe directly through their skins, also by diffusion of gases.|$|E

50|$|In 1822, he {{discovered}} the critical point of a substance in his famous cannon barrel experiments. Listening to discontinuities in {{the sound of a}} rolling flint ball in a sealed cannon <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluids</b> at various temperatures, he observed the critical temperature. Above this temperature, the densities of the liquid and gas phases become equal and the distinction between them disappears, resulting in a single supercritical fluid phase.|$|R
60|$|The {{remains of}} the yelk, which {{have not yet been}} applied to the {{nutrition}} and growth of the young animal, are contained in a sac attached to the rudimentary intestine, and termed the yelk sac, or 'umbilical vesicle.' Two membranous bags, intended to subserve respectively the protection and nutrition of the young creature, have been developed from the skin and from the under and hinder surface of the body; the former, the so-called 'amnion,' is a sac <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid,</b> which invests the whole body of the embryo, and plays the part of a sort of water-bed for it; the other, termed the 'allantois,' grows out, loaded with blood-vessels, from the ventral region, and eventually applying itself to the walls of the cavity, in which the developing organism is contained, enables these vessels to become the channel by which the stream of nutriment, required to supply the wants of the offspring, is furnished to it by the parent.|$|E
60|$|In certain animals {{belonging}} to {{every one of}} the chief groups into which the Metazoa are divisible, the cells of the cell-aggregate which results from the process of yelk-division, and which is termed a morula, diverge from one another in such a manner as to give rise to a central space, around which they dispose themselves as a coat or envelope; and thus the morula becomes a vesicle <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid,</b> the planula. The wall of the planula is next pushed in on one side, or invaginated, whereby it is converted into a double-walled sac with an opening, the blastopore, which leads into the cavity lined by the inner wall. This cavity is the primitive alimentary cavity or archenteron; the inner or invaginated layer is the hypoblast; the outer the epiblast; and the embryo, in this stage, is termed a gastrula. In all the higher animals a layer of cells makes its appearance between the hypoblast and the epiblast, and is termed the mesoblast. In the further course of development the epiblast becomes the ectoderm or epidermic layer of the body; the hypoblast becomes the epithelium of the middle portion of the alimentary canal; and the mesoblast gives rise to all the other tissues, except the central nervous system, which originates from an ingrowth of the epiblast.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{scarcely}} possible to avoid comparing the eye with a telescope. We {{know that this}} instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right {{to assume that the}} Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with spaces <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid,</b> and with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different distances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form. Further we must suppose that there is a power, represented by natural selection or the survival of the fittest, always intently watching each slight alteration in the transparent layers; and carefully preserving each which, under varied circumstances, in any way or degree, tends to produce a distincter image. We must suppose each new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; each to be preserved until a better is produced, and then the old ones to be all destroyed. In living bodies, variation will cause the slight alteration, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement. Let this process go on for millions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of man? ...|$|E

50|$|Pulmonary {{shunting}} is minimized by {{the normal}} reflex constriction of pulmonary vasculature to hypoxia. Without this hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, shunt and its hypoxic effects would worsen. For example, when alveoli <b>fill</b> <b>with</b> <b>fluid,</b> {{they are unable}} to participate in gas exchange with blood, causing local or regional hypoxia, thus triggering vasoconstriction. Blood is then redirected away from this area, which poorly matches ventilation and perfusion, to areas which are being ventilated.|$|R
