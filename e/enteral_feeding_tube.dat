40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between the}} auscultation test and X-ray when detecting the position of an <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube.</b> Methods: cross-sectional study in an intensive care unit in southern Brazil, in 2011. Clinical nurse and nurse researcher performed auscultation test recording the impressions regarding the placement of an <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> in 80 patients. A doctor evaluated the X-ray. Kappa coefficient and PABAK reviewed the agreements. Results: The X-ray showed that 70 % of the enteral tubes were in the stomach, 27. 4 % in the duodenum, 1. 3 % in the esophagus, and 1. 3 % in the right lung. There was a weak correlation between clinical nurses and nurse researchers (PABAK = 0. 054; P = 0. 103), clinical nurses and X-rays (PABAK = 0. 188; P = 0. 111) and nurse researchers and X-rays (PABAK = 0. 128; P = 0. 107).

Methods One hundred and twenty-nine tubes were collected from two neonatal intensive care units (NICU). A questionnaire on feeding regime was completed with each sample. Enterobacteriaceae present in the tubes were identified using conventional and molecular methods, and their antibiograms determined. Results The neonates were fed breast milk (16 %), fortified breast milk (28 %), ready to feed formula (20 %), reconstituted powdered infant formula (PIF, 6 %), or a mixture of these (21 %). Eight percent of tubes were received from neonates who were 'nil by mouth'. Organisms were isolated from 76 % of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> as a biofilm (up to 10 7 cfu/tube from neonates fed fortified breast milk and reconstituted PIF) and in the residual lumen liquid (up to 10 7 Enterobacteriaceae cfu/ml, average volume 250 μl). The most common isolates were Enterobacter cancerogenus (41 %), Serratia marcescens (36 %), E. hormaechei (33 %), Escherichia coli (29 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (25 %), Raoultella terrigena (10 %), and S. liquefaciens (12 %). Other organisms isolated included C. sakazakii (2 %), Yersinia enterocolitica (1 %), Citrobacter freundii (1 %), E. vulneris (1 %), Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 %), and P. luteola (1 %). The <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> were in place between 48 h (13 %).

Biofilm formation did not correlate with capsule production, and was not inhibited on silver-impregnated tubing. Bacteria grew in the tube lumen to cell densities of 107 cfu/ml within 8 h, and 109 cfu/ml within 24 h.

40|$|Abstract — Drug therapy may be {{complicated}} in hospitalized patients receiving nutrition via enteral feeding tubes. Dosage form selection and appropriate administration methods are crucial {{in patients with}} feeding tubes. Although hospitalized patients receive nutritional support through various routes, oral nutrition is preferred. Enteral or parenteral nutrition may be used if oral intake is inadequate or inadvisable. Patients with functional gastrointestinal tracts usually receive enteral nutrition. Administering oral medications through the <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> can lead to complications like tube clogging or decreased drug activity. However, drug therapy need not be compromised in patients receiving enteral nutrition. Careful selection and preparation of dosage forms reduces the complications of medication administration. Flushing the feeding tube and screening for drug incompatibilities decreases the incidence of tube clogging and replacement.

Since the majority of these patients tend to be fairly ill and unable to stand for upright abdominal radiographs, in the setting of percutaneous feeding tubes, decubitus abdominal radiographs should always be obtained.

40|$|Malnutrition {{is common}} in {{patients}} with acute and chronic illness. Nutritional management of these malnourished patients {{is an essential part}} of healthcare. <b>Enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> is one component of nutritional support. It is the preferred method of nutritional support in patients that are not receiving adequate oral nutrition and have a functioning gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This method of nutritional support has undergone progression over recent times. The method of placement of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> has evolved due to development of new <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> and endoscopic technology. <b>Enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> can be divided into methods that provide short-term and long-term access to the GIT. This review article focuses on the current range of methods of gaining access to the GIT to provide <b>enteral</b> <b>feed...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background. Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the acceleration of a hyperfractionated, concurrent chemoradiation regimen (HxCRT) for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods. Patients with unresectable HNSCC were treated based on a previously published HxCRT regimen: 1. 25 Gy twice daily to 70 Gy concurrent with cisplatin 12 mg/m 2 /day and 5 -fluorouracil 600 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days, weeks 1, 5. This regimen was accelerated in this series by shortening the treatment from 7 to 6 weeks by omitting the planned mid-treatment 1 -week break. Results. Forty-six patients with T 3 - 4 /N 3 disease were treated. The main acute toxicity was pharyngeal. Median weight change during therapy in patients with and without <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> was − 3. 8 % and − 7. 9 %, respectively (p =. 08). Fifteen percent had late grade III pharyngeal toxicity. Local/regional and distant failure rates were 28 % and 17 %, respectively; 52 % are alive without evidence of disease. Conclusions. In nonresectable HNSCC, acceleration of the HxCRT regimen is feasible, requiring <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes</b> during therapy in most patients. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|This study {{examines}} 2 physiochemical properties of liquid medications: osmolality and pH. Since liquid medications {{are often used}} concurrently in patients requiring nutrition products through <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes,</b> the study also looks at the com-patibility of liquid medication with enteral nutrition. Osmolality of oral liquid medications {{has been linked to}} causing diarrhea in the <b>feeding</b> <b>tube</b> patient. The clinician can use the data col-lected here to calculate the appropriate dilution of the medica-tion and improve patient outcome. The acidic pH of liquid medications has been linked to the formation of precipitates, when combined with <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> formulas. The informa-tion presented here will alert the clinician to use appropriate flushing before and after drug administration {{to reduce the risk of}} obstructing <b>feeding</b> <b>tubes...</b>|$|R
