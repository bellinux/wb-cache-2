50|$|The first {{structure}} and oldest {{is the current}} departures terminal. This terminal stretches from gates 11-13. Before the 2000-2006 expansion project, the original single terminal building housed both the arrivals and <b>departures</b> <b>facilities.</b> The former layout was divided in two with a few duty-free shops and an open-air area in the middle with trees and other greenery which was open to both halves of the terminal. The new translucent membrane that towers over the airport shows where the old terminal was split in two. Additionally the membrane tent covers {{the gap between the}} old and new terminal and gives the appearance of being a single long building.|$|E

30|$|To assist {{designers}} {{to think in}} more nuanced ways about the design of soft wearables-in all of their complexity-we describe in detail the kinds of decisions that we have found to be important to consider. We analyse a series of design projects undertaken in parallel with the same point of <b>departure,</b> <b>facilities</b> and skillsets. These cases demonstrate and articulate a framework for understanding wearables, focused on context and personal meaning-making. Our findings advocate moving the design process from the technologically oriented ‘drawing board’ to a full immersion in context. Doing so necessarily displaces out-of-the-box thinking for inside-of-the-box thinking. It demands direct engagement with the constraints that come from context, the performing body, material properties and functionality, enabling {{designers to}} frame ‘meaningful’ design opportunities.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{rivalry between}} transport facilities {{in a model}} that includes two sources of horizontal differentiation: geographical space and departure time. We explore how both sources influence facility fees {{and the price of}} the service offered by downstream carriers. Travellers' costs include a fare, a transportation cost to the facility and a schedule delay cost, which captures the monetary cost of departing earlier or later than desired. One carrier operates at each facility and schedules a single departure time. The interactions in the facility-carrier model are represented as a sequential three-stage game in fees, times and fares with simultaneous choices at each stage. We find that duopolis-tic competition leads to an identical departure time across carriers when their operational cost does not vary with the time of day, but generally leads to distinct service times when this cost is time dependent. When a facility possesses a location advantage, it can set a higher fee and its downstream carrier can charge a higher fare. Departure time differentiation allows the facilities and their carrier to compete along an additional differentiation dimension that can reduce or strengthen the advantage in location. By incorporating the downstream carriers into the analysis, we also find that a higher per passenger commercial revenue at one facility induces a lower fee charged by both facilities to their carrier and a lower fare charged by both carriers at their <b>departure</b> <b>facility,</b> while a lower marginal operational cost for one carrier implies a higher fee at its <b>departure</b> <b>facility,</b> a lower fee at the other facility served by the rival carrier and a lower fare at both facilities.

50|$|On 4 November 2008, Bridgepoint Capital {{announced}} their £28 million plans to redevelop the airport terminal. Planning permission was submitted to Leeds City Council in late November 2008. The plans involve building {{in front of}} the current terminal building, effectively turning the current crescent-shaped building into a semicircle. As the current terminal buildings are the product of 40 years of extensions, there is no continuity to the layout and the buildings can become very congested. The extension would be set over two stories and would facilitate new <b>departure</b> and arrival <b>facilities.</b> The ground floor will house new check-in halls, while on the first floor there will be a large departure lounge, featuring a glass roof. Both arrival and <b>departure</b> <b>facilities</b> will benefit from new retail facilities as the management claimed that current facilities were 'inadequate and unenticing'. It is estimated that with the completion of the airport extension and the forecast new flights, an extra 2,000 jobs will be generated at the airport. Since 2008 the redevelopment plans have remained largely unchanged, however the proposed external appearance of the building has changed, being clad in black instead of the white cladding that had initially been proposed.|$|R
30|$|Maximizing {{accessibility}} at critical hubs is {{a critical}} factor in increasing market share and a major driver of competitive advantage (de la Torre, 1999). Air differs from ocean carriers in that only the transportation asset and arrival <b>departure</b> <b>facilities</b> need to be common, e.g., airplanes and airports). Air traffic must also follow a very controlled set of routes, altitudes, and landing patterns coordinated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US. Routes of aircraft and available airport gate space limit the supply of aircraft at major airports. Major airlines are subject to complementary asset requirements at a limited number of airports with adequate runway length, terminal capacity and associated investments in services, security, and even infrastructure for ground transportation. Airlines compete on frequency and timing as well as passenger amenities. For air freight, the competition will be around transit times, loading and unloading performance, and surface delivery vehicles to perform the ground portion of the services offered.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{descriptions}} of export trends are needed so industry representatives, analysts, policymakers, and business owners can properly assess market conditions.

This volume includes data on both exports and imports, as well as a new section describing how those shipments are transported from <b>departure</b> <b>facilities</b> in Washington to ports of exit. Washington increased exports again in 2014, reaching an all-time high. Once again, the increase in statewide exports is due almost exclusively to an increase in exports from the aerospace industry. Changes in how agricultural producers shipped goods to international ports in 2015 suggest there may be differences in trade patterns in 2016, showing the importance of the transportation network within Washington for international trade...|$|R

500|$|On 20 November 2003, Notodden Airport {{was closed}} for all {{scheduled}} traffic by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, due to a not conforming with safety requirements. Bergen Air Transport was forced to reroute all its aircraft to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Following an investment of NOK 500,000 from the airline and NOK 1.2 million from the municipality, scheduled services could commence. The municipality had ambitions to upgrade the airport to a higher standard, which would allow it to serve charter aircraft weighing more than [...] and with more than nine passengers. The plans were abandoned after 11 neighboring municipalities rejected giving grants for the necessary technical upgrades. Notodden Municipality instead started a program to increase {{the popularity of the}} airport by targeting companies in the neighboring municipality of Kongsberg to encourage use of the airport, instead of going to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Another NOK250,000 was invested from 1 October 2004 to keep meet safety requirements. Starting in October 2004, security control was introduced.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of air {{transport}} recently observed in Brazil, several airports are experiencing demands that affect the level of service of passenger terminals. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the level of service offered in the passenger terminal of a regional airport. The case studied was the airport of Ribeirão Preto, in the state of São Paulo. The assessment was done with the method developed by Medeiros (2004), in two periods of time: the current situation (i. e., the actual demand in 2010) and the year 2015. The results have shown that the current levels of service of the terminal components assessed (which include since <b>departure</b> and arrival <b>facilities</b> until toilets) are predominantly Regular or Insufficient, with 69 % of the components in either one of those classifications. However, despite the substantial demand growth anticipated for the near future, the evaluation conducted for 2015 does not indicate a significant deterioration of the level of service in the passenger terminal. A possible explanation for that is the relatively low overall level of service already offered today...|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} an {{analytical}} cross-sectional design to identify risk {{factors associated with}} delays in care seeking among women admitted in life-threatening conditions to a maternity hospital in Herat, Afghanistan, from February 2007 to January 2008. Disease-specific criteria of ‘near-miss’ were used to identify women in life-threatening conditions. Among 472 eligible women and their husbands, 411 paired interviews were conducted, and information on socio-demographic factors; the woman's status and social resources; the husband's social networks; health care accessibility and utilization; care-seeking costs; and community characteristics were obtained. Decision and departure delays were assessed quantitatively from reported timings of symptom recognition, care-seeking decision, and <b>departure</b> for health <b>facilities.</b> Censored normal regression analyses suggest that although determinants of decision delay were influenced by the nature and symptoms of complications, uptake of antenatal care (ANC) and the birth plan reduced decision delay {{at the time of}} the obstetric emergency. Access to care and social networks reduced departure delay. Programmatic efforts may be directed towards exploiting the roles of ANC and social resources in facilitating access to emergency obstetric care...|$|R

Later the 2005 International terminal was joined to Terminal A, making the total area of the terminal 35,000 m² and the capacity of 1600 pax/hour. The terminal is 2 floors in height. The ground floor contains check-in desks, baggage claim areas (with carousels), currency exchange centers, a staff room, and several coffee shops. The second floor has several restaurants, including Grenki Pub, a children's nursery room, and the domestic business lounge which opened on June 13, 2013. The lounge is accessible by passengers with business class tickets or for a fine of 1960 rubles. The terminal has 5 jet bridges and several other bus gates. renovations to the domestic terminal were made as early as of February 18, 2014, with the stylistic and congestion reductional changes. The renovations began in 2012 with NefaResearch design studies winning the bid for the reconstruction, with Phase I completed on December 27, 2012, and Phase II on February 18, 2014.

50|$|The {{construction}} of the fortress resulted in an enormous economic upturn for the town, which was later paid for however with the <b>departure</b> of public <b>facilities</b> such as the court (Hofgericht) and county council (Kreisregierung). The Austrian lieutenant colonel, Georg Eberle was appointed as the senior fortress construction engineer and almost all the management staff were from Austria. The large number of construction workers employed (in 1844 4,000) made the expansion of municipal infrastructure (police and medical services) necessary, the financing of which caused disputes between the town, the grand duchy and federal military authorities. The majority of the construction stone came from a roughly 500-metre-long bunter sandstone quarry on the hill of Eichelberg near Oberweier and was transported to Rastatt on a 14.5-kilometre-long, horse-drawn wagonway, its capacity being 400 cubic metres per day. In the quarry 400-1200 workers were employed, for whom a special hutted camp was built. In addition to locals, there were workers from Württemberg, Austria, South Tyrol and Italy. It was planned to complete the construction in 1849, but this {{did not come to}} fruition due to financial problems and the intervention of the Baden Revolution.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{overview}} of pending rules governing residual radioactive release criteria and radioactive waste management, and the potential impact of these rules on the Fernald Scrap Metal program. More than 300, 000 cubic meters of radioactively contaminated waste will be generated during the dismantlement of three complexes at the Fernald Site over the next year and a half. Under current regulations, as much as 70 % (5, 000 tons) of steel will be either recycled or re-used in controlled applications. Depending on regulatory developments, the ratios of recycling to burial will range from 100 % burial to recycling more than 90 % of the waste. The absence of federal rules and regulations for classification of permissible levels of residual radioactivity is one of the most troublesome issues in the nuclear industry. The issue is growing in importance with the approaching end of useful life for many nuclear power generating stations and the planned remediation of the DOE nuclear weapons complex. Federal regulators have been involved in the {open_quotes}Enhanced rulemaking{close_quotes} process for over two years. The DOE Fernald site offers a good opportunity for understanding the potential impacts of the pending residual radioactivity regulations due to the maturity of the planned D&D activities, aggressive recycling program, and simple nature of contamination. The Fernald experience may offer a point of <b>departure</b> for many <b>facilities</b> engaged in D&D and waste management...|$|R
40|$|Question: What is {{the body}} {{temperature}} response of healthy pregnant women exercising at moderate intensity in an aqua-aerobics class where the water temperature is {{in the range of}} 28 to 33 degrees Celsius, as typically found in community swimming pools? Design: An observational study. Participants: One hundred and nine women {{in the second and third}} trimester of pregnancy who were enrolled in a standardised aqua-aerobics class. Outcome measures: Tympanic temperature was measured at rest pre-immersion (T 1), after 35  minutes of moderate-intensity aqua-aerobic exercise (T 2), after a further 10  minutes of light exercise while still in the water (T 3) and finally on <b>departure</b> from the <b>facility</b> (T 4). The range of water temperatures in seven indoor community pools was 28. 8 to 33. 4 degrees Celsius. Results: Body temperature increased by a mean of 0. 16 degrees Celsius (SD 0. 35, p <  0. 001) at T 2, was maintained at this level at T 3 and had returned to pre-immersion resting values at T 4. Regression analysis demonstrated that the temperature response was not related to the water temperature (T 2 r = – 0. 01, p = 0. 9; T 3 r = – 0. 02, p =  0. 9; T 4 r =  0. 03, p =  0. 8). Analysis of variance demonstrated no difference in body temperature response between participants when grouped in the cooler, medium and warmer water temperatures (T 2 F =  0. 94, p =  0. 40; T 3 F =  0. 93, p =  0. 40; T 4 F =  0. 70, p =  0. 50). Conclusions: Healthy pregnant women maintain body temperatures within safe limits during moderate-intensity aqua-aerobic exercise conducted in pools heated up to 33 degrees Celsius. The study provides evidence to inform guidelines for safe water temperatures for aqua-aerobic exercise during pregnancy.

40|$|As cities {{worldwide}} grow, their residents {{must be able}} {{to traverse}} urban space in order to access employment, social services, recreation, and other critical activities. Urban accessibility reflects the ease of such access with respect to locations within a city, and it is largely dependent on the city's land use and transport systems. A variety of urban accessibility metrics have been proposed to guide urban policy and planning, but they have not been implemented systematically. Better understood and more widely adopted accessibility measures could help guide complex land use and multimodal transportation planning processes toward more eective and equitable outcomes. Such measures represent a signicant <b>departure</b> from the <b>facility,</b> maintenance, and mobility priorities that dominate transportation planning today, opening possibilities for new approaches. In particular, a clearer focus on accessibility could help prioritize and inform the design of bus rapid transit (BRT) projects, which tend to include dierent potential streetscape, transport, and network improvement options across a wide range of geographic and temporal scales. This thesis aims to develop a participatory framework built on an open-source, web-based toolkit that transit advocates and planners can use to visualize how urban design and operational characteristics of dierent incremental BRT scenarios might affect access at a personal level and accessibility at a regional level. Such visualizations can encompass the interaction of these scenarios with pedestrian, local bus, and rail connectivity, as well as regional land use. Built on Open Trip Planner Analyst and other web-based civic engagement platforms, as well as open data such as transit information in the general transit feed specification (GTFS) format, this toolkit is applied to transit performance and accessibility for example projects in two contexts, Boston and Santiago de Chile. Focus groups with transit advocates and planners were conducted in these two settings to evaluate the proposed toolkit. Members of community-based transit advocacy organizations found the toolkit to be both understandable and able to represent some of their key concerns; professional planners thought the toolkit could help them better understand existing operations and proposed projects. These evaluations suggest that the participatory framework developed around this toolkit could be an eective platform for dialogue between planners and community organizations. By connecting individual perspectives on access with broader accessibility metrics, this framework has the potential to build political will for the adoption of equitable accessibility indicators as decision-making metrics. by Anson F.
