[...] Lowering the dam by as much as 0.9 meter (3ft) and failing to replace the discharge pipes {{at the base of the}} dam cut in half the safe <b>discharge</b> <b>capacity</b> of the dam. [...] This fatal lowering of the dam greatly reduced the capacity of the main spillway and virtually eliminated the action of an emergency spillway on the western abutment. [...] Walter Frank first documented the presence of that emergency spillway in a 1988 ASCE publication. [...] The existence of the emergency spillway is supported by topographic data from 1889 which shows the western abutment to be about one foot lower than the crest of the dam remnants, even after the dam had previously been lowered as much as 3 feet by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. [...] Adding the width of the emergency spillway to that of the main spillway yields the total width of spillway (wasteway) capacity that had been specified in the 1847 design of William Morris, a State Engineer. Lowering the top of the dam by the Club eliminated nearly all of the capacity of the emergency spillway and greatly reduced the <b>discharge</b> <b>capacity</b> of the main spillway on the eastern side.
