500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sulley, {{when asked}} (in 2004) {{to pick the}} {{highlight}} of her career, said: [...] "I think it's still happening. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> we're still doing it now. After all these years – I'm 41 now, and really, I shouldn't be in a pop group any more, but I am and it's still my job! I {{wake up in the}} morning and I haven't got to go to a nine-to-five. I've got this life and I'm very, very lucky! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why shouldn't {{she like}} Miss Ford, Belle? She {{seems to be}} a nice enough girl, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> she acts in the movies ought to be held against her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... [357] {468} This {{spectacle}} I have seen, such as described, {{beneath the}} wall of the Seraglio at Constantinople, in the little cavities worn by the Bosphorus in the rock, a narrow terrace of which projects between the wall and the water. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> is also mentioned in Hobhouse's Travels [in Albania, 1855, ii. 215]. The bodies were probably those of some refractory Janizaries.|$|E
60|$|Jack, as I {{used to call}} him, had a mother, but no father--his {{father died}} when Jack was an infant. I've often fancied {{that there was a}} {{delicate}} bond of union between us here. He had a mother, but no father. I had a father, but no mother. Strange coincidence! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> helped to draw us together. I may be wrong, but I think so. Jack was on a visit to us at the time, so I had only to cross the passage to reach his room.|$|E
5000|$|He {{once said}} that [...] "The story with the legal dispute is not {{pleasant}} for me. However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that J.K.

5000|$|Unlike other {{publications}} {{related to the}} LGBT community, which generally advocate for rights form a political standpoint, Candy stands out as a celebration of this lifestyle. For Venegas, “Candy isn’t about rights, but <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> it Candy exists helps.” [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Venegas made his statement clear: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, the Guinness Book of World Records {{recognized}} Frank and Louie as the world's oldest living janus cat. This was {{an uncommon}} distinction due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> most janus cats die within days. Armelle deLaforcade of the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine stated, [...] "The condition itself is very rare, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that this cat became an adult, a healthy adult, is remarkable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The sister,' said Bradley, {{separating}} {{his words}} over-carefully, and speaking {{as if he}} were repeating them from a book, 'suffers under no reproach that repels a man of unimpeachable character who had made for himself every step of his way in life, from placing her in his own station. I will not say, raising her to his own station; I say, placing her in it. The sister labours under no reproach, unless she should unfortunately make it for herself. When such a man is not deterred from regarding her as his equal, and when he has convinced himself that there is no blemish on her, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> must be taken to be pretty expressive.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{streams of}} filth flow {{down through the}} ages in literature, which {{sometimes}} seems little better than an open sewer, and, as I have said, I do not see why the time should not come when the noxious and noisome channels should be stopped; but {{the base of the}} mind is bestial, and so far the beast in us has insisted upon having his full say. The worst of lewd literature is that it seems to give a sanction to lewdness in the life, and that inexperience takes this effect for reality: that is the danger and the harm, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> ought not to be blinked. Compared with the meaner poets the greater are the cleaner, and Chaucer was probably safer than any other English poet of his time, but I am not going to pretend that there are not things in Chaucer which a boy would be the better for not reading; and so far as these words of mine shall be taken for counsel, I am not willing that they should unqualifiedly praise him. The matter is by no means simple; {{it is not easy to}} conceive of a means of purifying the literature of the past without weakening it, and even falsifying it, but it is best to own that it is in all respects just what it is, and not to feign it otherwise. I am not ready to say that the harm from it is positive, but you do get smeared with it, and the filthy thought lives with the filthy rhyme in the ear, even when it does not corrupt the heart or make it seem a light thing for the reader's tongue and pen to sin in kind.|$|E
5000|$|The Fool Circle {{is notable}} for a reggae sound {{on many of}} the songs. In an {{interview}} bassist Pete Agnew commented:"'Fool Circle' was the nearest we came to making a concept album, trying to inject a bit of humour into a pretty heavy subject. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that we recorded it on the island of Montserrat might account for a teeny bit of reggae poking its way through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The war cannot {{have had}} much effect to your prejudice, as grain {{of all sorts}} bore a high price; and <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that large armies were near by, to consume {{everything}} you had to sell, and that at high prices, more than compensated for any disadvantage it might have induced. You had the benefits of two wars, Mr. Newcome; that of 1775, {{and a part of}} that of 1756." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But we {{can have}} the oath of the servant who {{attended}} him,' said the ready Mr. Glossin; 'indeed, <b>I</b> hardly <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> will be disputed. I am more apprehensive that, from the too favourable and indulgent manner in which I have understood that Mr. Hazlewood has been pleased to represent the business, the assault may be considered as accidental, and the injury as unintentional, so that the fellow may be immediately set at liberty to do more mischief.' ...|$|R
40|$|Leadership! Books {{have been}} written about it, yet we still seem to want more {{accounts}} of it. In large part, the desire for ever more examples and models of leadership derives, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that leadership occurs in context, and particular contexts seem to call for particular kinds of leadership qualities. In this brief paper, I will discuss leadership for school improvement and two core principles that can help explicate it: power and insight...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking to The Blog That Celebrates Itself in 2009 {{about the}} EP, singer Steve Waterhouse said: [...] "We were only just finding our feet as a {{recording}} band {{during that time}} - something we've become a lot better at, which I think will show on the next record. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it was recorded live comes through and that’s something we’re all really pleased about. There's a looseness that you can only get from playing live." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sulley, {{when asked}} (in 2004) {{to pick the}} {{highlight}} of her career, said: [...] "I think it's still happening. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> we're still doing it now.

5000|$|In 1983, Bono {{said of the}} song, [...] "It {{would be}} stupid to start drawing up battle lines, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that 'New Year's Day' made the Top Ten {{indicated}} a disillusionment among record buyers. I don't think 'New Year's Day' was a pop single, certainly {{not in the way}} that Mickie Most might define a pop single as something that lasts three minutes and three weeks in the chart. I don't think we could have written that kind of song." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "A {{key factor}} in our long life, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> was <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that we were never a {{commercial}} group but preserved our idealism. We thought we were doing something {{that no one else}} could do. We were depicting a way of life both below and above ground in a mining village that only we knew by experiencing it. Life goes on and we paint life … A funny thing, once you've painted a picture, you feel it's part of your life.": ...|$|R
60|$|WILLIS: 'No, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that you}} had set the {{decanter}} here on the hearth, and put your cologne into the wood-box, you were perfectly calm, Agnes.' He takes them up and hands them to her. 'Quite as calm as usual.' The door-bell rings.|$|R
5000|$|He goes on {{to explain}} in the same {{interview}} {{that he was not}} put off by the fans: [...] "When I look back on it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that that song was a hit gives me some confidence in pop music because the song is completely honest, what it is, it's crafted well, it's relaxed, it's recorded in a way that we'd never recorded a song before, which was absolutely live, three or four microphones in a bedroom. The song cannot have more integrity than it had." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Wu debuted on the {{big screen}} with a three part-film series, The Four, {{starring}} Ronald Cheng, Anthony Wong, Deng Chao, and Liu Yifei. In February 2013, she was cast in the Korean reality show, We Got Married with Ok Taecyeon, of South Korean boy band 2PM, as her virtual husband. Regarding this experience, she has commented, [...] "I feel thankful that you found me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that I was able to do this show was a gift from the up above." ...|$|E
50|$|Regarding the situation, Vedder stated:That whole Gate Park {{thing was}} a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Neil Young was there {{made me feel like}} I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs. I just didn't feel good about the whole thing, I felt {{swallowed}} up by the whole deal. It was just a situation where you couldn't go to work. But I think now I'd probably get through that show.|$|E
50|$|He was an iron man. But {{somewhere along}} the line I think he lacked something, the {{dedication}} to make bike-racing a full-time career. Maybe he didn't want to, but he certainly had most of the qualities. He had the strength, he could climb and of course he could time-trial. What he really needed was {{to be part of a}} good continental racing team. Then I think he would have gone to the very top. But whether or not his personality would have got in the way, that's another thing. You need a bit of modesty and humility to achieve that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Ray dropped right out of the sport proves that his interest didn't go deep enough. Why he went off and hid away, I don't know.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} is that?" [...] asked Father Brown, and stood still. [...] "Oh, a new religion," [...] said Flambeau, laughing; [...] "one of those new {{religions}} that forgive your sins by saying you never had any. Rather like Christian Science, <b>I</b> should <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> is that a fellow calling himself Kalon (I don't know what his name is, except that it can't be that) has taken the flat just above me. I have two lady typewriters underneath me, and this enthusiastic old humbug on top. He calls himself the New Priest of Apollo, and he worships the sun." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{necessity}} {{for having the}} officers in the same dress as the men, was apparent to all who watched the operations. The conspicuous figure which a British officer in his helmet presented {{in contrast to the}} native soldiers in their turbans, drew a well-aimed fire in his direction. Of course, in British regiments, the difference is not nearly so marked. Nevertheless, at close quarters the keen-eyed tribesmen always made an especial mark of the officers, distinguishing them chiefly, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they do not carry rifles. The following story may show how evident this was:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{really wanted}} to do this new project and album for the Cinema, because it was just a very {{different}} way to approach writing and one I hadn't experienced yet. I've always started Lydia records from scratch and by myself. Matt and I started sending The Cinema songs back and forth, coast to coast, really kind of calling each other out to keep making the songs better and surpassing <b>the</b> previous versions. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that we are both stubborn and pretty damn picky, if we're being honest here, is really what made the songs and album what they are today. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> fans of <b>the</b> band can expect much more music to come from The Cinema." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, it was {{revealed}} that Tim would propose to Sally. Asked how Sally feels about Tim, Dynevor said: [...] "I think she really loves Tim and she really cares for him but she's hoping she's {{going to be able to}} change him into the man she's always wanted to be with." [...] Asked how Sally reacts to the proposal Dunevor said: [...] "It does come out of the blue to Sally. They have spoken about getting married in the past then decided they were happy just to be living together, so it does come as a shock. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he gets down on one knee, he's got the music, he's bought the ring and he does it in front of everybody does mean Sally's thrilled." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2013 McAllister {{completed}} a move League One rivals and former loan club Shrewsbury Town {{for an undisclosed}} fee, signing a two and a half-year deal. Manager Graham Turner said [...] "It's just over a week ago that Sheffield United accepted a bid for David, so obviously we're pleased to have concluded the deal... Initially {{it was a surprise}} that they would sell him as he's figured in a lot of their games, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he has been here and knows all about us, knows the professional attitude and the work ethic here helped in his decision to join us." [...] McAllister scored his first goal in Shrewsbury colours on 2 March 2013 in a 3-1 defeat to Walsall at the Bescot Stadium. McAllister picked up an ankle injury in March 2014, which saw him miss the season run-in as Shrewsbury were relegated to League Two.|$|E
5000|$|Former Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice {{had also}} auditioned for Gillan but {{according}} to guitarist Bernie Torme [...] "...he had some difficulty after playing [...] "Secret of the Dance" [...] due to his only having one lung, and being {{a bit out of}} practice. He played it brilliantly but he had to lie down on the floor for five minutes afterwards. He did not want to join because of our fast tracks, he said he no longer wanted to play stuff like that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he had been offered to join Whitesnake with his old friend Jon Lord made a big difference. Meeting Gillan again at the studio had obviously put Underwood's name on the list of potentials for the job, and as Torme revealed [...] "...we finally found the magnificently solid and under appreciated Mick Underwood. The day after he accepted the job, Underwood and the band began to record the Mr. Universe album, released in October 1979.|$|E
5000|$|Bunten said of this game: [...] "the {{sales that}} EA {{was able to}} {{generate}} (despite a worthy marketing effort) were disappointing. It didn't have a solo-play option was everyone's rationale for the 'failure'. I can't argue with that but <b>I</b> also <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it didn't have an identifiable 'genre' or audience certainly didn't help." [...] Brian Moriarty said in his tribute to Dani Bunten: [...] "Robot Rascals took the multiplayer option to a provocative new extreme. Not only did Robot Rascals have no single-player mode, it actually required the participation of no less than four human players. Daringly billed as a 'family game,' this peculiar fusion of turn-based action and strategy, augmented by a deck of real playing cards, received a polite but puzzled critical reception, and was carefully ignored by everybody else." ...|$|R
5000|$|Her {{production}} {{is inspired by}} artists such as Kid Cudi, N.E.R.D, {{as well as her}} reggae-DJing grandfather.Milo grew up listening to her mothers Jazz music which has been one of her biggest musical influences saying [...] "I’m instantly attracted to music with some kind of Jazz element to it, but <b>I</b> also <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that even my mum never played only one genre in the house rubbed off onto me, I don’t want to have just one sound in my music when there’s so many other genres that inspire me." [...] Milo is inspired by Corinne Bailey Ray and Amy Winehouse and the way they convey their emotions.Rainy was influenced by producer and singer Pharrell and cites in use of a mixture of genres as a major influence praising his ability to mix [...] "rock with psychedelic-sounding stuff and R&B".|$|R
30|$|So {{most of the}} {{students}} are satisfied, in general terms, with the course’s evaluation model based on continuous assessment. As some students stated, this model helped them to improve their learning despite its grade of thoroughness: “Even though it is a very demanding course, our teacher was very fair in her assessments; <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of being continuously assessed makes you have to work harder and consequently learn more” (Student 1). Other students directly explain their satisfaction with the assessment of the course: “continuous assessment is fine with me; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is coherent with the activities developed during the course; it helped me to learn” (Student 2). Some teachers state their satisfaction with this type of assessment as well: “It’s a more time consuming assessment but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of assessing students during the different activities improves their learning“ (Teacher 1).|$|R
