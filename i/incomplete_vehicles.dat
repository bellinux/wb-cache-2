5000|$|Many rail {{equipment}} builders {{have used}} kits or <b>incomplete</b> <b>vehicles,</b> often to meet local assembly and production requirements or quotas, or to satisfy tariffs. Some examples include: ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{introduced}} in 1977, the Bison/General were available from dealers as vehicle gliders. [...] Essentially a complete truck {{with the exception}} of the engine, transmission, and rear axles, the <b>incomplete</b> <b>vehicles</b> were designed for a dual purpose: to either reinstall an existing powertrain in a new truck or to allow for further customization not available from a dealership.|$|E
5000|$|Cutaway van chassis {{are used}} by second stage {{manufacturers}} {{for a wide range}} of completed motor vehicles. Especially popular in the United States, they are usually based upon incomplete vans made by manufacturers such as Chrysler Group LLC, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors which are generally equipped with heavier components than most of their complete products. To these <b>incomplete</b> <b>vehicles,</b> a second stage manufacturer adds specific equipment and completes the vehicle. Common applications of this type of vehicle design and manufacturing includes small trucks, school buses, recreational vehicles, minibuses, and ambulances. The term [...] "cutaway" [...] can be somewhat of a misnomer in most of the vehicle's context since it refers to truck bodies for heavy-duty commercial-grade applications sharing a common truck chassis.|$|E
50|$|The FS-65 chassis was {{assembled}} in Gaffney, South Carolina by the Freightliner Custom Chassis subsidiary of Freightliner; as an <b>incomplete</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the chassis was shipped to body manufacturers for final assembly of a bus. After {{a total of}} 62,764 units were produced, the final Freightliner FS-65 chassis rolled {{off the assembly line}} in December 2006.|$|R
5000|$|However an <b>incomplete</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{such as the}} EVTraxer {{would not}} qualify for either of these general schemes and so would require Individual Vehicle Approval in each country of {{registration}} (i.e. each individual owners' domicile or tax residence address) although if that IVA-based registration and vehicle taxation was effective within any EC country the vehicle could then be driven anywhere in Europe.|$|R

50|$|The 1987 F-Series {{carried over}} the same body style from the seventh generation, yet sported a new rounded front clip that {{improved}} aerodynamics, {{as well as the}} softening of body lines around the rear of the bed and fender arches around the wheel wells. The interior was also completely redesigned in 1987. The transmissions available on SuperCab models were a four-or five-speed manual; regular cab models were also available with automatic transmission. The Custom trim made a comeback for the eighth generation. In 1988, the 4.9-liter inline-six, 5.8-liter V8, and 7.5-liter V8 engines gained electronic fuel injection. International Navistar also increased the displacement of their 6.9-liter V8 in the same year, resulting in the new 7.3-liter unit. This was also the first year of a five-speed manual overdrive transmission, which included the Mazda M5OD in the F-150s and the heavy-duty ZF5 in the F-250s and F-350s. Four-speed manuals were dropped as standard equipment after 1987, but were available as a customer-ordered option until 1989. In 1989, the C6 three-speed automatic was replaced as the base automatic transmission with the E4OD, a four-speed electronically controlled automatic overdrive unit, though the C6 was still available as an option, mostly in F-250s and F-350s, until 1997. Heavy-Duty models included F-250s and F-350s (along with F-Super Dutys) that were classified as <b>incomplete</b> <b>vehicles</b> only that were produced with no bed, but appeared as tow trucks, box trucks (notably U-Haul), flatbed trucks, dump trucks and other models. Although the F-250s, F-250 HDs (heavy duty), and F-350s were built as a Chassis cab models only from 1987 to 1997, owners can convert the models to pickup trucks. However General Pacheco, Argentina and São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil assemblies were the only places F-250, F-250 HD, and F-350 were built and sold as pickup trucks models. Despite being produced only in General Pacheco, Argentina and São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil assemblies (located in South America) F-250s, F-250 HDs, and F-350s were shipped from South America to the United States as imports from 1987 to 1997.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} to {{identify}} moving loads on a beam using measured vibration responses is studied for its possible application to identify axle loads {{when applied to}} the real bridge/vehicle interaction problem with road surface roughness and <b>incomplete</b> <b>vehicle</b> speed.

40|$|This chapter {{specifies}} {{requirements for}} glazing materials {{for use in}} motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment. § 161. 2. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glaz-ing surfaces, to ensure a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle win-dows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility of occupants being thrown through the vehicle windows in collisions. § 161. 3. Application. This chapter shall apply to glazing materials for use in passenger cars, multi-purpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, slide-in campers and pickup covers designed to carry persons while in motion. § 161. 4. Definitions. The following words and terms, when used in this chapter, have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: Camper—A structure designed to be mounted in the cargo area of a truck, or attached to an <b>incomplete</b> <b>vehicle</b> with motive power, {{for the purpose of}} pro-viding shelter for persons...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the {{so-called}} [...] "Big Three" [...] (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) {{began working on}} higher-capacity models of their popular full-size vans; these heavy-duty chassis were intended for commercial use by second stage manufacturers. Second stage manufacturers build such products as bus and truck bodies, motor homes, and other specialized vehicles. Neither their product, nor the first stage portion, called an <b>incomplete</b> motor <b>vehicle,</b> are fully compliant with requirements for a complete motor vehicle.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} cruise was {{to develop}} a better {{understanding}} of carbon cycling in the pelagic waters of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP). There were three objectives 1) Turnaround moorings at the PAP Observatory; 2) Conduct a 1 -D time series on the central station {{of a wide range of}} biogeochemical processes and to back this up with a mesoscale survey of key variables; 3) To trial the use of Autosub for mesoscale surveys in conjunction with the ship. All objectives were met, although the tops of the moorings were found to be missing probably due to fishing activity and the Autosub trials were <b>incomplete</b> due to <b>vehicle</b> failure. A full mesoscale survey was carried out using the ship and an eleven day time series at the central station was achieved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{scheduling}} problem for automated guided vehicles in container terminals is defined and formulated as a Minimum Cost Flow model. This problem is then solved by a novel algorithm, NSA+, which extended the standard Network Simplex Algorithm (NSA). Like NSA, NSA+ is a complete algorithm, {{which means that}} it guarantees optimality of the solution if it finds one within the time available. To complement NSA+, an <b>incomplete</b> algorithm Greedy <b>Vehicle</b> Search (GVS) is designed and implemented. The NSA+ and GVS are compared and contrasted to evaluate their relative strength and weakness. With polynomial time complexity, NSA+ can be used to solve very large problems, as verified in our experiments. Should the problem be too large for NSA+, or the time available for computation is too short (as {{it would be in}} dynamic scheduling), GVS complements NSA+...|$|R

40|$|Local area freight {{networks}} (LANs) {{are used}} to collect and distribute freight within metropolitan regions. This paper classifies LAN topologies, then shows how the optimal topology for a common carrier depends on demand characteristics. A link cost function is developed that incorporates a linear and an integer term, the latter representing excess cost due to <b>incomplete</b> utilization of <b>vehicle</b> capacity. Continuous space models {{are used to}} approximate transportation distance. In addition, the model accounts for sorting and fixed costs at terminals. The star topology {{is found to be}} most attractive when a large proportion of shipments are external (i. e. originate or are destined outside the region), when many pickup and delivery routes are needed to distribute freight and when shipments are small. The best examples of systems with these characteristics are postal services. The complete topology is most attractive when shipments are large and primarily internal, as in many less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking companies. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Location-based {{services}} (LBS) can {{be treated}} as an abstraction of spatial queries, e. g. k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) queries. In LBS, users retrieve their desired entertainment services and information from their mobile devices based on their geographical position at the request time through mo-bile network. The IEEE standardization of Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) /Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) is designed for high-speed vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). However, most existing VANET-based LBS are designed for simple applications like information dissemination. In this paper, we develop a VANET-based LBS with the utilization of RSUs as an infrastructure support to process k-NN queries. In our framework, we design road-based semantic broadcasting and scheduling methods for RSUs to pour useful information into the network, and a communication protocol to handle <b>incomplete</b> transmission between <b>vehicles</b> and RSUs. We evaluate our framework with and without RSUs through simulated experiments. Experimental {{results show that the}} utilization of RSUs significantly improve the query response time, query answer accuracy, and communication overhead. I...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is a colorless, odorless, {{toxic gas}} {{that is a}} product of <b>incomplete</b> combustion. Motor <b>vehicles,</b> heaters, appliances that use carbon based fuels, and household fires are the main sources of this toxic substance. In the human body, CO attaches to the hemoglobin and blocks the capacity to carry oxygen. CO binds reversibly to hemoglobin with an affinity 200 - 240 times that of oxygen. It has been suggested that carboxyhemoglobin causes severe generalized tissue hypoxia and a direct toxic effect on the mitochondria(1). CO is now realized as one of the gaseous neurotransmitter similar to nitric oxide. Delayed postanoxic encephalopathy causes deterioration and relapse of cognitive ability and behavioural movement a few weeks after complete recovery from initial hypoxic injury(2). In Thailand, there is no case report of delayed post anoxicencephalopathy after CO poisoning. The patient was diagnosed and demonstrated extensive white matter lesions in the brain parenchyma including deep grey matter nuclei on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Literature review of this condition was extensively searched. Case Report A 50 -year-old Thai female was admitted a...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} Monoxide (CO) Poisoning is a colorless, — Continued odorless, {{toxic gas}} {{that is a}} product of <b>incomplete</b> combustion. Motor <b>vehicles,</b> heaters, and appliances that use carbon-based fuels are the main sources of this poison. Most fatal unintentional CO poisonings associated with motor vehicles are preventable and can result from differing mechanisms of exposure: 1) operation of a motor vehicle with a damaged or malfunctioning exhaust system and an inadequately ventilated passenger compartment, 2) operation of a motor vehicle in an enclosed space (e. g., a garage) with inadequate ventilation, and 3) use of auxiliary fuel-burning heaters inside a passenger compartment or in a camper (1 – 8). This report describes the investigation of deaths associated with multiple motor-vehicle–related CO poisonings in Colorado on November 3, 1996, summarizes a review of such deaths in New Mexico during 1980 – 1995, and presents geographic and seasonal patterns in national death rates for 1979 – 1992. These findings indicate that deaths from motor-vehicle–related unintentional CO poisonings increase during winter months and that death rates from CO poisoning in stationary motor vehicles are highest in states with colder average winter temperatures...|$|R
40|$|South Mato Grosso {{has been}} {{developing}} very rapidly in recent decades, and it is clearly leaving behind the status of being solely an agricultural region to become an important state {{in the areas of}} commerce and industry. Nevertheless, it is still possible to observe the harmful effects of at-mospheric pollution due to biomass burning activities, even if those actions are being systemati-cally reduced in the state throughout the past several years. This kind of pollution persists not only due to local activities but also due to the pollution of other states and even other border countries. Satellite remote sensing has proven to be an important tool of environmental control vis-à-vis the ease of data acquisition, accuracy and wide temporal range. A study has been con-ducted of spatial and temporal concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) in the state of South Mato Grosso from 2001 through 2012 using the MOPITT sensor onboard the TERRA satellite. The car-bon monoxide comes principally from the <b>incomplete</b> combustion of <b>vehicles</b> engines and biomass burnings. A direct correlation of the CO concentration in the state of South Mato Grosso is ob-served precisely during the months of drought (August to October), for which the number of fir...|$|R
40|$|Between {{the years}} 2005 and 2015 {{cars and trucks}} have {{increased}} with 7, 7 percent inGothenburg. This will mean that in 2035 there will be 47 140 more vehicles. 70. 000 of the 550. 000 people in Gothenburg is being exposed by a noise that is over the limit of 55 dBA. <b>Vehicles</b> <b>incomplete</b> combustion of hydrocarbons leads {{to a number of}} additional health problems. According to the Swedish transport department, closer to 3000 people dies prematurely in Sweden each year due to traffic air pollution. A measure to prevent and reduce the intense traffic involves emission requirements, congestion and traffic regulations. The city center of Gothenburg will on the first of October 2016 introduce a prohibition for heavy traffic around the area close to Domkyrkan between 11 am - 05 am a clock. The purpose of this study has been to investigate if a regulation of heavy traffic can be used as an instrument to contribute to a sustainable and environment adjusted city without affect the residents feeling of an attractive city center. On behalf of the municipal entity Traffic office Gothenburg City and the organization Innerstaden Göteborg a customer satisfaction index analysis (CSI) has been done. Performed in order to measure customer satisfaction before the regulation. The CSI model which is a result from this paper will be re-used after the regulation in order to identify the effects of the traffic regulation. CSI is a statistical method built upon indicators (questions) and latent variables (quality factors) related to a set of indicators. CSI is measured by the respondents answering questions through a 1 - 10 point scale where 1 is the lowest rating and 10 is the highest ratings. There are three standard questions which average rating creates the CSI value: How satisfied are you with the overall environment as it is today? How well meets the environment your expectations? How well relate this specific area with an ideal inner city environment...|$|R
