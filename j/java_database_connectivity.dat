The environment {{is conducive to}} {{taking advantage of the}} parallelisms inherent in the problem and distribute the individual disciplines on machines most appropriate to their needs while insulating the developer and the user from the complexity of the underlying communications constructs. Common Object Request Broker Architecture and Java programming language are used to encapsulate discipline codes as "objects". An interface file identifies all the information needed by a user of the object. Legacy codes are "wrapped" using Java's native interface methodology and each such code is called from a module which implements the services of the object. A server program ties the implementation to the interface.

40|$|Abstract––Conditional {{functional}} dependencies (CFDs) are {{the extension}} of functional dependencies (FDs) by supporting patterns of semantically related constants. These CFDs are very useful to frame the data cleaning rules in relational databases. The CFDs have been proven more effective than FDs in detecting and repairing dirtiness of data. However, finding the CFDs is a difficult task and it also involves rigorous manual effort. This paper proposes a fast and efficient method called BestCFD to find the CFDs from relations. This algorithm works effectively find the CFDs {{compared to the other}} algorithms like CTANE. The proposed method is implemented in <b>Java</b> with SQl <b>database</b> <b>connectivity</b> and tested for different datasets. The results validate the effectiveness of this method for finding CFDs in databases...|$|R

50|$|<b>Java</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Connectivity</b> (JDBC) is an {{application}} programming interface (API) for the programming language Java, which defines how a client may access a database. It is Java based data access technology and used for <b>Java</b> <b>database</b> <b>connectivity.</b> It {{is part of the}} Java Standard Edition platform, from Oracle Corporation. It provides methods to query and update data in a database, and is oriented towards relational databases. A JDBC-to-ODBC bridge enables connections to any ODBC-accessible data source in the Java virtual machine (JVM) host environment.|$|E

Similar to Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) or <b>Java</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Connectivity</b> (JDBC), GNU Data Access is a wrapper but with more features to access several database engines. GNU Data Access has been developed as a complete architecture that provides everything required to access data sources.|$|E
50|$|Oracle BI Server is a query, {{reporting}} and analysis server and provides {{services to the}} other components of the Business Intelligence suite such as Data mining, Reporting, and Analytic Applications. The Server uses ODBC 2.0 which provides a standard software API method for using database management systems and JDBC (<b>Java</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Connectivity)</b> which is an API for the Java programming language. The BI server compiles incoming query requests into an executable code and then execute the code. Clients of the BI Server work with a logical dataindependent of the data sources, and they submit them to the BI server. The server translates the data to some combination of physical SQL and sends them to the back-end databases.|$|E

Business logic {{can be developed}} completely independent of the underlying database and operating system. Database independence is also made possible by support for open standards. The database interface ensures optimized data access from within the ABAP environment through Open SQL. SAP propagates the outstanding capabilities of Open SQL for ABAP to Open SQL for Java and {{offers a variety of}} standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to application programmers, such as SQLJ. Other technologies, such as Java Data Objects (JDO) and Container-Managed Persistence (CMP) for EJB, or the direct use of the <b>Java</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Connectivity</b> (JDBC) API, are also supported.|$|E

50|$|The Entity DSL {{defines the}} {{structure}} of data in OFBiz. The listing below shows {{the definition of the}} Survey entity which is the business object that represents the concept of a survey. The code in the Listing is self-explanatory: An entity called Survey is defined with 10 fields. Each field has a name and a type. The field surveyId is used as the primary key. This definition is loaded by a central component in OFBiz called the entity engine. The entity engine instantiates a corresponding business object. The purpose of the entity engine is to manage transactional properties of all business objects and interact with various persistence mechanisms such as <b>Java</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Connectivity,</b> Enterprise JavaBeans or even some legacy system.|$|E
50|$|Remote APIs allow {{developers}} to manipulate remote resources through protocols, specific standards for communication that allow different technologies to work together, regardless of language or platform.For example, the <b>Java</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Connectivity</b> API allows {{developers to}} query {{many different types}} of databases with the same set of functions, while the Java remote method invocation API uses the Java Remote Method Protocol to allow invocation of functions that operate remotely, but appear local to the developer.Therefore, remote APIs are useful in maintaining the object abstraction in object-oriented programming; a method call, executed locally on a proxy object, invokes the corresponding method on the remote object, using the remoting protocol, and acquires the result to be used locally as return value. A modification on the proxy object will also result in a corresponding modification on the remote object.|$|E
50|$|Weka {{supports}} several {{standard data}} mining tasks, more specifically, data preprocessing, clustering, classification, regression, visualization, and feature selection. All of Weka's techniques are {{predicated on the}} assumption that the data is available as one flat file or relation, where each data point is described by a fixed number of attributes (normally, numeric or nominal attributes, but some other attribute types are also supported). Weka provides access to SQL databases using <b>Java</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Connectivity</b> and can process the result returned by a database query. It is not capable of multi-relational data mining, but there is separate software for converting a collection of linked database tables into a single table that is suitable for processing using Weka. Another important area that is currently not covered by the algorithms included in the Weka distribution is sequence modeling.|$|E
