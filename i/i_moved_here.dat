The {{dynamics}} between identity (who I am) and anti-identity (who am I not) {{are drawn}} on {{to explore the}} identity work of senior and middle managers who have elected to embark on formal, sustained and intensive leadership development work. We construct {{the concept of a}} default identity, not primarily as an oppositional or negative identity, but as a baseline identity that, because it is securely held, has a major role to play in the understanding, acquisition and performance of more emergent identity constructions. In exploring the dynamics between management (default identity) and leadership (emergent and desirable identity) for instance, it becomes clear that each is shaped by the other in subtle and overt ways. We conclude that the recognition of the dynamics and relation-ships between them holds some promise for new thinking and innovation in terms of individual organizational identity work, leadership develop-ment and organizational change.
