50|$|Recording {{companies}} pursued approximately 20,000 lawsuits in 17 {{countries in}} 2009 against file-sharing of copyrighted content; however, {{not a single}} case was filed within Mexico. Because Mexico’s government has made opening legitimate businesses bureaucratic and costly, consumers have learned to count on a much cheaper means of acquiring music and other media for their entertainment. Consumers continue to share files because the intellectual property laws in Mexico are very weak and have not been updated {{in order to take}} into account online trade such as file sharing; therefore, intellectual property laws do not punish file sharing and Mexico’s intellectual property laws cannot affect file sharers because no money is being exchanged. The issue of file sharing is becoming especially problematic for the entertainment industry in the sense that fast broadband connections have become even more common within Mexico, doubling to 61 percent of Web-enabled Mexicans in the last two years. Although file sharing laws are almost non-existent in Mexico, Mexican legislators are considering the approval of the punishment of unauthorized file sharers with fines of up to $20,000 and ten years in jail. However, even if the laws do change in regards to file sharing, finding offenders will not be easy by any means because approximately one-third of Mexico’s Internet users go online at Internet Cafes, where several people may use the same computer every hour. Ultimately, the Internet poses two challenges within Mexico: (1) the sale of counterfeit/copyrighted hard goods and (2) the distribution of illicit new releases, subtitles, covers, and dubbed versions of films, as well as music, software and books. There are many file sharing servers that are hosted within Mexico; however, the majority of these servers are based in the U.S. and Europe but administered in Mexico. According to the recording industry, Internet sharing of music dominates approximately 90% of the total music market in Mexico with Peer to Peer networks as being the most predominant form of music copyright <b>infrigement.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Chon {{attempts}} {{to map the}} challenges raised by recent encountersbetween intellectual property and development, proposing a normative principle of global intellectual property. Gervaise notes thet the economic purpose of copyright law is instrumentalist in nature, ensureing the orderly production and distribution of, and access to, work of art and intellect. Janis and Smith present a case study {{about the potential for}} new tehnology paradigms to drive intellectual property regimes towards obsolescence. Accordind to CDT, the same tehnology that has led to communications revolution makes <b>infrigement</b> easy and has opened the door to widespread piracy. Chon {{attempts to}} map the challenges raised by recent encounters between intellectual property and development, proposing a normative principle of global intellectual property; intellectual property should include a substantive equality principle, measuring the welfare – generating outcomes by economic growth and by distributional effects; a decision maker would accord much less deference and exercise much more skepticism towards the proposed government action when a knowledge good that affects basic human development capabilities is implicated. Chon claims that a new priciple of substantive equality is a necessary corollary to th...|$|E
40|$|The Republic of Karelia is an {{independent}} state of the Russian Federation. The Karels, the Veps and the Russians are native people of the Republic of Karelia. According to the adopted ethnological criteria the Karels and Veps {{are considered to be}} national minorities of the Republic. Due to a longstanding tradition the Finns, including 5 / 6 of the Inkeri Finns, are believed to be a national minority as well. In accordance with the last census (1989) the national minorities made up only 13. 1 % {{of the total number of}} the inhabitants of Karelia (the Karels - 10 %; the Finns - 2. 7 %; the Veps - 0. 4 %). Modern ethno-demographic situation in Karelia is considered to be a critical one. The average age of the Karels, the Veps and the Finns living there is higher than in the other ethnic groups. The process of democratization in the Soviet society aroused the national factor in the former Autonomous Republics. Ethnic minorities began to annouce <b>infrigement</b> of their rights, started organizing national movements. National and cultural rebirth of their peoples and first of all their languages appears to be the principle goal of these national societies. But the Karelian language has no official status. In 1991 - 1993 the writing of the Vepsians was restored. As for the Finnish language it does not have a definite status yet. The “Programme of the language-cultural rebirth and development of the Karels, Veps and Finns of the Republic of Karelia” was adopted in 1995 by the Karelian Government. By the end of the 1990 s two approaches to the national problems were determined. The first is cultural (the development of languages and culture within national autonomy) and the second is political (the advancement of political demands from national-radical movements and organizations). But the stable political and national situation in Karelia guarantees a favorable solution to the problems of the ethno-cultural development of the Veps, Karels, Finns...|$|E
40|$|The article {{attempts}} {{to evaluate the}} concept of transitional justice {{in the sphere of}} public and academical debates, in different social environments during the transition period in the recent history. The approach will include an overflight over some definitions and interpretation of that concept and an assessment of possible applications of this concept in the reparative (corrective) theories during the political transition. The evaluation of operational dimension of transitional justice will focus primarily the moral grounds invoked in political and juridical debates, and will pursue some applications of the transitional justice in intergenerational justice realm and {{at the level of the}} institution of retroactivity. Also, the assessment will focus the moral core of the motivation of judicial decisions in the space of positive law debates, concerning the constitutional and normative dimension. Examination of particular aspects of the transition has raised particular interest in the public agenda of romanian political change. Reparation issues in dealing with the past had always occupied a privileged role in public debate, in social and political problems. Justification for corrective measures during transition period were presented on various occasions in different points of view, but tools and proper institutions in generating legitimate formal-political obligations were absent, threatening the strength of the the political stability. Requirements for application of a corrective, reparative justice, appeared as a consequence of subjective awareness of rights and liberties that positive law of the communist system ignored or assign them like law <b>infrigement.</b> An approach of such rights, with their features should be evaluated in the context of both totalitarian and democratic state. A dialogue with the past becomes more necesary and will contribute to the success of any public policy designed for any possible reparation in the future. Transitional justice could also be a frame for testing the theoretical outcomes of an analytical justice which could bring normative results in intergenerational justice. One of the most important issues which requires an approach in transitional justice perspective remains the institution of retroactivity...|$|E
