40|$|Relationship of <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> and <b>fiscal</b> {{sustainability}} {{is subject}} to ongoing debate which was intensified by adoption of EU <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules.</b> Task of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> is simple - to prevent the unsustainable growth of debt and spending. However, the problem of <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> that have been applied in past is in ignoring the economic fundamentals that determine fiscal sustainability. So far, <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> were focused on the control of spending without taking care about possible output fluctuations or effects of debt financing on growth. That led to paradox that even with the sound fiscal policy guided by the <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> {{there is no guarantee}} of fiscal sustainability. This flaw became obvious when countries hit by economic crises start abandoning the criteria set up by <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> in order to confront impact of worsening economic conditions to fiscal variables. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} development of new <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules,</b> particularly on the sub-national government levels. These new <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> should encompass both short-term and long-term sustainability and particularly stimulus to economic efficiency. In order to determine necessary content of <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> to achieve such goals it is important to conduct comparative research on the issue.

5000|$|One {{approach}} that some developing countries {{have attempted to}} foster capacity building is through isomorphic mimicry. Similar {{to the concept of}} mimetic isomorphism used in organizational theory, isomorphic mimicry refers to the tendency of government to mimic other governments' successes by replicating methods and policy designs deemed successful in other countries. While such an approach can be effective for solving certain development problems that have [...] "a universal technical solution", it often ignores the political and organizational realities on the ground and produces little benefits to those using it. An example of a failed mimicry relates to the legal reform in Melanesia. In response to a major international assistance mission {{to improve the quality of}} the justice system, a jail and a courthouse were built, costing millions of dollars. However, the new justice infrastructure has been rarely used since its establishment, because there has been a lack of bureaucracy and financial sources to support the expensive justice system. As summarized by Haggard et al., accelerated modernization is an entirely inappropriate strategy for enhancing the functionality of legal system as solutions like this often require state capacities that developing countries do not have. Another example took place in Argentina. During the economic crisis in late 1980s, the government implemented a series of fiscal policies as recommended by IMF to regulate high point inflation affecting the country's economy. However, rather than constraining aggregate spending, the <b>fiscal</b> <b>rule</b> merely shifted spending from the central and to provincial governments. Adopting international best practices do not often translate into positive changes; in the case of Argentina, the mimicry produced little change to the vulnerable economy.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} numerical <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> in force in the 25 countries of the European Union, examines {{the reasons for the}} growing appetite for such rules, and assesses whether they have an influence on budgetary developments. The analysis is based on a new dataset constructed from questionnaires submitted to experts in finance ministries of EU countries which report a large amount of information on the numerical <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> in force in the EU countries over the 1990 - 2005 period. The paper shows that the number of <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> in force in the EU countries has increased in the past decades. The introduction of the Maastricht Treaty and of the SGP seem to have been catalysts for the introduction of <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules.</b> The analysis, based on the estimation of augmented fiscal reaction functions, confirms the existence of a relation between numerical <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> and budgetary developments. The results show that some dimensions matter particularly for the capacity of <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> to influence <b>fiscal</b> policy. Notably, the share of government finances covered by rules and the presence of strong enforcement mechanisms seem to be particularly relevant. The analysis also shows that there is a link between the design of numerical <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> and the stabilisation function of fiscal policy. These findings confirm that while numerical <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> can be useful devices to ensure better policies, careful attention should be devoted to the way they are designed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{strengthening}} of national fiscal frameworks, including numerical <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules,</b> {{has recently been}} proposed as {{an important part of}} the economic governance reform package for the EU. The strength of numerical <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> can be described along the dimensions of their statutory base, the room to revise budgetary objectives, provisions for their monitoring and enforcement, and their media visibility. With a unique data set summarizing the quality of national <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> along these dimensions, we show that stronger <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> in euro area member states reduce sovereign risk. According to our estimates, yield spreads against Germany of countries with relatively weak <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> could be up to 100 basis points lower if they upgraded their numerical <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules.</b> The legal base turns out to be the most important dimension for the perceived effectiveness of the rules. The effectiveness of the correction and enforcement mechanisms turns out to be very important as well, while the role of the bodies in charge of monitoring and enforcing compliance is somewhat smaller. Overall, national <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> are found to be beneficial for market assessments of governments' ability and willingness to timely service debt: they could thus provide an effective way to implement fiscal discipline. ...|$|R

This paper {{develops}} a simple macrodynamic model that synthesises some key perspectives of their analytical frameworks. The model incorporates Godley’s financial balances approach and postulates that private sector’s propensity to spend {{is driven by}} a stock-flow norm (the target net private debt-to-income ratio) that changes endogenously via a Minsky mechanism.

The analysis shows that (i) {{the interaction between the}} propensity to spend and net private indebtedness can generate cycles and instability; (ii) instability is more likely when the propensity to spend responds strongly to deviations from the stock-flow norm and when the expectations that determine the stock-flow norm are highly sensitive to the economic cycle; (iii) the Maastricht-type <b>fiscal</b> <b>rule</b> is destabilising while the Godley-Minsky <b>fiscal</b> <b>rule</b> is stabilising; (iv) the paradox of debt can apply both to the private sector and the government sector...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims {{to measure}} the {{effectiveness}} of <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules.</b> <b>Fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> are constraints on fiscal policy that limit budgetary outcomes. Some studies in the literature have examined their effectiveness using a stringency index. Arguing this index possesses some arbitrariness, this study measured the effectiveness of <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> using cluster analysis. This cluster analysis resulted in dividing the data into two clusters. Using panel data of 26 Swiss cantons plus the Swiss federation over the period 1990 - 2012, a Least Squares Dummy Variable econometric model was conducted. The findings indicate that <b>fiscal</b> <b>rules</b> have a favorable effect. It {{was found that the}} frameworks of cantons in cluster 1 are more effective in decreasing cantonal deficits than those of cluster 2.
