While UK bankruptcy law concerns the rules <b>for</b> <b>natural</b> <b>persons,</b> the term insolvency is generally used for companies formed under the Companies Act 2006. [...] "Insolvency" [...] means being unable to pay debts. Since the Cork Report of 1982, the modern policy of UK {{insolvency law}} has been to attempt to rescue {{a company that is}} in difficulty, to minimise losses and fairly distribute the burdens between the community, employees, creditors and other stakeholders that result from enterprise failure. If a company cannot be saved it is [...] "liquidated", so that the assets are sold off to repay creditors according to their priority. The main sources of law include the Insolvency Act 1986, the Insolvency Rules 1986, the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, the Employment Rights Act 1996 Part XII, the Insolvency Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 and case law. Numerous other Acts, statutory instruments and cases relating to labour, banking, property and conflicts of laws also shape the subject.|$|E
