40|$|Deafness is {{the most}} common {{disability}} present at birth. In the United States, approximately one in 300 infants is born with permanent hearing loss. We have long known that diagnosis in early infancy and intervention within {{the first few months of}} life can prevent the tragic consequences of limited communication, low school achievement and life-long dependency that can result from delayed <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> childhood <b>deafness</b> (Yoshinaga-Itano, 1995). Additionally, diagnosing these children early can trigger a closer look at medical conditions sometimes linked with deafness, such as heart arrhythmia and vision and kidney problems. Indeed, researchers in the field agree that no group has more to gain from early identification than children with hearing loss (Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, 2000). Until the last few years, the average age of diagnosis for hearing loss was 30 months. Advances in technology have now made it feasible to screen babies at birth using objective physiologic measures, and Newborn Hearing Screening Programs of the country in the percentage of newborns screened, has recently passed legislation (AB 2651) to try to address this gap. However, follow-up...|$|R

40|$|Mutations in the {{autosomal}} genes TMPRSS 3, TMC 1, USHIC, CDH 23 and TMIE {{are known}} to cause hereditary hearing loss. To study the contribution of these genes to autosomal recessive, non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in India, we examined 374 families with the disorder to identify potential mutations. We found four mutations in TMPRSS 3, eight in TMC 1, ten in USHIC, eight in CDH 23 and three in TMIE. Of the 33 potentially pathogenic variants identified in these genes, 23 were new and the remaining have been previously reported. Collectively, mutations in these five genes contribute to about one-tenth of ARNSHL among the families examined. New mutations detected in this study extend the allelic heterogeneity of the genes and provide several additional variants for structure-function correlation studies. These findings have implications for early DNA-based <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and genetic counseling of affected families in the Indian subcontinent...|$|E
30|$|As we have {{mentioned}} earlier {{on in this}} article, {{an important step in}} rectifying or addressing this anomaly as far as deaf children are concerned, is the introduction of signed bilingualism - {{this is the type of}} bilingualism that recognizes the use of two languages in different modalities; that is, signed and spoken languages (Oracha [2004]). Through this, the Deaf Education will open up and enable the deaf to compete effectively with their hearing counterparts. It would require that there is early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and therefore early interventions by taking the children into pre-school programs that use KSL. These programmes will help the deaf child in its social, linguistic and intellectual development based on a realistic view of the linguistic possibilities of the deaf world - visual communication. The introduction of signed bilingualism will enable the deaf child establish contact with other deaf children given that most deaf children grow in isolation.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the long-term development {{of patients with}} a cochlear implant of the University Medical Centre in Utrecht; with regard to three potential predictive factors: severity of preoperative hearing loss, duration <b>of</b> preoperative <b>deafness</b> and cause <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> (the ‘bony disorders’ meningitis and otosclerosis vs. all other causes <b>of</b> <b>deafness).</b> Study design: Retrospective longitudinal clinical study. Predictors of speech perception, after cochlear implantation surgery, included preoperative hearing loss, duration <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and effect <b>of</b> a bony disorder as cause <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> (meningitis or otosclerosis); with use of Multi-Level Modeling analysis. Patients: 247 adult patients with a cochlear implant. Interventions: Unilateral multichannel cochlear implantation. Main outcome measures: Postoperative speech perception (CVC) scores. Results and conclusion: Perception of CVC words after cochlear implantation is significantly predicted by duration <b>of</b> <b>deafness,</b> preoperative hearing loss and {{presence or absence of}} a bony disorder as cause <b>of</b> <b>deafness.</b> There is no effect of interaction of these prediction variables, nor among themselves nor with the time predictors (=duration of implant use). The development of speech perception over time is best described by a linear and a negative quadratic growth model. As Multi-Level Modeling has been demonstrated in previous studies to be more powerful in hypothesis testing than other analysis tools, our unexpected result <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> being a significant predictor of speech perception might be due to the sensitivity of the Multi-Level Modeling method...|$|R

METHODS: The authors analyzed National Health Interview Survey data from 1990 and 1991 [...] the years the Hearing Supplement was administered [...] linked with National Death Index data for 1990 - 1995. Adjusting for sociodemographic variables and health status, the authors compared the mortality of three groups of adults ages > or = 19 years: those with prelingual onset <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> (age 3 years), and {{a representative sample of}} the general population.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{association}} between patterns <b>of</b> pigmentation and <b>deafness</b> {{in the dog}} has a long-documented history, with reports dating back over one hundred years. Long suspected of having a genetic basis, the search for loci with a pronounced influence in the expression of hearing loss in the dog {{has yet to be}} successful. No studies in the dog to date have found a possible influence of a specific colour locus associated with deafness. The present study is intended to evaluate the heritability <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> in the Jack Russell Terrier (JRT), characterize the mode of inheritance, and evaluate the existence of a sex, coat colour, or coat texture influence on the expression <b>of</b> sensorineural <b>deafness.</b> Results The estimation <b>of</b> heritability <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> in the JRT was 0. 22 when deafness was considered a binary (normal/deaf) trait and 0. 31 when deafness was considered a three-category (normal/unilateral/bilateral <b>deafness).</b> The influence <b>of</b> coat colour in the incidence <b>of</b> JRT <b>deafness</b> was statistically significant, indicating that dogs with more white {{are more likely to be}} deaf. The influence of sex or coat texture was not statistically significant in the incidence <b>of</b> JRT <b>deafness.</b> Complex segregation analysis revealed a model of a single locus with a large effect on the binary measure of hearing loss is not supported. Conclusion This is the first attempt, to our knowledge, to characterize a genetic component responsible for deafness in the JRT. The heritability <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> in the JRT was found to be 0. 22 and 0. 31 considering deafness to be a two-category or three-category trait, respectively. There appears to be an influence of coat colour on the expression <b>of</b> <b>deafness.</b> In an attempt to characterize the mode <b>of</b> inheritance <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> in the JRT, a model of a single locus with a large effect on hearing loss is not supported with this data. Further study is needed to determine if a single locus may be influencing deafness in the JRT. While the absence of a clear mode of inheritance complicates genetic dissection <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> in the JRT, the assembling of this pedigree provides a tool for eventually defining the genetic bases of this disorder. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The hearing {{impairment}} {{has an impact}} on the person’s capabilities and has an influence on the quality of life. In the early childhood the acoustic information is indispensable for development of speech and language. The cochlear implant is a biomedical device that enables the deaf to hear but it cannot help all the hearing impaired individuals. Patients and methods: In the period from March 1996 to August 2004 there were 110 deaf patients who were operated on for cochlear implantation. We evaluated the ethiologic factors <b>of</b> <b>deafness,</b> the age at onset <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> and the benefits of cochlear implant use. Results: Most of the implanted patients were congenitally deaf (60. 91 %). The most frequent cause <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> was hereditary hearing loss (30. 00 %). The period <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> was in majority (52. 72 %) less than five years but a few (10. 00 %) were deaf for more than 15 years. Reimplantation was necessary in four patients. The application and the benefits vary between the individuals but only two gave up the implant all the remainders use it every day. The communication mode in 88 patients is acoustic-oral while in 22 subjects a total method is used. Conclusions: The outcome <b>of</b> management <b>of</b> <b>deafness</b> by cochlear implants is comparable to other centers. Good results in congenitally deaf children support the need for universal neonatal hearing screening. </p...|$|R
