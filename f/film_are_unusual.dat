The <b>film</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> because it had no spoken words, only music and occasional sound effects to tell the story." ...|$|R
5000|$|Casting for the American <b>Film</b> Theatre <b>films</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual.</b> As {{described}} by Raymond Benson, [...] "The talent (directors, actors, designers, technicians) {{was asked to}} work at a reduced rate or at scale. No one refused. It was for a cause they all thought was worthwhile. Lee Marvin, for example, joked that he “lost $225,000” by starring in The Iceman Cometh (which meant he did the movie for only $25,000—his going rate at the time was $250,000)." ...|$|R

The soundtrack in the <b>film</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> in that the actors sang some of the songs [...] "live". For that reason, the studio album did not quite match the tracks heard in the film. Van Dyke Parks is credited as music arranger.|$|R
50|$|The <b>film</b> <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> {{in that it}} has no opening {{credits and}} the end credits feature photos of the {{principal}} actors, {{as well as of the}} main technical crew, including director Gilbert and cameraman Otto Heller.

2500|$|... "Some of {{the music}} was written before the <b>film,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>unusual.</b> Leone's <b>films</b> <b>were</b> made like that because he wanted the music to be an {{important}} part of it, and he often kept the scenes longer simply because he didn't want the music to end. That's why the <b>films</b> <b>are</b> so slow - because {{of the music}}." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1945, Montgomery {{returned}} to Hollywood, making his uncredited directing debut with They Were Expendable, where he directed {{some of the}} PT boat scenes when director John Ford was unable to work for health reasons. Montgomery's first credited film as director and his final <b>film</b> for MGM <b>was</b> the <b>film</b> noir Lady in the Lake (1947), in which he also starred, which received mixed reviews. Adapted from Raymond Chandler's detective novel and sanitized for the censorship of the day, the <b>film</b> <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> because it <b>was</b> <b>filmed</b> entirely from Marlowe's vantage point. Montgomery only appeared on camera a few times, {{three times in a}} mirror reflection.|$|R
50|$|Apanjan <b>was</b> {{the first}} <b>film</b> {{to deal with}} {{contemporary}} political violence and urban angst in West Bengal, and indeed India. It was a good two years ahead of better known films that dealt with urban issues, such as Satyajit Ray's Pratidwandi and Mrinal Sen's Interview. When it was released in 1968, it struck a chord with urban audiences, and was a commercial success. It gave a boost to the careers of Swaroop Dutta and Samit Bhanja, catapulting the latter to stardom. The use of Rabindrasangeet in the <b>film</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual,</b> and added to its popularity with middle-class audiences.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>film</b> <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> in that {{although}} featuring Sammo Hung and Lam Ching-ying, two actors famed for their kung fu abilities, neither actually perform any martial arts. Golden Harvest had wanted Hung to perform fight {{scenes in the}} film, but he refused, rationalising [...] "My character was mentally retarded, mentally disabled, {{so how can you}} ask me to fall down and suddenly become well again? And fight? They knew my fighting skills and wanted me {{to be part of the}} action but I thought that would have completely destroyed the tone of the film, the principles behind the film." ...|$|R
50|$|Dance Hall is a 1950 British film {{directed}} by Charles Crichton. The <b>film</b> <b>was</b> an <b>unusual</b> departure for Ealing Studios at the time, as {{it tells the}} story about four women and their romantic encounters from a female perspective.|$|R
