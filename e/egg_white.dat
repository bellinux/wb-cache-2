5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, syrup, ice, <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and <b>egg</b> <b>white.</b> Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E
5|$|The Jesuits left an {{extension}} of the epistle transept used as living quarters. In 1872, it was expanded to become a proper convento under Father Cabañas. The convento is a typical bahay-na-bato with its first floor made out of coral stones and <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> mixed with plaster as binder and the second floor made out of light materials like bamboo. The convent which serves as the priest's house, it is much used as the church's ecclesiastical museum.|$|E
5|$|Non-inhibitory {{extracellular}} serpins also {{perform a}} wide array of important roles. Thyroxine-binding globulin and transcortin transport the hormones thyroxine and cortisol, respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in <b>egg</b> <b>white.</b> Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen's triple helix whilst it is being processed in the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
50|$|Egg albumen or <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> {{acts as a}} trypsin {{inhibitor}} because <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> are full of protein which allows trypsin to act upon the <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> instead of steapsin. This allows the trypsin to be neutralized and allows steapsin's activity to remain unchanged.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>whites</b> play an {{integral}} {{role in the}} structure of the baked cake. <b>Egg</b> <b>whites</b> are composed of many proteins, however only ovalbumin, conalbuminm, lysozyme, and globulins [...] have properties which aid in creating a voluminous angel food cake. Ovalbumin and globulins will produce a foam that is equal or greater to the size of the <b>egg</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{difficulty}} in purifying proteins {{in large quantities}} made them very difficult for early protein biochemists to study. Hence, early studies focused on proteins that could be purified in large quantities, e.g., those of blood, <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> various toxins, and digestive/metabolic enzymes obtained from slaughterhouses. In the 1950s, the Armour Hot Dog Co. purified 1 kg of pure bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A and made it freely available to scientists; this gesture helped ribonuclease A become a major target for biochemical study for the following decades.|$|E
5|$|To {{better control}} the {{population}} of termites, various methods {{have been developed to}} track termite movements. One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> cow milk, or soy milk proteins, which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test.|$|E

50|$|Dehydrated {{and frozen}} <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> are cheaper and more {{efficient}} than fresh <b>egg</b> <b>whites.</b> However, each lot of dehydrated <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> varies from the next. This results in each batch of cakes varying in texture, moisture, volume, and height. Surfactants {{that have been used}} to improve the whipping properties of dehydrated eggs are sodium desoxycholate, triethyl citrate, triacetin, sodium oleate and oleic acid. Frozen <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> do not form as firm or stable foams as fresh <b>egg</b> <b>whites.</b> It may be necessary to adjust the pH if the eggs have been refrigerated for a long time because they become more alkaline than fresh eggs. Acids can be added in manufacturing such as acetic, malic, tartaric, and citric. These improve the color and cake structure by lowering the pH, however they do not work as well as cream of tartar.|$|R
5000|$|A {{classic example}} of {{denaturing}} in proteins comes from <b>egg</b> <b>whites,</b> which are typically largely egg albumins in water. Fresh from the <b>eggs,</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> are transparent and liquid. Cooking the thermally unstable whites turns them opaque, forming an interconnected solid mass. The same transformation can be effected with a denaturing chemical. Pouring <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> into a beaker of acetone will also turn <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> translucent and solid. The skin that forms on curdled milk is another common example of denatured protein. The cold appetizer known as ceviche is prepared by chemically [...] "cooking" [...] raw fish and shellfish in an acidic citrus marinade, without heat.|$|R
50|$|Albumen is {{a mixture}} of {{proteins}} found in <b>egg</b> <b>whites,</b> and is utilized for its capacity to create foams. In a commercialized setting, dried albumen is used as opposed to fresh <b>egg</b> <b>whites.</b> In addition to convenience, the advantages of using dried albumen are an increase in food safety, and the reduction of water content in the marshmallow. Fresh <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> carry a higher risk of Salmonella, and are approximately 90 percent water. This is undesirable for the shelf life and firmness of the product. For artisan-type marshmallows, prepared by a candy maker, fresh <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> are usually used. Albumen is usually never used on its own when incorporated into marshmallows, and is used in conjunction with gelatin.|$|R
25|$|Macaroni {{products}} – {{is defined}} as the class of food prepared by drying formed units of dough made from semolina, durum flour, farina, flour, or any combination of those ingredients with water. Within this category various optional ingredients may also be used within specified ranges, including <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> frozen <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> or dried <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> alone or in any combination; disodium phosphate; onions, celery, garlic or bay leaf, alone or in any combination; salt; gum gluten; and concentrated glyceryl monostearate. Specific dimensions are given for the shapes named macaroni, spaghetti and vermicelli.|$|E
25|$|Some eggs have {{patterns}} {{near the}} surface of the <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> that are likened to pine branches, and that gives rise to one of its Chinese names, the pine-patterned egg.|$|E
25|$|Today, egg tarts come in many {{variations}} within Hong Kong cuisine, including <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> milk, honey-egg, ginger-flavoured egg, {{which are}} variations {{of a traditional}} milk custard and egg custard, and also chocolate tarts, green-tea-flavoured tarts, and even bird's nest tarts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>whites</b> may {{be added}} during {{simmering}} {{when it is}} necessary to clarify (i.e., purify, or refine a broth for a cleaner presentation). The <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> will coagulate, trapping sediment and turbidity into an easily strained mass. Not allowing the original preparation to boil will increase the clarity.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to health}} issues with raw egg consumption, such as salmonella, an egg-free {{variation}} of royal icing is sometimes alternatively used by decorators. Meringue powder {{is used instead}} of the <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> to create stiffness. Pasteurized refrigerated <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> are sold at grocery stores for a safer traditional recipe.|$|R
40|$|Among 58 Escherichia coli urosepsis isolates, P 1 -antigen-containing dove and pigeon <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> were {{significantly}} more effective inhibitors of P-adhesin-specific agglutination than were chicken <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> or globoside. Globoside's inefficacy may have resulted from a proadherence effect of globoside's lipid tail. Adhesin phenotypes determined with dove and pigeon <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> as as agglutination inhibitors corresponded closely with phenotypes defined by comparative hemagglutination of human P 1 and p erythrocytes. These data suggest that avian P 1 -antigen-containing substances may provide a useful alternative method for P adhesin inhibition among uropathogenic E. coli strains...|$|R

25|$|Zefir is {{somewhat}} similar in its consistency to marshmallows, Schokokuss or krembo. It {{is derived from}} the traditional Russian pastila but with added <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> foam and a gelling agent. The form typically resembles traditional meringue. However, in contrast to commercial meringue, it is never crisp. It is usually of white or rose color.|$|E

25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} by female animals of many {{different}} species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and fish, and have been eaten by humans for thousands of years. Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (<b>egg</b> <b>white),</b> and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs. Other poultry eggs including those of duck and quail are also eaten. Fish eggs are called roe and caviar.|$|E
25|$|Further, the {{researchers}} {{noted that a}} yellow-green fluorescence in each extract promoted rat growth, and that the intensity of fluorescence was proportional to the effect on growth. This observation enabled them to develop a rapid chemical and bioassay to isolate the factor from <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> in 1933, they called it Ovoflavin. The same group then isolated the same preparation (a growth-promoting compound with yellow-green fluorescence) from whey using the same procedure (lactoflavin). In 1934 Kuhn’s group identified the structure of so-called flavin and synthesized vitamin B2.|$|E
25|$|The pavlova has a {{crisp and}} crunchy outer shell, and a soft, moist marshmallow-like centre, in {{contrast}} to meringue which is usually solid throughout. It has been suggested the addition of cornflour {{is responsible for the}} marshmallow centre, although it has been debated that the cornflour is just another <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> stabiliser in addition to the acid. The consistency also makes the pavlova significantly more fragile than meringue. Because the pavlova is notorious for deflating if exposed to cold air, when cooking is complete it is left in the oven to fully cool down before the oven door is opened.|$|E

50|$|Royal icing is {{traditionally}} prepared with fresh <b>egg</b> <b>whites.</b> Although highly unlikely, {{there is a}} very small chance of salmonella poisoning from improperly stored and handled eggs. Particularly in the United States where this concern is taken more seriously by public health officials, meringue powder or ready-to-use, pasteurized, refrigerated <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> (wet <b>eggs)</b> can be used with similar results.|$|R
25|$|Alternately {{attributed}} to the 16th and 17th centuries, Groote Wafelen from the Belgian Een Antwerps kookboek was published as the first recipe to use leavening (beer yeast): Take white flour, warm cream, fresh melted butter, yeast, and mix together until the flour is no longer visible. Then add ten or twelve egg yolks. Those {{who do not want}} them to be too expensive may also add the <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> and just milk. Put the resulting dough at the fireplace for four hours to let it rise better before baking it. Until this time, no recipes contained leavening and could therefore be easily cooked in the thin moule à oublies. Groote Wafelen, in its use of leavening, was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons (wafelijzers) depicted in the Beuckelaer and Bruegel paintings of the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{milling of cereals}} {{results in}} {{considerable}} loss (up to 60%) of vitamin B2, so white flour is enriched in some countries such as US by addition of the vitamin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of vitamin B2. Polished rice is not usually enriched, because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice-consumption populations. However, most of the flavin content of whole brown rice is retained if the rice is steamed (parboiled) prior to milling. This process drives the flavins in the germ and aleurone layers into the endosperm. Free riboflavin is naturally present in foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Bovine milk contains mainly free riboflavin, with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD. In whole milk, 14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins. in Bovine Milk: its concentration, distribution, and binding linkage, J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol., 37, 15, 1991 <b>Egg</b> <b>white</b> and egg yolk contain specialized riboflavin-binding proteins, which are required for storage of free riboflavin in the egg {{for use by the}} developing embryo.|$|E
