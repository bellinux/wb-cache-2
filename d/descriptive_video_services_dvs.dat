It {{has three}} divisions: the Caption Center, <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Services</b> (<b>DVS),</b> and the Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM). WGBH pioneered accessible television and video in the United States.|$|E

50|$|CFTO is one {{of several}} {{television}} stations in Toronto that utilizes a <b>descriptive</b> <b>video</b> <b>service</b> audio track for the blind on the second audio programme feed.|$|R
50|$|For blind viewers, audio {{description}} (<b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service,</b> DVS) {{can be and}} usually is transmitted along with captions. Viewers listen to the descriptions via wireless headsets.|$|R
40|$|By scrutinizing {{the legal}} {{provisions}} pertinent to <b>descriptive</b> <b>video</b> <b>service,</b> though {{they seem to}} be out of harmony, the right of access to copyright works is determined as one of social right vested by constitution. While the <b>descriptive</b> <b>video</b> <b>service</b> is provided for in Library Act, Mass- communication Act and laws related with disabled people, it might constitute a violation against Copyright Act. Copyright Act provides that copyright works should be rendered accessible for auditorily disabled people whereas it mandates only literary works become accessible for visually impaired people. It is unreasonable discrimination. The revision bills intended to improve <b>descriptive</b> <b>video</b> <b>service</b> have been made most often in Library Act and least in Copyright Act. The revised Mass- communication Act and Library Act are deemed to enhance the access of visually disabled people to information. But the revision bills in the other related laws and regulations have been relinquished or remained in inchoate stage. It seems to take long time for visually disabled people to enjoy whole access to information...|$|R
50|$|WBNS-TV {{broadcasts}} in Dolby 5.1 {{and uses}} its SAP channel for varying purposes, including simulcasts of its radio sister and simulcasts of NOAA weather radio, along with <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> and Spanish language NFL on CBS coverage from CBS.|$|R
25|$|In 2015, {{she assumed}} {{the role of}} Berthe in Pippin with the Broadway Touring Company of the renowned musical. In the same year she also began to provide the <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> track for visually-impaired {{individuals}} for some episodes of the Fox series Empire.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> (DVS) {{is a major}} United States {{producer}} of video description, which makes visual media, such as television programs, feature films and home videos, more accessible {{to people who are}} blind or otherwise visually impaired. DVS often is used to describe the product itself.|$|R
5000|$|In many movie {{advertisements}} by {{a specific}} cinema, the [...] "RWC" [...] acronym is often used, {{much like the}} CC acronym is used to indicate the availability of closed captions on television shows. Often, [...] "RWC/DVS" [...] notation is used, indicating the availability of both Rear Window Captioning and <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2016 {{under new}} FCC guidelines, {{stations}} {{have begun to}} install televised text-to-speech systems which read out the ticker text over the second audio program channel (where the <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> channel is inserted), increasing access to the visually impaired to immediate news and severe weather information {{that they would be}} unable to interpret otherwise.|$|R
50|$|On July 1, 2012, Disney Channel began {{providing}} <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> audio {{in compliance}} with the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010, which required network owned-and-operated stations and affiliates in the 25 largest television markets as well as the five highest-rated cable and satellite channels (including Disney Channel) to offer audio descriptions for the blind.|$|R
50|$|In May 2012, {{the station}} {{activated}} its second audio program feed {{three years before}} FCC requirements for network-provided audio description went into effect for the Milwaukee market, which was done for all Local TV stations at the master control level. The station carries all Fox programming available with <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> audio, along with Spanish language audio broadcasts of Fox Sports telecasts.|$|R
5000|$|When the PBS <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> is not running, viewers on DirecTV {{hear the}} {{programming}} and hourly station IDs of WSVH/WWIO when {{listening to the}} second audio program ("Spanish" [...] selected with green button) of GPB on the standard-definition feed. This is regardless of the location in the state, {{as it is a}} single feed for all media markets statewide.|$|R
50|$|RabbitEars is {{a website}} {{dedicated}} to providing information on over-the-air digital {{television in the}} United States, its territories and protectorates, and border areas of Canada and Mexico. Aside from merely listing network affiliations and technical data, notations of stations carrying <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service,</b> TVGOS, UpdateTV, Sezmi, Mobile DTV, and MediaFLO are also now covered on the site. RabbitEars also maintains a spreadsheet of current television stations.|$|R
50|$|RabbitEars tracks {{stations}} that use <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service,</b> TVGOS, UpdateTV, Mobile TV, Sezmi, and individual datacasts provided by local television stations {{in addition to}} providing lists of television station ownership, network affiliations, and some other miscellaneous information. It covered the digital television transition extensively, and maintains a history of the transition. Also provided is continuing documentation of stations requesting different channels, as well as stations having problems with VHF transmission.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally, TCM shows {{restored}} {{versions of}} films, particularly old silent films with newly commissioned musical soundtracks. Turner Classic Movies {{is also a}} major backer of the <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> (created by Boston PBS member station WGBH-TV), {{with many of the}} films aired on the network offering visual description for the blind and visually impaired, which is accessible through the second audio program option through most television sets, or a cable or satellite receiver.|$|R
50|$|On June 15, 2015, WTMJ added {{a second}} audio program (SAP) feed to its main channel {{to allow the}} {{transmission}} of <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> audio description and Spanish language translations for NBC network programs; it became the last major network affiliate in the market to incorporate an SAP feed before the FCC's expansion of its requirements for television stations to feature audio description to media markets outside of the 25 largest (including Milwaukee) on July 1.|$|R
25|$|Daredevil is {{available}} on the streaming service Netflix, in all territories where it {{is available}}, in Ultra HD 4K and high dynamic range (HDR). The first two seasons were enhanced to be available in HDR after their initial release by post-production vendor Deluxe. The episodes for each season were released simultaneously, as opposed to a serialized format, to encourage binge-watching, a format which has been successful for other Netflix original series. Daredevil was the first Netflix original series to receive its <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> audio description track.|$|R
50|$|Kramer Morgenthau was the cinematographer for {{the pilot}} and {{together}} with director Gary Fleder established the basic visual presentation of Blind Justice. For the series Bochco employed two cinematographers, Jeff Jur and Ric Bota, who worked on alternate episodes to allow for more time to visually develop the individual episodes. Blind Justice was the first scripted series to be broadcast on ABC with video description for the visually impaired, where available (FCC regulations for <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> would not come into force for seven more years).|$|R
50|$|Jane the Virgin premiered on The CW on October 13, 2014, {{during the}} 2014-15 {{television}} season. Unique to the CW, {{it is the}} network's only program to feature a Spanish language audio track on the second audio program channel; however, as many CW stations usually do not carry the SAP channel {{due to a lack}} of need, this is more limited than the major networks, which are required by the FCC to have a SAP channel for the <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> track, which as a minor network the CW is not required to carry.|$|R
50|$|The primetime {{block of}} NBC's {{coverage}} in 2016 also features <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> through the SAP channel {{for the first}} time since the Federal Communications Commission was allowed to require broadcasters to expand their production and access to described programming for the blind and visually impaired (though live sporting events were not required under the guidelines, so NBC's effort is entirely voluntary). Other channels featured Spanish language audio (duplicating the audio feed for NBC Universo-covered events if that channel is not available to a viewer) through the SAP channel.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the audio}} part, MTS uses subcarriers {{on the video}} that can also carry three audio channels, {{including}} one for stereo (same left-minus-right method as for FM), another for second audio programs (such as <b>descriptive</b> <b>video</b> <b>service</b> for the vision-impaired, and bilingual programs), and yet a third hidden one for the studio to communicate with reporters or technicians in the field (or for a technician or broadcast engineer at a remote transmitter site to talk back to the studio), or any other use a TV station might see fit. (See also NICAM, A2 Stereo.) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1970, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), the {{successor}} network to National Educational Television, began service, combining televised educational lectures with popular {{programs such as}} Sesame Street, NOVA and Masterpiece Theatre that remain PBS staples to this day. The station is also noted in Houston for many technical firsts at the local level. In 1981, KUHT became Houston's first television station to provide closed captioning, and 10 years later, in 1991, it became the first station in Houston to offer <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> audio, and other services for the visually impaired as well as bilingual viewers via a secondary audio program feed.|$|R
5000|$|In {{developing}} IPG software, manufacturers {{must include}} functions {{to address the}} growing volumes of increasingly complex data associated with programming. This data includes program descriptions, schedules and parental television ratings, along with flags for technical and access features such as display formats, closed captioning and <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service.</b> They must also include user configuration information such as favorite channel lists, and multimedia content. To meet this need, some set-top box software designs incorporate a [...] "database layer" [...] that utilizes either proprietary functions or a commercial off-the-shelf embedded database system for sorting, storing and retrieving programming data.|$|R
50|$|With {{respect to}} {{description}} and media, broadcast systems in Canada and the United States are transmitted digitally {{and access to}} description on the former SAP secondary audio program channel is no longer available. Ideally, {{it is now possible}} to access multiple streams of audio, e.g., Spanish translation, audio description, audio description in Spanish, etc. In the United States, affiliates in the top 25 markets and the top five-rated cable network are required to provide 50 hours of video-described programming per quarter under the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act of 2010. <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> (DVS) is a popular producer of audio description for shows on television.|$|R
5000|$|The three-hour block {{featured}} educational entertainment {{series for}} younger children, which met programming requirements {{defined by the}} Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s Children's Television Act. Programs broadcast by the NBC Kids block included Clangers, Ruff-Ruff, Tweet and Dave, Floogals, Nina's World, LazyTown and Astroblast!. [...] Programs broadcast under MiTelemundo include Spanish-dubbed episodes of Barney and Friends, Play with Me Sesame, Raggs and Super Why!, along with Spanish language versions of LazyTown, Jay Jay the Jet Plane, Fireman Sam and Noodle and Doodle. All NBC Kids programs featured <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> on the second audio program channel for the visually impaired, with access depending on the local NBC affiliate.|$|R
50|$|Online {{streaming}} {{services such}} as Hulu and the services of television networks themselves such as CBS All Access have yet to carry <b>descriptive</b> <b>video</b> <b>service</b> audio in most cases as they instead are currently focused on adding closed captioning to their libraries. Netflix committed in April 2015 to begin audio description of their original series, starting with Daredevil (which features a blind protagonist with other heightened senses) and the remainder of their original programming {{in the next few}} months, making their goal in that timeframe, along with providing the DVS tracks of existing series in their library; however some platforms (mainly older versions for devices that are now unsupported) do not provide the alternate audio.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 2009, {{with the}} December 2008 {{cancellation}} of Wonderful World of Disney, ABC Saturday Movie of the Week has become ABC's main platform for all movies. Currently {{the title is}} used solely for internal scheduling purposes; either a short promotional piece listing the film coming up or a direct cut to a disclaimer that the film has been formatted to broadcast television presentation precedes the aired film, along with noting time stretching done with extra commercial breaks and [...] "bonus content" [...] {{to fill out the}} three-hour timeslot. The use of the second audio program also varies wildly, with some weeks featuring the film's Spanish language dub, and others with a <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> track.|$|R
50|$|The CBS Dream Team, debuted on September 28, 2013 {{replacing}} Cookie Jar TV; this {{marked the}} second time that CBS carried an exclusively live-action block for younger audiences on Saturday mornings, having previously produced an E/I-compliant block called Think CBS Kids from September 1997 to September 1998. The Dream Team block's initial lineup consisted mainly of newer series; however, the cooking series Recipe Rehab also migrated to the Dream Team from Litton's Weekend Adventure for its third season. Shortly before the block debuted, Litton reached a distribution agreement with the American Forces Network to televise the block to provide educational content to military children overseas. All of the network's programming features <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> for the visually impaired on the second audio program channel.|$|R
50|$|Due to unknown issues, Milwaukee PBS {{had never}} {{introduced}} any second audio program channels allowing {{the use of}} <b>services</b> such as <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> on their digital channels, a rarity in the PBS system as DVS is usually expected as a regular feature (DVS and SAP were available during the analog age on both stations). This was not rectified until February 2016, when WMVS and WMVT added second and third audio program streams to all of their channels, allowing viewers to utilize DVS, along with English translation for the Spanish language program ¡Adelante!. MPTV was the last major station in the Milwaukee market to add SAP and DVS services, eight months after FCC requirements regarding audio description came into effect for the Milwaukee market for major commercial stations, though they are voluntary for non-commercial broadcasters.|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{introduce}} a dataset of video annotated with high quality natural language phrases describing the visual content {{in a given}} segment of time. Our dataset {{is based on the}} <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> (DVS) that is now encoded on many digital media products such as DVDs. DVS is an audio narration describing the visual elements and actions in a movie for the visually impaired. It is temporally aligned with the movie and mixed with the original movie soundtrack. We describe an automatic DVS segmentation and alignment method for movies, that enables us to scale up the collection of a DVS-derived dataset with minimal human intervention. Using this method, we have collected the largest DVS-derived dataset for video description of which we are aware. Our dataset currently includes over 84. 6 hours of paired video/sentences from 92 DVDs and is growing. Comment: 7 page...|$|R
5000|$|SAP {{is often}} used to provide audio tracks in {{languages}} other than the native language included in the program (as a result, the facetious term [...] "Spanish audio program" [...] is used as an expansion to the acronym), or for the <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> (DVS) offered in the United States on some television stations or cable networks (primarily ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS), along with broadcasting the local NOAA Weather Radio services or a local National Public Radio station (on many PBS stations) at times where translation or DVS is not needed. As of 2016, FCC guidelines now require stations in larger markets to read out the text of any on-screen news tickers which appear on-screen (mainly severe weather warnings) either using human intervention or via reading it out using an automated text-to-speech voice; the latter is done usually with the SAP channel exclusively.|$|R
500|$|The {{first season}} of Daredevil was {{released}} on April 10, 2015 on the streaming service Netflix, in all territories where it is available, in Ultra HD 4K. On April 14, 2015, Daredevil was the first Netflix series to receive its <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> audio description track, [...] "a narration track that describes what is happening on-screen, including physical actions, facial expressions, costumes, settings and scene changes." [...] By April 16, episodes for the series had been pirated by 2.1 million individual users worldwide, according to Excipio, a piracy tracking firm, surpassed in that timeframe only by Game of Thrones. The biggest countries for piracy were Brazil (190,274 torrent downloaders), India (149,316), the U.S. (144,351), the UK (119,891), France (105,473) and Australia (101,025). Except for India, Netflix was available {{in each of those}} countries at the time. The season was enhanced to be available in high dynamic range after its initial release by post-production vendor Deluxe.|$|R
40|$|<b>Descriptive</b> <b>video</b> <b>service</b> (DVS) {{provides}} linguistic de-scriptions {{of movies}} and allows visually impaired people {{to follow a}} movie along with their peers. Such descriptions are by design mainly visual and thus naturally form an inter-esting data source for computer vision and computational linguistics. In this work we propose a novel dataset which contains transcribed DVS, which is temporally aligned to full length HD movies. In addition we also collected the aligned movie scripts which {{have been used in}} prior work and compare the two different sources of descriptions. In total the Movie Description dataset contains a parallel cor-pus of over 54, 000 sentences and video snippets from 72 HD movies. We characterize the dataset by benchmark-ing different approaches for generating video descriptions. Comparing DVS to scripts, we find that DVS is far more visual and describes precisely what is shown rather than what should happen according to the scripts created prior to movie production. 1...|$|R
50|$|GPB Television {{broadcasts}} PBS {{programming and}} statewide programs produced {{specifically for the}} GPB network 24 hours a day on a network of nine full-power stations as well as numerous low-power translator stations (especially in the state's mountainous northeastern counties). Certain programs broadcast by GPB Television (mainly those provided by PBS) feature a <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Service</b> track that is audible over the second audio program (SAP) channel of each station; GPB Radio feeds could previously be heard during times when DVS-transcribed programs were not airing, prior to the 2009 digital television transition. All stations within the GPB Television network act as rebroadcasters, simulcasting the network's programming at all times. GPB-produced programs include Gardening in Georgia, Georgia Backroads, Georgia's Business, Georgia Outdoors and Georgia Traveler, as well as annual coverage of the Georgia General Assembly when it is in legislative session early in the year. Live coverage of the football and basketball championship games from the Georgia High School Association is broadcast {{at the end of}} their respective seasons.|$|R
