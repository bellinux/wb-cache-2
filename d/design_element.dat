5|$|A {{number of}} the Rova's {{buildings}} possessed unique design features. The modest wood building then known as Manjakamiadana was also called Felatanambola ("Silver Hands") for the hand-shaped sculptures crafted from melted silver piastres and attached {{to each of the}} building's four tandrotrano (roof horns)—an architectural <b>design</b> <b>element</b> formed from the crossed gable beams that extended past the roof line of all traditional aristocratic Merina houses. Felatanambola's decorative silver hands were later affixed to the roof horns of Besakana. Another distinctive building from this period was called Bevato ("Many Stones") because its foundation was atypically composed of stone blocks. Manatsara was said to be the most well constructed of the many houses because it was built using ambora (Tambourissa parrifolia), an extremely durable and rot-resistant indigenous hardwood, rather than a traditional wood called hazomena (Weinmannia rutenbergii). According to oral history, Manatsara was treasured by Andrianampoinimerina and the house was quite old but still well preserved in the mid-19th century when Queen RanavalonaI decided to recover its interior walls with wood taken from Sihanaka country.|$|E

However, web <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> generally known are broad and various that are hardly conceived and classified, so many practitioners and design researchers approach to web <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> based on graphic and visual design that mainly focus on print media design. This paper discusses about web <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> in terms of online user experience, as web media certainly differs from print media.

40|$|Given {{industry}} competitiveness, how do firms' {{new product}} development (NPD) process designs differ when responding to an innovation mandate? How do NPD <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> differ across firms when implementing NPD processes? These <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> are {{strategic business unit}} (SBU) senior management involvement, business case content, customer interactions, and cross-functional integration. What are the consequences of different combinations of NPD process <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> for innovation productivity? We explore these questions via a collective case study of newly implemented NPD process designs at three different SBUs of a major US-based international conglomerate, 1 year after receiving the mandate to grow through innovation. Our analysis suggests that industry competitiveness and firm characteristics influence the NPD process design as SBUs employ distinct combinations of NPD <b>design</b> <b>elements.</b> The differential emphasis on <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> leads to variation in process design and divergence in innovation productivity. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

The method used is a qualitative hermenuetic comparative study of objects, where the distinct significant <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> are being identified and interpretated. Several significant <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> are identified, and some are interpretated as representing certain animals. The amalgamation of differentiating <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> in some objects however, leads to interpretations of compound animal motifs, where some motifs are considered ambiguous and some are rendered uninterpretated.

25|$|Forsaking Mountfort's 19th-century Gothic, Petre {{designed}} the new church in a Renaissance, Italian basilica style, albeit with one major exception. Ignoring Renaissance convention, Petre obtained a greater visual impact by siting the Italianate green copper-roofed dome not above the crossing (as in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome), but directly above the sanctuary. In Petre's opinion, this <b>design</b> <b>element,</b> {{coupled with the}} Byzantine apse, added extra grandeur and theatre to the high altar set in the tribune. The nave and chancel roofs were supported by colonnades of ionic columns and the entrance facade of the cathedral was flanked by twin towers {{in the manner of}} many of Europe's great renaissance churches.|$|E
25|$|Canted {{vertical}} stabilizers {{are another}} distinguishing <b>design</b> <b>element,</b> one among several other such elements that enable the Hornet's excellent high {{angle of attack}} ability, including oversized horizontal stabilators, oversized trailing edge flaps that operate as flaperons, large full-length leading-edge flaps and flight control computer programming that multiplies the movement of each control surface at low speeds and moves the vertical rudders inboard instead of simply left and right. The Hornet's normally high angle of attack performance envelope was put to rigorous testing and enhanced in the NASA F-18 High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV). NASA used the F-18 HARV to demonstrate flight handling characteristics at high angle-of-attack (alpha) of 65–70 degrees using thrust vectoring vanes. F/A-18 stabilators were also used as canards on NASA's F-15S/MTD.|$|E
25|$|Proton {{sought to}} create a new {{signature}} façade with the Prevé. The result is Proton Wings, a unified <b>design</b> <b>element</b> that fuses the headlights, Proton emblem and air-intake grille, giving it a distinctive look of a bird ascending. The Prevé is the first Malaysian-made car to be factory-fitted with LED position lamps. The exterior of the car was styled to sport a reduced drag coefficient in an effort to enhance fuel efficiency. Proton collaborated with Italy-based Italdesign Giugiaro S.p.A for the styling and likeness of the Prevé. Italdesign is also responsible for the styling of the 2010 Proton Tuah concept car. Additionally, Azlan Othman, Proton's Head of Styling was dispatched to Turin under the collaboration with Italdesign which lasted almost a year.|$|E

25|$|There {{really are}} two {{different}} kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in two different ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original <b>design</b> <b>element.</b> Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear {{in the field of}} the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field is the first thing to be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{software}} design document bridges the requirement phase activity with {{the implementation phase}} activity. <b>Design</b> <b>elements</b> are having pictorial information about the possible solution for requirements. Software modules are written from these documents. If we can represent these <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> in well-defined text format, many experiments are possible on {{software design}} for optimizing it. This paper is an initiative towards a new framework, which stores the <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> {{in the form of}} a text document with the help of proposed DGML (DesiGn Markup Language). A new syntax is created for DGML based documents. This representation of pictorials <b>design</b> <b>elements</b> in the form of text helps in design optimization, reusing the existing design and early prediction of error prone modules. A fresh new design can be obtained from existing design after parsing it for well-defined project requirements...|$|R
