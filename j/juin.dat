5|$|The next {{assignment}} for 2e DB, {{and the one}} that it had been brought from Africa for, was the liberation of Paris. Allied troops initially avoided the historic city, moving around it to minimise the danger of destruction if the Germans sought to defend it. When Parisians rose against the Germans, de Gaulle and Leclerc persuaded General Dwight D. Eisenhower to help. Leclerc's men had to fight their way into Paris, and when they got there they found German infantry and tanks still holding parts of the city. The German commander, General der Infanterie Dietrich von Choltitz, was inclined to surrender, and did so to Leclerc and Henri Rol-Tanguy of the French Forces of the Interior at the Gare Montparnasse on 25 August 1944. Leclerc arranged for Ensign Philippe de Gaulle, who was serving in the RBFM, to be in attendance, but the elder de Gaulle was annoyed that Leclerc had allowed the communist Rol to co-sign the surrender. The next day de Gaulle held a triumphal parade, accompanied by senior military figures including Leclerc, Alphonse <b>Juin,</b> Marie-Pierre Kœnig and Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu.|$|E
25|$|Robert Murphy {{then drove}} to the {{residence}} of General Alphonse <b>Juin,</b> the senior French Army officer in North Africa, with some resistance fighters. While the resistance surrounded the house, making <b>Juin</b> effectively a prisoner, Murphy attempted {{to persuade him to}} side with the Allies. However, he was treated to a surprise: Admiral François Darlan, the commander of all French forces, was in Algiers on a private visit. <b>Juin</b> insisted on contacting Darlan, and Murphy was unable to persuade either to side with the Allies. In the early morning, the Gendarmerie arrived and released <b>Juin</b> and Darlan.|$|E
25|$|In January 1947 <b>Juin</b> {{returned}} to Africa as the Resident-General in Morocco. He opposed Moroccan attempts to gain independence, and worked uneasily with Mohammed V, the Sultan of Morocco, whom <b>Juin</b> correctly suspected of harbouring nationalist sympathies. <b>Juin</b> forbade religious schools and certain gatherings, which he felt were being {{taken over by}} nationalists. During his tenure he instituted many administrative reforms, and greatly expanded opportunities for Moroccans, but it was overshadowed by the growing drift to independence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Juin</b> did {{not want}} Algeria {{occupied}} by the Americans {{any more than he}} wanted France occupied by the Germans, but he recognised the reality of the situation. Darlan authorised <b>Juin</b> to negotiate a local ceasefire in Algiers, so <b>Juin</b> met with American Major General Charles W. Ryder, commander of the U.S. 34th Infantry Division, and the two arranged {{for an end to the}} fighting. Algiers was handed over to the Americans, French troops were confined to barracks but retained their weapons, and French police maintained law and order. French resistance to the Allies continued elsewhere in North Africa until Darlan issued a ceasefire on 10 November, and directed <b>Juin</b> to order French forces in Tunisia to resist the Germans and the Italians. Juin's orders were not always obeyed by his subordinates in Tunisia, many of whom believed that Darlan and <b>Juin</b> were being held prisoner by the Americans, but he was able to personally persuade Noguès to work with the Allies.|$|E

25|$|<b>Juin</b> was {{promoted}} to Général d'armée. He was given a tumultuous welcome from the populace when he entered Tunis after the Allies captured the city in May. De Gaulle appointed Mast as Resident-General in Tunisia, but Mast was injured in an air crash, and <b>Juin</b> was asked to fill in for him. In this role, <b>Juin</b> joined General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Général d'armée Henri Giraud, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder and Lieutenant General Kenneth Anderson on the review stand for the victory parade on 20 May. A less savoury {{part of the job}} was informing the Muhammad VII al-Munsif, the Bey of Tunisia, that he was being deposed. When <b>Juin</b> was informed that Pétain had stripped him of his French nationality and membership in the legion of honour, he merely noted that he was grateful he had not been sentenced to death.|$|E
25|$|In the event, <b>Juin</b> did not die, but {{remained}} frail {{for the rest}} of his life. He suffered a heart attack November 1966, and was again taken to the Val-de-Grâce, where he died on 22 January 1967. A funeral was held at Notre Dame de Paris, which was attended by old comrades including Alexander, Ridgway, Béthouart, Marcel Carpentier and de Gaulle, after which <b>Juin</b> was interred in Les Invalides with full military honours.|$|E
25|$|Noguès became Resident-General in Morocco in 1937, {{with the}} {{expectation}} that he would become commander in chief in North Africa in the event Of hostilities with Nazi Germany. If this happened, Noguès wanted <b>Juin</b> for his chief of staff, but since <b>Juin</b> was only a colonel, it was arranged for him to attend a senior officers course at the Centre des hautes études militaires. On graduation he returned to Algiers, where he was promoted to the rank of général de brigade on 26 December 1938.|$|E
25|$|Alphonse <b>Juin</b> {{was born}} at Bône in French Algeria on 16 December 1888, the only son of Victor Pierre <b>Juin,</b> a soldier who became a gendarme after 15 years of {{military}} service, mostly in Algeria, and his wife Précieuse Salini, the daughter of another soldier and who had become a gendarme. He was named after his paternal grandfather. When he was six, {{his family moved to}} Constantine, where he went to primary school, and learnt Arabic from the local boys. In 1902 he was awarded a bursary to study at the Lycée d'Aumale in Constantine.|$|E
25|$|The {{organ of}} the fifth chapel of Versailles was built by Robert Clicquot and Julien Tribuot in 1709–1710. His first {{official}} presentation took place on Pentecost, <b>Juin</b> 8, 1710; the organist was Jean-Baptiste Buterne.|$|E
25|$|In the {{reorganisation}} of French {{forces in}} North Africa on 13 November, <b>Juin</b> became {{commander of the}} Eastern Sector. His command, known as the Détachement d'armée Français, held two distinct sectors on the Tunisian front, one in the north under Général de brigade Fernand Barré, {{and one in the}} south under Koeltz. His forces were poorly equipped, and when the Germans and Italians counter-attacked, he had to call on the British and Americans for assistance. In January, <b>Juin</b> agreed to a more regular command arrangement, with French forces being concentrated in Koeltz's XIX Corps, which was placed under Lieutenant General Kenneth Anderson's British First Army.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} {{of the end of the}} war in Europe, <b>Juin</b> was in the United States, where he {{represented}} France at the San Francisco Conference. In the immediate post-war period he continued with his task of rebuilding France's armed forces. This was made difficult by the ending of American Lend-Lease aid, and the military commitments to the Allied occupation of Germany, and in North Africa, Syria and Italy, where the 1947 Paris Peace Treaties made some adjustments to the border. The major looming crisis, though, was the Indochina War. <b>Juin</b> lost his direct access to the President when de Gaulle left office in 1946, and his plans for an Army large enough to handle France's commitments had to be scaled back.|$|E
25|$|<b>Juin</b> {{became a}} {{prisoner}} of war, and was held in Oflag IV-B Koenigstein, a prison camp for officers in Königstein Fortress in Saxony. While in prison {{he was promoted to}} général de division. He was released in June 1941 at the request of Pétain, now the head of the Vichy Government, in exchange for thirty German sailors, as a specialist in North African affairs. He was promoted to Général de corps d'armée on 16 July, and became commander of the troops in Morocco. Admiral François Darlan offered him the post of Minister for War following the death of Général d'armée Charles Huntziger in November 1941, but <b>Juin</b> turned down the offer, saying that he only wished to serve in North Africa. On 20 November, he was promoted to Général de corps d'armée, replacing Weygand as commander of French land forces in North Africa. In December he led a French mission to Germany that met with Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring to discuss {{what would happen if the}} German-Italian Panzerarmee Afrika was driven out of Libya by Operation Crusader. This did not occur, but a dispute over what should be done led to <b>Juin</b> relieving de Lattre of command of the forces in Tunisia, permanently damaging their friendship.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant General Clark made a triumphal {{entry into}} Rome, with <b>Juin</b> {{sitting next to}} him. For <b>Juin,</b> the {{experience}} was bittersweet. He felt that the fruits of his victory had been lost through British caution, and the American obsession with the capture of Rome. His support for continuing the campaign in Italy now that the Allies were winning {{was rejected by the}} French command. On 4 July, the CEF captured Siena, where it celebrated Bastille Day, and then was withdrawn to participate in Operation Dragoon, codename for the Allied invasion of Southern France. In the wake of allegations of raping and pillaging by his North African troops in the Marocchinate, he took steps to curtail the abuses, with drastic measures, including the death penalty, that were not entirely successful owing to the animosity between the French and Italian people over the events of 1940.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} French Expeditionary Corps, {{commanded}} by the future Marshal <b>Juin,</b> the 3e DIA captured Monte du Belvédère on January 25. While attracting the German forces attention, the division contributed {{to the success of}} the landing at Anzio, and for the American advance on the heights of Cassino. As a result of this battle, the 4e RTT suffered the loss of half of its strength.|$|E
25|$|During the German Operation Northwind in January 1945, he {{clashed with}} Eisenhower's chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter B. Smith, over a {{proposed}} Allied withdrawal from Alsace and Lorraine. In the event, Eisenhower {{gave way to}} political pressure from the British and the French, and the withdrawal was not carried out. <b>Juin</b> also opposed the attack on Royan in April 1945, but it was carried out anyway over his objections.|$|E
25|$|In November 1943 the French forces {{received}} enough {{military equipment}} through Lend-Lease to re-equip eight divisions {{and allow the}} return of borrowed British equipment. At this point, the Free French forces and Army of Africa were merged to form the French Expeditionary Corps (Corps Expéditionnaire Français, CEF), under General Alphonse <b>Juin,</b> that would {{take part in the}} 1943 Italian Campaign and the August 1944 invasion in Southern France called Operation Dragoon.|$|E
25|$|After Operation Torch, the {{invasion}} of Algeria and Morocco by British and American forces in November 1942, <b>Juin</b> ordered French forces in Tunisia to resist the Germans and the Italians. His great skills were exhibited during the Italian campaign as commander of the French Expeditionary Corps. His expertise in mountain warfare was crucial in breaking the Gustav Line, which had held up the Allied advance for six months.|$|E
25|$|In March 1943, after {{a meeting}} General Alphonse <b>Juin,</b> Stirling took 50 French {{soldiers}} out of 2 SAS to form the 2 SAS, French 2nd Squadron under Couraud, under his new title of Captain Lee. The squadron consisted of Couraud as captain and commander, three British lieutenants, two French officers (Lieutenant Robert Sablet, Raillard and Aspiring), and French soldiers, with {{a large proportion of}} former Legionnaires. In May 1943, taking advantage of the Churchill Act of 1940, Couraud took British citizenship.|$|E
25|$|After the 8 November 1942 putsch by the French {{resistance}} that prevented the 19th Corps to respond effectively to the allied landings around Algiers the same day, most Vichy figures were arrested (including General Alphonse <b>Juin,</b> chief commander in North Africa, and Vichy admiral François Darlan). However, Darlan was released and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower finally accepted his self-nomination as high commissioner of North Africa and French West Africa, {{a move that}} enraged de Gaulle, who refused to recognise his status.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>Juin</b> visited Indochina in April 1946, and {{met with}} Ho Chi Minh, he was not {{interested}} in a command there. He likewise turned down an offer in 1948 to command the Western European Union land forces. He returned to Indochina in October 1950, when he was sent to report on the state of France's efforts there. He produced a damning report, in which he criticised both the strategy and tactics being employed. But he again turned down an offer to command the French forces in Indochina, being far more concerned about the situation in North Africa.|$|E
25|$|In North Africa, {{after the}} 8 November 1942 putsch by the French resistance, most Vichy figures were arrested, {{including}} General Alphonse <b>Juin,</b> chief commander in North Africa, and Admiral François Darlan. However, Darlan was released, and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower finally accepted his self-nomination as High Commissioner of North Africa and French West Africa (Afrique occidentale française, AOF), {{a move that}} enraged de Gaulle, who refused to recognize Darlan's status. After Darlan signed an armistice with the Allies and took power in North Africa, Germany violated the 1940 armistice with France and invaded Vichy France on 10 November 1942 (operation code-named Case Anton), triggering the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} was {{to portray}} life in France {{in the period}} following June 1940, the month in which the German army rapidly defeated the French and fought the British; Paris and northern France came under German occupation on June 14. The first novel, Tempête en <b>juin</b> (Storm in June) depicts the flight of citizens from Paris in the hours preceding the German advance and {{in the days following}} it. The second, Dolce (Sweet), shows life in a small French country town, Bussy (in the suburbs just east of Paris), in the first, strangely peaceful, months of the German occupation. These first two novels seem able to exist independently from each other on first reading. The links between them are rather tenuous; as Némirovsky observes in her notebook, it is the history and not the characters, that unite them.|$|E
25|$|At that time, General Alphonse <b>Juin</b> was {{the chief}} of staff of the French army, but it was General François Sevez who {{represented}} France at Reims on 7 May, while it was General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny who was the leader of the French delegation at Berlin on V-E day, as he was the commander of the French First Army. At the Yalta Conference, Germany had been divided into Soviet, American and British occupation zones, but France was then given an occupation zone in Germany, as well as in Austria and in the city of Berlin. It was not only the role that France played in the war which was recognised, but its important strategic position and significance in the Cold War as a major democratic, capitalist nation of Western Europe in holding back the influence of communism on the continent.|$|E
25|$|Operation Torch {{started on}} 8 November 1942, and {{finished}} on 11 November. In {{an attempt to}} pincer German and Italian forces, Allied forces (American and British Commonwealth), landed in Vichy-held French North Africa {{under the assumption that}} there would be little to no resistance. Nevertheless, Vichy French forces put up a strong and bloody resistance to the Allies in Oran and Morocco, but not in Algiers, where a coup d'état by the French resistance on 8 November succeeded in neutralizing the French XIX Corps before the landing and arresting the Vichy commanders. Consequently, the landings met no practical opposition in Algiers, and the city was captured on the first day along with the entire Vichy African command. After three days of talks and threats, Generals Mark Clark and Dwight Eisenhower compelled the Vichy Admiral François Darlan (and General Alphonse <b>Juin)</b> to order the cessation of armed resistance in Oran and Morocco by French forces on 10–11 November with the provision that Darlan would be head of a Free French administration. During Operation Torch, American, Vichy French and German navy vessels fought the Naval Battle of Casablanca, ending in an American victory.|$|E
