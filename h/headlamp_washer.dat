50|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the Imola Individual there was a {{pre-production}} model made which was used as the basis of the special edition, it featured the Class II front splitter and rear spoiler, special order Imola red Paint, special order Nappa + Anthracite Amaretta interior, SMG gearbox, GSM Phone Kit, <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers</b> and double-spoke polished alloy wheels.|$|R
50|$|It {{is based}} on the Mégane Renault Sport 230 F1 Team R26, but it is 123 kg lighter. Weight {{reduction}} is achieved via the removal of the rear seats and seat belts, passenger airbag and curtain airbags (the driver's airbag remains), climate control (air conditioning remains as standard), rear wash/wipe and heated rear window, front fog lamps, <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers,</b> radio/CD player and most of the soundproofing.|$|R

A new 18 in alloy wheel complements the existing range of 16 inch (steel and alloy) and 17 inch (alloy) designs. V8 models {{are given a}} discreet V8 badge {{at the leading edge}} of both front doors and a new side moulding across the doors.|$|R
50|$|Even more {{important}} to the company's fortunes was 1968's Saab 99. The 99 was the first all-new Saab in 19 years, and unlike its predecessors, severed all ties with the 92. The 99 had many innovations and features that would come to define Saabs for decades: wraparound windscreen, self-repairing bumpers, <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers</b> and side-impact door beams. The design by Sixten Sason was no less revolutionary than the underlying technology, and elements like the Saab hockey stick profile graphic continue to influence Saab design.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, as {{interest}} in auto safety grew, engineers began researching various headlamp cleaning systems. In late 1968, Chevrolet introduced {{high pressure fluid}} <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers</b> {{on a variety of}} their 1969 models. In 1970, Saab Automobile introduced headlight wipers across their product range. These operated on a horizontal reciprocating mechanism, with a single motor. They were later superseded by a radial spindle action wiper mechanism, with individual motors on each headlamp. In 1972, headlamp cleaning systems became mandatory in Sweden.|$|R

25|$|The SC 430 {{featured}} a retractable aluminium hardtop, all-leather interior with brushed-aluminum accents, navigation screen with folding wood panel, and 18-inch aluminium wheels. Chrome Lexus emblems were {{mounted on the}} back of the front seat headrests. The coupe has four seat belts and could technically seat four, but rear-seat space is limited. The hardtop fully retracts in 25 seconds. Standard luxury features include Burl Walnut or Bird's Eye Maple wood trim, a Mark Levinson premium sound system, DVD-based navigation system, and <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers.</b> For additional trunk space, as an option the SC 430 could be equipped with run-flat tires.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, Federal {{lighting}} regulations required headlamps of {{sealed beam}} construction and standard {{size and shape}} on all vehicles, so Accords in North America were equipped with four rectangular headlamp units rather than the aerodynamic composite replaceable-bulb units used on Accords sold outside North America (note European specification imagery). Other Automotive lighting variations included amber front and red rear side marker lights and reflectors in North America, and <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers</b> and a red rear fog lamp for European markets. Japanese-market Accords were unique from all other markets in that they included adjustable ride height control and side view mirrors installed on the mid-forward fenders.|$|R
50|$|DVD {{navigation}} with {{map data}} and remote control is standard on higher specifications, options include a rear seat DVD entertainment system with two headrest monitors, Xenon headlights with <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers,</b> integrated child booster seats, an integrated home link remote control garage door opener, rear-door child-safety locks, {{front and rear}} park assist, power-adjustable front seats with 3-position memory and lumbar support, heated front and rear seats, an integrated grocery bag holder, an integrated sunglass holder, a frameless auto-dimming rear view mirror with rear view mirror compass, a power glass moonroof, 12 volt power outlet in the trunk, leather seats, rear tinted windows, rain sensor and an engine block heater. From MY 2014 onwards, a TFT dashboard replaced the analogue instruments.|$|R
50|$|In the US Saab 9-5 trim levels were: Turbo4, Turbo4 Premium, Turbo6 XWD, and Aero. Turbo4 models {{come with}} a {{turbocharged}} four-cylinder and features that included power adjustable driver and passenger’s seats, leather upholstery, five-spoke alloy wheels, fog lamps, and rain-sensing wipers. The Turbo4 Premium added a panoramic sunroof, <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers,</b> Saab parking assistance, keyless entry and start, memory seats, and 18-inch alloy wheels, while the Turbo6 XWD was powered by a turbocharged six-cylinder engine and features an all-wheel-drive system. The top trim Aero featured 15-spoke “Rotor” 18-inch alloy wheels, leather-trimmed sports seats, a multi-color central information display, Bi-Xenon SmartBeam headlamps, dark titanium-effect interior trim, aluminum sports pedals, a sports-tuned suspension system with real-time damping, and Aero exterior elements.|$|R
5000|$|In 1987, a new {{entry-level}} model badged [...] "Panda Young" [...] {{was added to}} the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769 cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod FIAT 100 engine and producing the same 34 bhp (25 kW) as the more sophisticated 769 cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released; this was based on the standard 4x4, but came with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers,</b> bonnet scoop, [...] "Sisley" [...] badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model due to its popularity.|$|R
25|$|The first Supra Turbo was {{introduced}} in 1987. The inter-cooled, turbo charged version of the 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine boosted power to 230hp (172kW; 233 PS) 240lb·ft (325 N·m). The Turbo model also included an engine oil cooler and integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a limited slip differential (LSD), TEMS, and <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers.</b> A new Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) was optional on both models. Also in 87 a new beige/tan color combination was implemented, and only 1000 models were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin turbo 1G-GT called T-VIS and also included it into the 7M-GT engine as well.|$|R
50|$|The G-Wagen was facelifted in 1990. In 1989, for the 10th {{anniversary of}} the G Model, a new model variant with {{permanent}} 4-wheel drive, a wood-trimmed interior and optional Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) debuted at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. Production began the following April. For 1992, a new sub-series for professional users began production. The civilian model began to offer cruise control, a stainless-steel spare-tire cover, running boards and Burl Walnut wood interior trim. The same year, the 100,000th G Model was built in Graz. In 1994, the model line was officially renamed the G-Class. Ventilated front disc brakes and a driver’s air bag became standard. In 1996 the automatic transmission became an electronically controlled 5-speed unit. <b>Headlamp</b> <b>washers,</b> cruise control and a front passenger’s air bag were added. In 1998, the range-topping G 500 with a 296 hp V 8 was introduced for series production.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{introduction}} of the smooth bumper facelift Nissan also offered the [...] "200SX Executive". This doesn't appear on the car at all but only on the UK vehicle Log Book. The Executive was a locally enhanced specification produced by the UK importer AFG. At launch and as tested by the press it initially had limited slip differential, leather seats (high back seats re-trimmed in UK), leather trimmed steering wheel and gear knob, <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers,</b> air con, sun roof and a multi change CD player in the boot. Some cars that were sold as Executive arrived without sunroof so a local accessory sun roof was fitted during the upgrade. It very quickly lost the CD player and the leather seats for low back seats with adjustable head rests. During the period that the Executive was sold the base model was downgraded to steel wheels. As most cars with steel wheels have had alloy wheels fitted and the grey waffle fabric trim on seats and doors was common, it's no longer easy to tell an Executive from a base model and the log book must be checked. The cabin carpet was now a long [...] "cut" [...] pile in a pale blue.|$|R
50|$|All Acclaims were {{powered by}} the {{transverse-mounted}} all alloy and overhead-cam 1335 cc engine found in the Honda Civic. This engine {{was a member of}} the Honda CVCC family, although the cast alloy rocker cover with Honda branding was replaced with a plain black pressed steel item for the Acclaim to disguise the car's Honda origins. The engine drove the front wheels through either a five-speed manual gearbox or a three-speed Trio-matic (which was a manually selectable automatic transmission) gearbox (the same as the Hondamatic) and the interior was nearly identical (except for the seats). The usual BL trim levels were offered: L, HL, HLS and the top of the range CD, which had front and rear electric windows, chrome bumpers, <b>headlamp</b> <b>washers,</b> 165/70 tyres (the L had 145/80 tyres and the HL & HLS had 155/80 tyres), plastic wheel trims, velour upholstery with seat pockets on the back of the front seats, front seat head restraints and optional air conditioning. The car remained largely the same throughout its production life. A Mark 2 version of the Acclaim came out in 1983 (from VI No. 180415 onwards). The main changes were to the exterior door handles, an electronic digital clock replaced the previous mechanical one, a restyled steering wheel, a restyled gear knob, the rear interior door handles (they were just swapped) and the heater recirculation control, which was moved. Mark 2 HL and HLS cars were better equipped than the earlier ones.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, Cadillac {{offered a}} lower-priced ($53,050) {{companion}} {{model with a}} cloth convertible roof and without the removable aluminum hardtop, and a model including the hardtop at $58,638. By midyear, prices were dropped to $57,813 for the hardtop/convertible and $51,500 for the convertible, which included a $650 Gas Guzzler Tax along with $550 destination charge. The fully integrated cellular telephone, which was equipped from the factory on just 36 cars this year, was available for an additional $1,195. Allanté's bumper-to-bumper new car warranty, seven years and 100000 mi, was three years longer than other Cadillacs, and an additional 50000 mi of coverage. Allanté owners also received a special toll-free number to call for service or concerns. <b>Headlamp</b> <b>washers</b> and dual 10-way Recaro seating remained standard, among other niceties. A driver's side airbag {{was added to the}} leather-wrapped steering wheel, eliminating the telescoping steering wheel [...] - [...] which retained its tilt feature. The analog instrument cluster - introduced the previous year - was standard on the convertible (available at no extra cost on the hardtop/convertible), however, only 358 cars were equipped with the analog cluster. The power mirror control moved from the right of the steering column on the instrument panel to a new location on {{the upper end of the}} driver's door armrest, while the power seat switches (previously mounted on the face of the seat base) were relocated to the lower side trim of the seat base facing the door panels. The 3-channel garage door opener base mounted on the header panel above the windshield was eliminated when a revamped sun visor design was introduced this year. Technological news was the addition of traction control - the first front-wheel drive automobile with a V8 in the world to be equipped as such. The elaborate system was able to cut fuel to up to four cylinders to reduce power and optimize traction. The electronically controlled shock absorbers were retuned to remain in [...] "soft" [...] mode for up to 40 mph. Previously, they entered [...] "normal" [...] mode after just 25 mph. A revised audio system allowed a CD player to be added as standard equipment, along with the cassette player. Of the 2,523 built for 1990, only five were exported - four to Canada and one to Germany. Allanté was available in eight colors this year, the most popular was Euro Red, found on 1,012 cars, while the least chosen was Gray Metallic, with only 28 made. Interior color choices (and production figures) were Charcoal Gray (1,343), Natural Beige (767), and Maroon (413).|$|R
