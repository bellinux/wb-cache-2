5|$|Regardless of {{the causes}} of the Breeders' hiatus, by early 1995 Deal {{believed}} her next album would be a solo one, and at first intended to play all instruments on it <b>herself.</b> <b>Back</b> at her home in Dayton, Ohio, she practiced the drums and initially prepared six songs for recording. Around the same time, she produced some tracks for Guided by Voices at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. While there, Deal used a portion of the studio time to record demos for some of her new songs. As an attempt to distract her sister from her drug problems, Deal recruited Kelley to play on three songs at this initial recording session. Kelley's involvement changed Deal's mind about playing all the instruments herself, and she began to conceptualize the album as a band project.|$|E
