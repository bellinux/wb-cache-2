5|$|Design plays a {{vital role}} in product and brand development, and is of great {{economic}} importance for organisations and companies. Creativity and design in particular (as an activity: design skills, methods and processes) play a growing role in creating products and services with high added value to consumers. Design generates 50% of world <b>export</b> <b>revenue</b> in the creative industries' products (goods and services). The creative industry workforce is 3.1% of total employment in the European Union (EU), which creates a revenue that is 2.6% of the EU gross value. Creative industries have attained an unprecedented average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent across the EU between 2000 and 2005.|$|E

France is Madagascar's main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties to the country. The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets. Imports of such items as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52percent of GDP. The main sources of Madagascar's imports include China, France, Iran, Mauritius and Hong Kong.|$|E

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} thesis is to {{determine}} the effects of a volatile coffee price on Guatemala’s <b>export</b> <b>revenues</b> and analyze the effects on the economic growth. The scope for the thesis is based upon the current situation on the coffee market. The price on coffee has not been as low as it is today in more than a century. This situation is causing large problems in a country like Guatemala when the crop accounts for 22, 9 percent of the total <b>export</b> <b>revenues.</b> To reveal the effects of a volatile coffee price on the <b>export</b> <b>revenues</b> I use a multiple regression model where the <b>export</b> <b>revenues</b> is the dependent variable and the price on coffee, exchange rate and the quantity of coffee produced in Guatemala as the independent variables. The conclusion is that the volatile coffee price has a large effect on the revenues. If the coffee price rises with 1 percent, <b>export</b> <b>revenues</b> will rise with 1, 089 percent, ceteris paribus. The economic growth in Guatemala is also dependent on the coffee production and if the coffee price is low, Guatemala will have a slower economic growth. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

Export taxes comprised 8% to 11% of the Kirchner government's total tax receipts, around two-thirds of which came from soy exports. Taxes on imports and exports increased government spending from 14% to 25% of GDP. However, the import and export taxes have discouraged foreign investment, while high spending has pushed inflation over 20%.|$|E

5|$|During Madagascar's First Republic, France heavily {{influenced}} Madagascar's economic planning and policy {{and served as}} its key trading partner. Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was {{a key factor in}} launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import–export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50percent of the nation's <b>export</b> <b>revenue</b> was spent on debt servicing.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{four major}} {{industries}} shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil. Before {{and after the}} U.S. Civil War the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic driver for the state, thus creating the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major petroleum deposits (Spindletop in particular) that initiated an economic boom which became {{the driving force behind}} the economy for much of the 20th century. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2015, it is second on the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with 54. With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the effects of foreign {{exchange}} rate policy, export credits and export promotion on <b>export</b> <b>revenues.</b> Anti-inflationary policies curb the domestic demand and this leads to lower industrial capacity utilization. Shifting to domestic demand to export markets compensates the decrease in capacity utilization. In the first part of this paper, monetary, fiscal and foreign exchange policies are analyzed based on current account which is the main part of balance of payments. The success and effectiveness of application of these policies play an important role in the credibility of a country with respect to international competition. Besides economic policies, tools of export promotion and export credits are effective in increasing <b>export</b> <b>revenues.</b> In the second part, textile industry will be analyzed. Under these economic indicators, directing export and increasing <b>export</b> <b>revenues</b> become important. Both having export promotion and export credits are expected to increase <b>export</b> <b>revenues.</b> The sufficiency and effectiveness of these economic policies are evaluated with respect to cause and effect relationship [...] Each factor and tool will be analyzed based on their impacts and utilization methods. The rank correlation and chi square analysis will be used to analyze the data.
