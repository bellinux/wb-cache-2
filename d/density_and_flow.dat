50|$|Mayall et al. (2006) {{provides}} the best summary that discusses the causes of sinuosity. Factors involve: flow dynamics such as flow <b>density</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> velocity; {{and the depth of}} the current relative to topography; and topographic and morphological controls such; shape channel cross section, slope topography, erosive base at flow onset and the effects of both lateral stacking and lateral accretion. Compared to their terrestrial cousins, the scale of submarine systems observed in seismic sections, aerial photos and rock outcrops are in no way comparable. As expected with this significant difference in scale, the dynamics of turbid current flows within submarine channels are significantly different from fluvial systems. These differences in dynamics and scale are due to the much lower density contrast between the flow and the host fluid is much lower in submarine channels than that of open channel flows with a free surface. This causes the flow to be significantly super-elevated about the channel margin causing overspill and building the levees.|$|E

50|$|While {{working at}} NBS {{on the problem}} of humans in high {{altitude}} space, Iberall was led into more and more interdisciplinary research using kinetic theory to develop instrumentation covering the major variables of pressure, temperature, <b>density,</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow,</b> both steady state and dynamically changing. Working on the applied problems of the aircraft industry, meteorology, and high altitude military led to his studies of high speed so-called speed-of-sound rates of flow, to more than one phase flow (e.g., gases and liquids), two or more stream flow theory, metastability, solid state metals research both for steady state loads and dynamic (or changing) states. This irrevocably led to the problem of turbulence as distinguished from laminar flow. That also led to the full Navier-Stokes equation set, a nonlinear high ordered mathematical physical construct that still leaves much to be desired in solution. From a homeokinetic perspective, these Navier-Stokes equations connect the lower level atomistic-like components with the upper level collective processes in the material-energetic substance.|$|E
