500|$|Selena Quintanilla {{was born}} on April 16, 1971, in Lake Jackson, Texas. She was the {{youngest}} child of Marcella Ofelia Quintanilla (née Samora) who had Cherokee ancestry and Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., a Mexican American former [...] musician. Selena was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. Quintanilla, Jr. noticed her musical abilities when she was six years old. He told People magazine, [...] "Her timing, her pitch were perfect, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> from day one". In 1980 in Lake Jackson, Quintanilla, Jr. opened his first Tex-Mex restaurant, Papa Gayo's, where Selena and her siblings Abraham III (on bass guitar) and Suzette Quintanilla (on drums) would often perform. The following year, the restaurant was forced to close after a recession caused by the 1980s oil glut. The family declared bankruptcy and were evicted from their home. They settled in Corpus Christi, Texas; Quintanilla, Jr. became manager of the newly formed band Selena y Los Dinos and began promoting it. They needed money and played on street corners, at weddings, at quinceañeras, and at fairs.|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose I hardly {{was like}} my usual self, for I scared her--that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> was right: she must be scared to be won.|$|E
60|$|The figure glided yet nearer, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>it</b> was trembling, and now {{its arms}} were {{extended}} also.|$|R
60|$|He {{was from}} the country. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that. <b>It</b> was written all over him, from his face to his shoes.|$|R
60|$|The man's brow grew {{black with}} anger. He was very angry, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>it</b> was with {{difficulty}} {{he kept his}} hands off me.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't in my head--it's in my heart, my coeur de mere. We guess those things. You think he's selfish. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not the {{slightest}} curiosity that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> {{is enough for}} her that you are to be cured. The rest she leaves to the doctor." ...|$|E
60|$|Further remonstrance {{would be}} useless; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in her face; I {{could hear it}} in her voice. I turned round to open the drawing-room door.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{single man}} in a dog-cart, so far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> Well, <b>it</b> {{certainly}} was not Mr. James Wilder, for there {{he is at the}} door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, you can't see ideas--especially such highly {{ethereal}} ones as mine. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>it</b> myself--that {{would be}} a great step in advance." ...|$|R
60|$|These latter {{words were}} {{addressed}} to Ada, {{who was sitting}} nearest to him. Her face being turned {{away from me and}} towards him, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What's so wonderful?" [...] Gregory retorted. [...] "I {{saw that}} she wanted them that day when the shoe peddler was here. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> and you could." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> in her face, at last clear itself; she put out {{her hand}} {{to me as a}} pledge. [...] "I'll go--I'll go. I'll go this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor dears" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in the toss of her head); [...] "they {{will think}} they know best; {{it is just as}} well not to argue with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rupert was eyeing him sarcastically, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>it</b> {{was on the}} tip of {{his tongue}} to say, inquiringly, [...] "Receiver of stolen goods, perhaps." [...] What he did say was: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess there}} is," [...] said Hannah. [...] "I {{used to think}} that that Wiley was low enough, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him. <b>It</b> was some satisfaction. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> know the worst, anyhow.... I guess it's about time for another flood." ...|$|R
5000|$|Produces {{elaborate}} sentence structures: [...] "The cat ran {{under the}} house before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what color <b>it</b> was." ...|$|R
60|$|He was right. The next ball {{struck the}} rails that ran round the poop, carried away the binnacle, and raked {{the upper deck}} from stern to stem. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> quite plainly with the glass.|$|E
60|$|The gloomy look {{returned}} to Arthur's face: and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> {{was only to}} distract his thoughts that he took his place {{at the side of}} the metaphysical young lady, and resumed their interrupted discussion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, {{on account}} of some other matter--and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was true--she hadn't time. Twenty minutes--she was here less--were all she came to give you. So don't be afraid I've frightened her away. She'll come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|I cast {{my eyes to}} the {{stranded}} vessel--when {{the breach}} and froth of the sea being so big <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> it lay so far off--and considered, Lord! how was it possible <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get on shore? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{pointed to}} the palette lying on his work-table. Different shades of black {{pigments}} were brushed on it. One, in particular, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> gave my eyes a blurring sensation, and I rubbed them and looked again.|$|R
6000|$|I cast my {{eye to the}} {{stranded}} vessel, when, {{the breach}} and froth of the sea being so big, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> it lay so far of; and considered, Lord! how was it possible <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get on shore? ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{label on}} it shone with gold and bright colours. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was figured. The figure {{represented}} a cat, squatting on its haunches. The sacred inscription ran, {{in our own}} tongue, [...] "Old Tom Gin, Unsweetened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Understood what I meant?" [...] she wondered. [...] "He {{was greatly}} moved. That I know! In my own {{agitation}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> But I spoke distinctly. He heard me; he seemed, indeed, {{to hang on}} my words..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you prefer}} {{storming}} works to boarding vessels, {{there is a}} fortress of stone, Mr. Barnstable, which lies directly on our beam. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> through the haze, when I was on the cliffs, stationing the lookout-- and---- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> bear no more. I am a tender-hearted man, and I {{made some}} excuse and got away. From the {{expression}} on the girl's face <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>it</b> was only a question of days before she gave her heart to this romantic newcomer.|$|R
6000|$|I {{know not}} whether Verena was provoked, but she {{answered}} with more spirit than sequence: [...] "Well, {{you know you}} did pour contempt on us, ever so much; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> how <b>it</b> worked Olive up. Are you {{not going to see}} her at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know." [...] Glendenning's face as {{he turned}} to me again was quite white. [...] "It is Mrs. Bentley's farmer," [...] he added, feebly, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>it</b> was with an effort he kept himself from sinking. [...] "Something has happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{she left}} {{it on the table}} where I was sitting, where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> and it is this very one, so I must not look at it; I wish I could do sums as fast as she can.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me steadily, finally. And <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was {{impossible}} for us to understand each other, or {{for me to understand}} him. I could not understand the strange white gleam of his eyes, where it came from.|$|E
60|$|She didn't answer, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> coming, so I {{sat still}} and waited. And {{presently}} {{she seemed to}} make up her mind that, {{even if it was}} no business of mine, it would be a relief to talk about it.|$|E
60|$|I {{dare say}} the young fellow blushed, as any modest lad might have done; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> but <b>I</b> heard the chuckle of {{satisfaction}} that escaped him, as he glanced from his shattered arm and bandaged {{side to the}} pale figure opposite.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> soon <b>see</b> that <b>it</b> {{was to be}} no {{false alarm}} this time, and that the tribes really meant business.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his dilemma. <b>It</b> was {{the best}} man who should go, and yet it {{was the best}} man whom he could least spare.|$|R
