In 1919, he wrote The Economic Consequences of the Peace based on his objections. He wrote that he believed [...] "that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war {{was one of the most}} serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible", and called the treaty a [...] "Carthaginian peace" [...] that would economically affect all of Europe. Keynes said that the treaty's reparation figures [...] "generally exceed Germany's capacity" [...] to pay. He said that [...] was the [...] "safe maximum figure", but even then he did [...] "not believe that [...] pay as much". He said the Reparation Commission was a tool that could [...] "be employed to destroy Germany's commercial and economic organization as well as to exact payment".|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish–American War of 1898 added {{new life}} to the canal debate. During the war, American {{warships}} in the Atlantic seeking to reach battle zones in the Pacific {{had been forced to}} round Cape Horn. Influential naval pundits, such as Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, urged the construction of a Central American canal. In 1902, with the French efforts moribund, US President Theodore Roosevelt backed the Panama route, and Congress passed legislation authorizing him to purchase the French assets on the condition that an agreement was reached with Colombia. In March 1902, Colombia set its terms for such a treaty: Colombia was to be sovereign over the canal, which would be policed by Colombians paid for by the United States. The host nation would receive a larger percentage of the tolls than provided for in earlier draft treaties. The <b>draft</b> <b>terms</b> were quickly rejected by American officials. Roosevelt was in a hurry to secure the treaty; the Colombians, to whom the French property would revert in 1904, were not. Negotiations dragged on into 1903, during which time there was unrest in Panama City and Colón; the United States sent in Marines to guard the trains. Nevertheless, in early 1903, the United States and Colombia signed a treaty which, despite Colombia's previous objections, gave the United States a [...] wide zone in which it could deploy troops with Colombian consent. On August 12, 1903, the Colombian Senate voted down the treaty 24–0.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{one type of}} ex-ante effect {{of the battle of}} the forms: the {{incentive}} to <b>draft</b> reasonable boilerplate <b>terms.</b> It argues that the experience with the battle-of-the-forms rule under the CISG reinforces what we already know, that existing legal solutions do not provide any incentive for the parties to draft reasonable forms. The paper suggests that the goal of inducing parties to <b>draft</b> reasonable <b>terms</b> can be significantly promoted by a third rule, a variant of the “best-shot” rule proposed by Victor Goldberg. Under the version labeled the “reasonable-shot” rule, the court would resolve the battle of the forms by choosing the form that contains the more efficient terms. The paper proposes some guidelines how the “reasonable shot” could be identified by the court, and argues that there are good reasons to expect that this regime would give parties the incentive to <b>draft</b> reasonable <b>terms.</b> In fact, it is plausible that under this rule the parties’ forms would converge and the battle of the forms would cease to exist...|$|R
