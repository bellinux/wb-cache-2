25|$|Dispersal {{of cells}} from the biofilm colony is an {{essential}} stage of the biofilm life cycle. Dispersal enables biofilms to spread and colonize new surfaces.

Biofilm matrix degrading enzymes may be useful as anti-biofilm agents. Recent evidence has shown that a fatty acid messenger, cis-2-decenoic acid, is capable of inducing dispersion and inhibiting growth of biofilm colonies.

Restriction and modification of phages by fi− R factors. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 477 – 486. 1966. —An fi− R factor, which restricts phages λ, T 1, and T 7 without modifying them, {{was found to}} restrict and not to modify an F−-specific phage, W- 31, in Escherichia coli K- 12, but not to restrict phage P- 22 in Salmonella typhimurium LT- 2, whereas other fi− R factors restricted and modified P- 22 but not W- 31; fi+ R factors did not restrict these phages. Transduction and lysogenization with phages λ and P- 22 were reduced by these fi− R factors in K- 12 and LT- 2, respectively, and the transducing phages λ and P- 22 were modified by these fi− R factors. Spontaneous as well as ultraviolet-induced production of phage P- 22 and zygotic induction of phage λ were not significantly affected by any R factor. Injection of the nucleic acids of phages T 1 and λ was not affected by R factors, but the injected phage nucleic acids were rapidly broken down in the bacteria carrying fi− R factors. The nucleic acids of the modified phages were not broken down in these bacteria. It was assumed from these results that the mechanism of restriction of phages by fi− R factors {{is due to the}} breakdown of the injected phage nucleic acids by a <b>deoxyribonuclease(s),</b> presumably located near the cell surface in the cells carrying fi− R factors. The <b>deoxyribonuclease(s),</b> formed in the cells carrying the nonmodifying fi− R factor, is considered to be different from that synthesized in the cells carrying the modifying fi− R factors.
