5000|$|A <b>flower</b> <b>box,</b> a {{receptacle}} (usually {{a ceramic}} pot or urn) or more rarely a stand upon which, or into which, plants may be placed. (The French themselves refer to tabletop versions of such receptacles as cachepots.) [...] Jardinières {{tend to be}} highly decorative and are sometimes used as garden accent elements for large plants and for raised culinary and herb gardens.|$|E

There is also a short dance interlude.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} placed or affixed to an {{accessible}} location so the resident {{of a home}} may easily work with the plants in the container. A <b>flower</b> <b>box</b> may be installed under a window and supported in place by brackets on the wall below, in which case it may be called a window box. Flower boxes may {{also be used to}} line decks, patios, porches, steps, and sidewalks and they can even be hung from railings.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1957, Neosho {{has been}} locally {{well known as}} [...] "The <b>Flower</b> <b>Box</b> City"; that year it earned the All-America City Award for its {{beautification}} efforts. In 1955 the town had received a $5,000 grant from the New York Community Trust for that purpose. Local companies provided lumber at cost, and the Jaycees formed an assembly line to build more than 200 wooden flower boxes. Pet Milk Company donated 400 used wooden barrels for container gardens, and town nurseries supplied plants at reduced rates. The city dressed up trash cans and parking meters around the courthouse square with flower baskets. In 1957 Neosho earned a coveted All-America City Award from Look magazine and the National Municipal League. (The Life magazine photojournalist Wallace Kirkland covered the 1957 city for the magazine. A life collection of his photographs from this assignment, many previously unpublished, {{can be found in}} the Life photo archive, hosted by Google). Since then, the <b>Flower</b> <b>Box</b> Promotion Committee has supported beautification and awarded 'Beauty Spot' prizes each spring and summer to homes and businesses with outstanding yards, flower gardens, and flower boxes.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes, guests {{would bring}} {{bouquets}} of <b>flowers,</b> <b>boxes</b> of candy, (during one story, even a scrapbook or photograph album) or stuffed animals, among other things, as an offering {{to the person}} {{they want to be}} with. Almost inevitably, these would be destroyed by the angered outside party. Sometimes, the bouquet of flowers themselves would be used as a weapon on the interloping adversary.|$|R
50|$|By November, the lot {{was cleared}} and {{the post office}} wall was primed for a future mural. New {{sidewalks}} and other cement work was installed, and decorative stone was laid. The following spring, the project resumed. A custom gazebo was constructed on the cement platform {{in the center of}} the lot, providing covered seating. Trash cans and <b>flower</b> <b>boxes</b> were also placed.|$|R
5000|$|The Six Gallery, {{founded by}} Hedrick, Deborah Remington, John Ryan the poet, Jack Spicer the poet, Hayward King, and David Simpson, was {{previously}} {{known as the}} King Ubu Gallery - a reference to Ubu Roi - which was founded by artist Jess Collins in 1952. Before its association with art and poetry, it was an auto repair shop. In 1995, literary pilgrim Tony Willard wrote of the location, [...] "3119 Fillmore {{stands in the middle}} of block's west side, canary yellow with royal blue awnings, black <b>flower</b> <b>boxes</b> full of exuberant geraniums at the second-story windows. It houses a store called Silkroute International, whose rugs and pillows spill onto the sidewalk." [...] The Gallery's 3119 address no longer exists, but a podium and plaque commemorating the 50th anniversary of the reading of [...] "Howl" [...] stand on the sidewalk in front of a restaurant at 3115 Fillmore. The black <b>flower</b> <b>boxes</b> are still there, without exuberant geraniums.|$|R
50|$|Wood, brick, metal, fiberglass, vinyl, and {{cellular}} PVC {{can all be}} used in <b>flower</b> <b>box</b> construction, with wood being a classical material of choice. A typical wooden container will last 3-5 years before showing signs of rot. With painting and maintenance they can sometimes last 10-15 years. Fiberglass {{has the advantage of}} being lightweight and insect proof. Vinyl {{and cellular}} PVC are plastics which are completely rot proof alternatives to wood which are often used on homes to prevent rot or siding damage.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Neosho" [...] is {{generally}} accepted {{to be of}} Native American (most likely Osage) derivation, meaning [...] "clear, cold water", referring to local freshwater springs. The springs attracted varying cultures of Native American inhabitants for thousands of years. It was also ideal for the later white settlers, who founded the city in 1833. It was incorporated as a municipal government in 1878. Nicknamed [...] "City of Springs", Neosho has long served as an agricultural center and, since 1888, is home of the Neosho National Fish Hatchery, the oldest in the National Fish Hatchery System. It is known locally as the [...] "Gateway to the Ozarks", and since 1957 as [...] "the <b>Flower</b> <b>Box</b> City".|$|E
50|$|He makes 100 to 150 pies a day. DeMarco uses {{imported}} ingredients - flour, {{extra-virgin olive}} oil, San Marzano tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella cheese from Casapulla, freshly grated grana padano (a slightly salty hard cow's milk cheese), {{three types of}} mozzarella cheese, and hand-grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese are all from Italy, and the basil and oregano are from Israel. In a windowsill <b>flower</b> <b>box,</b> he grows thyme, oregano, basil, rosemary, and hot peppers. He cuts fresh basil over each pie {{with a pair of}} kitchen scissors. The pizzas bake for a few minutes at about 800 F. In July 2009, Di Fara raised its price for a plain slice of pizza from $4 to $5, becoming the first $5-a-slice pizza place in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell {{turned her}} old fish shack into a {{personal}} space and built large <b>flower</b> <b>boxes</b> around her studio, allowing morning glory and Madeira vines {{to grow up}} to the roof. Her studio's garden became a local attraction and she hosted teas for which she made homemade candy. During this time Lazzell produced white-line prints and flower monoprints and she taught painting and block printing classes.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "temporary" [...] {{memorial}} {{was erected}} {{at the site}} in 1918 by Charles Higham. The original memorial consisted of a painted concrete obelisk, with bronze plaques and wreath, and concrete <b>flower</b> <b>boxes</b> to either side. After the council proposed landscaping work at Islington Green, it became clear in 2004 that the old memorial needed to be replaced, and it was demolished in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Hillmont, {{also known}} as the Armstrong-Moltz House and Greystone Inn, is a {{historic}} home located at Lake Toxaway, Transylvania County, North Carolina. It was built about 1915, and is a large 2 1/2-story, board and batten sheathed square block with two rambling stone additions. It features <b>flower</b> <b>boxes</b> on all windows, balconies, and casement windows, which give an impression of Swiss-chalet design. It was rehabilitated as the Greystone Inn in the mid-1980s.|$|R
50|$|Stuart Meeson {{also has}} a very keen {{interest}} in amateur horticulture. He {{is a member of}} many UK based horticultural societies and exhibits regularly at their horticultural shows. He was awarded the RHS Banksian Medal at the Dogmersfield, Winchfield and Crookham Village Horticultural Show 2010. In 2011 he was awarded the Ernie Self Novice Trophy at the Orchid Society of Great Britain (OSGB) Autumn Show. Later in 2014 he was awarded the RHS Banksian Medal at the OSGB Spring Show and a Certificate of Appreciation for orchid Masdevallia mendozae 'Mullus' by the RHS Orchid Committee in March 2015. At the 25th Anniversary Show he was awarded an RHS Gold medal and Best <b>Flower</b> <b>Box</b> at RHS Hampton Court Palace Flower Show 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The Big Treehouse covers 5,000 {{square feet}} and has 12 levels that go up to {{five and a half}} stories tall. The first 11 levels can be traversed via a 60-step spiral staircase, while a ladder is needed to ascend to the final level. Various levels have tables, birdwatching, {{meditation}} facilities, and views. It has electrical and telephone service, as well as several porch swings, and a microwave oven. It also includes a 50 ft long <b>flower</b> <b>box,</b> rope lights, and a grill. There are models of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway bridge and the Marsh Rainbow Arch Bridge that can both be crossed by visitors. A skyway, styled [...] "Skywalk 2000", winds around the tenth level, the spiral staircase, and the model of the Rainbow Bridge.|$|E
50|$|Rhytidiadeplhus loreaus is a {{beautiful}} decorative moss. Its many uses range from placement in store windows, material to build figurines or could {{be placed in a}} hanging <b>flower</b> <b>box.</b> It can also be used in Christmas decorations. It has become a very commercialized and successful product that has fueled a rapidly increasing demand for natural decorations. Florists have created mosseries where moss such as Lanky Moss is grown commercially and then packaged and sold to floral shops who wish to use the moss in displays or floral arrangements. The aesthetic appreciation for moss has grown in popularity with the emergence of Japanese gardening and commercialized landscaping. Moss needs little maintenance, which makes it a perfect lawn or garden substitute. Because of its high water retention and drought resistance capabilities, Lanky Moss is an environmentally friendly as well as cost affective alternative to grass lawns. A downside to moss is that it can inhibit new tree growth by possibly suffocating seedling success and blocking any available water to enter the root systems. All in all, Rhytidiadelphus loreau is a key component of a healthy, sustainable ecosystem.|$|E

The result was a yard with no grass, as the entire front and back yards were covered with cement. When asked why he did it, John simply answered, [...] "I got sick of mowing the grass." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ruehl's {{storefront}} {{was meant}} to resemble a series of brownstone buildings, with concrete walkways, hedges, <b>flower</b> <b>boxes,</b> and iron gates at the front door. The interior was sectioned off into numerous bedrooms, living rooms, and conservatories meant to mimic {{the interior of a}} home. Bookshelves lined the [...] "living room", chandeliers hung from the ceiling of the [...] "bedrooms", portraits sat on the floor, tilted against walls, and a central hallway divided the store in half.|$|R
