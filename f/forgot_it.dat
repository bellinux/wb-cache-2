25|$|Vladimir Peter Tytla {{was born}} on October 25, 1904 in Yonkers, New York. His Ukrainian {{immigrant}} parents reportedly recognized talent in their son and encouraged it. In 1914, when Tytla was 9, he visited Manhattan to attend Gertie the Dinosaur, an animated vaudeville act by Winsor McCay. He never <b>forgot</b> <b>it,</b> and some say it changed his life forever.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2001, Feist self-produced seven songs at home which she called The Red Demos, which have never been {{released}} commercially. She spent {{more than two years}} touring throughout Europe with Gonzales. In that same year she joined a group of old friends in forming a new version of Toronto indie rock group Broken Social Scene, adding vocals to many tracks after being forbidden to play guitar by de facto bandleader Kevin Drew. She subsequently recorded You <b>Forgot</b> <b>It</b> in People with the band. While on tour in Europe with Gonzales, they began recording new versions of her home recorded Red Demos, which would later become her major label debut Let It Die. Let It Die featured both original compositions and covers, and Feist has been noted both as a songwriter and as an innovative interpreter of other artists' songs.|$|E

She studied the language as a child but <b>forgot</b> <b>it</b> as {{she grew up}} and rose to fame. Beyoncé was planning to take Spanish lessons because she had learn the language again and then the song by imitating the sounds. She stated: [...] "I had the best coach; I did it phonetically, every sentence I recorded maybe four times." [...] A [...] "Making of ..." [...] video was created while Beyoncé was recording the song with Fernández. While creating the song, Beyoncé had producer Rudy Perez coach her in her Spanish, as {{she did not want to}} misrepresent the language.|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} approached, word spread that Georgia Tech was insisting that Ward not play, {{and that the}} {{administration}} might capitulate to the demand. Ward’s right to play became a major controversy on the campus. Mass meetings and demonstrations were held. [...] Some students and faculty demanded that either Ward must play or the game should be canceled. [...] Petitions were circulated, and formal protests were lodged with the university by the Ann Arbor Ministerial Association, the NAACP, the National Student League and many other groups. [...] The student newspaper, the Michigan Daily opined: “If the athletic department <b>forgot</b> <b>it</b> had Ward on its football team when it scheduled a game with Georgia Tech, it was astonishingly forgetful; ... if it was conscious of Ward's being on the team but scheduled the game anyway, it was extraordinarily stupid." ...|$|E
500|$|Raynor {{was also}} {{inspired}} by the issue of World War I soldiers who were executed for cowardice when they were suffering from shellshock. One of the episode's working titles was [...] "Soldier's Heart", an American Civil War term for shellshock. The final title recalls an infamous order from Field Marshal Douglas Haig on 11 April 1918, {{in response to the}} German Spring Offensive, which included the phrase: [...] "Every position must be held to the last man: there must be no retirement". This policy led shell-shocked soldiers, like the fictional Tommy, to be sent back to war after a very short recuperation period. Director Andy Goddard felt that a scene in which Tommy watches footage of the Iraq War was key to the episode; this experience tells Tommy that the human condition has not changed since 1918 and that humanity still makes the same mistakes. During the episode, Jack suggests that the British army executed [...] "more than 300" [...] shell-shocked soldiers for cowardice during the First World War. Executions for all offences numbered 346, of which 40 were for murder or mutiny. The remaining 306 were for desertion (266), cowardice (18), and other offences (22). While some of these can now be attributed to shell shock, most cannot, although all 306 were posthumously pardoned in 2006. Early drafts of the episode included Tommy asking for Suzie Costello, a member of the Torchwood Institute who had committed suicide in the series' 2006 premiere episode. In regards to the sensitive material in the episode, actress Naoko Mori stated that whilst reading the script she [...] "kind of <b>forgot</b> <b>it</b> was Torchwood and [...] it was science-fiction". She found the climax of the episode [...] "heartbreaking".|$|E

He probably knew this would have been his last chance to remain in Europe. As he had done numerous times during the last ten years, he asked my mother to return with him to Moscow. Although he knew the general situation was bad, he nevertheless described to her the comfortable life that the family could have there together. It was the last opportunity my mother had to give a negative answer, and she never <b>forgot</b> <b>it.</b> Perhaps it helped her later on to be proven completely right in her fears and her total lack of confidence in the Soviet Union. My mother described to me these last conversations with my father many times." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 14, 1814, McDonald {{died in a}} {{military}} hospital in Batavia, New York from health complications caused by a [...] "very long and trying" [...] forced march. McDonald's final messages along with his belongings, which included his sword and sash, were delivered {{to his mother and}} children at [...] "Glengarry" [...] by his colleague and friend, Colonel John Strother, who had been present at McDonald's death. The McDonald family was very grateful to Strother for his actions and the two families remained close. Fifty years later, during the American Civil War, McDonald's son Colonel Angus William McDonald interceded on Strother's behalf when he was arrested by McDonald's Confederate squad for treason in August 1861. McDonald said of Strother, [...] "he had been kind to my father, was his fellow soldier, tended him on his death-bed and was kind to me as his son.

2500|$|Davis {{nearly died}} in an {{automobile}} accident on November 19, 1954, in San Bernardino, California, as he was making a return trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. During the previous year, he had started a friendship with comedian and host Eddie Cantor, who had given him a mezuzah. Instead of putting it by his door as a traditional blessing, Davis wore it around his neck for good luck. The only time he <b>forgot</b> <b>it</b> was the night of the accident. The accident occurred at a fork in U.S. Route 66 at Cajon Boulevard and Kendall Drive (...) [...] Davis lost his left eye to the bullet-shaped horn button (a standard [...] feature in 1954 and 1955 Cadillacs) as a result. His friend, actor Jeff Chandler, said he would give one of his own eyes if it would keep Davis from total blindness. Davis wore an eye patch for at least six months following the accident. He was featured with the patch on the cover of his debut album and appeared on What's My Line? wearing the patch (March 13, 1955). Later, he was fitted for a glass eye, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
2500|$|Mihai Eminescu died at 4am, on 15 June 1889 at the Caritas Institute, a {{sanatorium}} run by Dr. Suțu {{and located}} on Plantelor Street Sector 2, Bucharest. Eminescu's last wish was {{a glass of}} milk, which the attending doctor slipped through the metallic peephole of the [...] "cell" [...] where he spent the last hours of his life. In response to this favor he {{was said to have}} whispered, [...] "I'm crumbled". The next day, on 16 June 1889 he was officially declared deceased and legal papers to that effect were prepared by doctors Suțu and Petrescu, who submitted the official report. This paperwork is seen as being ambiguous, because the poet's cause of death is not clearly stated and there was no indication of any other underlying condition that may have so suddenly resulted in his death. In fact both the poet's medical file and autopsy report indicate symptoms of a mental and not physical disorder. Moreover, at the autopsy performed by Dr. Tomescu and then by Dr. Marinescu from the laboratory at Babeș-Bolyai University, the brain could not be studied, because a nurse inadvertently <b>forgot</b> <b>it</b> on an open window, where it quickly decomposed.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rabbi Nehemiah, {{this is how}} the {{exchange}} went: Moses asked Aaron why he had not eaten the sacrifice. Moses asked Aaron whether perhaps the blood of the sacrifice had entered the innermost sanctuary, but Aaron answered that its blood had not entered into the inner sanctuary. Moses asked Aaron whether perhaps the blood had passed outside the sanctuary courtyard, but Aaron replied that it had not. Moses asked Aaron whether perhaps the priests had offered it in bereavement, and thus disqualified the offering, but Aaron replied that his sons had not offered it, Aaron had. Thereupon Moses exclaimed that Aaron should certainly have eaten it, as Moses had commanded in [...] that they should eat it in their bereavement. Aaron replied with [...] and argued that perhaps what Moses had heard was that it was allowable for those in mourning to eat the special sacrifices for the Inauguration of the Tabernacle, but not the regular ongoing sacrifices. For if [...] instructs that the tithe, which is of lesser holiness, cannot be eaten in mourning, how much more should that prohibition apply to sacrifices like the sin-offering that are more holy. When Moses heard that argument, he replied with [...] that it was pleasing to him, and he admitted his error. Moses did not seek to excuse himself by saying that he had not heard the law from God, but admitted that he had heard it and <b>forgot</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
