40|$|We {{consider}} <b>interruptible</b> electricity <b>contracts</b> {{issued by}} a distributor of electricity, {{that allow for}} interruptions to electric service in exchange for either an overall reduction {{in the price of}} electricity delivered, or for financial compensation at the time of interruption. We provide an equilibrium model to determine electricity prices, based on stochastic models of supply and demand. In the context of this model we quantify the value of <b>interruptible</b> <b>contracts</b> and describe the optimal interruption strategy. Our numerical results indicate that, in a deregulated, competitive, market, <b>interruptible</b> <b>contracts</b> can alleviate supply The market {{for one of the most}} important commodities in today’s economic environment, electricity, has recently undergone significant changes.

30|$|There are {{two types}} of {{programs}} for the application of DSI: price-based programs and incentive-based programs [37, 38]. In price-based programs, consumers adjust their energy consumption about the changes in electricity market price. In contrast, the latter is provided through curtailment or <b>interruptible</b> <b>contracts</b> where consumers are paid to shift or reduce their energy consumption [37].|$|R
40|$|In today's {{competitive}} marketplace, many {{electrical energy}} consumers {{are encouraged to}} enter into <b>interruptible</b> or cogeneration <b>contracts</b> by their electrical utility. <b>Interruptible</b> <b>contracts</b> provide year-round cost savings for the consumer, and defer costly infrastructure expansion for the utility. In some cases, existing generators and controls can be upgraded or modified for paralleling with the utility. In new installations, there are literally dozens of options available for generator operation. This paper {{provides an overview of}} generators, relaying and controls. Typical operational procedures are discussed to provide a framework for optimizing generator performance. Additionally, methods of providing electrical protection and control for generators are discussed for small and large generator applications at low and medium voltages.

40|$|In most IEA Member countries, {{natural gas}} demand varies {{strongly}} during the year, according to temperature. Flexibility {{is needed to}} cover seasonal swings and variations in gas demand, especially for household customers. It is also needed to maintain short-term supply security {{in the case of}} a disruption of a supply source. Over the years, gas companies have devised a variety of flexibility tools, such as supply swing, storage and <b>interruptible</b> <b>contracts.</b> This enabled them to balance supply and demand by modifying volumes. Today, market liberalisation encourages the development of hubs and spot markets, where supply and demand can be balanced by the pricing mechanism. As a result, flexibility services are now offered and priced independently from the gas itself. Opportunities for arbitrage between gas and electricity have also emerged in countries where both sectors have been liberalised" [...] P. [4] of cover...|$|R
40|$|Many large {{industrial}} consumers of electricity purchase power through special <b>interruptible</b> <b>contracts</b> or curtailable tariffs. Historically, {{the number of}} actual interruptions has been very small -many interruptible consumers have never been required to curtail their usage, and may be assuming that interruptions will never occur. This situation {{is largely due to}} the glut of electric generating capacity that exists today in the United States -generally speaking, there is enough generation available to serve all firm customers and all interruptible customers most of the time. However, this glut will likely disappear in the next few years, meaning that interruptible consumers will be required to suffer more interruptions in the near term. Industrials subject to these interruptions should work now toward mitigating the possibility of interruptions and planning their operations so that interruptions can be avoided or sustained with minimal impact. This paper describes methods available to avoid and manage interruptions...|$|R
40|$|Assuring {{appropriate}} {{levels of}} generation capacity adequacy at the minimum possible cost using market-based approaches is a contemporary issue attracting much attention in deregulated power systems. Introduction of <b>interruptible</b> electricity <b>contracts</b> {{could provide a}} possible solution to such a problem. However, theoretical frameworks for examining the impacts of these contractual arrangements on system operations have not been maturely developed. This paper presents a probabilistic production simulation based framework for modeling and analyzing <b>interruptible</b> electricity <b>contracts.</b> The interdependence between the pricing models of interruptible electric power and {{the operations of the}} whole system is addressed and solved by an iterative coordinating algorithm. The probabilistic production simulation framework allows the uncertainties inherent in both the forced outages of generators and system load demand at the contract delivery time to be taken into account. The proposed approach is capable of achieving comprehensive analysis and systematic pricing for interruptible electric power. A numerical case study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and validity of the methodology. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R

30|$|A {{model for}} {{evaluating}} <b>contracts</b> with <b>interruptible</b> loads {{is described in}} [14], and a program for managing interruptible loads considering distinct generation contingencies is formulated. The integration of renewable energy generation schemes into <b>interruptible</b> <b>contracts</b> is studied in [15]. In [16], a scheme for incentive DR programs that enables the DR provider to compute individual demand curtailments and DR rewards while preserving customers’ privacy. An energy efficient optimization model which offers incentives to end users curtailing their energy use during times of peak demand is reported in [17]. To benefit a customer by minimizing electricity cost, the proposed model optimally schedules the electricity consumption of different household appliances in a dynamic pricing environment. An implementation of DR to improve network reliability proposed in [18] uses a non-linear mathematical model of the incentive DR programs to identify the most reliable and conservative responsive model. An incentive mechanism to promote the participation of distribution companies in DR energy efficiency programs is proposed in [19]. The model allows studying {{the effect of the}} payments scheme incorporating uncertainty.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the cold}} weather in the Northern Hemisphere, the Christmas and holiday season (as well as {{the second half of}} winter) is a time of {{increased}} use of fuel for domestic heating. This has prompted concerns in the United Kingdom {{about the possibility of a}} shortage in the domestic gas supply. However, in the event of an exceptionally long cold season, it is industrial users, signed on to <b>interruptible</b> supply <b>contracts,</b> who would find themselves without gas supply.|$|R
40|$|After the {{deregulation}} of electricity industries {{on the premise}} of increasing economic efficiency, market participants {{have been exposed to}} financial risks due to uncertain energy prices. Using time-series analysis and the real options approach, we focus on modelling energy prices and optimal decision-making in energy projects. Since energy prices are highly volatile with unexpected spikes, capturing this feature in reduced-form models leads to more informed decision-making in energy investments. In this thesis, non-linear regime-switching models and models with mean-reverting stochastic volatility are compared with ordinary linear models. Our numerical examples suggest that with the aim of valuing a gas-fired power plant, non-linear models with stochastic volatility, specifically for logarithms of electricity prices, provide better out-of-sample forecasts. Among a comprehensive scope of mitigation measures for climate change, CO 2 capture and sequestration (CCS) plays a potentially significant role in industrialised countries. Taking the perspective of a coal-fired power plant owner that may decide to invest in either full CCS or partial CCS retrofits given uncertain electricity, CO 2, and coal prices, we develop an analytical real options model that values the choice between the two technologies. Our numerical examples show that neither retrofit is optimal immediately, and the optimal stopping boundaries are highly sensitive to CO 2 price volatility. Taking the perspective of a load-serving entity (LSE), on the other hand, we value a multiple-exercise <b>interruptible</b> load <b>contract</b> that allows the LSE to curtail electricity provision to a representative consumer multiple times for a specified duration at a defined capacity payment given uncertain wholesale electricity price. Our numerical examples suggest that interruption is desirable at relatively high electricity prices and that uncertainty favours a delay in interrupting. Moreover, we show that a deterministic approximation captures most {{of the value of the}} <b>interruptible</b> load <b>contract</b> if the volatility is low and the exercise constraints are not too severe. ...|$|R
30|$|Significant {{differences}} exist between electricity markets and gas {{markets in the}} United States. Though both markets have been deregulated, their structures are quite distinct. In deregulated electricity markets, the supply of electricity is organized through a day-ahead and real-time market, with the former operating on a 24 -hour time-scale and the latter clearing anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes depending on the geographical location. At the wholesale level, a centralized balancing authority such as the ISO supervises the operation of these markets. And in each market, the offers made and schedules posted depend significantly {{on the availability of}} power generation as well as electricity demand. On the natural gas side, there are capacity markets and commodity markets, for buying NG quantities and buying NG transportation, respectively. Market contracts pertaining to the gas industry can be classified as firm or <b>interruptible.</b> Firm <b>contracts</b> are long term and are typically used by Local Distribution Companies (LDC). Moreover, these contracts incur an additional reservation price which pays off investment in pipeline infrastructure. <b>Interruptible</b> <b>contracts</b> are flexible and typically used by GFGs [2]. Unlike the electricity market, gas markets do not have an ISO but are rather deregulated entirely in which the spot markets consist of bilateral contracts between the gas marketer and consumers (utilities or GFGs obtain gas off this market). Given the above significant differences between the gas and electricity infrastructures, and the growing reliance of the electricity sector on natural gas, it is imperative that the effect of this reliance be explored in a quantitative manner. The focus of this paper is thus to examine how changes in the electricity sector, specifically increased renewable penetration, impact gas market factors such as gas price and volatility in GFG bids for gas. Traditional models of the electricity infrastructure and markets have aimed to maximize net social benefits or minimize costs across an optimized electricity network [3]. Research investigations have examined the changing generation mix including the impact of renewable generation on the electric grid as a whole and wholesale markets in particular. For example, the New England States Committee on Electricity, or NESCOE, explored the impacts of various scenarios of increased renewable capacity on the electric transmission in New England [4]. Econometric models have been explored in [5, 6] to determine wind generation impacts on electricity prices and price volatility, mostly examining the merit-order effect that increased wind penetration has on the grid. Reference [7] looks into the relationship between wind power feed-in to the grid and wholesale electricity price. In contrast, the focus {{of this paper is to}} examine the growing role of natural gas within the electric grid, especially in light of this increased renewable generation, and how it impacts natural gas markets and in turn wholesale electricity markets in New England.|$|R
40|$|Wind-power {{penetration}} in {{many cases}} faces significant barriers due to limited transmission capability. In Greece (and in most countries in Europe), the guaranteed access to the grid offered to wind parks, {{in conjunction with the}} existing planning practices, has led to severe limitations in wind power installed in certain congested areas. This paper presents some simple ideas that are currently being applied to the Hellenic Interconnected System, in order to increase the wind-power penetration. The main concept is the introduction of <b>interruptible</b> generator <b>contracts</b> and the control of the power flow through congested corridors by issuing power reduction commands, whenever security limits are violated. The proposed control is implemented using common PLCs of low cost and the existing SCADA system, and is both simple and transparent. The paper presents also a methodology {{to assess the impact of}} the proposed techniques on the wind penetration achieved. © 2004 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. internationale. International audienceA {{large number}} of {{applications}} {{in such areas as}} diagnosis or path planning, use more and more anytime algorithms for which the quality of results increases with computation time. Two types of anytime algorithm exist <b>interruptible</b> and <b>contract</b> algorithms. An <b>interruptible</b> algorithm can be stopped at any time, while for a contract algorithm, a mandatory computation time is required. Using this type of algorithm in a real time application introduces a new set of timed constraints (e. g. dealines). We propose, in this paper, the definition of a new entity called Resource Manager. Its aim is to share the processor among the different types of tasks (non-anytime, anytime interruptible or anytime with contract) so that every deadlines are respected. This algorithm uses an acceptation test based on Earliest Deadline First policy, without explicit computation of the response times. || Un grand nombre d'applications dans certains domaines comme le diagnostic ou la recherche de trajectoire utilise de plus en plus des algorithmes "anytime" tels que la qualité de leurs résultats s'accroit en fonction du temps de calcul.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel congestion management protocol applicable for both purebilateral and hybrid market structure. The mechanism {{is based on}} an <b>Interruptible</b> Physical Transmission <b>Contract,</b> which guarantees physical access to the transmission network users and provides financial incentives for the bilateral contract holders to forfeit the physical access to the transmission network. The contract specifies a financial reimbursement payable to the insured if the system operator dispatch requires a curtailment of a bilateral contract involving an injection into and withdrawal of power at a specified set of nodes. The insurer is compensated {{in the form of an}} insurance premium for providing the service. The contract is structured such that the reimbursement payable to the insured party equals the actual loss incurred so that the insured party is “made whole ” with the insurance payment. Similarly, when the insurer is the System Operator itself, it tries to dispatch the generators such that the aggregate insurance reimbursements payable to the insured parties is minimized. In this way, the transmission contract mechanism ensures that a near optimal curtailment policy coincides with the efficient dispatch in the system...|$|R
40|$|Early in 2011 {{a report}} was {{commissioned}} by Transpower New Zealand Limited and the Ministry of Science and Innovation into Smart Grid in a New Zealand context. In New Zealand, plans for a Smart Grid will likely differ from those in other countries. This is because New Zealand is starting from a different position {{than the rest of}} the world. For example, the generation mix in New Zealand is fairly unique compared with other countries, with New Zealand having a large renewable base compared with many countries having a large thermal base capacity. In addition, many countries see load management as an area Smart Grids could improve their system. In the New Zealand context direct control is already widely used via ripple control of hot water heating and <b>contracted</b> <b>interruptible</b> load. However, it must be said that ripple control system would now be considered low spec by today’s standards and regulatory and market drivers have over recent years resulted in a general erosion of capabilities. Thus there is a need for the industry to become pro-active in this and other Smart Grid areas. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the main findings of the report and to present this information to a wider audience than might otherwise see it. For those who are interested, the full report can be found in [1]. The paper begins by examining what progress has been made toward Smart Grids in other countries and the progress of smart grid standards. This is followed by an overview of some of the significant steps towards a smart grid that have been made in New Zealand. The paper then finishes with some concluding remarks...|$|R
40|$|A quasi-optimal {{technique}} ('quasi' in {{that the}} technique discards unreasonable optimums), realized by a dynamically evolving mixed integer program, is used to develop regional electric power maintenance and production schedules for a two to five year planning horizon. This sophisticated, yet computationally feasible, method is used to develop the bulk dispatch schedules required to meet electric power demands at a given reliability level while controlling the associated dollar costs and environmental impacts. The electric power system considered is a power exchange pool of closely coupled generation facilities supplying a region approximately the size of New England. Associated with a tradeoff between a given cost of production and the relevant ecological factors, an optimum production schedule is formulated which considers fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, gas turbine and pumped storage generation facilities; power demands, reliabilities, maintenance and nuclear refueling requisites; labor coordination, geographic considerations, as well as various contracts such as interregional power exchanges, <b>interruptible</b> loads, gas <b>contracts</b> and nuclear refueling contracts. A prerequisite of the model was that it be flexible enough {{for use in the}} evaluation of the optimum system performance associated with hypothesized expansion patterns. Another requirement was that the effects of changed scheduling factors could be predicted, and if necessary corrected with a minimum computational effort. A discussion of other possible optimization techniques is included, however, this study was primarily intended as a development of a static procedure; a dynamic technique counterpart with a more probabilistic. approach is being undertaken as a Part II of this study and at its conclusion the two techniques will be compared. Although the inputs are precisely defined, this paper does not deal explicitly with any of the fabrications of the required inputs to the model. Rather, it is meant as a method of incorporating those inputs into the optimum operation schedule process.
