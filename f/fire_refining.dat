40|$|Butte, Montana is {{the host}} to a Cu-Mo {{porphyry}} deposit {{and has been a}} location of mining interest since 1864. Once copper ore is removed from this deposit it goes through a smelting process. Copper smelting processes consist of roasting, smelting, concentrating, and <b>fire</b> <b>refining.</b> During smelting, metals are separated from the waste, or gangue material. Slag is the waste material from these processes. Non-ferrous slag, such as a copper ore, removes iron and silica from the original ore. There is much interest in slag postproduction for there is often still a significant weight percent of metals trapped within a silica matrix. Slag in this study is from the Butte Reduction Works (BRW) copper smelter that started operation in 1886. The slag walls were constructed alongside Silver Bow Creek starting in 1894, in a now superfund site called Lower Area One, and have never been geochemically analyzed. The main goals of this study were to characterize the mineralogy, chemical composition, and environmental geochemistry of the slag walls in Lower Area One. The composition of BRW slag is dominated by Fe, Ca and Si. Silicates in the olivine and pyroxene groups, glass, and magnetite are the most abundant solid phases found in BRW slag. Olivine occurs as feather-shaped crystals that often grew within interstitial spaces. Some samples contain more than one olivine type: an Fe-rich olivine approximating fayalite (Fe 2 SiO 4) and an Fe-Ca olivine approximating kirschsteinite (CaFeSiO 4). Pyroxenes occur as prismatic crystals that often radiate out from sulfide droplets like sunrays. More than one pyroxene type was consistent throughout these samples, a hedenbergite (CaFeSi 2 O 6) as well as a Ca-Fe rich pyroxene with the approximate formula Ca 3 FeSi 4 O 12. The olivines and pyroxenes are rich in metal impurities, including Zn, Mn, and Cu. Magnetite is abundant as euhedral grains disseminated through the slag, and the slag itself is magnetic. Sulfides and other metallic compounds occur as tiny spheres, or “prills”, which are remnants of the molten Cu-sulfide matte that failed to separate from the slag during smelting. The main sulfides in the prills are bornite and chalcocite, commonly intergrown in an exsolution texture. Other prill phases include chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, and pyrrhotite. Based on bulk chemical composition, some metals in the slag, including Fe, As, Co, Mn, Pb, Zn, and W, exceed USEPA screening levels for residential and/or urban soils. The BRW slag is not acid-generating, and instead has significant acid neutralizing potential in the form of Ca-olivine and Ca-pyroxene. TCLP and SPLP tests indicate an overall low potential to leach metals from the slag, although one sample exceeded the TCLP standard for lead. Concentrations of dissolved As and W were elevated in the SPLP leachates, possibly due to the high pH of the solutions after interaction with the slag. Interaction of BRW slag with Silver Bow Creek water gave variable results: some metals (e. g., Zn, Fe) showed a decrease in dissolved concentration whereas others (e. g., As, W) increased. Dissolved copper concentration increased after interacting Silver Bow Creek water with one slag sample but decreased slightly in the other two samples. These contrasting results are explained by heterogeneity in the composition and mineralogy of the BRW slag. Because Silver Bow Creek passes directly through the BRW slag walls, there is a possibility of release of certain metals from the slag to the stream water...|$|E

60|$|One remark of Mr. Max Muller's fortifies these opinions. If fetichism be indeed {{one of the}} {{earliest}} factors of faith in the supernatural; if it be, in its rudest forms, most powerful in proportion to other elements of faith among the least cultivated races (and that Mr. Muller will probably allow)--among what class of cultivated peoples will it longest hold its ground? Clearly, among the least cultivated, among the fishermen, the shepherds of lonely districts, the peasants of outlying lands--in short, among the people. Neglected by sacred poets in the culminating period of purity in religion, it will linger among the superstitions of the rustics. There is no real break in the continuity of peasant life; the modern folklore is (in many points) the savage ritual. Now Mr. Muller, when he was minimising the existence of fetichism in the Rig Veda (the oldest collection of hymns), admitted its existence in the Atharvana (p. 60). {241} On p. 151, we read 'the Atharva-veda-Sanhita is a later collection, containing, besides a large number of Rig Veda verses, some curious relics of popular poetry connected with charms, imprecations, and other superstitious usages.' The italics are mine, and are meant to emphasise this fact:--When we leave the sages, the Rishis, and look at what is popular, look at what that class believed which of savage practice has everywhere retained so much, we are at once among the charms and the fetiches! This is precisely what one would have expected. If the history of religion and of mythology is to be unravelled, we must examine what the unprogressive classes in Europe have in common with Australians, and Bushmen, and Andaman Islanders. It is the function of the people to retain in folklore these elements of religion, which it is the high duty of the sage and the poet to purify away in the <b>fire</b> of <b>refining</b> thought. It is for this very reason that ritual has (though Mr. Max Muller curiously says that it seems not to possess) an immense scientific interest. Ritual holds on, with the tenacity of superstition, to all that has ever been practised. Yet, when Mr. Muller wants to know about origins, about actual ancient practice, he deliberately turns to that 'great collection of ancient poetry' (the Rig Veda) 'which has no special reference to sacrificial acts,' not to the Brahmanas which are full of ritual.|$|R

It is an opinion piece intended to stimulate discussion. Whilst structural fire engineering knowledge may be relatively underdeveloped compared to other engineering disciplines, the industry has made great progress in recent decades in understanding and analysing fire behaviour and the response of structures, as well as developing fire protection products that can be accurately specified to meet performance criteria. In addition, through modern fire and risk engineering there are also methods to establish the appropriate fire resistance rating for a building (or element) based on risk profile, fire loading, building fabric and potential ventilation amongst other things. It is the objective of many within the industry for structural fire engineering to become an integrated part of the design process, ultimately leading to safer and more efficient structures. However, this paper questions whether current structural fire resistance design methods achieve the consistent level of crudeness required for this, or whether the means by which structural performance in fire is quantified, standard fire resistance, represents a weak link that undermines the entire process. Although the concept of standard fire resistance, benchmarked against performance under normalised furnace test heating regimes, is useful in that it allows for the comparison necessary to safeguard consistency across products, design methods and geographies, the historic 15 -min fire resistance increments (for example 60, 75, 90 min) result in inconsistent levels of safety. Refined grades, as in fact already allowed under fire resistance testing standards, would yield significant benefits for reliability and design efficiency. The paper uses hypothetical case studies to exhibit the merits of <b>refined</b> <b>fire</b> resistance grades and explains how implementing the enhanced classification system may be readily achievable...|$|R

Osnovna karakteristika ovih vozila je u tome da se vatrogasni kontejner postavlja na specijalno podvozje pomoću trajno ugrađenog hidrauličnog krana. Tako se vatrogascima omogućuje efikasna zašita ili gašenje požara sa samo jednim podvozjem i s nekoliko specijalnih kontejnera u vatrogasnoj postrojbi. Broj i vrsta kontejnera koji se mogu «navlačiti « na isto podvozje ograničeni su samo nosivošću podvozja i «navlakača», a određuju ih iskustvo stručnjaka postrojbe (sukladno procjeni ugroženosti od požara područja koje štiti postrojba) i vatrogasna znanja proizvođača. Kontejneri s opremom ili sredstvom za gašenje mogu biti trajno smješteni u postrojbi ili na mjestima očekivane vatrogasne intervencije. Također se mogu neposredno prije očekivane katastrofe premjestiti na poziciju koja vatrogascima najviše odgovara. Ovaj članak upravo predstavlja jednu takvu nadogradnju hrvatskog proizvođača vatrogasnih vozila ZIEGLER d. o. o. Hrvatska. Recently, roll on/off {{container}} vehicles {{have been}} increasingly included in firefighting vehicle manufacturing program given that they imply a new {{aspect of the}} vehicle design and construction. The basic feature of the roll on/off firefighting container vehicles distinguishing them from the standard firefighting vehicles is their mobile superstructure, which, according to its design and construction, is in short called ‘a container’. Therefore, the firefighting vehicle of this type basically includes a standard constructed truck chassis adequate capacity with loader crane for containers and a firefighter container. In relation to buyer’s demands, the container may incorporate different firefighting technical details, devices and equipment, thus determining each container’s technical and functional characteristics. Hence, depending on the equipment, roll on/off container vehicles {{may be used for}} both technical and firefighting interventions. Furthermore, the advantage of the roll on/off container vehicles over the standard firefighting vehicles is the chassis which can support a container of any type and purpose, so any firefighting intervention can be performed with only one chassis and several different containers. Roll on/off container vehicles are controlled by the German standard DIN 14505 : 2004 Fire fighting and rescue service vehicles - Vehicles for roller containers - General requirements. DIN 14530 - 21 : 2011 Firefighting vehicles - Part 21 : Pump water tanker TLF 4000 standard applies as well for the construction and design of roll on/off container vehicles. This container superstructure described herein is equipped with fire techniques and equipment with the sole purpose of <b>fire</b> extinguishing in <b>refining</b> plants. In addition this container with integrated water/foam monitor the kit included containers superstructure with foam pump and foam tank volume 15. 000 l. Bearing in mind special technical characteristics, the container of this vehicle includes fire techniques and equipment of higher technical quality than in most standard firefighting vehicles. Thus, there is strong Caterpillar diesel drive motor, designed for eternally operation, integrated in a separate, sound-insulated space of the container’s superstructure. This motor drives the KSB centrifugal pump flow 22. 500 l/min as well as the Edwards gear pump for foam agent. Foam agent dosage rate is proportional within the fixed water flow rate. Pipeline system is similar in design to the most firefighting vehicles and is equipped with ‘storz’ coupling adapters with female thread at the user endings. The coupling adapters are closed with sealed cap. Water/foam monitor of a special manufacturer Williams Ambasador is of high range and stream water and foam capacity. The article presents the construction and design of roll on/off container vehicles for water and foam <b>fire</b> extinguishing in <b>refining</b> plants, which is designed by manufacturer ZIEGLER d. o. o. Croatia, Zagreb in cooperation with company TOTAL. At the moment of the release of this article, the container with monitor and other containers with foam agent tank are in finally phase of construction and are in start production. The vehicles are being constructed for TOTAL company from Netherlands, and will be delivered under the name as Roll on/off extinguishing container with monitor (SBH Unit) and Roll on/off foam container (SVH Unit). The entire design and construction of the vehicle with all technical characteristics are owned by ZIEGLER d. o. o. The author of the article presented the above mentioned firefighting vehicle {{for the sole purpose of}} introducing the operational technical characteristics and application of the roll on/off container vehicles in firefighting. Ziegler d. o. o. and the author of this article agree to publish the full contents of the article.

In this thesis, we focus on two objectives: detecting hierarchical relationships between users and inferring the hierarchical roles of users interacting via the same online communication medium. In both cases, we show that considering the temporal dimension of interaction substantially improves the detection of relationships and roles. The first focus of this thesis is {{on the problem of}} inferring implicit relationships from interactions between users. Based on promising results obtained by standard link-analysis methods such as PageRank and Rooted-PageRank (RPR), we introduce three novel time-based approaches, -F" based on a defined time function, Filter and <b>Refine</b> (<b>FiRe)</b> which is a hybrid approach based on RPR and Time-F, and Time-sensitive Rooted-PageRank (T-RPR) which applies RPR in a way that takes into account the time-dimension of interactions in the process of detecting hierarchical ties. We experiment on two datasets, the Enron email dataset to infer managersubordinate relationships from email exchanges, and a scientific publication coauthorship dataset to detect PhD advisor-advisee relationships from paper co-authorships. Our experiments demonstrate that time-based methods perform better in terms of recall. In particular T-RPR turns out to be superior over most recent competitor methods as well as all other approaches we propose. The second focus of this thesis is examining the online communication behaviour of users working on the same activity in order to identify the different hierarchical roles played by the users. We propose two approaches. In the first approach, supervised learning is used to train different classification algorithms. In the second approach, we address the problem as a sequence classification problem. A novel sequence classification framework is defined that generates time-dependent features based on frequent patterns at multiple levels of time granularity. Our framework is a exible technique for sequence classification to be applied in different domains. We experiment on an educational dataset collected from an asynchronous communication tool used by students to accomplish an underlying group project. Our experimental findings show that the first supervised approach achieves the best mapping of students to their roles when the individual attributes of the students, information about the reply relationships among them as well as quantitative time-based features are considered. Similarly, our multi-granularity pattern-based framework shows competitive performance in detecting the students' roles. Both approaches are significantly better than the baselines considered...|$|R
2500|$|Rav Kruspedai said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Johanan that on Rosh Hashanah, three books are opened in Heaven — one for the {{thoroughly}} wicked, one for the thoroughly righteous, and one for those in between. The thoroughly righteous are immediately inscribed definitively in the book of life. The thoroughly wicked are immediately inscribed definitively in the book of death. And the fate of those in between is suspended from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur. If they deserve well, then they are inscribed in the book of life; if they do not deserve well, then they are inscribed in the book of death. Rabbi Abin said that [...] tells us this when it says, [...] "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous." [...] "Let them be blotted out from the book" [...] refers to the book of the wicked. [...] "Of the living" [...] refers to the book of the righteous. [...] "And not be written with the righteous" [...] refers to the book of those in between. Rav Nahman bar Isaac derived this from [...] where Moses told God, [...] "if not, blot me, I pray, out of Your book that You have written." [...] "Blot me, I pray" [...] refers to the book of the wicked. [...] "Out of Your book" [...] refers to the book of the righteous. [...] "That you have written" [...] refers to the book of those in between. It was taught in a Baraita that the House of Shammai said that there will be three groups at the Day of Judgment — one of thoroughly righteous, one of thoroughly wicked, and one of those in between. The thoroughly righteous will immediately be inscribed definitively as entitled to everlasting life; the thoroughly wicked will immediately be inscribed definitively as doomed to Gehinnom, as [...] says, [...] "And many of them who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life and some to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence." [...] Those in between will go down to Gehinnom and scream and rise again, as [...] says, [...] "And I will bring the third part through the <b>fire,</b> and will <b>refine</b> them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried. They shall call on My name and I will answer them." [...] Of them, Hannah said in 1 Samuel [...] "The Lord kills and makes alive, He brings down to the grave and brings up." [...] The House of Hillel, however, taught that God inclines the scales towards grace (so that those in between do not have to descend to Gehinnom), and of them David said in [...] "I love that the Lord should hear my voice and my supplication [...] [...] [...] The cords of death compassed me, and the straits of the netherworld got hold upon me," [...] and on their behalf David composed the conclusion of [...] "I was brought low and He saved me."–17a1.|$|R
