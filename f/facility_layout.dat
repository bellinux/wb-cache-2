40|$|Measuring {{effectiveness}} in an existing <b>facilities</b> <b>layout</b> {{is a prerequisite}} in order to initiate any action that will improve layout effectiveness. Available methods on measurement of layout effectiveness help measure it in respect to only material handling cost and select an effective layout from a set of available alternatives. Nevertheless, factors such as empty travel of material handling equipment, layout flexibility and area utilisation contribute significantly towards the layout effectiveness. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} have a measurement model to determine the <b>facilities</b> <b>layout's</b> effectiveness by considering all significant factors. Hence, a measurement model considering a set of three layout effectiveness factors namely <b>Facilities</b> <b>Layout</b> Flexibility (FLF), Productive Area Utilisation (PAU) and Closeness Gap (CG) is developed in our research. The proposed model will enable the decision-maker of a manufacturing enterprise to analyse a layout in three different aspects; based on which they can make decision towards productivity improvement. Due to the space limitation, this paper only discusses about the measurement of the CG. The CG is developed in respect to the objective of bringing closer the highly interactive facilities/departments. The CG presented in this paper extends other related works by incorporating numerous aspects of layout that include: empty travel of material handling equipment, information flow, personnel flow and equipment flow...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the high}} rate of {{failures}} and damages occurring with current traffic light assemblies because of motorists striking them or the nature of the components, {{there is a need for}} optimizing the production rate. This need is specifically aimed at accommodating replacement at a quicker rate as well as a new method of assembly by using different materials and components. Therefore it is necessary to implement a new facilities plan to improve the current situation and reduce costs associated with a prolonged repair programme. A modular replaceable traffic light is an innovative and cost efficient solution to the conventional traffic light assemblies. This report outlines the key principles and activities that occur in optimizing a <b>facilities</b> plan <b>layout</b> for the assembly of a replaceable traffic light. The details of the entire assembly line project and <b>facilities</b> <b>layout</b> are explained and investigated in this report. <b>Facilities</b> <b>layout</b> planning is the critical component in a company’s future growth and development plans; it provides the company with a long-term solution for reaching its desired goals and vision. By implementing the correct facilities planning tools and techniques a number of benefits will be achieved namely a reduction in costs associated with a production line assembly; bottlenecks will be reduced thus increasing material flow and an improved working environment all contribute to the success of a correctly implemented <b>facilities</b> <b>layout.</b> The modular replaceable traffic light is constructed out of the latest polymer plastic which allows for quick assembly due to its light weight and manoeuvrability. By implementing the steps necessary to create an optimal <b>facilities</b> plan <b>layout</b> the replacement time for damaged or broken traffic lights currently on the roads today will be significantly reduced.

There is {{a wide range of}} choices in measuring facility performance is essential to support various decision making problems that may arise during a <b>facilities</b> <b>layout</b> life cycle. The existing models have considered only material handling cost as the performance measurement factor. Nevertheless, general, flow of material, flexibility, space utilization, materials handling, storage arrangement, shipping and receiving, building and utilities, expandability without major disruption, and service activities have a significant contribution towards the layout effectiveness. Therefore, it is necessary to have an efficient model to determine the <b>facilities</b> <b>layout’s</b> effectiveness by considering a set of layout effectiveness factors. The proposed model, using a fuzzy multiple attributes decision-making method, enables the decision-maker of a manufacturing enterprise to analyze alternative layouts in different boards, based on which they can develop decision towards productivity improvement.

A quadratic assignment model deals with <b>facilities</b> <b>layout</b> problems, assigning ‘n’ facilities to ‘n’ mutually exclusive locations by either construction or improvement procedures so that the objective of minimization of cost (or flow) is attained.

In our approach, the sum of distance-weighted congruent objectives of normalized weighted closeness relationships and distance-weighted normalized weighted interactions are handled in the objective function.
