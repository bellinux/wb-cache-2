40|$|Control of {{dispersion}} in fibre {{optical waveguides}} is {{of critical importance}} to optical fibre communications systems and more recently for continuum generation from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared. The wavelength at which the group velocity dispersion crosses zero can be set by varying <b>fibre</b> core <b>diameter</b> or <b>index</b> step. Moreover, sophisticated methods to manipulate higher-order dispersion so as shape and even flatten dispersion over wide bandwidths are possible using multi-cladding fibre. Here we introduce design and fabrication techniques that allow analogous dispersion control in chip-integrated optical microresonators, and thereby demonstrate higher-order, wide-bandwidth dispersion control over an octave of spectrum. Importantly, the fabrication method we employ for dispersion control simultaneously permits optical Q factors above 100 million, which is critical for efficient operation of nonlinear optical oscillators. Dispersion control in high Q systems has taken on greater importance in recent years with increased interest in chip-integrable optical frequency combs...|$|R

In the average <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> range from 9 - 18 m dry-as-moulded (DaM) composite unnotched impact and tensile strength decreased significantly. The composite notched impact performance and tensile modulus showed little dependence on <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter.</b> The influence of broadening the <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> distribution by blending glass fibre samples of different average diameter was found to be particularly negative on the level of composite unnotched impact when compared at equal number average diameter. After hydrolysis treatment the composite tensile strength and modulus exhibited a large drop compared to the DaM results. In contrast, the unnotched impact results became insensitive to <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> after hydrolysis. The average level of unnotched impact after hydrolysis was sufficiently high to show an increase over DaM when the <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> was above 14 m. Residual fibre length correlated significantly with <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> with a lower average length for thinner fibres. The interfacial shear strength was found to be in the range of 26 - 34 MPa for DaM composites. There was a highly significant inverse correlation between the DaM interfacial strength and the average <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter.</b> It is shown that results from both tensile and unnotched impact measurements can be brought back to single trend lines by using a Z average value for the average <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> which is more heavily weighted to the thicker fibres in the distribution...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> {{can vary}} {{dramatically}} along a wool staple, {{especially in the}} Mediterranean environment of southern Australia with its dry summers and abundance of green feed in spring. Other research results have shown a very low phenotypic correlation between <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> grown between seasons. Many breeders use short staples to measure <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> for breeding purposes and also to promote animals for sale. The effectiveness of this practice {{is determined by the}} relative response to selection by measuring fibre traits on a full 12 months wool staple as compared to measuring them only on part of a staple. If a high genetic correlation exists between the part record and the full record, then using part records may be acceptable to identify genetically superior animals. No information is available on the effectiveness of part records. This paper investigated whether wool growth and <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> traits of Merino wool grown at different times of the year in a Mediterranean environment, are genetically the same trait, respectively. The work was carried out on about 7 dyebanded wool sections/animal. year, on ewes from weaning to hogget age, in the Katanning Merino resource flocks over 6 years. Relative clean wool growth of the different sections had very low heritability estimates of less than 0. 10, and they were phenotypically and genetically poorly correlated with 6 or 12 months wool growth. This indicates that part record measurement of clean wool growth of these sections will be ineffective as indirect selection criteria to improve wool growth genetically. Staple length growth as measured by the length between dyebands, would be more effective with heritability estimates of between 0. 20 and 0. 30. However, these measurements were shown to have a low genetic correlation with wool grown for 12 months which implies that these staple length measurements would only be half as efficient as the wool weight for 6 or 12 months to improve total clean wool weight. Heritability estimates of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>fibre</b> curvature were relatively high and were genetically and phenotypically highly correlated across sections. High positive phenotypic and genetic correlations were also found between <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>fibre</b> curvature of the different sections and similar measurements for wool grown over 6 or 12 months. Coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> of the sections also had a moderate negative phenotypic and genetic correlation with staple strength of wool staples grown over 6 months indicating that coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> of any section would be as good an indirect selection criterion to improve stable strength as coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> for wool grown over 6 or 12 months. The results indicate that <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>fibre</b> curvature of wool grown over short periods of time have virtually the same heritability as that of wool grown over 12 months, and that the genetic correlation between <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>fibre</b> curvature on part and on full records is very high (rg > 0. 85). This indicates that <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>fibre</b> curvature on part records can be used as selection criteria to improve these traits. However, part records of greasy and clean wool growth would be much less efficient than fleece weight for wool grown over 6 or 12 months because of the low heritability of part records and the low genetic correlation between these traits on part records and on wool grown for 12 months...|$|R

Follicle activity was measured by histological changes in skin biopsies taken weekly. Blood samples were collected at two-week intervals and plasma cortisol measured. Increased plasma cortisol concentration significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced clean wool production and mean <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> dropped to its lowest level four weeks after commencement and two weeks after the cessation of cortisol injection. Elevation of plasma cortisol concentration significantly (p< 0. 0001) increased the percentage of inactive follicles two weeks after injection started. High <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> groups (Strongwool sheep; i. e. HL+HH) had significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher percentage of follicle shutdown than low <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> groups (Finewool sheep; i. e. LL+LH). Average percentage of shutdown follicles for Finewool (LL+LH) and Strongwool (HL+HH) Merino sheep was 9. 8 [+ or -] 0. 9 and 13. 5 [+ or -] 0. 9 respectively. Shutdown of primary follicles was more pronounced in Finewool than Strongwool sheep. There was no significant effect of coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> on propensity to follicle shutdown induced by exogenous cortisol.

Mid-side mohair samples (n= 504) were collected from two consecutive shearings of a mixed sex group of Angora kids at 6 and 12 months of age. The samples were at the fine end (average 20. 9 µm) of the mean <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> range of mohair. There was a bias between the estimates of mean <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> at both shearings. The other traits studied also had biases between measurement methods.

The data used for this study were collected on between 898 and 6211 kids (depending on the trait measured) born between 2000 and 2006 in 11 different Angora goat studs. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated with the ASREML programme for fleece weight, <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> standard deviation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> comfort factor, spinning/effective fineness and standard deviation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> along the length of the staple.

Polymer throughput increases considerably with an increasing concentration of polymer solutions in roller electrospinning. The properties of the nanofibers {{and the quality of}} the nanofiber layers were also studied. <b>Fibre</b> <b>diameters</b> increase with an increasing concentration in both techniques. <b>Fibre</b> <b>diameters</b> produced by needle electrospinning are smaller than those produced by roller electrospinning. The distribution of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameters</b> is rather narrow and not significantly dependent on the concentration of solutions in either technique...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA novel {{device to}} produce ethyl {{cellulose}} fibres, an important biomaterial in modern food processing, using a glass {{needle in a}} modified electrospinning setup has been investigated. The effect of applied voltage on the fibre aspect ratio was analysed during electrospinning with a metallic (stainless steel) needle and then compared with that obtained with a glass–steel needle combination. A distinct difference in <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> was observed between the two needle setups for the same processing conditions. A detailed quantitative study of the <b>fibre</b> length and <b>diameter</b> with respect to applied voltage was also carried out {{in order to determine}} any relationship between the needle material and the resulting electrospun fibres. There was an increase in <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> in the case of steel–steel needle electrospinning with increasing applied voltage while a decrease in <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> was observed with glass–steel needle electrospinning for the same voltage...|$|R
40|$|While electrospinning is an {{effective}} technology for producing poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) micrometre-scale fibrous scaffolds for tissue regeneration, electrospinning of PHBV fibrous scaffolds composed of sub-micrometre fibres, surface-porous fibres or nanocomposite fibres is rarely explored. In this study, the average PHBV <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> was successfully reduced to the sub-micrometre scale by dissolving a conductivity-enhancing salt in the polymer solution for electrospinning. Surface-porous fibres were made using a mixture of solvents, and carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA) nanoparticles were incorporated into the fibres {{with the aid of}} an ultrasonic power source. Water contact angle measurements demonstrated that both <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> reduction and CHA incorporation enhanced the wettability of the fibrous scaffolds. Tensile properties of the scaffolds were not undermined by the reduction of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and the presence of surface pores. In vitro biological evaluation using a human osteoblast-like cell line (SaOS- 2) demonstrated that all types of fibrous scaffolds supported cell attachment, spreading and proliferation. Analysis of cell morphology revealed similar projected cell areas on all types of scaffolds. However, cells on sub-micrometre fibres possessed a lower cell aspect ratio than cells on microfibres. The reduction of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> to the sub-micrometre scale enhanced cell proliferation after 14 days cell culture, while the incorporation of CHA nanoparticles in microfibres significantly enhanced the alkaline phosphatase activity of SaOS- 2 cells. The control of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> surface topography and composition is important in developing electrospun PHBV-based scaffolds for specific tissue-engineering applications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new {{technique}} has been developed to enable <b>fibre</b> <b>diameters</b> to be measured in an aqueous environment using the OFDA 2000 instrument. The existing OFDA instrument has only been used to measure <b>diameters</b> of animal <b>fibres</b> under dry conditions. This {{new technique}} was utilised to assess the effects of pH and temperature on the diameters of merino wool fibres in aqueous environments. Significant changes in <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> under aqueous conditions were found {{as a function of}} pH and temperature. Wool <b>fibre</b> <b>diameters</b> were at a minimum close to the wool isoelectric point (pH 4. 8) and increased at both lower and higher pHs. Swelling of merino wool fibres was observed to increase linearly by around 15 % as the temperature rose from ambient to 70 °C...|$|R
40|$|In this report, all of {{the known}} {{estimates}} of the genetic parameters for pasture intake by Merino sheep and its relationship with production traits were combined. Combining these estimates improved the precision of the genetic parameter estimates. The pooled estimates of heritability of digestible organic matter intake (DOMI), wool growth, wool growth efficiency and <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> were 0. 12 ± 0. 04, 0. 37 ± 0. 05, 0. 25 ± 0. 05 and 0. 66 ± 0. 08, respectively. The genetic relationships of wool growth efficiency with wool gr wth and <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> were 0. 84 ± 0. 20 and – 0. 3 ± 0. 12, respectively, while those for feed intake (as DOMI) with wool growth and <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> were – 0. 02 ± 0. 17 and 0. 40 ± 0. 15...|$|R
40|$|The mean <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> of wool of 5818 Merino, rams, {{measured}} as two-tooths {{on a number}} of Merino studs in N. S.

It is suggested that the average <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> for as many years as records are available could give a valuable estimate of a stud’s real value for fibre fineness and a mean value from which to express individual ram’s fineness on a percentage deviation basis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fibres</b> with a <b>diameter</b> in the {{nanometer}} range were electrospun from aqueous poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVOH). In {{order to improve}} the mass deposition rate and decrease the final <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> salts (NaCl, LiCl, LiBr and LiF) {{were added to the}} solution. The aim was to increase the charge density and hence increase the electrostatic forces on the fluid. It was found that with increasing salt concentration the charge density did increase. However the mass deposition rate was found to decrease and the final <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> was found to increase. The decrease in mass deposition rate is explained by considering the concept of a virtual orifice. The increase in the final <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> is explained by considering the charge distribution in the jet when it behaves like a conductor compared to when it behaves like an insulator. Both mechanisms result from the increase in conductivity of the PVOH solution without significantly modifying other solution properties when salt is added...|$|R
