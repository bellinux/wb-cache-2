50|$|Sterilized {{intervention}} {{is a policy}} that attempts to influence the exchange rate without changing the monetary base. The procedure {{is a combination of}} two transactions. First, the central bank conducts a nonsterilized <b>intervention</b> by <b>buying</b> (selling) foreign currency bonds using domestic currency that it issues. Then the central bank “sterilizes” the effects on the monetary base by selling (buying) a corresponding quantity of domestic-currency-denominated bonds to soak up the initial increase (decrease) of the domestic currency. The net effect of the two operations is the same as a swap of domestic-currency bonds for foreign-currency bonds with no change in the money supply. With sterilization, any purchase of foreign exchange is accompanied by an equal-valued sale of domestic bonds, and vice versa.|$|R

Second, using a regression framework we again find evidence that corporate customers react in ways consistent {{with the intentions of}} the Bank of Japan, while financial customers act in the opposite way. The aggregate impact of <b>intervention</b> to <b>buy</b> the dollar is, if anything, to increase net purchases of the yen by the customers of the bank we analyse.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on {{arrangements}} made by the EEC to establish a common market in sheepmeats. A system of <b>intervention</b> <b>buying</b> or deficiency payments ensures that producers are guaranteed a minimum price. In addition, compensatory payments up to a Reference Price level give farmers additional income support during the transition period from 1980 to 1984. The whole arrangement is protected from imports from third countries with a system of tariffs, licences and Voluntary Restraint Agreements. EEC exports, subject to a clawback tax under the Variable Premium System, and to refunds under the Intervention System, are maintained at traditional levels to current markets. Any increased production in the U. K. is likely to be exported to the Continent, so the British market should remain stable. New Zealand has agreed to limit sales to the EEC at 245, 500 tonnes in return for a reduction in the import levy to 10 %. There are a number of disadvantages and benefits for New Zealand attached to this agreement, for example no allowance for market growth but higher per unit returns. Whilst there is guaranteed access to the market for this quantity up to 1984, exporters need to keep a close watch on any further long term developments within the EEC...|$|E
30|$|Agricultural {{policies}} play an import {{role within}} the dairy industry. The EU dairy industry, for example, {{is subject to}} the CAP. In the past, the CAP focused on maintaining adequate and stable prices for particular dairy commodities, such as butter and SMP. In turn, it was expected that the enhanced returns from these commodities would be transmitted to the farm gate price for milk. This aim was mainly achieved by purchasing to intervention stores, setting production quotas, export refunds, import tariffs and subsidized consumption. These measures resulted in isolating EU dairy commodity prices from lower and more volatile World prices. However, more recent changes to the CAP, and in particular the Luxembourg 2003 agreement, resulted in a greater market orientation with a lower level of price support (<b>intervention</b> <b>buying,</b> 9 import tariffs and export refunds) for EU dairy commodities. To compensate for the resultant losses, the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) was introduced to provide income support at farm level. In addition, the supply quota, introduced in 1984, expired in 2015. This aim of bringing EU dairy prices more in line with World prices was observed in O’Connor and Keane (2011) who reported a convergence of volatility between EU and World dairy commodity prices. A more comprehensive discussion of the CAP policy changes can be found in Keane and O’ Connor (2015).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} {{of foreign exchange}} intervention in China {{and its effects on}} the RMB’s exchange rate levels and volatility. The research first examines what drives Chinese central bank’s <b>intervention</b> through <b>buying</b> and selling foreign exchange (the CB intervention) in a bivariate probit model and shows that intervention is driven by an array of factors including exchange rate deviations, conditional volatility, national economic conditions, interest rate differentials. The PBOC conducts intervention in a leaning-against-the-wind fashion in the medium term, while leaning-with-the-wind intervention is used in the short term. The thesis next focuses on the intervention in the central parity rate (the CPR intervention). Evidence from a Bayes Tobit model shows that the CPR intervention is determined by the market price (proxied by the proposed price by designated market makers), broad currency index and the yield curve spread. The PBOC adopts a leaning-against-the-wind strategy for the intervention in that when the market price appreciates (depreciates), the PBOC sets a higher (lower) central parity rate to dampen or even reverse the appreciation (depreciation). To what extent the CB and CPR interventions are effective is then estimated in threshold GARCH models. Results show that while CPR intervention focuses on combating appreciation, intervention by the central bank’s purchase or sale operations (CB intervention) impacts on exchange rate levels when the RMB depreciates. While interventions would move exchange rate levels to the direction desired by the authorities, they tend to increase exchange rate volatility. Finally, event study methodology is deployed to explore the properties and impacts of China’s oral intervention. The estimation adopts four criteria (event, direction, reversal and smoothing) to test to what extent oral intervention is effective. Evidence indicates oral intervention through exchange rate communications can influence exchange rate levels and the RMB exchange rate is responsive to international pressure. Furthermore, sequential oral interventions can reduce exchange rate volatility...|$|R
40|$|The June 2003 Horticulture Fact Sheet {{contained}} {{a summary of}} the EU regime for cut flowers. Production of cut flowers and plants in the EU involves about 160, 00 hectares of land, some under glass and protective coverings. The sector is worth around € 16 billion per annum and is growing. Holland accounts for around 30 % of EU production and is a major trader. Germany accounts for 16 %, Italy 15 %, France 14 % and the UK 7 %. The EU regime for cut flowers and plants was established in 1968. It sets quality standards, minimum physical characteristics and marketing standards. There is no EU financial assistance to the sector, no aid to producers, no <b>intervention</b> <b>buying,</b> no price support and no export subsidies. The principal form of regulation is the tariff regime applied and the special safeguard measures allowed. Special arrangements are then negotiated within this framework. The EU is the major market for cut flowers and about 80 % of imports enter the market on preferential terms. Kenya is the main third-country supplier. Comment: The cut-flower sector is a major sector into which ACP countries have diversified. It {{remains to be seen whether}} the sector will fit into the EU's emerging single farm payment system and the impact that these developments will have on the market prices received by ACP exporters.

40|$|In {{the words}} of the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 {{agreement}} on CAP reform will mean that 'in future, the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently from the volume of production'. However 'member states may choose to maintain a limited link between subsidy and production under well-defined conditions and within clear limits'. The single farm payment system will enter into force in 2005. However, member states may get a special dispensation to apply it only from 2007. The key elements of the reform package as agreed are:  a single farm payment for EU farmers, independent from production; limited coupled elements may be maintained to avoid abandonment of production; this payment will be linked to respect for environmental, food-safety, animal and plant health and animal-welfare standards, as well as the requirement to keep all farmland in good agricultural and environmental condition ('cross compliance'); a strengthened rural-development policy with more EU money, new measures to promote the quality of the environment and animal welfare, and to help farmers to meet EU production standards starting in 2005; a reduction in direct payments ('modulation') for bigger farms to finance the new rural development policy; a mechanism for financial discipline to ensure that the farm budget fixed until 2013 is not overshot; revisions to the market policy of the CAP involving: asymmetric price cuts in the milk sector; reduction of the monthly increments in the cereals sector by half, (the current intervention price will be maintained);  reforms in the rice, durum wheat, nuts, starch potatoes and dried fodder sectors. The Commission press release provides a detailed summary of how the various reforms will be implemented. This includes an outline of the modifications made to the Commission's original proposals with regard to the single farm payment scheme, where member states can be allowed to maintain up to 25 % of current hectare payments in the arable sector linked to production if this maintains land in production. Alternatively 40 % of the supplementary durum wheat premium may continue to be linked to production. Unlike the Commission's initial proposal there will be no reduction in cereals intervention prices, although the existing seasonal correction payments will be reduced by 50 %. A supplement for durum wheat in traditional durum wheat farming areas will be paid independently of production for which member states may decide to retain 40 % linked to production. A quality premium for durum wheat used in pasta and semolina production to farmers in traditional zones will also be paid. A one-step reduction in the price of rice of 50 % was agreed. This will bring the EU price (€ 150 /tonne) into line with the world market price. Current direct aid payments will be increased from € 25 /tonne to € 177 /tonne. Of this € 102 /tonne {{will be part of the}} single farm aid payment, based on historical rights, while the remainder (€ 75 /tonne) will be paid as a crop-specific aid. <b>Intervention</b> <b>buying</b> will be triggered should market prices fall to € 150 per tonne, with a ceiling of 75, 000 tonnes being set for <b>intervention</b> <b>buying.</b> New tariff items are to be created to accommodate the new rice regime. With regard to the beef sector, member states may decide to retain up to a 100 % of the suckler cow premium and over 40 % of the slaughter premium as a production-linked payment, or 100 % of the slaughter premium or 75 % of the special male premium. In addition for sheep and goats, a maximum of 50 % of the premium can remain linked to production, while drying aid for cereals in the outermost regions of the EU may remain linked to production. The dairy sector will only be incorporated into the single farm payment from 2008 when the process of reform has been fully implemented. The reformed dairy quota regime will remain in place until 2014 / 15. The intervention prices for butter will decrease by 25 % over four years which is an additional price cut of 10 % compared to those agreed in 2000. There will be a reduction in skimmed milk powder prices of 15 % over three years in line with the Agenda 2000 agreement. <b>Intervention</b> <b>buying</b> for butter will be suspended above a limit of 70, 000 tonnes in 2004, with this declining to 30, 000 tonnes by 2007. Compensation payments will rise from € 11. 81 per tonne in 2004 to € 23. 65 in 2005 and € 35. 5 per tonne in 2006. In addition member states may make additional payments equivalent to 10 % of the sum of the single farm aid payment to encourage specific types of farming. With regard to funds generated by 'modulation' (that is the progressive reduction of payments to larger farms) 1 % will remain in the member states where the money is raised. The remainder will be allocated to member states according to: agricultural area; agricultural employment; GDP per capita, purchasing power. This being said every member state will receive at least 80 % of the funds generated from modulation in its territory. Proposals for reform of the olive oil, tobacco and cotton regimes will be tabled in autumn 2003. Comment: The prior implementation of reform in the dairy sector, involving substantial price reductions, in advance of incorporation into the single farm payment scheme, gives an indication of the likely trajectory for reform in the sugar sector, a sector of vital importance to a number of ACP economies. The impact this will have on the value of ACP sugar preferences (quite independent of the outcome of the Brazilian and Australian WTO challenge to the EU's 'C' export arrangements) will need to be taken into account in the on-going EPA negotiations; possibly through the negotiation of 'compensatory trade measures' explicitly linked to the erosion of the value of trade preferences as a result of the implementation of CAP reform. In the rice sector the compromise reform includes a specific reference to traditional rice suppliers stating 'the Commission will also take into account the interests of developing countries, including those traditional suppliers, as well as the implementation of the EBA regulation', it remains to be seen what this will mean in practice for traditional ACP suppliers such as Surinam and Guyana. The major change with regard to modulation which keeps the vast majority of these funds for deployment in support of rural development means that there will be little scope created for the financing of further reform. This could serve to defer substantive reform of the EU sugar regime. In {{the words of}} the European Commission, the June 26 th 2003 agreement on CAP [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Hungarian {{agricultural}} production plays {{a significant role}} in the preservation of rural areas, in its sustainable development, and in lessening the regional differences. The value of our agricultural sector is primarily provided by the combination of favourable climate, good natural makings and growth traditions. The effectiveness of our crop growing greatly depends on our most important plant cultures such as for example the results wheat growing. In our country wheat growing has a traditional importance in the plant growing branch since centuries, it is grown on most farms. The basic purpose of our analytic work was to compare the results of wheat growing based on the production results collected by us concerning wheat growing in Hungary and Austria. Based on the comparative study we can say that in Hungary wheat is grown on an area five times as large as that in the neighbouring Austria. During the course of the study we concluded that in the two countries, the Austrian production averages per area unit are 29. 30 percent higher on average. The unfavourable effect of the weather in the year has caused a significant shortfall production wise. In the case of Hungarian farmers it also caused a significant loss of income from their farms. As opposed to this, Austrian farmers weren’t particularly hard hit by the production shortfall because the Austrian procurement prices are higher than Hungarian average prices. It would greatly aid the income and competitiveness situation of Hungarian farmers if they were to receive an agricultural subsidy that is on a par received by Western European farmers. In Hungary the seed planting areas of staple cereals will not decrease due to tradition, but the distribution of the seed planting areas between particular staple cereals will change, depending on the procurement price and sale options. To prevent difficulties in sales from re-occuring it will be important to raise the domestic grain use, besides keeping up <b>intervention</b> <b>buying</b> up. In our opinion, this latter option can be realized primarily with 52 the expansion of live stock, and the increase of processing/use of staple cereals for food industry and energy oriented processing/use. wheat growing, Hungarian and Austrian wheat growing results, competitiveness, Crop Production/Industries, Production Economics,...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{clientelism}} typically {{assume that}} political machines deliver rewards to influence vote choices and turnout {{of the existing}} electorate. This assumption masks important clientelist strategies because it focuses narrowly on citizens who are already registered in a machine’s district. Political machines distribute benefits not only to influence {{the actions of the}} electorate, but also to shape the composition of the electorate. One such clientelist strategy, which we term “voter buying, ” induces citizens in other districts to transfer their electoral registration and vote for the machine. A formal model suggests that voter buying is incentive-compatible and provides several testable predictions. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses provide evidence of this strategy in Brazil. We investigate the impact of voter buying with a regression discontinuity design, exploiting an intervention that required municipalities to re-register their entire electorate if they exceed an arbitrary threshold.

40|$|The {{next stage}} of CAP reform was finally agreed by the EU on June 26 th 2003 (see the {{following}} item). Earlier discussions in EU Agricultural Council meetings in May and June, however, throw some light on how the agreement was eventually reached. An USDA GAIN Report on the May Agricultural Council meeting sets out the different positions of EU member states on the major issues faced under the Commission's CAP-reform proposals. With regard to decoupling Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK were in favour of full decoupling. France, Austria and Spain were against, while Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and Italy favoured partial decoupling. Ireland's position was unclear while Finland felt decoupled payments should be linked to hectorage. On dairy sector reform, France, Ireland and Spain rejected the Commission's proposals, while Italy proposed no quota cuts beyond 2008. Austria favoured the maintenance of quotas until 2015. In contrast Belgium favoured reform in 2006, while Denmark favoured reform in 2010. The UK and Germany accepted in full the proposed price cuts, but Finland rejected them. Luxembourg does not want dairy-sector reform while the Netherlands wants full decoupling. In the cereals sector Denmark, Germany and the UK favoured further farm cuts, but Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Ireland and Luxembourg are against. Italy favours partial decoupling while the Netherlands wants full decoupling. Spain wants to see <b>intervention</b> <b>buying</b> retained. Comment: An article in 'Inside US Trade' has taken a far less optimistic view, revealing sharp divergences amongst EU member states on how decoupling should be implemented. The overall conclusion is that decoupling {{is likely to be}} far less extensive than initially envisaged. This would appear to be consistent with the Commissioner's line that there are 'solid arguments' for leaving various sensitive areas out of decoupling. Much of the disagreement revolves around the basis for calculating decoupled farm payments {{and the extent to which}} there should be flexibility between member states in how the new system is implemented. According to 'Inside US Trade' there are also disagreements within the EU on the extent to which existing payments should be cut to finance further reform and the extent to which funds should be transferred to the rural-development window. From an ACP country perspective it should be noted that any weakening of decoupling through the maintenance of parallel systems of coupled payments is likely to increase EU levels of production, whilst allowing prices to fall. This is likely to lead to higher levels of EU exports at lower prices, with consequent losses for competing unsubsidised ACP suppliers in areas where cropping patterns overlap with those of the EU.

40|$|A fact-sheet on the EU Horticulture {{sector has}} been {{posted on the}} web. It shows that the EU is {{a major player in}} world horticulture, with 9 % of world production. Around 15 % of the value of EU {{agricultural}} production comes from the horticulture sector, and the EU is both a major importer and exporter. It accounts for around 11 % of world exports and 25 % of world imports and is thus the second largest exporter and the biggest importer of fruit and vegetables in the world. Leading products traded are citrus fruit, apples, tomatoes and onions. The EU's main imports are bananas (3. 3 million tonnes), citrus fruit (1. 9 million tonnes), apples (0. 7 million tonnes), grapes (0. 3 million tonnes), and pineapples (0. 3 million tonnes); fruit juices are also important imports. The EU's main exports are citrus fruit (1. 0 million tonnes), apples (0. 5 million tonnes), grapes (0. 2 million tonnes), peaches and nectarines (0. 2 million tonnes), onions (0. 4 million tonnes) and tomatoes (0. 2 million tonnes). Tomato paste and peeled tomatoes are also major EU exports. Reform of the sector has been underway since 1996, so that a far smaller role for <b>intervention</b> <b>buying</b> is now apparent. EU support programmes in the sector are largely implemented through producer organisations. Support programmes are financed by members of producer organisations and the EU on a 50 / 50 basis. EU aid however is limited to 4. 1 % {{of the value of the}} production handled by the producer organisations. Funds can be used to finance withdrawal of products from the market at times of surpluses or to top up compensation payments. It can also be used to finance operational programmes of support. In the EU nearly 1, 400 producer organisations are recognised, channelling 40 % of all fruit and vegetables to the market. The EU budget for the fruit-and-vegetable sector was € 1, 650 million in 2002 (3. 7 % of the agricultural budget). Some 56 % of this budget is for fresh fruit and vegetables. Specific aid schemes exist for: processing of tomatoes, peaches, pears and citrus fruit; dried figs and dried prunes; cultivation of grapes for drying; the storage of sultanas, currents and dried figs; nuts. Marketing standards are established for all fruit and vegetables marketed in the EU. Agreements can be reached with third countries to implement controls on compliance with these standards. This is increasingly occurring, with approximately 45 % of EU imports entering under these arrangements by the end of March 2003. This reduces the delivery time to the final consumer and lowers administrative costs. In terms of trade arrangements, most imports take place under preferential arrangements and can be subjected to import licences. Access for some products is based on an entry-price system. ‘If import volumes of products subject to the entry-price system exceed the trigger volumes agreed within the WTO, an additional import duty may be applied'. In addition, duties for processed fruit-and-vegetable products are also levied based on the sugar content of the product. The EU pays export refunds on both fresh fruit and vegetables and certain processed fruit and vegetables on the basis of export licences, with refunds varying from country to country. The fact-sheet profiles the product- and geographical-structure of the sector in the EU. Comment: For non-least developed ACP countries restrictions in the fruit-and-vegetable sector offer important opportunities for the extension of further trade preferences. Currently ACP export of these products largely falls under Declaration XXII of the Cotonou Agreement (except for bananas), which includes provisions for extending preferences into new areas. ACP governments should fully exploit these provisions to further enhance access to what are currently still profitable market opportunities in the EU. For least developed ACP countries trading under the EBA initiative, problems still exist in the processed fruit-and-vegetable sector, as a result of the continued application of restrictions on LDC sugar. As a consequence of these restrictions additional duties are charged on processed fruit-and-vegetable exports based on the sugar content of the final product. For many products this constitutes an effective barrier to trade. The EU should take immediate steps to remove this anomaly for all sugar-containing products imported from least developed countries. Export refunds on processed fruit-and-vegetable products pose a significant threat to the development of certain fruit-and-vegetable sectors in a number of ACP countries and the EU should look to using the export-licensing system to prevent exports of these products to ACP countries which have competing production of the basic raw material.
