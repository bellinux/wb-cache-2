5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth <b>is</b> <b>closed.</b> The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth <b>is</b> <b>closed.</b>|$|E

5|$|Forming a minor of a pseudoforest by {{contracting}} some of {{its edges}} and deleting others produces another pseudoforest. Therefore, the family of pseudoforests <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> under minors, and the Robertson–Seymour theorem implies that pseudoforests can be characterized {{in terms of a}} finite set of forbidden minors, analogously to Wagner's theorem characterizing the planar graphs as the graphs having neither the complete graph K5 nor the complete bipartite graph K3,3 as minors.|$|E
5|$|Given a {{set with}} an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always define a corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group {{can be described as}} a set that <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> under subtraction.|$|E
