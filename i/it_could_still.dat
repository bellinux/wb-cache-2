5|$|But they {{overlooked}} that inexpensive aspirin {{had become}} available in India {{and other places}} after October 1918, when the Bayer patent expired. In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> have been a factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, but that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E

5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese soon {{worked on}} various {{techniques}} {{to improve the}} effectiveness of their guns. They developed a serial firing technique to create a continuous rain of bullets on the enemy. They also developed bigger calibers to increase lethal power. Protective boxes in lacquerware were invented to fit over the firing mechanism so <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> fire while it was raining, as were systems to accurately fire weapons at night by keeping fixed angles thanks to measured strings.|$|E
25|$|Stereo linking can be {{achieved}} in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono {{the left and right}} channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> make sense to dial different settings on left and right channels as one might wish to have less compression for left-side events).|$|E

25|$|That fall, the Caldwell group (now {{named the}} Canadian Television Network, or CTN) and the ITO faced {{off in a}} series of {{meetings}} with the BBG.

Ultimately, the BBG granted a licence to CTN, conditional on securing the affiliation of six of the eight ITO stations.|$|E

The court found that it was obliged to apply this exception and refused to take on claims by Nicaragua based on the United Nations Charter and Organization of American States charter, but concluded that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> decide the case based on customary international law obligations with 11-4 majority.|$|E
25|$|After {{the opening}} of the loop, the line became a much more profitable. Despite being longer, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be run with only seven trams; the higher speed up the Singsaker Hill allowed faster travel times. Ridership in November 1955 was up 33 percent since the {{previous}} November. Subsequently, the Solhaug bus route operated by Trondheim Bilruter had lost sufficient ridership to be terminated. During rush hour, an extra tram was put into service, decreasing the intervals from six to five minutes. Eventually trailers were also put into use. All this was despite a price increase with 50% in 1955.|$|E

25|$|Dextromethorphan was {{excluded}} from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 and was specifically {{excluded from the}} Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As of 2010, Dextromethorphan was still excluded from U.S. scheduling of controlled substances; however, officials have warned that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> be added if increased abuse warrants its scheduling. The motivation behind its exclusion from the CSA was that, under the CSA, all optical isomers of listed Schedule II opiates are automatically Schedule II substances. Since dextromethorphan is an optical isomer of the Schedule II opiate levomethorphan (but does not act like an opiate), an exemption was necessary {{to keep it a}} non-controlled substance. The Federal Analog Act does not apply to dextromethorphan because a new drug application has been filed for it.|$|E
25|$|In the United States Supreme Court, Penn Central changed theories. Instead {{of arguing}} {{that it was not}} {{receiving}} a reasonable return on its property because of the city regulations, it argued that the regulation took its air rights above Grand Central Terminal which had been designed to accommodate a twenty-story building on top of it. The Supreme Court disagreed and held that under a new taking test that it formulated in this opinion, the economic impact on Penn Central was not severe enough to constitute a taking because Penn Central conceded that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> continue with its present use whose return was reasonable. Thus, the regulation did not interfere with its reasonable investment-backed expectations. The court therefore found that the city's restrictions on Grand Central Terminal did not amount to a taking.|$|E
25|$|Even in 1940, the Luftwaffe did {{not have}} the command {{structure}} and resources in a number of essential areas. It lacked specialised maritime aircraft designs, a staff interest in naval aviation, and possessed a commander-in-chief who was unwilling to cooperate with the Kriegsmarine. This ensured that those responsible for the direction of German strategy at that time did not immediately recognise the potential damage the Luftwaffe could do to British sea communications. The Luftwaffe command was busy replacing its losses from the Western campaign in which it had lost 28 per cent of its aircraft. Although <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>still</b> command over 1,000 medium bombers in July 1940 it did not possess many long-range aircraft or effective air-dropped torpedoes, nor was it experienced in operations against naval vessels. The short comings of the Luftwaffe in this regard were not readily apparent. The threat from German aircraft against unarmoured and slow merchant ships, and even warships on occasion, became apparent in the Norwegian Campaign.|$|E
