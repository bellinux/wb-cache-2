40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{whether the}} financial crisis has affected citizens’ confidence in the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economy and whether it has triggered citizens’ demand for a <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economy with stronger state regulations. Using panel data, the paper confirms that citizens’ confidence levels in the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economy have decreased {{in most of the}} largest economies and demand for a <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economy with stronger state regulation has increased {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. After analysing the determinants for citizens’ confidence in the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economy and demand for a <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economy with stronger state regulation before and after {{the financial crisis}}, the author concludes that citizens’ net confidence loss in the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economy seems to have been driven by rising unemployment rates, and citizens’ demand for stronger state regulation seems to have been driven by the real economic downturn in GDP growth...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} technological innovation can soften pressure and enlarge opportunity to gain the benefit of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition. The <b>free</b> <b>market</b> operation becomes uncertain {{in relation to the}} domestic affairs and global circumstances. The accelerated process of moving toward <b>free</b> <b>market</b> under a domestically worsening economic situation may backfire, while slowing it down becomes backward under the globally progressing <b>free</b> <b>market</b> circumstances. In dealing with the complexity of building up competitiveness under the pressure of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition, we propose a model; the so-called ‘adaptive innovation policy’. The model is drawn from the metaphor of living system and its environment. The adaptive innovation is continuous enrichment of technology as the nutrition of living economic system to evolve in gaining the benefit of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition. The simulation results from the model imply that: i) dealing with the complexity of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> competition requires understanding the behavior of multiple feedback inside the complex economic system; ii) spurring the economic growth by capital investment beyond the carrying capacity of market could bring about economic instability; iii...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{and other}} intellectuals have debated for centuries for {{the merits of}} free trade and <b>free</b> <b>market</b> as an {{economic}} policy. Irwin (1996) wrote, " [...] . that the proposition that freedom of trade is on the whole economically more beneficial than protection, {{is one of the}} most fundamental propositions economic theory has to offer for the guidance of economic policy". However, there are questions fairness and validity in the distribution of resources and that <b>free</b> <b>market</b> is a just economic system. Adams smith theory of morality and justice is presented and analyzed in relation to his argument that <b>free</b> <b>market</b> is a just economic system. This paper will then provide critique on the morality argument for <b>free</b> <b>market.</b> John Rawls theory ofjustice will be used as a basis for criticizing the argument that the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> is a just economic system. Key Words: <b>Free</b> <b>Market,</b> Capitalism, Theory of Justice, Moralit...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} long-term {{developments in}} the quality and efficiency of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutional systems across thirteen emerging economies from South, South-east, and East Asia over the 1995 – 2014 period. The paper also empirically assesses the impact of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutions on a country’s inward foreign direct investment (FDI) performance. We find that the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutional framework in most economies is still relatively inefficient, restrictive, and underdeveloped but has, nevertheless, substantially improved during the last twenty-year period. Our empirical results also indicate that a <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutional system in a host-country is a factor that attracts inward FDI to emerging Asian economies by multinational companies. Consequently, policy makers should focus on further {{improving the quality of}} <b>free</b> <b>market</b> institutions...|$|R
50|$|Classical {{liberals and}} libertarians support <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> on moral, ideological grounds: {{principles}} of individual liberty morally dictate support for <b>free</b> <b>markets.</b> Supporters {{of the moral}} grounds for <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> include Ayn Rand and Ludwig von Mises. The liberal tradition is suspicious of government authority, and prefers individual choice, and hence tends to see capitalist economics as the preferable means of achieving economic ends.|$|R
50|$|Modern conservatives, on {{the other}} hand, derive support for <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> from {{practical}} grounds. <b>Free</b> <b>markets,</b> they argue, are the most productive markets. Thus the modern conservative supports <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> not out of necessity, but out of expedience. The support is not moral or ideological, but driven on the Burkean notion of prescription: what works best is what is right.|$|R
50|$|Within academia {{the post}} WWII {{high point of}} <b>free</b> <b>market</b> {{economics}} occurred in the 1990s, with several <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economists winning the Nobel Prize. Increased skepticism concerning the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> consensus was fueled by the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the Dot-com bubble. The financial crisis of 2007-08 saw a resurgence of interest in Keynesian economics, the 2008-09 Keynesian resurgence.|$|R

50|$|A <b>free</b> <b>market</b> {{does not}} require the {{existence}} of competition, however it does require a framework that allows new market entrants. Hence, in the lack of coercive barriers, and in markets with low entry cost it is generally understood that competition flourishes in a free-market environment. It often suggests the presence of the profit motive, although neither a profit motive or profit itself are necessary for a <b>free</b> <b>market.</b> All modern <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> are understood to include entrepreneurs, both individuals and businesses. Typically, a modern <b>free</b> <b>market</b> economy would include other features, such as a stock exchange and a financial services sector, but they do not define it.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> are {{commonly}} associated with capitalism within a market economy in contemporary usage and popular culture, <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> have also been advocated by free-market anarchists, market socialists, and some proponents of cooperatives and advocates of profit sharing.|$|R

40|$|Unconventional {{oil and gas}} extraction(UOGE) {{has spurred}} an {{unprecedented}} boom in on-shore production in the U. S. Despite a surge in related research, a void exists regarding policy-related inquiries. To address this gap, we examine support of federal regulatory exemptions for UOGE using survey data collected in 2015 from two northern Colorado communities {{as part of a}} National Institutes of Health study. We assert that current regulatory exemptions for UOGE can be understood as components of broader societal processes of neoliberalization. We test whether <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideologies relate to people’s regulatory views and find that <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology increases public support for federal regulatory exemptions for UOGE. We find that perceived negative impacts do not necessarily drive people to support increased federal regulation. Utilizing neo-Polanyian theory, we tested for an interaction between <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology and perceived negative impacts(Block and Somers 2014; Author 2015). Interestingly, <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology appears to moderate people’s views of regulation. <b>Free</b> <b>market</b> ideology seems to increase the effect of perceived negative impacts while simultaneously increasing support for deregulation. We conclude with a nuanced theoretical discussion to analyze how <b>free</b> <b>market</b> ideology might normalize the impacts of UOGE activity...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> system in allocating resources and in regulating itself has become a received doctrine in practically all capitalist nations. But the recent global financial crisis and the resultant government interventions to salvage the economies of many nations have generated much debate on the continued relevance of the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> and the wisdom of government ‘intrusion’. This paper revisits the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> as propagated by Adam Smith and examines {{the role of government}} in present day circumstances. Drawing from the African experience, the paper concludes that the <b>free</b> <b>market</b> system and government involvement in the economy can complement each other provided there is the capacity for determining the appropriate mix that would deliver the maximum good to society...|$|R
40|$|America now advocates {{the path}} of <b>free</b> <b>markets</b> to industrialization. However, a cursory look into its {{developmental}} history shows that protectionism has been the hallmark of industrial, investment and trade policies followed in that country. Far from adopting <b>free</b> <b>market</b> regime, it has used the strategic interventions by state to promote American industries, especially knowledge-based ones. Therefore, developing and less developed countries should not neglect the strategic {{role of the state}} in development process and completely rely on a regime based on <b>free</b> <b>market</b> forces. ...|$|R

50|$|Edmund Phelps {{published}} an analysis in 2010 theorizing {{that the cause}} of income inequality is not <b>free</b> <b>market</b> capitalism, but instead {{is the result of the}} rise of corporatization. Corporatization, in his view, is the antithesis of <b>free</b> <b>market</b> capitalism. It is characterized by semi-monopolistic organizations and banks, big employer confederations, often acting with complicit state institutions in ways that discourage (or block) the natural workings of a free economy. The primary effects of corporatization are the consolidation of economic power and wealth with end results being the attrition of entrepreneurial and <b>free</b> <b>market</b> dynamism.|$|R
