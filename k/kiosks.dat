40|$|We {{present a}} system in which a user leverages a {{personal}} mobile device to establish trust on a public computing device, or <b>kiosk,</b> prior to revealing personal information to that <b>kiosk.</b> We have designed and implemented a protocol by which the mobile device determines the identity and integrity of the software running on the <b>kiosk.</b> A similar protocol simultaneously allows a <b>kiosk</b> owner to verify that the <b>kiosk</b> is running only approved software. Our system combines a number of emerging security technologies, including the Trusted Platform Module, the Integrity Measurement Architecture, and new support in x 86 processors for establishing a dynamic root of trust. In ongoing work, we plan to use virtual machines to support the important case where the user wishes to run personal software on the <b>kiosk.</b> We are also continuing to explore several open issues we have identified surrounding trust in a <b>kiosk</b> scenario. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{functionality}} of {{an information}} <b>kiosk</b> {{can be extended}} by allowing it to interact with a smartphone, {{as demonstrated by the}} Kimono system, and the user interface can be greatly simplified by “associations ” between pieces of information. A <b>kiosk</b> provides information that is relevant to a particu-lar location and can use valuable context information, such as the fact that a user is physically {{standing in front of the}} <b>kiosk,</b> to tailor the display. Its graphically rich screen is suit-able for presenting information to the user and has a natural input modality requiring the user to simply touch the screen. However, a <b>kiosk</b> lacks mobility and cannot stay with the user as he or she moves about the environment. Also, infor-mation provided by the <b>kiosk</b> must be remembered by the user. Finally, it is difficult to add information to the <b>kiosk,</b> and so the <b>kiosk</b> remains an information display device. All this changes when a handset, such as a PDA or smart-phone, can interact with the <b>kiosk.</b> The handset acts like a personalized proxy of the <b>kiosk.</b> It accompanies the user serving as a memory device. It is also an excellent media cre-ation device, capable of taking pictures and recording voice memos as well as short text messages. Associating newly created content with other currently selected content makes for a simpler user interface. Content and its associations can be uploaded to a <b>kiosk</b> allowing others to access to it. ...|$|R
