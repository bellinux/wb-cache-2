Material and Method: In the present study the dose selection of <b>Formulation</b> I and <b>Formulation</b> II for the particular species (Rat) were {{selected on the basis of}} the method described by Paget and Barnes. The assessments of immunomodulatory activity were carried out by using Delayed Type Hypersensitivity Test, Carbon Clearance Test and Neutrophil adhesion test. Result: Oral administration of Marketed <b>Formulation</b> I and <b>Formulation</b> II significantly (P< 0. 0001) showed Immunomodulatory activity by increase in DTH response, phagocytic activity, and Neutrophil adhesion in Rat at experimental dose. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that both the <b>Formulation</b> I and <b>Formulation</b> II shows significant immunomodulatory effect on both humoral as well as cell mediated immunity. While among two <b>Formulation</b> II showed more immunomodulatory activity as compare with <b>Formulation</b> I. Present study it was revealed that <b>Formulation</b> II showed more immunomodulatory activity than <b>Formulation</b> I due to presence of multiple immunomodulatory ingredient in its <b>Formulation</b> (Tinospora Cardifolia, Ocimum Sactum, Glycyrrhiza Glabra, Aconitum hetrophylum,Cyperus rotundus, Pistacia integerrimg), when compare with <b>Formulation</b> I it contain single ingredient (Tinospora Cardifolia).

The test <b>formulation</b> and DMEM were divided into two parts. One part of the test <b>formulation</b> and one part of the DMEM received the Consciousness Energy Healing Treatment by Vaibhav Rajan Parulkar and were defined as the Biofield Energy Treated samples, while the other parts were denoted as the untreated test samples. Cell viability using MTT assay showed more than 75 % cells were viable in all the tested concentrations in three cells, indicating that the test <b>formulation</b> was safe and nontoxic.
