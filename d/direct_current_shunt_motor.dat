40|$|A B-spline neural networks-based {{adaptive}} control technique for angular speed reference trajectory tracking tasks with highly efficient performance for direct current shunt motors is proposed. A methodology for {{adaptive control}} and its proper training procedure are introduced. This algorithm sets the control signal without using a detailed mathematical model nor exact {{values of the}} parameters of the nonlinear dynamic system. The proposed robust adaptive tracking control scheme only requires measurements of the velocity output signal. Thus, real-time measurements or estimations of acceleration, current and disturbance signals are avoided. Experimental results confirm the efficient and robust performance of the proposed control approach for highly demanding motor operation conditions exposed to variable-speed reference trajectories and completely unknown load torque. Hence, laboratory experimental tests on a <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> <b>motor</b> prove the viability of the proposed adaptive output feedback trajectory tracking control approach...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{proposes to}} study the concept of {{similarity}} and its use {{in the design of}} fuzzy system. The concept of similarity relation is effectively used in fuzzification of crisp values. Similarity index is used in measuring approximate (graded) equality of fuzzy sets over a given universe of discourse. It is proposed to use such an index in modifying a fuzzy relation. Different similarity measures in the literature are elucidated, and a comparative study between different pairs of fuzzy sets is presented. One of these similarity measures has been used successfully in rule selection and modification of a fuzzy relation. In the process, a number of modification schemes based on different logic have been extensively studied for different reasoning mechanisms based on the same data and results are tabulated. A specificity-based approach to defuzzification is also presented, which is found to be suitable for similarity-based fuzzy systems. The results are illustrated with the behaviour of a <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> (DC) <b>shunt</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|R
30|$|The paper {{consists}} of seven sections. The introductory section {{is followed by}} a discussion on the similarity relation which again {{is followed by a}} proposal for constructing such an equivalence relation induced by fuzzy sets and its subsequent use in fuzzification in the section ‘Similarity relation - fuzzification'. Similarity measure of two fuzzy sets is considered in the section ‘Similarity measure - inference'. Approximate reasoning is discussed in the context of similarity. Different schemes are presented and examples considered to illustrate the problem. The section ‘Specificity measure - defuzzification' is devoted to defuzzification of fuzzy outputs. Specificity measure of fuzzy sets can be used to determine the anxiety in decision making. A new defuzzification scheme is defined that works on specificity measures of fuzzy sets. Application of the same in different models are presented in the section ‘Application in different models' followed by result of a case study on a <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> (DC) <b>shunt</b> <b>motor.</b> The paper is concluded in the section ‘Conclusions'. A list of references is provided in the last section.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a thorough thermal study on {{a fleet of}} DC traction motors which were found to suffer from overheating after 3 years of full operation. Overheating of these traction motors is attributed {{partly because of the}} higher than expected number of starts and stops between train terminals. Another probable cause of overheating is the design of the traction motor and/or its control strategy. According to the <b>motor</b> manufacturer, a <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> is permanently connected across the motor field winding. Hence, some of the armature current is bypassed into the <b>current</b> <b>shunt.</b> The <b>motor</b> then runs above its rated speed in the field weakening mode. In this study, a finite difference model has been developed to simulate the temperature profile at different parts inside the traction motor. In order to validate the simulation result, an empty vehicle loaded with drums of water was also used to simulate the full pay-load of a light rail vehicle experimentally. The authors report that the simulation results agree reasonably well with experimental data, and {{it is likely that the}} armature of the traction motor will run cooler if its field shunt is disconnected at low speed...|$|R

Introduction: The {{generator}} tested is in {{the power}} plant of the Manhattan Ice, Light and Power Company, Manhattan, Kansas. Its regular work is to carry the lighting load {{during the second half}} of the night. It is belt driven by a 14 ” x 21,” Erie City, simple, non-condensing engine of one hundred and fifty horse power capacity at ninety five pounds steam pressure. The engine’s normal speed is one hundred and seventy eight revolutions per minute. The power is transmitted by a pulley nine feet, three inches in diameter to a twenty one inch pulley on the generator shaft. The generator is manufactured by the General Electric Company, Schenectady, New York. It is the revolving field, stationary armature type and is self-excited from a <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> generator carried on the same shaft.

Introduction: In the whole field of {{machinery}} operation no subject is receiving {{so much attention}} today as that of driving by electric motors. It shall be our aim to treat, briefly, several classes of motors; but {{to show that the}} Stowe motor is the best type of <b>Shunt</b> <b>Motors.</b> We will start by giving the principle, operation, and use of <b>Shunt</b> <b>Motors</b> in general. <b>Shunt</b> <b>Motors</b> are composed of Field Poles, Armatures, the necessary frame work, commutator, and brushes. The field being wound with a large number of turns of small wire, while the Armature is wound with either Drum or Gramme Ring. The effect of current in the field and Armature causes a skewing of the lines of flux, causing what is known as "cross turns" and "back turns" in the Armature. The cross turns on the Armature tend to change distribution of lines of force on the role faces, skewing them over from trailing tip to entering tip {{in the case of a}} motor.

40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>current</b> (dc) motors {{are used}} in {{terrestrial}} photovoltaic (PV) systems such as in water-pumping systems for irrigation and water supply. <b>Direct</b> <b>current</b> motors may {{also be used for}} space applications. Simple and low weight systems including dc motors may be of special interest in space where the motors are directly coupled to the solar cell array (with no storage). The system will operate only during times when sufficient insolation is available. An important performance characteristic of electric motors is the starting to rated torque ratio. Different types of dc motors have different starting torque ratios. These ratios are dictated by the size of solar cell array, and the developed motor torque may not be sufficient to overcome the load starting torque. By including a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) in the PV system, the starting to rated torque ratio will increase, the amount of which depends on the motor type. The starting torque ratio is calculated for the permanent magnet, series and <b>shunt</b> excited dc <b>motors</b> when powered by solar cell arrays for two cases: with and without MPPT's.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A kainic acid (KA) -induced model of temporal lobe seizure and a penicillin-induced model of neocortical partial seizure were used in this study. Rats of each model were randomly allocated into two groups: control and model groups. The model group was further divided into the KA or penicillin group, sham conduction group and conduction group. The <b>current</b> <b>shunt</b> was realized through the implantation of a customized conduction electrode. After surgery, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded for two hours for each rat under anesthesia. Subsequently, the rats were video monitored for 72 h to detect the occurrence of behavioral seizures upon awakening. The average number and duration of seizures on EEG and the number of behavioral seizures were measured. RESULTS: In KA model, the number of total EEG seizures in conduction group (9. 57 ± 2. 46) was significantly less than that in sham conduction group (15. 13 ± 3. 45) (p< 0. 01). The duration of EEG seizures in conduction group (26. 13 ± 7. 81 s) was significantly shorter than that in sham conduction group (34. 17 ± 7. 25 s) (p =  0. 001). A significant reduction of behavioral seizures was observed in the conduction group compared with KA (p =  0. 000) and sham conduction groups (p =  0. 000). In penicillin model, there was a 61 % reduction in total EEG seizures in conduction group compared with sham conduction group (p< 0. 01), and the duration of EEG seizures in conduction group (6. 29 ± 2. 64 s) was significantly shorter than that in the sham conduction group (12. 07 ± 3. 81 s) (p =  0. 002).
