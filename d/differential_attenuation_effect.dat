40|$|Propagation {{effects in}} {{rainfall}} are examined at three microwave frequencies corresponding to S (3. 0 GHz), C (5. 5 GHz), and X (10. 0 GHz) bands. Attenuation at horizontal polarization, as well a s <b>differential</b> <b>attenuation</b> and <b>differential</b> propagation phase between horizontal (HI and vertical (V) polarizations are considered. It is shown {{that at the}} three frequencies both <b>attenuation</b> and <b>differential</b> <b>attenuation</b> are nearly linearly related to differential propagation phase (cbDP). This is shown through simulation using (a) gamma raindrop size distributions (RSD) with three parameters (No, DO. m) that are varied over a very wide range representing a variety of rainfall types, and (b) measured raindrop size distributions at a single location using a disdrometer. Measurements of X-band specific attenuation and S-band specific differential phase in convective rainshafts using the National Center for Atmospheric Research CP- 2 radar are presented in order to experimentally demonstrate the linear relationship between <b>attenuation</b> and <b>differential</b> propagation phase. Correction procedures for reflectivity and differential reflectivity (&) are developed assuming that differential propagation phase is measured using a radar that alternately transmits H and V polarized waves with copolar reception through the same receiver and processor system. The correction procedures are not dependent on the actual rainrate profile between the radar and the range location of interest. The accuracy of the procedure depends on, (a) RSD fluctuations, (b) variability in the estimate of differential propagation phase due to measurement fluctuations, and (c) nonzero values of the backscatter differential phase (&) between H and V polarizations. Simulations are used to gauge the accuracy of correction procedures at S- and C-bands assuming 6 is negligible. The correction accuracy for attenuation at S-band {{is estimated to be}} - 0. 05 dB while at C-band it is estimated to be within I dB if (IDP G 60 deg). Simulations further indicate that C-band <b>differential</b> <b>attenuations</b> <b>effects</b> can be corrected to within - 35 % of the mean value...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{microwave}} signal depolarization {{caused by}} storms particles {{is one of}} the major problems in utilizing microwave bands for terrestrial and space communication especially at desert and semi desert area. This aim of this research is to study the effects of dust particles on the polarization state of microwave signal. The calculations, which were based on the probability density of Iraqi dust storms, were performed for six frequency bands of microwave signals. Results showed that strong and severe dust storms can highly depolarized the microwave signal through induced <b>differential</b> <b>attenuation</b> and <b>differential</b> phase shift. These two parameters also depends on the shape of the dust particle, particles with low axial ratio can induce relatively high <b>differential</b> <b>attenuation</b> and <b>differential</b> phase shift, and therefore cause more depolarization in the signal. It was found that the relative humidity can only affect the <b>differential</b> <b>attenuation</b> and this <b>effect</b> is minimized at band of high frequency...|$|R
40|$|Source and Qp {{parameters}} {{were estimated}} from the inversion of first arrival P waveform durations of about 300 microearthquakes recorded at a digital seismic network operating in southeastern Sicily. The average risetime and pulse width at each station {{do not show}} large differences, allowing us to exclude significant <b>differential</b> <b>attenuation</b> site <b>effects.</b> A first Qp estimate was obtained by applying the classical risetime method, under the assumption of a point-like source time function. In order to investigate the effect of directivity due to the finiteness of seismic sources, new nonlinear relationships, based on a circular crack model rupturing at a constant velocity, were numerically built. These relationships were used to formulate a nonlinear inverse method for retrieving source (radius, dip, and strike of the circular crack) and Qp parameters from the inversion of risetime and pulse width data. The application of the method produced a better fit of the observed data and a Qp value higher than that obtained by applying the risetime method. The discrepancy between the different Q estimates {{may be due to}} a trade-off among source dimension and Qp, as we inferred from a test on a subset of low-magnitude events (Ml ≤ 2. 5). A good agreement with independent estimates of fault plane solutions, as inferred from P polarities and S polarizations, was found. The estimated stress drops are generally very low (0. 1 – 10 bars). This suggests that the background seismic activity in southeastern Sicily is related to fault segments and/or weakened zones where great stress accumulations are hindered...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{technique}} that enables to disentangle Mie and <b>attenuation</b> <b>effects</b> in coincident, beam-matched K[subscript a]- and W-band radar observations is presented here.

The retrieval technique is applied to a light stratiform rain event and provides plausible results.

40|$|Stimuli {{caused by}} our own {{voluntary}} actions receive a special treatment in the brain. In auditory processing, the N 1 and/or P 2 components of the auditory event-related brain potential (ERP) to self-initiated sounds are attenuated compared to passive sound exposure, which has been interpreted {{as an indicator of}} a predictive internal forward mechanism. Such a predictive mechanism enables differentiating the sensory consequences of one´s own actions from other sensory input and allows the mind to attribute actions to agents and particularly to the self, usually called the “sense of agency”. However, the notion that N 1 and/or P 2 <b>attenuation</b> <b>effects</b> to self-initiated sounds reflect internal forward model predictions is still controversial.
