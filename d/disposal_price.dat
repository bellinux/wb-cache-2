Monitoring the property market changes and understanding property market cycles may provides some guidance for investors and fund managers to make beneficial decisions in determining disposal and acquisitions time. Although the practice of monitoring property market has not been widely accepted in Malaysia, studies on the variations of occupancy rates and office rents in prime commercial area in Kuala Lumpur revealed the existence of the property market cycle and that it provides guidance for disposing and acquiring properties. During the period of market depression owners are forced to dispose of properties at extremely low prices in view of the increasing numbers of NPL. However if disposal can be delayed, there are chances that properties can fetch higher prices. Analysis on <b>disposal</b> <b>price</b> when the property market cycle was its lowest point during depression period has deprive the owner of a potential gain of about 70 % if they were to hold on and dispose a year later when the property market was at its recovery period. This finding suggest that the commercial property market need to be analysed monitored and kept up to date to enabled it to be utilised for any decision-making. This has important implication on the utilisation of property analyst to investors holding property assets...|$|E

They also include crimes that take place in one country with consequences that significantly affect other countries. Examples include human trafficking, smuggling (arms, drugs, currency), sex slavery, non-domestic terrorism, and financial crimes. Transnational organized crime refers specifically to transnational crime carried out by organized crime syndicates. Although several encyclopedias cover aspects of transnational crime, it is this encyclopedia’s emphasis on transnational justice, as well, that differentiates it from the pack.

40|$|The supply {{response}} of the marketed surplus of food grains in the agri-cultural sector of less-developed countries {{has long been a}} subject of debate in discussions of the effects of such policies as P. L. 480 <b>disposals,</b> food <b>price</b> regulations, and export taxes. Estimates of this response have been very few because the lack of time-series data for marketed quantities precludes direct estimation. This article presents a model for the indirect estimation of the price elasticity of the marketed surplus of a subsistence crop. The model is contrasted with an earlier model presented by Raj Krishna. The model is then applied to the case of Thai rice. In this application, some new non-linear estimates of a Nerlovian model for the total {{supply response}} of Thai rice production are also presented and discussed. SOME economists contend that the supply {{response of the}} agriculturalsector in less-developed countries is quite similar to the response in countries with high per capita incomes. Others argue that this response is perverse in the sense that increased prices result in smaller quantities. A third group maintains that institutional constraints are so limiting that no significant response to economic incentives is likely to be observed. To some degree, these different opinions have resulted from the failure to dis-tinguish explicitly between the supply of a single crop and the supply of all crops, between total production and the marketed surplus, and between short-run and long-run responses. Even after discounting for the confusion which has resulted from the failure to make explicit such distinctions, how-ever, considerable disagreement remains. Consequently, disputes continue over the role of agriculture in less-developed countries and over the effects of such policies as P.

This thesis studies a one-time excess inventory disposal problem where the demand during the disposal period (DDDP) is stochastic and its distribution depends on the <b>disposal</b> <b>price.</b> More specifically, this thesis considers a periodic-review stochastic inventory system that has been operated under a policy different from the one that is to be implemented in the future. Such a situation may arise as a result of changes in the model assumptions that lead to the implementation of a different policy. Before the new policy is implemented, there may be some units on hand that exceed the optimal order-up-to level. Consequently, the inventory manager needs to evaluate a one-time inventory disposal decision immediately before the new/modified policy replaces the policy in use. In the thesis, the situations and applications of the problem are discussed in detail, and a model applicable for all of the demand patterns is derived and analyzed. Four special models studied include the cases where the DDDP and the regular demand are assumed to be (i) exponential distribution and exponential distribution, (ii) exponential distribution and uniform distribution, (iii) uniform distribution and exponential distribution, and (iv) uniform distribution and uniform distribution, respectively. The second and fourth models do not have closed forms but they can be solved numerically. The first and third models have compact closed forms and thus the mathematical properties of the objective function are presented and explanations associated with the particular problem are provided. Based on the analytical results, the models are simplified, and the programs are developed to compute optimal solutions.

We find that {{the probability that a}} facility is selected as the destination of an off-site shipment of halogenated solvent waste depends on the cost of shipping and disposal at that facility, on measures of existing contamination at the site, and on the track record of the receiving facility. Generators do seem to balance current disposal costs with the likelihood of future liability, should the TSDF become involved in either the state or federal Superfund program. In general, we find no evidence that generators prefer “wealthier ” TSDFs or “larger ” facilities, suggesting that there is a role for smaller, private companies in the management of halogenated solvent waste. When attention is limited to so-called “restricted ” wastes containing halogenated compounds, which cannot be landfilled, the best match between the waste and the treatment offered by the facility may be more important than saving on the cost of <b>disposal,</b> and <b>price</b> may even be interpreted as a signal for quality of the facility. ...|$|R

40|$|Parallel to {{the efforts}} of the EU to achieve a {{significant}} and overall reduction of waste quantities within the EU, the Swedish parliament enacted an environmental quality objective stating that ‘the total quantity of waste must not increase …’ i. e. an eventual absolute decoupling of waste generation from GDP. The decoupling issue is ad-dressed, in the present paper, by assessing future waste quantities, for a number of economic scenarios of the Swedish economy to 2030 with alternative assumptions about key factors affecting waste generation and waste management costs. We use an integrated top-down/bottom-up approach by linking a CGE-model of the Swedish economy with a systems engineering model of the Swedish waste management system. In this way, we can in more detail consider the interaction between waste generation and waste management costs (waste <b>disposal</b> <b>prices)</b> when assessing future waste quantities. A relative decoupling of waste generation takes place in all scenarios, i. e. total waste quantities increase at a lower rate than GDP. Absolute decoupling, which re-quire total waste quantities to stabilize or to reduce, does not take place in any of the scenarios. This means that the present Swedish Environmental quality objective of stabilizing waste quantities is not met in any of the scenarios with total waste genera-tion levels of 110 per cent up to nearly 200 per cent of that in 2006. The overall impression from our analysis is that costs are high for reducing waste generation irrespective of the type of waste reduced. In other words, the waste treat-ment costs are low compared to the costs for reducing waste. This situation also means that the use of policy instruments, which induce substitution by increasing the <b>price</b> of waste <b>disposal</b> services, will have very small reducing effects on the generation of all types of waste unless the price increase brings about an introduction of waste preventing techniques and affect households {{in the direction of a}} less waste intensive behaviour. For example, the policy instruments used must affect the pattern of household consumption pattern more directly, as a differentiation of the value added tax, rather than to be directed towards the waste management sector. Economic policy instruments introduced in the waste management sector are more likely to affect the choice of waste management solutions than prevent waste generation. Linking a macroeconomic and a systems engineering model for waste manage-ment, gives us a tool useful also for capturing the macroeconomic effects, such as GDP growth and structural changes, when designing policy instruments intended to prevent waste generation or take waste management in a more sustainable direction. general equilibrium model; systems engineering; solid waste; waste management; waste generation; decoupling; EMEC; NatWaste; top-down/bottom-up; waste policy instruments...|$|R

40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 With {{electricity}} tariffs in South Africa escalating at a {{rapid pace}} the demand for alternative power sources has increased. One of these renewable energy sources includes the use of biogas. Biogas is not {{only one of the}} most efficient and effective renewable energy possibilities available but also requires less capital investment as compared to other renewable sources like hydro, solar and wind and are also more economical as it involves less per unit production cost. Biogas plants have been used around the globe for numerous years, but are a relative new technology in South Africa, predominantly in the red meat industry with the use of slaughter waste as a form of biomass. Slaughter waste offers a vital possible source of renewable energy. A variation of factors makes the production of renewable energy from slaughter waste particularly appealing. The continuous rise of energy <b>prices,</b> waste <b>disposal</b> <b>prices,</b> and incentives for renewable energy production have increased the value of outputs from slaughter waste-to-energy systems. The primary objective of the research is assessing the economic viability of biogas plants at abattoirs in South Africa and if such a biogas plant would be beneficial to an abattoir. The research aimed to determine the viability through various capital budgeting techniques and define what the most significant calculated variables are that should be addressed in such an economic viability model. For {{the purposes of this study}} a Class A abattoir with a slaughtering capacity of 400 cattle per day was used as a case study. Biogas will be generated through anaerobic digestion and the utilising of the gas for the generation of electricity and heat by means of a CHP generator. The economic viability study contains of a base case scenario and two other possible scenarios and provides recommendations and a concluding report, based on the scenario that is the most viable. The succeeding techniques which were recognised were used to analyse the economic viability of the biogas plant: Payback Period, Discounted payback period, Net present value, profitability index, and internal rate of return. Furthermore a sensitivity analysis was done in the study with a pessimistic and optimistic outcome on key variables. The study establish that in the base case scenario a positive net present value was realised, the internal rate of return was more than the required rate of return and the payback periods was shorter than required. In this study the concept of biogas plants in the red meat industry were researched with the purpose of determining the economic viability of these plants. In determining the viability of the biogas plant the key variables that will impact the viability was also identified and discussed. Based on the data gathered and assumptions that was made it was concluded that a biogas plant will be beneficial to an abattoir and was considered economically viable. Master...|$|R

Their management and recycling is a major challenge for member states. The present work aims to define the management situation of CDW in Sardinia, in order to assess the economic and social perspectives that result from the reuse as secondary raw materials. A database, integrating data from a first phase of the research (Balletto et al, 2013), has been constructed to illustrate the situation of the CDW management in Sardinia in terms of production, typologies and costs. The information were carried out by different channels: first, we asked to fill out a question form from the operators of authorized recycling facilities in the region, and, after, we collected available information in the public offices. By means of question form, information about the types of equipment, the amount of inert produced in previous years, the quality of materials (the REC codes of their waste) and the output data (type of products sold, their final use, etc.) in addition to the cost of <b>disposal</b> and sales <b>prices</b> have been collected.

40|$|For {{many centuries}} urban waste {{management}} in Europe and Northern America consisted of private – to – private arrangements to remove waste {{from the city}} centre and so restrain the spread of cholera and other diseases, odour and nuisances. The agricultural and industrial value chains provided a destination and a motivation to extract and valorise rags, ashes, dust, excreta, metals, food scraps, and many other forms of secondary resources which had some value to someone. The business of recycling developed alongside of municipal waste management, and absorbed many discarded materials, but remained a separate sector with its own practices, institutions, and economic rationality. The management of solid waste management became primarily focused on dumping waste outside the city boundaries. The ‘discovery’ {{of the relationship between}} open dumping and groundwater contamination in the 1960 s {{set the stage for a}} round of modernisation of waste management practices and institutions in high-income countries. The widely recognised and celebrated result was the shift from open dumping and open burning of waste to the engineered “regional sanitary landfill” as a large technical facility that concentrates waste, isolates it from population centres, protects ground-water and thus allows for safe modern disposal of increasingly complex materials. This proved to be a costly affair though, and  triggered a process of ecological modernisation in solid waste management characterised by institutional and financial reforms, which elevated the cost of removal. Disposal became costly, and as cities expanded, land to dump became a scarce resource. This set the stage for incorporating valorisation into the modernised waste management landscape as an alternative to modernised disposal.   The ecological modernisation process that took place in Northern Europe and North America in the 1980 s and early 1990 s changed the policies and practices of waste management in fundamental but seldom understood ways. <b>Pricing</b> of <b>disposal</b> in high-income countries represents a core financial reform which in turn stimulates local authorities to invest in their own recycling (composting, reuse) infrastructure as a lower-cost and environmentally attractive alternative. Municipal recycling emerges as a key modernised institution in the landscape of integrated waste management, where investment in recycling produces higher and higher recovery rates and a virtuous circle of more investment, more recovery, less waste, co-operation with the value chains which have been re-constituted as “recycling markets,” and lower system costs. In municipal recycling, the agricultural and industrial value chains function as alternative and lower-cost sinks, complementing the landfill and lowering costs for the whole waste management system. In low- and middle-income countries, in contrast, the ecological modernisation of solid waste is problematic and incomplete, and ‘recycling’ becomes a key new area of global conflict. <b>Priced</b> <b>disposal</b> does not come about, either because of low levels of disposable income or unwillingness of elected officials to impose a burden on tax- and rate-payers, or because the motivation to modernise disposal comes from global institutions and is insufficiently embedded in genuinely local policymaking. Without it the system-internal benefits of diverting materials from disposal to valorisation are missing. Municipal recycling does not emerge, and the virtuous cycle of increasing recovery ambitions and performance is replaced by a vicious cycle of interrupted private value chain transactions, declining valorisation rates, and increasing volumes of materials requiring expensive disposal. City authorities in low- and middle-income countries seeking to gain the financial benefits of selling materials compete with private (informal) waste pickers, recyclers, and livestock feeding operations, claim monopoly rights to materials, and criminalise value chain activities. But  they are unable to organise effective valorisation themselves, as they lack knowledge and commercial channels to reach the value chains. The value chain actors are blamed for not buying materials, but also for exploiting poor workers in miserable working conditions. Valorisation businesses are unwilling to do business with municipalities who supply low-quality materials, so the value chain transactions fail, and both avoided costs of disposal and offsetting revenues from valorisation remain elusive. Municipalities, waste system users, and the environment lose in this situation when local authorities are unable to pay landfill operating costs, and the expensive sanitary landfill infrastructure reverts to the status of a pre-modern dumpsite, which has to handle more and more waste. Agricultural and industrial value chains also suffer, because the thousands of individual and family enterprises in waste picking, recycling, and animal feeding are at risk to lose their livelihoods, or see reduced returns on their efforts due to monopoly behaviour, criminalisation, or harassment from the formal waste system actors. Mid-level value chain enterprises get fewer materials, and increasing volumes of potentially recoverable resources end up in the dump. But there are already some examples of how changing the model can produce improved results. In a small number of cities in low- and middle-income countries, the ecological modernisation of the waste management system appears to be leading to the emergence of a new model for institutionalised valorisation, provisionally called inclusive recycling. Inclusive recycling is a model for public sector acceptance of private value chain activities of valorisation. It is  a model of shared ownership, risks, and benefits, where each set of actors does what they are best at. While it builds upon the techniques for participatory planning and stakeholder engagement, as well as on technical innovations for separate collection, processing, and environmental education that characterised the development of municipal recycling in the 1980 s in OECD countries, inclusive recycling does not rely on the institutional reform of <b>priced</b> <b>disposal.</b>   Rather, it maintains the centre of gravity of valorisation activities in the industrial or agricultural value chains, where the knowledge and infrastructure exists to receive, process, and market materials. Instead of re-inventing recycling as a part of the municipal solid waste department’s responsibilities, inclusive recycling looks to intermediary institutions such as labour unions or recycling co-operatives to facilitate shared risks and responsibilities between local authorities and value chain actors. Inclusive recycling can be seen in some of its emerging forms in Asia and Latin America, particularly in situations where there is a tradition of co-operation between civil society and local authorities, large numbers of waste pickers at the base of the value chain pyramid, and where the paper and metal value chains are long, healthy, and deeply rooted.   In place of a single municipal recycling system, inclusive recycling is a mixed system where there are many different types of actors, economic niches, and business models. The results may be high levels of recovery and diversion from disposal, making it comparable to municipal recycling as a modernised institution. Like municipal recycling, inclusive recycling contributes to the pluralism of the modernised system, with a proliferation of actors, activities, and economic niches, which qualify it as what ecological modernization scholars have called a ‘modernised mixture’. However, inclusive recycling is not municipal recycling, and in the absence of <b>priced</b> <b>disposal,</b> the risks for both local authorities and value chain actors remain high. Combining global knowledge with local control of ecological modernisation processes is one approach to keeping the risks limited and enlarging the space for the virtuous circle of inclusive recycling to take root and flourish.   ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} venture-capital backing of UK companies issuing shares at flotation {{on the characteristics of}} the lock-in agreements entered into by the existing shareholders, and on the abnormal returns realised around the expiry of the directors' lock-in agreements. The study {{examines the}} lock-in agreements of a sample of 186 UK IPOs issued during 1992 - 98. 103 of these companies had venture-capital backing at the IPO. The sample is also broken down into firms classified by industrial sector: of 103 VC backed companies 48 are high-tech, and among the 83 firms without VC backing 33 are high-tech. We find that lock-in agreements in the UK show much more variety in terms of the contractual detail than US agreements. Lock-in periods are particularly long for venture-backed high-tech companies. By contrast, for firms not in the high-tech sector, venture-capital backing appears to reduce the directors' lock-in periods. This suggests that for UK IPOs venture-capital backing does not serve as a substitute for lock-in agreements. Examining the proportion of locked-in directors' shares, we find it to be significantly higher in VC-backed firms as compared to firms without VC backing in the sample of firms not classified as high tech. This suggests that for firms likely to face only moderate information asymmetries (i. e. those not in high-tech industries), venture-capital backing of the IPO is not used as a substitute for, but rather as a complement to, lock-in agreements. The higher proportion of locked-in directors' shares among VC-backed companies (not in the high-tech sector) may be because the underwriters of VC-backed IPOs expect heavy sales by the VCs in the period after the IPO and decide to lock in the directors' shares and in order to limit the downward pressure of the VC's <b>disposals</b> on stock <b>prices.</b> Alternatively, if VCs do not sell out completely in the IPO, as reported by Barry et al. 1990, they may seek to align the directors' interests with their own by locking the directors in. We also examine the share-price performance of IPOs with and without VC backing {{around the time of the}} expiry of the lock-in agreements, and find that the CAARs for the VC-backed stocks are lower for most of the short windows around the expiry date, both for the sample as a whole and separately for each industry sector. For the sample of 28 VC-backed stocks, the CAARs are statistically significantly less than zero at the 1 % level for the narrow one-to three-day windows around the expiry date. For the VC-backed stocks, the CAARs range from - 1. 2 % to - 1. 6 % (and even to - 2 % for the 11 -day window, but this result is not statistically significant), while the corresponding CAARs for the stocks without VC backing range only from - 0. 2 % to - 0. 8. ...|$|R
