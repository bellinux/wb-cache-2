5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence {{that not only was}} James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo <b>ever</b> <b>even</b> existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E
5|$|In December 2003, Neuner won the German Cup for 17-year-olds, {{which led}} to her {{appointment}} for the 2003–04 European Cup competition for juniors. With four wins at European level, Neuner qualified for the 2004 Junior/Youth World Championships in Haute Maurienne, France, where she won the sprint and relay events, as well as silver in the pursuit. One year later at the 2005 Junior/Youth World Championships in Kontiolahti, Finland, she claimed two silver medals (pursuit and relay), and again won the sprint discipline. With her success at junior level, Neuner at 18 years old, {{was considered one of}} Germany's biggest biathlon talents <b>ever.</b> <b>Even</b> before achieving any results at senior level, she had signed a sponsorship deal.|$|E
25|$|After his appointment, Fulco {{appears in}} sources only once. In 1171, Pope Alexander III asked the Archbishop of Trondheim to assign an Estonian monk Nicolaus living in Stavanger {{to go to}} Fulco's assistance.

25|$|There {{once was}} a fourth primary pantheon, the Eastern Pantheon, based on the Greek pantheon led by Zeus.

Ealham took five wickets for only 15 runs. At the time {{this was the best}} bowling performance by an Englishman in a one-day international match <b>ever.</b> <b>Even</b> more remarkable is that all five wickets were LBWs. This is still a record in one-day international cricket.|$|E
25|$|The Magic's 15th {{season in}} 2003–04 {{proved to be}} one of its toughest <b>ever.</b> <b>Even</b> with the {{acquisition}} of veteran free agents Tyronn Lue and Juwan Howard, the Magic struggled early. After winning its first game, the Magic lost 19 consecutive games, setting a franchise record. They finished an NBA worst 21–61. Despite this, McGrady led the league in scoring with 28.0 ppg, made the All-NBA 2nd Team and his 4th consecutive All-Star Team. In the middle of the 19-game losing streak, coach Doc Rivers was fired, and assistant Johnny Davis was promoted to head coach. General manager Gabriel was replaced by John Weisbrod.|$|E

25|$|Citizen Kane is {{loosely based}} on Hearst's life. Welles and co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz created Kane as a {{composite}} character of multiple men, among them Harold McCormick, Samuel Insull and Howard Hughes. Hearst, enraged {{at the idea of}} Citizen Kane being a thinly disguised and very unflattering portrait of him, used his massive influence and resources in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the film from being released-—all without his <b>ever</b> <b>even</b> having seen it. Welles and the studio RKO Pictures resisted the pressure, but Hearst and his Hollywood friends ultimately succeeded in pressuring theater chains to limit showings of Citizen Kane, resulting in only moderate box-office numbers and seriously harming Welles' career later on.|$|E

Olivio Umberto from RnB Junk was positive towards the visual, with him feeling that [...] "the look, the scenery and clothing present Alexandra in all her beauty and sensuality, but always preserve a class of aura, without <b>ever</b> <b>even</b> getting close to vulgarity." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{supporter}} of the LGBT movement, Nelson published in 2006 through iTunes a version of Ned Sublette's [...] "Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other", that met instant success. During an interview with Texas Monthly in 2013, regarding the Defense of Marriage Act and Same-sex marriage in the United States, Nelson responded to a comparison the interviewer made with the Civil Rights Movement, stating: [...] "We'll {{look back and say}} it was crazy that we <b>ever</b> <b>even</b> argued about this". He also presented two logos with the pink equal sign, symbol of the LBGT movement. The first one, featured the sign represented with two long braids; while the second one, featured the sign represented with two marijuana cigarettes. The use of the logos became viral instantly in social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.|$|E
500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{praised the}} episode and specific elements of it, like Michael {{wandering around the}} office drunk {{and many of the}} documentary-style interviews, like Charles talking about his effect on women, Toby comparing Michael to a movie on a plane and Kevin being too lazy to compliment Michael in person. But he said the episode was [...] "elevated" [...] by Michael and Pam forming a partnership at the end: [...] "Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer are always brilliant in those moments when they have to show multiple emotions at once, so it was nice to finally see them get to do it side-by-side." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said [...] "Two Weeks" [...] offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although he said it was [...] "not a nonstop laugh riot", he said it [...] "highlights what The Office does that few other shows <b>ever</b> <b>even</b> attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 7, Trump {{appeared}} in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, where he spoke before the Chamber of Commerce, attended a Reform Party fundraiser, {{and held a}} joint press conference with Ventura.

At the press conference, Trump claimed {{he had yet to}} decide whether to run officially and so had not asked for Ventura's endorsement. [...] Ventura said that if Trump decided to run, he would give his [...] "full consideration." [...] Trump asserted it would be [...] "disaster for the Reform Party" [...] if Pat Buchanan received the presidential nomination. Describing himself and Ventura as self-made and not part of the [...] "lucky sperm club," [...] Trump made an indirect jab at both the Republican front-runner George W. Bush, the son of former President Bush, and Democratic front-runner Al Gore, son of the late Senator Albert Gore, Sr.. Trump and Ventura released a written statement opposing the Commission on Presidential Debates' decision to limit debate participation to candidates polling above 15 percent in the general election and urging the Federal Election Commission to take action.|$|E

500|$|Aly Semigran for Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} episode [...] "was {{nowhere near as}} good" [...] as other recent episodes as it was [...] "too {{dependent}} on obvious physical comedy." [...] IGN writer Robert Canning took no strong position on the episode, saying it had [...] "jokes {{enough to make it}} funny, but nothing over the top to make it classic," [...] rating the episode 8.2 out of 10. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin was more clearly positive about the episode, calling it a [...] "glorious return to form" [...] and grading the episode an A-. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad opined he was not thrilled with Jenna's plot, observing that it was [...] "kinda ridiculous (and unfunny, which is the worse sin)." [...] Sassone, however, said that Liz and Tracy feuding and Jack and his mother battling [...] "are plots that are always good for some laughs." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger wrote that while [...] "The Natural Order" [...] was not a [...] "classic episode" [...] it was still [...] "solid enough, in the end." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed Jack and his mother's story, but commented that the Liz and Tracy rivalry was a [...] "hit-or-miss." [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts said this episode [...] "is easily the show's most grounded episode <b>ever,</b> <b>even</b> if it does feature a gibbon in a mariachi suit. The script dares to deal with issues of race and gender from a typically irreverent perspective." [...] Fretts noted that Elaine Stritch and Alec Baldwin [...] "share a surprisingly tender scene as Colleen tells her son, 'You're my good boy I just love you to death.'" ...|$|E

[...] This left the team with their first winless season <b>ever,</b> <b>even</b> though there were some strong performances over the year. [...] Consistent finishes in the World Championship were not be enough for Brun to defend their title, yet the team finished in second, ahead of plethora of Porsche teams.|$|E
2500|$|Kreuger invented another {{financial}} instrument, {{which continues}} to be used and is nowadays known as American Depositary Receipts. That issue was called Kreuger & Toll [...] "American Certificates". American investors had never seen an investment like this. It was part bond, part preferred stock, and part profit sharing option. The certificates enabled investors to gain exposure to a foreign company that had been paying dividends of 25 percent. It would be backed by the largest private loan to a foreign government (i.e. Germany) <b>ever.</b> <b>Even</b> {{in the midst of}} the growing panic investors went crazy for the issue and promised to buy 28 million dollars of the new securities.
