5|$|By {{the time}} of Sophia's birth, Briggs had {{achieved}} a high standing within his profession. Nevertheless, he considered retiring from the sea to go into business with his seafaring brother Oliver, who had also grown tired of the wandering life. They did not proceed with this project, but instead each invested his savings in a share of a ship: Oliver in Julia A. Hallock, and Benjamin in Mary Celeste. In October 1872, Benjamin took command of Mary Celeste for her first voyage following her extensive New York refit, which was {{to take her to}} Genoa in Italy.

5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle.

Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E
5|$|In 1760, {{with the}} Seven Years' War raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked by {{advancing}} Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov paid {{compensation for the}} damage caused to Euler's estate, later Empress Elizabeth of Russia added a further payment of 4000 roubles – an exorbitant amount at the time. The political situation in Russia stabilized after Catherine the Great's accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant – a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. All of these requests were granted. He spent {{the rest of his life}} in Russia. However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage.|$|E

His FBK commanding officer, Franz Schädle, appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. Misch handled all of the direct communication from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Schädle called him on the phone and told him there was a place reserved <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the Führerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post.|$|E

25|$|A person {{holding a}} {{high-ranking}} office within {{one of the}} highest classes of rank automatically received ennoblement for himself, <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> for his legitimate children, and for decades this status was normally hereditable for his patrilineal and legitimate descendants. However, basically all such ennoblements were annulled when King Christian VI, tired of his father's generosity, acceded to the throne in 1730, and only those who received a special recognition after making an application retained their noble status. The office nobility as such was not abolished. Subsequent royal decrees introduced a more restrictive policy, under which noble status dependent on offices was limited to the person concerned, to his wife, and to his legitimate children.|$|E
