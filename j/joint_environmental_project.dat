50|$|Save the Brahmaputra River is {{the first}} <b>joint</b> Indo-British <b>environmental</b> <b>project</b> {{focusing}} on creating awareness about the ecological challenges faced {{by one of the}} world's mightiest rivers. This cross-continental campaign was officially launched on 31 July 2009 at Guwahati Press Club in presence of environmentalists, scholars and campaigners from both United Kingdom and India. Within a year of its launch, the campaign received extensive international coverage and support for its proactive works in saving the river from environmental threats.|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{based on}} a larger study that {{was carried out by}} a joint Palestinian – Israeli {{research}} team before and during the Al Aqsa Intifada, examines Israeli and Palestinian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have worked on <b>joint</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>projects.</b> We focus here on three jointly run Palestinian – Israeli NGOs, 16 Israeli organizations and 12 Palestinian organizations that engaged in cooperative work, looking at the kind of work they did, their perceptions of the causes of environmental damage and its connection to the conflict, their perceptions of the roles of NGOs within their societies, and obstacles encountered in cooperative work. Data about the NGOs were collected through face-to-face audio taped interviews, their publications, and from their websites. Results showed that while the Israeli and Palestinian NGOs agree that joint work is needed to address ecological problems, they differ in their reasons for working together, their perceptions of the sources of environmental deterioration, the roles that NGOs should be taking within their society, the relationship of the Israeli – Palestinian conflict to the state of the environment, and the effect that a final peace agreement would have on solving these problems. It was concluded that the “environmental narratives” of the two sides differ greatly, and that the establishment of a “culture of peace” is a very long-term process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{show how}} {{one of the}} Kyoto Protocol mechanisms, the {{so-called}} <b>joint</b> implementation in <b>environmental</b> <b>projects,</b> can be transformed into and studied as an infinite-dimensional quasi-variational inequality. Specifically, we examine {{the situation in which}} different countries attempt to fulfill Kyoto commitments by investing in emission reduction or emission removal projects in countries where the abatement costs are lower. We derive the equilibrium conditions and prove their characterization in terms of an infinite-dimensional quasi-variational inequality problem. Finally, we discuss the existence of solutions...|$|R
40|$|European {{partners}} from 11 countries {{working in}} the framework of the Blended Learning Institutions’ Cooperative (blinc) have been applying web-based, mixed learning methodologies for different learning groups and contexts in three different projects. The INTEGRATION project deals with intercultural staff training for organisations working with multiethnic clients and beneficiaries. Nine partners from six nations have been developing audiovisual learning and training materials. This was done by using video-graphic approaches in intercultural training, analysing given situations of intercultural encounters in a critical incident approach, and producing and documenting “intercultural micro-communications ” as short online films. In the framework of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Environmental</b> Management (JEM!) <b>project</b> funded by Socrates, Joint Actions Programme partners from five countries applied an eCoaching System for the introduction of environmental management in European schools. The content of the system consists of fully-fledged courses, training materials and accompanying guidelines for teachers, trainers or consultants. The applied system used in JEM! was developed {{in the framework of}} a project entitled “IEM in hospitals”, which was recognised as one of the five best projects out of 2, 500 since 1992. In the framework of JEM!, the approach was transferred to European schools. Training and counsellin...|$|R
