The uncertainties {{in the original}} measurements (about 3 ppm), and the time span between the two observations, imply that tectonic signals larger than about 0. 03 ppm/yr are resolvable. Along the Apenninic belt, where the largest earthquakes are concentrated, the geodetic deformation has a clear and consistent strain pattern between adjacent regions, well above the uncertainties, and shows a pervasive NE-SW extension. Along the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic coasts the geodetic signal is not homogeneous and is comparable with the uncertainty in the original measurements. Seismic deformation, calculated over the same time interval, agrees well with estimated extensional direction, but the magnitudes of geodetic and seismic strain differ suggesting that, in part of the Apennines, significant strain accumulation over the past 130 years {{may not have been}} released in earthquakes...|$|E

40|$|Global plate models predict about 56 mm/yr {{of motion}} between the North American and Pacific plates along the plate {{boundary}} in southern California, while geodetic and Holocene geological data suggest only 34 mm/yr on the San Andreas fault. Deformation in the Great Basin {{does not explain}} this discrepancy, {{and it has been}} suggested that faulting in the offshore of southern California could account for some of the discrepancy. Evidence of deformation in the offshore region of southern California is most abundant in the Santa Barbara Channel. Geological investigations of folding and faulting in this region, as well as earthquake investigations, indicate north-south shortening across the channel on the order of 10 to 20 mm/yr. The most rapid rates occur to the east of the channel in the Ventura Basin. South of the Santa Barbara Channel, though, evidence for deformation is limited to seismicity studies which are sparse. Seismic events are abundant in this area, but their implication for the amount of deformation in the offshore is unclear. GPS measurements made between June 1986 and May 1988 have been used to obtain vector positions for several stations at which historical <b>first</b> <b>order</b> <b>triangulation</b> observations were performed between the late 1800 's and the mid 1900 's between the coast of southern California and the nearby offshore islands. By comparing the spheroidal angles obtained from the GPS positions with the the previously observed triangulation data, shear strain rates can be calculated for the region using Frank's method. These results seem to suggest that shear strain deformation occurs in the offshore of southern California as a result of north to north-west shortening. That deformation is most active in the Santa Barbara Channel region and least active between Catalina and San Nicholas islands. Just how much of the missing plate motion can be accounted for by this deformation is not known at this time and will have to await further analysis...|$|E

40|$|When a {{triangulation}} {{of a set}} {{of points}} and edges is required, the constrained Delaunay triangulation is often the preferred choice because of its well-shaped triangles. However, in applications like terrain modeling, it is sometimes necessary to have flexibility to optimize some other aspect of the triangulation, while still having nicely-shaped triangles and including a set of constraints. Higher <b>order</b> Delaunay <b>triangulations</b> were introduced to provide a class of well-shaped triangulations, flexible enough to allow the optimization of some extra criterion. But they are not able to handle constraints: a single constraining edge may cause that all triangulations with that edge have high order, allowing ill-shaped triangles at any part of the triangulation. In this paper we generalize the concept of the constrained Delaunay <b>triangulation</b> to higher <b>order</b> constrained Delaunay <b>triangulations.</b> We study several possible definitions that assure that an order-k constrained Delaunay triangulation exists for any k ≥ 0, while maintaining the character of higher <b>order</b> Delaunay <b>triangulations</b> of point sets.
