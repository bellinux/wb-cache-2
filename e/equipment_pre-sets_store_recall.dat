The human perceives {{the information about the}} environment from multiple sensory complex cues, creates and maintains spatial representations in short-term and long-term spatial memory and applies the created spatial representations to direct navigational behavior [31]. In this term, spatial navigation in humans is performed by using a complex cognitive map to acquire, code, <b>store,</b> <b>recall,</b> and decode spatial information that is perceived from the environment and the application of a hierarchy of navigation strategies that are formulated based on human spatio-temporal thinking skills [32, 33].|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, an {{effort has been}} made for <b>storing</b> and <b>recalling</b> images with Hopfield Neural Network Model of auto-associative memory. Images are stored by calculating a {{corresponding}} weight matrix. Thereafter, starting from an arbitrary configuration, the memory will settle on exactly that stored image, which is nearest to the starting configuration in terms of Hamming distance. Thus given an incomplete or corrupted version of a stored image, the network is able to recall the corresponding original image. The storing of the objects has been performed according to the Hopfield algorithm explained below. Once the net has completely learnt this set of input patterns, a set of testing patterns containing degraded images {{will be given to}} the net. Then the Hopfield net will tend to recall the closest matching pattern for the given degraded image. The simulated results show that Hopfield model is the best for <b>storing</b> and <b>recalling</b> images...|$|R

40|$|A fully {{connected}} recurrent network that {{is capable of}} <b>storing,</b> <b>recalling,</b> and generating a pattern sequence, is presented. This network reproduces a memorized sequence by synchronous updating, and can independently adjust the duration of occurrence of each pattern in the sequence. Such a capability is obtained by using a state dependent threshold for each cell, which reflects the characteristics of the neuron refractory period, and by the use of the hyperbolic tangent activation function rather than a hard limit. Computer simulations highlight the capabilities of the proposed architecture. I. Introduction The recognition and generation of temporal sequences is fundamental {{to a wide range of}} cognitive processes. A sequence is distinguished not only by its composite patterns and pattern transitions, but also by the duration of each pattern. For example, when a melody suddenly comes to mind, both its notes and meters are recalled. If it is either out of tune or off the beat, the melody [...] ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Geographical Information Systems is an {{information}} system used to enter, <b>store,</b> <b>recall,</b> process, analyze, and produce geographically referenced or geospatial data, to support {{decision making in}} the planning. By using GIS hoped will facilitate decision-makers to know the location of public services and facilities, existing facilities in the City of Tuban.

With this GIS will be obtained some information in detail and visualization {{in the form of the}} mobile web (WAP), which can be used as a reference for decision-makers, especially in finding the location of existing public services in the town of Tuban.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of contemporary research on music cognition has focussed on perceptual processes in the lis-tener 1 – 4. This is unsurprising and defensible: the musical ex-perience of the listener {{is at the heart}} of all musical activity. Without heard experience composition and performance would have no purpose. In addition, the {{vast majority}} of the population in contemporary industrialized nations are lis-teners rather than performers. It makes sense to focus scien-tific effort on processes that are shared by the majority of a population. Taking into account performers as well as lis-teners, the core questions for the study of music cognition are: what representational and control processes underlie people’s ability to recognize, <b>store,</b> <b>recall,</b> transform and generate musical materials? Research on music perception has established that, as for language, the cognition of music is underpinned by the human ability to extract, store and manipulate a range of abstract structural representations from a comple...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{concerns of}} the field of cognitive psychology-understanding the nature of the mental representation of information and the processes which operate on those representations-have received their most extensive examination in the past decade in the field of psycholinguistics. The reasons for this are obvious: language is a relatively accessible domain for study, and the systematic classification and observation brought by linguistics and philosophy to language provided a major initial stepping stone for the investigation of the psychological functions underlying human language production and comprehension. And, while there has been much growth {{in a number of other}} fields in the area of cognition, the now-expanded domain of psycholinguistics still represents one of the most promising and profitable areas for examining cognitive function. It appears likely that major breakthroughs in understanding the extent of (and constraints on) our ability to perceive, process, <b>store,</b> <b>recall</b> and comprehend information will come from gaining a detailed empirical understanding of the nature of languag...|$|R

25|$|Studies {{have tested}} the {{difference}} between what men and women can recall after a presentation. Three speakers were involved, one being female and two being male. Men and women were put into the same lecture hall and had the same speaker talk to them. The results suggested that information presented by the women speaker was more easily recalled by {{all the members of the}} study. Researchers believe this to be a significant difference between genders because women's voices have better acoustics, ranging from low tones to high tones. Since their voices have this range, semantic encoding is increased for the pitches that stimulate the auditory component of the brain; this resonates better in the ear function. Since pitch ranges from low tones to high tones, it draws people's attention to the words attributed with the tone. As the tone changes, words stand out and from these differences memories can be <b>stored.</b> <b>Recall</b> is made easier since the association the brain can make is between words and sounds spoken.|$|R
