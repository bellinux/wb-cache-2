5|$|You Me at Six {{formed in}} Weybridge, Surrey in 2004. The band's line-up {{consisted}} of vocalist Josh Franceschi, guitarists Max Helyer and Chris Miller, bassist Matt Barnes, and drummer Joe Phillips. The group released an EP, We <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>It</b> <b>Means</b> <b>to</b> Be Alone in 2006, after which, Phillips left the band. Dan Flint, a friend the band {{had gone to}} college with, was initially asked to fill in on drums for a tour. He ended up becoming Phillips' permanent replacement following the band's appearance at Slam Dunk Festival 2007. The band then released another EP later in 2007.|$|E

The cover was released {{as a single}} and received airplay on adult alternative stations. It also features altered lyrics in the chorus, instead of [...] "But he knows not what it means, knows not what it means. And I say" [...] his version is [...] "But he don't know what it means, Don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> love someone". He has stated the lyric change was a mistake during the recording process, caused by him not reading the lyrics before recording the song.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 November 2006, {{the region}} of the Komi Republic in Russia filed a lawsuit against t.A.T.u. over the album and song [...] "Lyudi Invalidy" [...] (translates to {{disabled}} people). Leonid Vakuev, a human rights representative for the Komi Republic, interpreted the song as being directed towards disabled people and cited words written in the booklet for the album, which said: [...] " [...] do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be a human being. They are fakes inside the human form. They do not live, but— function". Katina said, [...] "Of course, we meant moral invalids, people who do not have [...] soul and human feelings." [...] When asked if they had anything against disabled people, she stated that she finds it offensive to refer to people by that term, and added, [...] "We take pictures together and make sure they have priority seats [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|The first Harmonists left Pennsylvania in June 1814 and {{traveled}} by flatboat {{to their new}} land in the Indiana Territory. In May 1815 {{the last of the}} Harmonists who had remained behind until the sale of their town in Pennsylvania was completed departed for their new town along the Wabash River. Frederick Reichert Rapp, George Rapp's adopted son, drew up the town plan for their new village at Harmony, Indiana, which surveyors laid out on August 8, 1814. By 1816, the same year that Indiana became a state, the Harmonists had acquired [...] of land, built 160 homes and other buildings, and cleared [...] for their new town. The settlement also began to attract new arrivals, including emigrants from Germany such as members of Rapp's congregation from Wurttemberg, many of whom expected the Harmonists to pay for their passage to America. However, the new arrivals [...] "were more of a liability than an asset". On March 20, 1819, Rapp commented, [...] "It is astonishing how much trouble the people who have arrived here have made, for they have no morals and do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> live a moral and well-mannered life, not to speak of true Christianity, of denying the world or yourself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harry Schwarz {{was born}} Heinz Schwarz to Fritz (1897–1969) and Alma Schwarz (1901–1999) in Cologne, Germany. His family {{belonged to the}} Glockengasse Synagogue. He arrived in South Africa as a Jewish refugee from Germany in 1934 {{with his mother and}} younger brother Kurt. His father Fritz, a Social Democratic Party activist, left for South Africa the night the Nazis came to power. They boarded the SS Giulio Cesare in Genoa, Italy which took them to South Africa. When they arrived in Cape Town they stayed in one room in a house in Kloof Street. Schwarz {{described}} how he was [...] "lucky" [...] as eventually he was able to sleep in a bathroom in a rusty bath. He spoke no Afrikaans or English at first and had strong memories of being taunted on the schoolyard for being different. Schwarz stated in an interview in 1991 that [...] "I know what the word discrimination means, not because I've read it in a book, but because I've been the subject of it. And I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> be hungry." [...] The discrimination and financial difficulties of his family left a strong impression on Schwarz and helped shape his political philosophy with its emphasis on social justice and the rule of law.|$|E
