5|$|Reactions {{to the new}} freeway {{were not}} all positive. In a special {{editorial}} in The Grand Rapids Press after the freeway opened in 2004, local resident Curt MacDougall summarized the criticisms of the new freeway. He cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>mean</b> increased development. That development will mean further urban sprawl, and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, the Voyager crew discover a ship sent from Starfleet that could take them back to the Alpha Quadrant in just 3 months, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>mean</b> abandoning their vessel. However, it is all revealed to be an elaborate trap as the alien Arturis (Ray Wise) attempts to gain his revenge on the crew for preventing the destruction of the Borg.|$|E
5|$|Abi {{gets her}} job back at The Queen Vic and celebrates with Lauren and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Lee's {{pregnant}} fiancée. Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi {{to confess to}} Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen freezer room {{as an act of}} revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone in the kitchen with Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi wants to move out. Abi is inwardly resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's partner, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they would make a good couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too young to be a mother. On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>mean</b> nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying about having a brain tumour so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren. Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) overhears Abi and Steven talking about their relationship and confronts them. Abi then discovers she is pregnant by Steven.|$|E

25|$|Keleon {{explains}} {{that if the}} trio defeat Eldrith, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>mean</b> {{the destruction of the}} Tower itself, as well as freeing the ghosts within. However, as they cannot leave the tower the way they entered, it will most likely lead to their own deaths. They find Eldrith alone {{on the roof of the}} Tower guarding another portal. She reiterates her plans for the destruction of Baldur's Gate. They fight and defeat her, and as she dies, she repents her actions and asks forgiveness. With the tower crumbling around them, the heroes enter the portal, not knowing where it leads.|$|E
25|$|Pronominal {{adjectives}} have {{a variety}} of purposes in modern Lithuanian. One of them is the definitiveness, that is, these adjectives can sometimes act like an equivalent of the definite article in English: Suvalgiau raudoną obuolį – I’ve eaten a red apple; Suvalgiau raudonąjį obuolį – I’ve eaten the red apple. But they are rarely used this way, as demonstrative pronouns serve better for this purpose. Pronominal adjectives often indicate something unique, thus they are usually used with proper names: Juodoji jūra, Vytautas Didysis, Naujoji Zelandija. Another use (and a very common) is scientific terminology: kvapusis mairūnas, dėmėtoji pelėda, standusis diskas etc. In almost all of these cases, a simple adjective can be used, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>mean</b> a completely different thing: juoda jūra (instead of Juodoji jūra) means any sea that is black (not necessarily the particular sea in Eastern Europe); dėmėta pelėda (instead of dėmėtoji pelėda) means any owl that has dots on its plumage (not necessarily an owl of the Strix occidentalis species) etc.|$|E
500|$|In 1999 Hippe became Editor-in-Chief of Økonomisk Rapport (ØR). Hippe openly {{supported}} the Labour Party Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg from mid 2000 in Stoltenberg's first term (17 March 2000 to 19 October 2001). Hippe believed the government needed {{to spend more}} money from the Norwegian oil fund, saying: [...] "The greatest paradox today is that the government refuses to investigate what <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>mean</b> to buy goods and services abroad in fear that someone will come {{up with the idea of}} spending more money than we do today. The government plays with the lives of the sick and aggravates children's education because of the dogma that oil money cannot be used". Hippe left his position as Editor-in-Chief in 2002 because the new owners did not share the same future plans for the magazine as he did. He was succeeded by Joachim Bamrud. Six months after Hippe left a number of journalists and most of the old leadership staff had also left the magazine.|$|E

It emphasised that its recommendation to the commissioners had been against the move. [...] "The Football Association sees it as vital for the game to stop these circumstances ever happening again," [...] the statement concluded. The {{chief executive of the}} FA, Adam Crozier, said that he believed the commission to have made an [...] "appalling decision". Koppel said the decision had saved Wimbledon Football Club. A spokesman for Milton Keynes Council said the people of Milton Keynes were looking forward to the team's arrival, stating: [...] "It will be of great benefit to the city. Milton Keynes is becoming a city of sport." [...] In the eyes of the WISA, the Dons Trust and most of the Wimbledon F.C. fanbase, the move's sanctioning marked the [...] "death of their club". [...] "If it moves <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>mean</b> nothing to us," [...] said Marc Jones, a WISA spokesman.

Britain's then foreign secretary (later prime minister) James Callaghan later disclosed that U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger [...] "vetoed" [...] at least one British military action to pre-empt the Turkish landing. 40% of the land came under Turkish occupation reaching as far south as the Louroujina Salient.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{contentious}} {{decision of the}} series was when Don Bradman was not given out {{when he was on}} 28 in the First Test.

Australia were 72/2 when Bill Voce bowled a ball that [...] "flew from the blade of the bat to Ikin". [...] Clif Cary was watching Bradman with Zeiss glasses while commentating on the radio and reported [...] "The next ball from Voce rises as it goes away and Bradman is out...Bradman out, caught Ikin at second slip, bowled by Voce, for 28". Ikin made the mistake of not appealing immediately as it was assumed that a batsmen will walk when he is so obviously out, but [...] "Bradman stood there as if he had never hit the ball" [...] "The fieldsmen stared as Bradman stood his ground, then appealed for a catch. In believing that he had jammed the ball on to the ground before it rose, Don was in a minority of the nearest witnesses on the field but that minority included the umpire".
