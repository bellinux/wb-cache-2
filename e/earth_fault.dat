In the United States and Canada, panel-mounted devices that combine ground (<b>earth)</b> <b>fault</b> detection and over-current protection are called ground fault interrupter (GFI) breakers; a wall mounted outlet device or separately enclosed plug-in device providing ground fault detection and interruption only (no overload protection) is called a {{ground fault circuit interrupter}} (GFCI).|$|E
25|$|In Marvel Family #10, Atlantis appears. It was sunk about 8000 BC by an <b>earth</b> <b>fault</b> {{below the}} Island, but the Sivana Family hope {{to use an}} element there for a machine to prevent the Marvels calling their {{lightning}} down. A scientist Chal-Patzun, hoped to have Atlantis raised in the Future by his descendants, his son having gone to the mainland. He had discovered an element called Protium, which in 10,000 years would become Neutrium, and in another 10,000 years, Electrium. A machine powered by this would raise the Island. Before Atlantis sinks, Georgia Sivana, having traveled to the past, steals a vial of Protium. During the 20th century his descendant, Dr. Charles Patterson, is shot by Sivana while in the vault after he tries to stop him taking Neutrium. It is raised around AD 12,000 by Dr. Charles Patterson's own descendant, Chass Passon, though two of the vials had been stolen by the Sivanas {{in the past and}} present, leaving just eight. Sivana Jr. succeeds in taking a vial of Electrium just after the Island is raised. Atlantis is apparently located around the Atlantic coast latitude 35. See more on Sivana Family.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effects of double <b>earth</b> <b>faults</b> in Medium Voltage (MV) networks, in presence of electrical interconnection of the earthing systems of the secondary substations. In urban areas, indeed, the earth electrodes of the secondary substations are interconnected and, in many cases, they are also connected to the earth electrodes of the primary stations, in order to realize quasi-equipotential surfaces, intrinsically safe against electric shocks, named Global Earthing Systems (GES). The concept of GES has been introduced in the technical literature ten years ago in the Document HD 637 S 1 by CENELEC, with the aim of providing a solution to the problems of designing and verifying the effectiveness of the earth electrodes of the secondary substations located inside urban areas. In these areas, usually, fault currents are higher and it is more complicated to execute large earthing systems and to execute earth resistance measurements. Unfortunately, the concept of GES has not been adequately exploited, primarily due to the absence of precise indications on how to recognize a GES among all the interconnected, but not necessarily intrinsically safe, large earthing systems. The study of these systems has been done in the past by using practical methods or touch and step voltages measurements and, first of all, with regards only to single line to <b>earth</b> <b>faults.</b> Nevertheless in very old MV network, expecially in those managed with unearthed neutral points, single line to <b>earth</b> <b>faults</b> can evolve into double <b>earth</b> <b>faults,</b> characterized by very high fault currents (about the 80...|$|R
