This fallacy led to the condor's extirpation {{in some parts of}} the western United States.

The Zhengs brought 70,000 soldiers to Taiwan and immediately began clearing {{large tracts of}} land to support its forces. Despite the preoccupation with fighting the Qing, the Zheng family was concerned with aboriginal welfare on Taiwan. The Zhengs built alliances, collected taxes and erected aboriginal schools, where Taiwan's aborigines were first introduced to the Confucian Classics and Chinese writing.

5|$|Before the mid-1870s, the {{judicial}} system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character, particularly {{because most of the}} judges were legally unqualified. Most of {{the judicial}} procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling <b>deeply</b> <b>ingrained</b> political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of {{the judicial system}}, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It helped that Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|E

In this article, the myth {{and narrative}} are analyzed as the features of human psycholinguistic structures, aiding the creation of variety of meanings that affects the everyday mass consciousness. Modern myths differ from the classical ones, due to their genesis and clear pragmatics, framed for a particular social group. This unites modern mythology with the ideology. Narrative becomes {{the way of the}} last maintenance, turning the plot of various events into yet another mythological subject. Therefore, the article presents the process of narrative’s genesis from the myth; the common and distinctive features of myth and narrative are compared. They have such common features as metaphoricity, symbolism, imagery. Myth and narrative are based on the metaphorical theory of truth. Instead of searching the truth, their main function becomes the creation of meanings through the interpretation and representation. The differences between the classical myth and narrative are also analyzed in the article (tabulated), which are stipulated mainly due to the different time perception - cyclic for a myth and linear for narrative. The article also shows the features, distinguishing the modern political myth from the traditional classical...|$|R
5000|$|Occurring {{approximately}} {{thirty years}} after the first crisis, the Kingdom of Anacreon, still the largest of the Four Kingdoms, once again planned to conquer the Foundation in order to gain its technological resources. Having grown in power since the original Crisis, even the other three kingdoms united were not enough of a deterrent to forestall attack. Aware that this was always a distinct possibility, the Foundation had since spread a cult of science through the barbarian kingdoms. Providing technological aid to the Four Kingdoms in a further attempt to forestall hostility, the Foundation had withheld all scientific explanation on the functioning of their technology, the equipment was operated by technicians who only had an empirical knowledge of the science surrounding the feats that were accomplished. Furthermore, the technicians and populace were indoctrinated into a religion that placed all science within the realm of magic and Terminus in the role of a religious capital. This religion was <b>ingrained</b> <b>deeply</b> enough into the mentality of the populace that the common people of the kingdoms would oppose any attack on Terminus by their leaders because it would be regarded as [...] "sin," [...] and the soldiers of Anacreon rebelled when they learned what their leaders were planning.|$|R

40|$|The National Clinical Director of Mental Health for NHS England {{has said}} {{that we need to}} ‘dump Descartes’, and the authors of one of psychiatry’s {{principal}} diagnostic manuals have stated that the term mental disorder is a dualistic anachronism. Existing critical challenges to dualism, including affect theory, new materialism and phenomenology, have sought to reinstate meaning for the material body, and biomedical work exploring the immune system, epigenetics and the microbiome-gut-brain axis suggests that mind over matter is an untenable principle. Moreover, UK government health strategies have come to recognise the relationship between mental and physical health outcomes and are increasingly focused on connecting up care. However, mind and body dualism is <b>deeply</b> and habitually <b>ingrained</b> in medical practice, healthcare structures and research silos. Despite efforts focused on integration, the dominating influence of psychiatric discourse and the focus on mental health {{within the confines of the}} head continue to reinforce the split. Working with a transdisciplinary critical medical humanities framework, and guided by feminist criticism gesturing towards making social change, this thesis critiques dominant models of mental health focused on immaterial thoughts or brain dysfunction, both of which overwrite embodied dimensions of experience. It argues that mental health involves physical beings in constant contact with the world and that without a shift in the language, the social, corporeal and environmental aspects of mental health remain tacked on to problematically individualised and internalised constructs. To go against the grain of language, the thesis then moves on to find appropriate tools and models with which to conceptualise non-dualist ontologies and to gesture towards an embodied model of mental health. It concludes that a radical shift in mental health research and practice is urgently needed that drops out of the head and into the ‘being-body’...|$|R

What really can be expected from our scholarly researchers, thousands of them strong, spread across a Babel of disciplines and inquiries around the world, each of them preoccupied with the importance of their efforts and their centrality to learning and to the human condition? The researcher's first contribution is to the dialogue on policy; and it is problematical insofar as it is ideological and political. The second involves practices of handling library materials; and it is basically so self-obvious as to be insulting. The third involves the prospect of better control over access and use; and it is painful to consider.

25|$|Organizational {{culture has}} been {{described}} as a set of assumptions shared by individuals in an organization; the assumptions influence the interpretation and actions that define appropriate behavior for various situations. Organizational {{culture has been}} shown to affect important organizational outcomes such as performance, attraction, recruitment, retention, employee satisfaction, and employee well-being. There are three levels of organizational culture: artifacts, shared values, and basic beliefs and assumptions. Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often <b>deeply</b> <b>ingrained</b> within the organization's culture.|$|E

The study showed that among these children, instances of behavioral and emotional disorders decreased, and conscientiousness and agreeableness increased.|$|E

The book blamed the FBI's decentralized structure, which prevented effective communication and cooperation among different FBI offices. The book suggested that the FBI had not evolved into an effective counter-terrorism or counter-intelligence agency, due in large part to <b>deeply</b> <b>ingrained</b> agency cultural resistance to change.

25|$|The Dreyfus Affair, which {{erupted in}} France in 1894, profoundly shocked emancipated Jews. The depth of {{antisemitism}} {{in the first}} country to grant Jews equal rights led many to question their future prospects among Christians. Among those who witnessed the Affair was an Austro-Hungarian Jewish journalist, Theodor Herzl. Herzl was born in Budapest and lived in Vienna (Jews were only allowed to live in Vienna from 1848), who published his pamphlet Der Judenstaat ("The Jewish State") in 1896 and Altneuland ("The Old New Land") in 1902. He described the Affair as a personal turning point. Seeing Dreyfus's Jewishness used so successfully as a scapegoat by the monarchist propagandists disillusioned Herzl. Dreyfus's guilt was deemed indisputable simply because Jewish stereotypes of nefariousness prevented a fair trial from occurring. Herzl outright denied that any such Jewish stereotypes were rooted in reality in any way. However, he believed that anti-semitism was so <b>deeply</b> <b>ingrained</b> in European society that only {{the creation of a}} Jewish state would enable the Jews to join the family of nations and escape antisemitism.|$|E
25|$|Gender roles within social {{hierarchies}} {{are concerned}} with the question of agency in the conduct of physical violence. Men are expected to exert violence, while women are victimized by it. In conflict situations, rape against men dissolves this relationship and puts men in the ‘receiving’ role of the victim. Similarly, the ‘penetrating’ role of men as opposed to the ‘receiving’ role of women in (conventional) sexual intercourse illustrates this constructed power relationship. Hence, male rape victims experience the worst possible ‘humiliation’ with regards to the ingrained social roles they are traditionally expected to fulfill. Moreover, their stigmatization takes on particularly severe dimensions within conservative social environments in which homosexual intercourse – regardless of consent – is punished harshly. For example, Ugandan male rape victims explain their choice to not speak out with the fear of being branded homosexuals. As homosexuality is widely condemned in Uganda, male victims of sexual violence often struggle to get proper support because they are accused of being gay. In certain cases, gender roles concerning violence and sexual conduct are so <b>deeply</b> <b>ingrained</b> that the mere existence of male rape is denied.|$|E

500|$|As Thomas Asbridge wrote, [...] "Just {{as we can}} {{do nothing}} more than {{estimate}} the number of thousands {{who responded to the}} crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent." [...] Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, [...] "This image is ... profoundly misleading." [...] He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land. It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so <b>deeply</b> <b>ingrained</b> with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.|$|E

500|$|However, the Minister for Law {{said the}} Government {{was of the}} opinion that as the right to vote is an implied right in the Constitution, it was {{unnecessary}} for the Constitution to be amended to expressly mention the right. Articles 65 and 66 of the Constitution would be entrenched once Article 5(2A) is brought into force. That Article, which has remained in abeyance since it was introduced in 1991, provides that a bill that seeks to amend, among other things, Article 65 or 66, must be supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast, unless the President consents to the amendment. Shanmugam went on to state that the concerns of the 1966 Constitutional Commission were now moot, as Singapore had since experienced ten general elections with a 95% voter turnout each time.

Townsend states that dishonesty is [...] "the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own". Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees, coolies, shopkeepers, and government officials, and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and [...] "aimless lying, with each lie merely a pretext for another". The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their [...] "indifference to fellow suffering". Through a large number of personal and second-hand anecdotes, Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the only {{people in the world who}} are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people. Because the Chinese feel no empathy toward others, they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another, and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of. Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice, [...] lust for money, lack of a sense of personal hygiene, lack of critical thinking skills, insincerity, and obsession with hollow rites. Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses, and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos, but rather are <b>deeply</b> <b>ingrained</b> traits of China's national character.
