Nevertheless, he considered retiring from the sea to go into business with his seafaring brother Oliver, who had also grown tired of the wandering life. They did not proceed with this project, but instead each invested his savings in a share of a ship: Oliver in Julia A. Hallock, and Benjamin in Mary Celeste. In October 1872, Benjamin took command of Mary Celeste for her first voyage following her extensive New York refit, which was {{to take her to}} Genoa in Italy.

5|$|In 1880, Maine Republicans {{refused to}} pass more anti-alcohol legislation, and Dow quit {{the party to}} join the Prohibitionists; he {{instantly}} became the party's most prominent member. His friend and ally James Black requested that Dow's name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the 1880 convention, to which Dow agreed. The convention that met in Cleveland that June welcomed delegates from twelve states, but attracted almost no attention from the press. Dow himself did not attend, staying <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> ailing wife (candidates for a party's nomination often did not attend conventions in person at that time). He was nominated, heading a ticket with vice-presidential nominee Henry A. Thompson of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, Stone was aboard an {{airplane}} which skidded off a snowy runway at O'Hare Airport in Chicago; {{there were no}} injuries. Stone began piloting ultra-light airplanes as a hobby in 1999 and 2000. In March 2000, he suffered a broken left ankle, cracked rib, concussion, and bruised kidney after crashing his plane in Robertson County, Tennessee, and was briefly hospitalized before he resumed touring. Stone later said that the accident made him decide to quit flying planes. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, rumors circulated that Stone had been {{on one of the}} hijacked planes; a spokeswoman for the singer confirmed that he was at <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> family that day.|$|E
5|$|In middle age, Walton left Britain {{and set up}} <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> {{young wife}} Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased to be {{regarded}} as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics {{at the time of their}} premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.|$|E
5|$|The {{testimony}} of Henry Davis and Oscar Davis's sons proved damning, and several witnesses also testified {{that they had}} heard Waller declare he would come <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wheat or kill Oscar Davis. In {{an analysis of the}} transcript, Sherman proposes that the phrasing of these witnesses was so similar that they may have been coached by prosecutors, but the defense counsel did not pursue this possibility. On September 27, 1940, after less than an hour's deliberation, the jury found Waller guilty of first degree murder and sentenced him to death, a verdict praised by the Virginia press covering the trial. His execution was scheduled for December 27 of that year.|$|E

5|$|The {{winter of}} 1946–47 was harsh, and in February the sub-zero {{temperatures}} burst the water main outside Ketèlbey's Hampstead <b>home.</b> <b>With</b> <b>his</b> house partially flooded, he {{lost most of}} his correspondence, manuscripts and papers {{and he and his}} wife both contracted pneumonia. The couple were taken to the Regent's Park Nursing Home, where Lottie died two days later. He sold his house and moved temporarily to the Hendon Hall Hotel, where he had a nervous breakdown. He spent the remainder of the year staying in hotels in southern England; in Bournemouth he began a relationship with Mabel Maud Pritchett, a hotel manageress, and the couple married in October in the following year.|$|E
5|$|Wheelwright had 12 children, 10 of whom {{survived to}} adulthood. With his first wife, Mary Storre, Wheelwright had four children, three of whom survived childhood, {{and came to}} New England.

The first three were baptized in England, and two survived, leaving him with five children during his immigration to New England. They had five more children born after arriving in New England, all of whom survived and married.|$|E
5|$|Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a {{child and}} was serious, quiet and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became {{depressed}} after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion, and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially, and the two kept up a long correspondence by letter. His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} he reached his teens, Gygax had a {{voracious}} appetite for pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, a few months after his father died, he {{dropped out of high school}} in his junior year. He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he was given a medical discharge and moved back <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> mother. From there, he commuted to a job as shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once a week or more. It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Marge {{has begun}} to panic over being unable to {{communicate}} with Homer, as she knows nothing of his undercover work and cannot get any information on his whereabouts. She is surprised and thrilled when he returns <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> prison sentence lifted, but Homer feels guilt for Fat Tony's death and bitterness toward the government over being used to bring him down. Homer visits Fat Tony's grave to apologize, but is kidnapped by his cousin Fit Tony, who plans to kill him for revenge. However, Fit Tony spares his life after Homer tells {{of the time he}} and Fat Tony spent together, seeing that Fat Tony lives on in Homer's memories. Fit Tony takes charge of the syndicate, but the stress of the position causes him to overeat and gain weight, becoming known first as Fit Fat Tony and then simply Fat Tony - now physically indistinguishable from the original.|$|E
