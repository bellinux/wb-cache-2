2500|$|In {{a widely}} publicized report, former Deputy Leader of the Red Electoral Alliance Marte Mjøs Persen left the party, believing {{there was a}} big generational gap between the older and younger members of Red. She further claimed that only the older members, who have their origins from the {{foundation}} of the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party, controlled the party. Persen's statements were met with positive response by fellow party members and outsiders. Mathias Furevik, who had served as Dahle's campaign manager, agreed with her accusations. Bergen City Council representative, Stine Akre, reluctantly agreed with Persen's accusations and said; [...] "Red is now a party for middle-aged men, and {{has not been able to}} get rid of the generation gap. It also means that many younger people will <b>get</b> <b>burned</b> out before they move the party's direction." [...] Persen shortly after joined the Norwegian Labour Party.|$|E

60|$|Maybe {{the boys}} {{nowadays}} do not throw fire-balls, or know about them. They {{were made of}} cotton rags wound tight and sewed, and then soaked in turpentine. When a ball was lighted a boy caught it quickly up, and threw it, and it made a splendid streaming blaze through the air, and a thrilling whir as it flew. A boy {{had to be very}} nimble not to <b>get</b> <b>burned,</b> and a great many boys dropped the ball for every boy that threw it. I am not ready to say why these fire-balls did not set the Boy's Town on fire, and burn it down, but I know they never did. There was no law against them, and the boys were never disturbed in throwing them, any more than they were in building bonfires; and this shows, as much as anything, what a glorious town that was for boys. The way they used to build their bonfires was to set one tar-barrel on top of another, as high as the biggest boy could reach, and then drop a match into them; in a moment a dusky, smoky flame would burst from the top, and fly there like a crimson flag, while all the boys leaped and danced round it, and hurrahed for the Whig candidates. Sometimes they would tumble the blazing barrels over, and roll them up and down the street.|$|E

Five or six do not require nearly so much attention as one. But before then the mischief has been done. A house where there seems no room for him and a wife too busy to think of him have lost their hold on that so unreasonable husband of yours, and he has learned to look elsewhere for comfort and companionship.|$|E
