5|$|Virginia Tech's defense {{came into}} the 1995 Sugar Bowl ranked 10th {{in the country in}} total defense. This was {{due in large part to}} the Hokies' success in rushing defense.

5|$|Virginia Tech's defense {{likewise}} {{was more}} successful against opponents' rushing offense than their passing attack. Tech permitted {{an average of}} 99.3 yards per game on the ground (16th), but allowed 224.4 yards per game through the air (79th). In total, Tech was ranked the No. 27 <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country—slightly better than Clemson.

5|$|With the fifth-ranked <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SEC {{going up}} against the number-one ranked scoring <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation, {{attention}} centered on {{the likelihood of a}} low-scoring defensive struggle. Of particular interest were the two teams' quarterbacks and how they would likely fare against such a tough defense. Georgia struggled on offense for much of the season, resulting in a battle for the starting quarterback position between senior Joe Tereshinski and freshman Matthew Stafford. Though Stafford was eventually given the starting role, he struggled in his first year, completing 126of235passes (53.6%) for 1,620yards, with sixtouchdowns and 12interceptions heading into the Chick-fil-A Bowl. On {{the opposite side of the}} field, Virginia Tech would be starting redshirt sophomore Sean Glennon. Named the starting quarterback at the beginning of the 2006 season, Glennon replaced Marcus Vick, who had been expelled from Virginia Tech at the end of the previous year. While not as statistically successful as Marcus Vick, Glennon still managed to lead the Hokies to their third consecutive 10-win season, and had the edge over Stafford in terms of experience.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, the battleship and her sisters were placed back in active service as the V Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet and tasked with coastal <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Sea.

Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse {{was used as a}} depot ship in Kiel and eventually a torpedo target ship. After the war, the Treaty of Versailles greatly reduced the size of the German Navy. The vessel was sold for scrapping to a German company and broken up in 1920.|$|E

Cornerback Carlos Rogers {{was one of}} the key players on the {{defensive}} squad. Rogers, who won the Jim Thorpe Award—given annually to the best defensive back in the country—earned consensus All-America honors and was a finalist for the Bronco Nagurski Award and a semifinalist for the Chuck Bednarik Award, each given to the best defensive college football player in the United States.|$|E

Tevin Washington led the Yellow Jackets to a 31–17 upset victory by rushing for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown, which was the most rushing yards ever by a Georgia Tech quarterback. In addition, Clemson's offense was almost completely shutdown by Georgia Tech's <b>defense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half, and the Tigers were plagued by turnovers, which contributed to the win for the Yellow Jackets.|$|E
