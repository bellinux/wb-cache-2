5|$|The Parallax Correctors {{were needed}} because the turrets were located {{hundreds}} of <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the director. There was {{one for each}} turret, and each had the turret/director distance manually set in. They automatically received Relative Target Bearing (bearing from own ship's bow), and Target Range. They corrected the bearing order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo converged on the same point.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{surveys of the}} ship {{indicate}} that the ship was modified late in her career and have lent support {{to the idea that}} the Mary Rose was altered too much to be properly seaworthy. Marsden has suggested that the weight of additional heavy guns would have increased her draught so much that the waterline was less than one metre (c. 3 <b>feet)</b> <b>from</b> the gunports on the main deck.|$|E
5|$|A few of {{the roads}} {{surrounding}} the area that was Monte Ne {{on the edge of}} Beaver Lake have names reflecting what once was there. Highway 94, which once led to Monte Ne, is also called Monte Ne Road. Country Road 1195, which runs along the lake, is also called Pyramid Street and is a few hundred <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> where the Pyramid would have stood. Similarly Canal Street is nearby, named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.|$|E

5|$|At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above {{can be seen}} in {{the ceiling}} of the {{existing}} station. This portion of the Utica Avenue Line was built with the construction of the Fulton Street Line. Ramps were built from the mezzanine to the platforms because the normal vertical distance of ten <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the mezzanine floor to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing mezzanine passes over the unused space.|$|E

5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E

5|$|A foot pursuit {{in which}} Diesel, Brewster and Walker are chased across favela rooftops by Johnson {{and his team}} was filmed {{over the course of}} a week in the small {{hillside}} town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, birds-eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> a building onto a waiting safety mat. In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community.|$|E

5|$|Back at school, Skinner's {{dress code}} demoralizes the {{students}} until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color {{to be washed}} out, revealing tie-dye colors that make the playful spirit of the children return. At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Cheered on by his teammates, Homer attempts {{to break into the}} mansion and recover the trophy; however, this ends disastrously when the hounds are released and catch Homer a few <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the gate, mauling him severely.|$|E
5|$|Commercial logging {{had also}} been {{operating}} for years in the Trinity River country, {{but most of the}} timber produced was used locally. After World War II, logging greatly increased both due to high demand for housing domestically and abroad, and the introduction of more advanced technologies. In 1959 alone, loggers took 439 million board <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> Trinity County. The rate dropped after that, but logging continued at 200–300 million board feet per year well into the 1980s. Many logged areas were on steep mountains, and improper construction of roads and skid trails exposed slopes to erosion and landslides. In 1988 several environmentalist groups including the Wilderness Society, Audubon Society and Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, preventing the cutting of 18.4 million board feet of salvage lumber in an area with particularly high erosion risk. This generated pushback in the local timber industry, whose decline has partly been attributed to more stringent environmental regulations.|$|E
5|$|During early August 1940, {{while she}} was still being {{outfitted}} and was in a semi-complete state, Prince of Wales was attacked by German aircraft. One bomb fell between the ship and a wet basin wall, narrowly missing a 100-ton dockside crane, and exploded underwater below the bilge keel. The explosion took place about six <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> the ship's port side {{in the vicinity of the}} after group of 5.25-inch guns. Buckling of the shell plating took place over a distance of 20 to , rivets were sprung and considerable flooding took place in the port outboard compartments in the area of damage, causing a ten-degree port list. The flooding was severe, due to the fact that final compartment air tests had not yet been made and the ship did not have her pumping system in operation.|$|E

5|$|In April 1735, Linnaeus and Sohlberg {{set out for}} the Netherlands, with Linnaeus to take a {{doctoral}} degree in medicine at the University of Harderwijk. On the way, they stopped in Hamburg, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed hydra. Linnaeus quickly discovered it was a fake: jaws and clawed <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2006, American comedian Stephen Colbert {{appeared}} as the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, {{which was held}} in Washington, D.C., at the Hilton Washington hotel. Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States on the cable television networks C-SPAN and MSNBC. Standing a few <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> U.S. President George W. Bush, {{in front of an}} audience of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media. He spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 1935, the {{building}} shifted to within 2.5 <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> {{the edge of}} the cliff following a landslide caused by a severe storm. The warden at the time, James A. Johnston, proposed extend the seawall next to it and asked the Bureau for $6500 to fund it; he would later claim to dislike {{the building}} because it was irregularly shaped. A smaller, cheaper riprap was completed by the end of 1935. A guard tower and a catwalk from Hill Tower was added to the roof of the Industries Building in June 1936 and the building was made secure with bars from old cells to bar the windows and grill the roof ventilators and to prevent inmates from escaping from the roof. It ceased use as a laundry in 1939 when it was moved to the upper floor of the New Industries Building. Today the building is heavily rusted after decades of exposure to the salt air and wind, and neither the guard tower on top of the building nor the Hill Tower still exist.|$|E
