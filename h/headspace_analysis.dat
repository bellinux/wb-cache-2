50|$|Chromatographic {{techniques}} are often useful when mixtures of analytes are present {{because they are}} capable of measuring multiple analytes during a single application. They require isolation of the analyte from the matrix they come in (the body of the sample). One of the simpler techniques is to simply trap the analytes in a bubble of air above the sample (headspace) and inject part of that bubble directly into the instrument. This procedure is called <b>headspace</b> <b>analysis.</b> One of the most widely used methods for <b>headspace</b> <b>analysis</b> is described by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and is called RSKSOP-175.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis describes the development and validation in the laboratory of four techniques employed for the off-line and on-line analysis of liquid chemical process streams by mass spectrometry, without previous chromatographic separation of sample components. The four techniques were total vaporisation analysis, <b>headspace</b> <b>analysis,</b> membrane introduction mass spectrometry and atmospheric pressure ionisation-mass spectrometry. The technique of total vaporisation analysis completely vaporises liquid samples in a gas chromatograph heated injection inlet and analyses the vapour created with a mass spectrometer. <b>Headspace</b> <b>analysis</b> and membrane introduction mass spectrometry provide partial and selective transfer of compounds from the liquid sample phase to the gas phase and the subsequent analysis of the gas phase with a mass spectrometer. <b>Headspace</b> <b>analysis</b> has no third phase separating the liquid and gas phases whereas membrane introduction mass spectrometry places a membrane between the two phases. All three techniques were validated using an electron-impact quadrupole mass spectrometer and two model streams; acetone (analyte) in water and methyl iodide (analyte) in acetic acid. As an alternative strategy atmospheric pressure ionisation-mass spectrometers ionise samples in ion sources operating at atmospheric pressure. The techniques of electrospray ionisation and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation were investigated {{for the analysis of}} formic, acetic and propionic acids present in water and other carboxylic acids. The techniques of total vaporisation analysis, <b>headspace</b> <b>analysis</b> and membrane introduction mass spectrometry provided low p. g m 1 ' or g 11 limits of detection for acetone and methyl iodide with relative standard deviation values for replicate analyses of 100 pg ml' standards of less than 10 % in most cases. Off-line and on-line total vaporisation analysis and off-line <b>headspace</b> <b>analysis</b> provided accurate determination of acetone in similar process samples, whereas the matrix affected the accuracy of the determination when the techniques of on-line <b>headspace</b> <b>analysis</b> and membrane introduction mass spectrometry were employed. Electrospray ionisation could also detect formic, acetic and propionic acids in aqueous or carboxylic acid matrices at concentrations of and possibly less than 100 tg nil 1. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation could only detect carboxylic acids present in aqueous matrices at concentrations of 100 tg ml' or greater...|$|E

The headspace chromatographic method described here {{makes it possible to}} analyze dimethyl sulfide, ethyl acetate, propanol, isobutanol, isoamyl acetate, isoamyl and amyl alcohols, and less volatile compounds such as ethyl caproate (168 -degrees-C) and ethyl caprylate (208 -degrees-C) in less than 20 min. Two calibration methods are described: daily calibration or the use of an internal reference beer system, which considerably simplifies the calibration procedure for long-term use.

Nowadays, salt is consumed more than is advised (between 5 to 10 times more than the recommended 2 g/day), its overconsumption, can contribute to the deterioration of health. This is the reason why, in March 2001, a workgroup associating scientists, administrations, agencies, economic actors, and association of consumers was set up to decrease by 20 % the population consumption of salt. During the last years, measures have been taken by salt producers to diversify their commercial offer with standing products as well as guaranteed know-how products. For example, European producers intend to obtain Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) or Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) status in order to protect and value coarse salt, ground (fine) salt and flower of salt, based on the quality policy for the product of EU agriculture.

On {{the basis of the}} <b>headspace</b> SPME-GC-MS <b>analysis,</b> with the addition of green/black tea extracts, the contents of acetaldehyde, acrolein, malondialdehyde, and propanal, four major lipid peroxidation products, were reduced. The inhibition rates of acrolein formation by green tea and black tea extracts were 98. 40 and 96. 41 % respectively, and were 99. 17 and 98. 16 % for malondialdehyde, respectively, much higher than the inhibition of the formation of acetaldehyde and propanal. Because malondialdehyde and acrolein are reactive carbonyl species (RCS) and recent studies have suggested that phenolics can directly trap RCS, this study also investigated whether green tea polyphenols can trap acrolein or not. Acrolein was reduced by 90. 30 % in 3 h of incubation with (-) -epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG). Subsequent LC-MS analysis revealed the formation of new adducts of equal molars of acrolein and EGCG. The reaction site for acrolein was elucidated to be the A ring of EGCG as evidenced by LC-MS/MS analysis and by testing of the acrolein-trapping capacities of the analogous individual A, B, and C rings of EGCG.
