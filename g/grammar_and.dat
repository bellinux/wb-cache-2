5|$|Nagavarma II, {{poet laureate}} (Katakacharya) of King Jagadhekamalla II made {{contributions}} to Kannada literature in various subjects. His works in poetry, prosody, <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> vocabulary are standard authorities and their {{importance to the}} study of Kannada language is well acknowledged. Kavyavalokana in poetics, Karnataka-Bhashabhushana on <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> Vastukosa a lexicon (with Kannada equivalents for Sanskrit words) are some of his comprehensive contributions. Several works on medicine were produced during this period. Notable among them were Jagaddala Somanatha's Karnataka Kalyana Karaka.|$|E
5|$|When Champollion {{submitted}} his Coptic <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> dictionary {{for publication}} in 1815, it was blocked by Silvestre de Sacy, who {{in addition to his}} personal animosity and envy towards Champollion also resented his Napoleonic affinities. During his exile in Figeac, Champollion spent his time revising the <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> doing local archeological work, being for a time cut off from being able to continue his research.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{population}} statistics, Villani {{also offered}} statistics on education. He wrote that {{boys and girls}} learning to read numbered 8,000 to 10,000 each year. There were 1,000 to 1,200 children learning to use the abacus and algorism for mathematics. In the four large, prestigious schools of Florence, there were always 550 to 600 students in attendance to learn proper <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> scholastic logic.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, Coolsma {{returned}} to the Netherlands and became {{the leader of the}} Netherlands Missionary Union, promoting further missionary activity in the predominantly Muslim western portion of the East Indies. He also wrote extensively on Sundanese, including a <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> two dictionaries. Although his Bible translation had little lasting impact, these later works have remained in use.|$|E
5|$|The Christ Church {{scriptorium}} {{was particularly}} active under Wulfred. Although the handwriting {{of the documents}} produced during Wulfred's archiepiscopate is quite elegant, the actual contents of the charters is marked by bad <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> other errors. From this, the historian N. P. Brooks has deduced that the clergy of the cathedral were not very literate in Latin, and would have likely been unable to compose new Latin works.|$|E
5|$|A {{scholar and}} teacher {{throughout}} his life, Priestley also {{made significant contributions}} to pedagogy, including the publication of a seminal work on English <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> books on history, and he prepared some of the most influential early timelines. These educational writings were among Priestley's most popular works. It was his metaphysical works, however, that had the most lasting influence: leading philosophers including Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer credit them among the primary sources for utilitarianism.|$|E

In 1897 during his work in Baroda he started working as a part-time French teacher at Baroda College (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda).

40|$|Two automata {{models are}} {{introduced}} that play, {{with respect to}} attribute <b>grammars</b> <b>and</b> attribute-evaluation for them, the same role as pushdown automata have with respect to context-free <b>grammars</b> <b>and</b> their parsing. It is shown, in fact, that these automata define the same class of string-to-value translations as attribute grammars. Their class of tree-to-value translations seems instead to be larger than that of attribute <b>grammars</b> <b>and</b> the difference is overcome by means of (a special type of) context-free grammar interpretations. An extended model of attribute grammar is presented that is as powerful as the automata with respect to tree-to-value translations...|$|R

5|$|Markham was a {{prolific}} writer and diarist; his first published work, {{an account of}} his voyage with HMS Assistance in search of Franklin, had appeared in 1853. After his retirement from the India office in 1877 writing became his chief source of income. In addition to papers and reports for the Royal Geographical Society and other learned bodies, Markham wrote histories, biographies and travel accounts, many as full-length books. He also translated many works from Spanish to English, and compiled a <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> dictionary for the Quichua language of Peru.|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.|$|E

The right {{part of a}} rewriting rule is formalized by a finite set of permitted tiles. We focus on a simple type of tiling, named regional, and define the corresponding regional tile grammars. They include both Siromoney’s (or Matz’s) Kolam <b>grammars,</b> <b>and</b> their generalization by Průša. Regionally defined pictures can be recognized with polynomial time complexity by an algorithm extending the CKY one for strings.

5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a step forward in both film <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E

5|$|The early 9th century, however, was {{a period}} of direct {{imitation}} of Chinese models making kanshi the major form of poetry at the time. In the late 9th century, waka and the development of kana script rose simultaneously with the general revival of traditional values, culminating in the compilation of the first imperial waka anthology, the Kokinshū, in 905. It was followed in 951 by the Gosen Wakashū; in all seven imperial anthologies were compiled in the Heian period. The main poetic subjects were love and the four seasons; the standards of vocabulary, <b>grammar</b> <b>and</b> style, established in the Kokinshū, dominated waka composition into the 19th century.|$|E
