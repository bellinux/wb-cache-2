30|$|In {{comparing}} the cumulative {{performance of the}} three fluid systems on average CTE (Fig.  19), the optimum observed average CTE was achieved with HWBM. The least average CTE was achieved with fresh water, while BWBM have better average CTE than fresh water. Increased cuttings interactions with HLE have led to its more cuttings recovery to the surface compared {{with the other two}} fluids. The synergy existing between fluid velocity and buoyancy force in HLE bearing mud sample was higher compared to that of BWBM as the momentum of the flow in HWBM observed during the experiments was higher compared with fresh water and BWBM. Furthermore, HLE associated with WBM shows chemical stability in WBM as surface force easily balance the gravity force and adhered to <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings,</b> resulting in increased drag force action to <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings.</b> This action can easily lift <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> to the surface. For example, for vertical portion of the well (0 °), HWBM on average transported about 5.43 % and 9.94 % more <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> than BWBM and fresh water, respectively, while BWBM transported 4.77 % more <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> than fresh water. Similar trend of result was achieved at 45 °, 60 °, 75 °, and 90 °. Therefore, it can be suggested that the HLE bearing mud sample contain improved rheological properties than BWBM which significantly enhance the mud’s carrying capacity of <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings.</b>|$|R

30|$|Two {{velocity}} vectors acts on <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> {{in opposite}} direction in vertical annulus, {{and they are}} gravity force pulling them downward and annular fluid velocity pushing them upward. At any time, the fluid velocity is able to surpass the effects of gravity on the <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> owing to synergistic relationship between the fluid velocity and the buoyant force triggered by difference in density, cuttings in the vertical annulus have the tendency to transports out of the annulus. This explained phenomenon is responsible for achieving the highest CTE at 0 ° hole-angle of this study. In the highly deviated and horizontal portion of the annulus, the cuttings slip velocity vector can be grouped into two components; one working contrary to the fluid velocity, in which it decreases with increasing hole-angle, and the other component driving the cuttings towards the low side-wall of the annulus. This force acting on <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> increases as hole-angle increases, {{as can be seen}} in the range of 35 °– 60 ° hole-angles. When this happens, the <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> are forced towards the low side-wall of the annulus. Furthermore, as the hole-angle increases beyond 60 °, the declining nature of the CTE observed at 35 °– 60 ° hole-angles was reversed, and the CTE started to increase again. The increasing trend continued to 90 ° hole-angle. The sudden change of declining CTE from 35 to 60 ° hole-angles to nonstop increase from 60 ° to 90 ° hole-angles could be credited to the fact that <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> at 60 ° angle and above are stable and have reduced effects of gravity, indicating reduced <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> avalanched (constant sliding downwards of <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings).</b> Therefore, appropriate hydraulic power could be needed for better cuttings transportation in high-hole angles portion of the well.|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> lifting {{from the}} bottom hole to the surface improves drilling performance. The transportation of <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> becomes more challenging when drilling a high angle or horizontal well. A sufficiently high annular mud velocity is essential to prevent <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> from settling and forming stationary beds on the low side of a hole. This can cause several drilling problems such as high torque and drag, stuck pipe, etc. This problem has been addressed via an experimental work which studied the effect of annular mud velocities on <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> removal using water-based mud with polypropylene beads in vertical, deviated, and horizontal holes. It was accomplished using a 3. 96 m long flow loop which comprised 50. 8 mm transparent acrylic section with a simulated drill string. The annular mud velocity was varied from 0. 27 in/s to 1. 06 m/s at ambient condition. The experimental results showed that increase in annular mud velocity has improved hole cleaning, i. e., cuttings transport ratio experienced an improved performance in the turbulent flow than in laminar flow.
