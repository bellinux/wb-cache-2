5|$|Whisky Galore! was well-received on its release. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> in {{the same}} year as Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets, leading to 1949 being remembered as one of the peak years of the Ealing comedies. In the US, where Whisky Galore! was renamed Tight Little Island, the film became the first from Ealing Studios to achieve box office success. It was {{followed}} by a sequel, Rockets Galore!. Whisky Galore! has since been adapted for the stage, and a remake was released in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the revolving speaker.|$|E

5|$|Bogdan-Pitești was by then an {{inspiration}} for the blooming Romanian Symbolist movement. In effect, {{he was the first}} Romanian expert on the work of Symbolist celebrities like Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and (his favorite) Alexandre Séon. He soon became a contributor to Literatorul, a Symbolist magazine, and was close friends with its founder, Alexandru Macedonski. In 1897, he was chosen by the latter to edit and promote his book of French-language poems, Bronzes. In the end, Bogdan-Pitești provided the funds needed for Bronzes to be published in Paris. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> with an introductory note, in which Bogdan-Pitești favorably compared Macedonski with arch-rival Mihai Eminescu. In more general terms, the preface showed Bogdan-Pitești as an unyielding Francophile, who reported with alarm that Romania risked being seduced and then engulfed by German culture. Himself a disciple of Macedonski, T. Vianu comments that Bogdan-Pitești was probably unsuited for the task of introducing Bronzes, and that, despite expectations, the volume failed to impress the French public. He notes the virtually complete lack of press reviews—with the notable exception of a May 1898 article in Mercure de France, written by the Symbolist-anarchist Pierre Quillard.|$|E

I have been advising a top premiership star who is bisexual. If <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> that he had gay tendencies, his career would be over in two minutes. Should it be? No, but if you go on the terraces and hear the way fans are, and also, that kind of general attitude that goes with football, it's almost like going back to the dark ages.|$|E
25|$|In a July 2014 {{interview}} at San Diego Comic-Con International, Miller said he designed {{the film in}} storyboard form before writing the screenplay, working with five storyboard artists. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> as about 3,500 panels, almost {{the same number of}} shots as in the finished film. He wanted the film to be almost a continuous chase, with relatively little dialogue, and to have the visuals come first. Paraphrasing Alfred Hitchcock, Miller said that he wanted the film to be understood in Japan without the use of subtitles.|$|E

25|$|Until {{it became}} commercially viable, natural gas {{was often a}} nuisance. Dangerous to handle and {{hard to get to}} market, early oilmen despised it as a poor {{relation}} to its rich cousin crude oil. Although early processing procedures were able to remove water, in the 19th century discoveries were only developed if consumers could use the gas just as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the ground. If the gas required further processing or needed to be piped a long distance to market, the producer shut in the well. Flares got rid of gas coming from oil wells.|$|E

Frank Sinatra had married Mia Farrow in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker to sit up and take notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> that he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|E

Rachel was set free and the future seemed bright for the Cory family, but then Mitch and Rachel began an affair. Rachel decided {{to start a new life}} with Mitch and divorced Mac.|$|E
25|$|Johnson’s poke check {{could also}} be used to force {{turnovers}} and generate offensive rushes. Combining good breakaway speed with positional awareness, Johnson would charge an oncoming attacker, use his poke check to strip the player of the puck, bank it off the sideboards and race after it. While on the attack himself, he would often deliberately make as if he were dumping the puck in. Instead, when thirty feet from the opposing net, he would deliberately fire the puck along the boards so that it rimmed around behind the opponent’s goalie; however, rather than chase after it, he would subsequently cut across the slot and pick up the puck as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> the other side.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the arrest, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> that the manager of the {{newspaper}} delivery agency in Higashisumiyoshi Ward had made a report to the police that a newspaper subscription fee of 230,000 yen had been stolen. Afterwards, the manager discovered that the thief was Kobayashi, now working in Kawai. On November 17, 2004, the day of the kidnapping, a judge had issued an arrest warrant for Kobayashi for the embezzlement reported by the manager. However, the manager did not inform the police of this, because he was promised that the suspect would repay him for the stolen money with monthly payments. Therefore, the police were not able to arrest Kobayashi, and he was free to commit his attack.|$|E

25|$|By 1920, the paper's size had {{increased}} to 6 pages, and under editor Thomas Wolfe the paper {{moved to a}} twice-a-week format in September 1920. In 1923, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> from {{under the auspices of}} the athletic association and became governed by the Student Publications Union Board, which at the time was in charge of all campus publications. Students paid a fee of $5.50 to fund the publications. Publication increased to three days in 1925 and published the first summer edition in 1927. The student body voted in favor of increasing funding to the DTH in 1929 in a vote of 666 to 128. The vote enabled the paper, then led by editor Walter Spearman, to publish six times a week. The paper changed its name to The Daily Tar Heel.|$|E
25|$|Metamorfoz {{was finally}} {{released}} in Turkey on December 25, 2007, {{one day after}} its announced release date, while <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> on February 1, 2008 in Europe. Seven of the songs were written by Tarkan, three are collaborations with producer-composer Ozan Çolakoğlu. Metamorfoz means metamorphosis, transformation or change in English. The title indicates that musically Metamorfoz is different from Tarkan's previous works. The cover pictures Tarkan with unusually short hair, in a shiny grey suit, an image unfamiliar to his fans, which also justifies {{the title of the}} album. The cover features the title in Braille dots for the visually impaired. In the first edition of the cover the Braille title was printed wrong and read Tarkaf instead of Tarkan. It was soon corrected and the cover reprinted.|$|E
25|$|Though all {{the accused}} were not {{communist}}s, the charges framed against them betrayed the British government's fear for growth of communist ideas in India. In the trial the accused were all labeled as Bolsheviks. During {{the trial of}} {{four and a half}} years, the defendants turned the courtroom into a public platform to espouse their cause. As a result, the trial saw strengthening of the communist movement in the country. Harkishan Singh Surjeet, a former General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) wrote about the aftermath of the Meerut Conspiracy case thus:a Party with a centralized apparatus, came into being only after the release of the Meerut prisoners, in 1933. The Meerut Conspiracy Case, though launched to suppress the communist movement, provided the opportunity for Communists to propagate their ideas. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> with its own manifesto and was affiliated to the Communist International in 1934.|$|E
