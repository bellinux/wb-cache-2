Trout (called forel), gilthead seabream (called denisse), St. Peter's fish (known as 'musht') and other fresh fish are prepared this way.

Whole, sliced clementines including the peel, or peeled clementines can be used, and the clementines can be cooked before being used in the cake batter. The fruit can be chopped or blended using a food processor. Candied clementines can be used atop the cake or as a garnish. The almonds used can be toasted or blanched.|$|E

25|$|Physiological {{noise is}} from head and brain {{movement}} in the scanner from breathing, heart beats, or the subject fidgeting, tensing, or making physical responses such as button presses.

40|$|Study DesignRetrospective, {{radiological}} study. PurposeTo {{determine the}} relationship between clinical symptoms {{and the extent of}} tumor occupation of the spinal canal by cauda equina schwannoma. Overview of LiteratureLittle is known about {{the relationship between}} the size of tumors of the cauda equina and the manifestation of clinical symptoms. We analyzed this relationship by estimating the percentage of tumor occupation (PTO) in the spinal canal in cauda equina schwannomas and by correlating this parameter with the presence and severity of clinical symptoms. MethodsTwenty-two patients (9 men and 13 women; age, 19 – 79 years; mean age, 55. 3 years) who were radiologically diagnosed with schwannomas of the cauda equina between April 2004 and July 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. PTO was measured in axial and sagittal magnetic resonance imaging <b>slices</b> <b>in</b> which the cross-sectional area of the tumor was the largest. Data regarding clinical symptoms and results of physical examinations were collected from patient medical records. PTO differences between symptom-positive and -negative groups were analyzed for each variable. ResultsIn the 4 cases in which tumor presence was not related to clinical symptoms, PTO was 5 %– 10 % (mean, 9 %) <b>in</b> axial <b>slices</b> and 23 %– 31 % (mean, 30 %) <b>in</b> sagittal <b>slices.</b> <b>In</b> the 18 cases in which symptoms were associated with the tumor, PTO was 11 %– 86 % (mean, 50 %) <b>in</b> axial <b>slices</b> and 43 %– 88 % (mean, 71 %) <b>in</b> sagittal <b>slices.</b> PTO <b>in</b> axial <b>slices</b> was significantly higher in the presence of Déjèrine symptoms and/or muscle weakness, a positive straight leg raise test, and a positive Kemp sign.
