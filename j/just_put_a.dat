In an {{interview}} with Revolver magazine's May 2008 issue, Max explained that Gloria had worked for Sepultura for two years without earning one dollar, just for {{the passion of the}} music. Disagreeing with the other Sepultura members, Max said, [...] "If this is how it's going down, I'm out. I quit. I can't <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> mask on and backstab a bunch of people that trust me." [...] Later, Max stated that it was the hardest decision he had to make in his life.|$|E
500|$|Chandler {{had been}} {{dissatisfied}} with the sound quality at De Lane Lea, so he took the advice of Kit Lambert and booked time at CBS Studios. On December 13, 1966, after taking a five-week break from recording while they performed in Europe, the Experience reconvened at CBS. Assisted by engineer Mike Ross, the band were especially productive during the session, recording instrumentation and vocals for [...] "Foxy Lady" [...] and basic instrumental tracks for [...] "Love or Confusion", [...] "Can You See Me", and [...] "Third Stone from the Sun". Ross recalled the impact of Hendrix's Marshall stacks: [...] "It was so loud you couldn't stand in the studio... I'd never heard anything like it in my life." [...] When Ross asked Hendrix where he would like the microphone placed Hendrix replied: [...] "Oh, man, <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> mic about twelve feet away {{on the other side}} of the studio. It'll sound great." [...] Ross agreed, and with a Neumann U87 tube mic he recorded Hendrix's guitar playing in a large room that, according to Ross, [...] "was absolutely vital to the uniquely powerful Experience sound." [...] Ross noted that input from Mitchell and Redding was minimized, and he asserted that Chandler was clearly [...] "the one in charge" [...] of the sessions. The band played together live at CBS; the lead and backup vocals were overdubbed. Despite his dwindling finances, Chandler encouraged the Experience to record numerous takes of a song, affording them the luxury of repeated attempts at a satisfactory recording. With a live instrument track as the foundation of the recordings, they eschewed the common practice of piecing together parts of several takes to make one continuous piece. After the December 13 recording session, the band made their television debut, on Britain's Ready Steady Go! ...|$|E

He said, [...] "The Edge rang me up and said, 'Nobody wants to do The Fly – they're all afraid of it.' I think it's because {{it has its own}} essence, sonically. It was the lead single and the point of reinvention. U2 said it best: it was the sound of four men chopping down the Joshua Tree. I remember seeing them working on Achtung Baby in its early stages.

2500|$|Hynde and Honeyman-Scott {{have both}} {{acknowledged}} the influence their contrasting styles had {{on each other}} (Guitar Player, 1981; Uncut, 1999). According to Honeyman-Scott, Hynde had a unique style he adjusted to in several ways: [...] "She does {{quite a bit of}} rhythm guitar, and I don't know anybody who plays like her. It's real distinct, and I can't count her beat half the time. Instead, I <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> little guitar line over it, like the lick in 'Tattooed Love Boys'" [...] (Guitar Player, 1981). He joked about his other strategy: [...] "I've never told them I can't work out their time at all! They are used to me coming in a bar too late; they think that's the way I play. But it's because I've missed where she comes in! I just bluff it and hope for the best." ...|$|E

The series was written by Derren Litten. The BBC issued a press release saying: [...] "It's 1988 and Young Mr Grace is determined to drag Grace Brothers into, well 1988, but he has a problem on his hands. Mr Humphries, Captain Peacock, Mr Rumbold and Mrs Slocombe all seem to be stuck in another era.

2500|$|The Tunnel Rats formed after rapper Dax Reynosa {{performed}} at a graffiti equipment store Hex's Hip Hop Shop. After the performance, he invited {{about two dozen}} rappers to his house for an open mic. The performers came from racially diverse backgrounds, a mix of Latinos, whites, and blacks, groups which Reynosa says did not always get along then. Among the standout performers that night were Reynosa's cousin Jurny Big, his sister Zane One, the four-member group Future Shock (consisting of Ahred a.k.a. Redbonz, Ajax Starglider, Sojourn, and DJ Trey-Qel), and Shames Worthy (a.k.a. Raphi), all of whom came together to form the Tunnel Rats. Reynosa was inspired to name the group [...] "Tunnel Rats" [...] after his father, {{who served in the}} Vietnam War as a tunnel rat. Ahred, a member of Future Shock, stated in an interview that [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> name to it and called it Tunnel Rats. In Vietnam, the tunnel rats were the guys who went underground {{to make sure that the}} tunnels were clear so the soldiers could go through. We considered ourselves as those guys going first to make the way clear for people to go after us." [...] Reynosa recounts that [...] "we never believed that we were called to emcee or rap, never.
