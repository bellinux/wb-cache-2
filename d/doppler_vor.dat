5000|$|... #Caption: DVOR (<b>Doppler</b> <b>VOR)</b> ground station, {{collocated}} with DME.|$|E
50|$|High-Altitude <b>Doppler</b> <b>VOR</b> with DME equipment, for {{non-precision}} approaches to both runways. Frequency 114.30 MHz, designator CAR.|$|E
50|$|This {{document}} {{sets the}} worst case bearing accuracy performance on a Conventional VOR (CVOR) to be ±4°. A <b>Doppler</b> <b>VOR</b> (DVOR) is required to be ±1°.|$|E
5000|$|The {{predicted}} {{accuracy of}} the VOR system is ±1.4°. However, test data indicate that 99.94% of the time a VOR system has less than ±0.35° of error. Internal monitoring of a VOR station will shut it down, or change over to a standby system if the station error exceeds some limit. A <b>Doppler</b> <b>VOR</b> beacon will typically change over or shut down when the bearing error exceeds 1.0°. [...] National air space authorities may often set tighter limits. For instance, in Australia, a Primary Alarm limit may be set as low as ±0.5° on some <b>Doppler</b> <b>VOR</b> beacons.|$|E
50|$|In practice, bearing errors {{can often}} exceed those defined in Annex 10, in some directions. This is usually due to terrain effects, {{buildings}} near the VOR, or, {{in the case}} of a DVOR, some counterpoise effects. Note that <b>Doppler</b> <b>VOR</b> beacons utilise an elevated groundplane that is used to elevate the effective antenna pattern. It creates a strong lobe at an elevation angle of 30° which complements the 0° lobe of the antennas themselves. This groundplane is called a counterpoise. A counterpoise though, rarely works exactly as one would hope. For example, the edge of the counterpoise can absorb and re-radiate signals from the antennas, and it may tend to do this differently in some directions than others.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} signals {{received}} by these antennas, in a <b>Doppler</b> <b>VOR</b> beacon, {{are different from}} the signals received by an aircraft. This is because the antennas are close to the transmitter and are affected by proximity effects. For example, the free space path loss from nearby sideband antennas will be 1.5 dB different (at 113 MHz and at a distance of 80 m) from the signals received from the far side sideband antennas. For a distant aircraft there will be no measurable difference. Similarly the peak rate of phase change seen by a receiver is from the tangential antennas. For the aircraft these tangential paths will be almost parallel, {{but this is not the}} case for an antenna near the DVOR.|$|E
50|$|<b>Doppler</b> <b>VOR</b> beacons are {{inherently}} {{more accurate than}} Conventional VORs because they are less affected by reflections from hills and buildings. The variable signal in a DVOR is the 30 Hz FM signal; in a CVOR it is the 30 Hz AM signal. If the AM signal from a CVOR beacon bounces off a building or hill, the aircraft will see a phase {{that appears to be}} at the phase centre of the main signal and the reflected signal, and this phase centre will move as the beam rotates. In a DVOR beacon, the variable signal, if reflected, will seem to be two FM signals of unequal strengths and different phases. Twice per 30 Hz cycle, the instantaneous deviation of the two signals will be the same, and the phase locked loop will get (briefly) confused. As the two instantaneous deviations drift apart again, the phase locked loop will follow the signal with the greatest strength, which will be the line-of-sight signal. If the phase separation of the two deviations is small, however, the phase locked loop will become less likely to lock on to the true signal for a larger percentage of the 30 Hz cycle (this will depend on the bandwidth of the output of the phase comparator in the aircraft). In general, some reflections can cause minor problems, but these are usually about an order of magnitude less than in a CVOR beacon.|$|E
