40|$|CRISPR {{technology}} has rapidly {{changed the face}} of biological research, such that precise genome editing has now become routine for many labs within several years of its initial development. What makes CRISPR/Cas 9 so revolutionary is the ability to target a protein (Cas 9) to an exact genomic locus, through designing a specific short complementary nucleotide sequence, that together with a common scaffold sequence, constitute the guide RNA bridging the protein and the DNA. Wild-type Cas 9 cleaves both DNA strands at its target sequence, but this protein can also be modified to <b>exert</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>functions.</b> For instance, by attaching an activation domain to catalytically inactive Cas 9 and targeting a promoter region, it is possible to stimulate the expression of a specific endogenous gene. In principle, any genomic region can be targeted, and recent efforts have successfully generated pooled guide RNA libraries for coding and regulatory regions of human, mouse and Drosophila genomes with high coverage, thus facilitating functional phenotypic screening. In this review, we will highlight recent developments in the area of CRISPR-based functional genomics and discuss potential future directions, with a special focus on mammalian cell systems and arrayed library screening...|$|E
