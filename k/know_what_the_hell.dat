Although the bombs' existence was public, secrecy continued, and many workers remained ignorant of their jobs; one stated in 1946, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> I'm doing besides looking into a ——— and turning a ——— alongside a ———.

500|$|Dahl {{said that}} the {{original}} novel was [...] "Ian Fleming's worst book, with no plot in it which would even make a movie", and compared it to a travelogue, stating {{that he had to}} create a new plot [...] " [...] I could retain only four or five of the original story's ideas." [...] On creating the plot, Dahl said he [...] "didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> Bond was going to do" [...] despite having to deliver the first draft in six weeks, and decided to do a basic plot similar to Dr. No. Dahl was given a free rein on his script, except for the character of Bond and [...] "the girl formula", involving three women for Bond to seduce— an ally and a henchwoman who both get killed, and the main Bond girl. While the third involved a character from the book, Kissy Suzuki, Dahl had to create Aki and Helga Brandt to fulfil the rest.|$|E
500|$|Saunders was {{discharged}} from the Army on 5October 1945, {{following the end of}} the Second World War. Returning to Australia, he volunteered for service in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, but the government would not accept Aborigines for the operation. Saunders spoke publicly against this policy, calling it [...] "narrow-minded and ignorant"; the wartime restriction on non-European enlistments in the armed forces was not lifted until 1949. Saunders moved to Melbourne with his family, which by this time consisted of his wife Dorothy, whom he had married in 1944, and their three young children. Dorothy had served in the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force during the war. [...] Saunders recalled that he [...] "had a hard time after the war... and poor old Dotty, she, you know, didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> to make of it". Facing discrimination that he had rarely encountered as a soldier, he worked in the ensuing years as a tram conductor, a foundry worker, and a shipping clerk.|$|E

5000|$|Really Red {{was one of}} {{the very}} few bands that dealt with {{politics}} in a meaningful way. They didn't just yell a bunch of cheap slogans. They never talked down to their audience. Most importantly, they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> they were talking about. This was a huge contrast to the generic [...] "political" [...] hardcore bands highly touted by the likes of Maximum Rock 'n' Roll. The band's righteous anger was infectious. At least it infected me.|$|R
5000|$|It wasn't {{something}} that came up. You had to bluff to survive. When sound first came in, nobody knew much about it. We were all {{walking around in}} the dark.

He {{was one of the}} few directors who <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> they were doing. Most of your directors walked around in a fog - they didn't know where the door was.|$|R
500|$|During the October 15, 1973 session, drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens {{contributed to}} the tracks [...] "Peace Go with You", [...] "Rivers of My Fathers", [...] "Back Home", and [...] "The Bottle". Adams, however, was {{disappointed}} that [...] "H²Ogate Blues" [...] was to be left off the album. The song originally served as an opening monologue concerning the Watergate incident used by Scott-Heron at his concerts, and it contains proto-rap and talking blues elements, in which rhythmic speech or near-speech {{is accompanied by a}} free melody and strict rhythm. The studio version, which was recorded during the album's sessions, was not intended to be for the album prior to Adams' objection, as Scott-Heron said that [...] "nobody outside of Washington seemed to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> I was talking about." [...] Scott-Heron later revisited the experience in the liner notes of the album's 1998 reissue. On Adams' opinion of [...] "H²Ogate Blues", he wrote that [...] "His reply was that even if people didn’t understand the politics it’s still funny as hell." [...] On the recording, Scott-Heron stated: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> they’re doing and neither will you when you get to be a parent. You’ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home. [...] "Right then, I knew my dad had dragged out his furniture single-handedly," [...] he recalled. He spoke on the song's inspiration in 2001: ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track. According to the singer, [...] "I was thinking: who is in my eyes super iconic, who do I look up to, who is alive today that's been through what I feel like I've been through, that's been through a lot, survived, has stories to tell, has evolved as human being [...] is a survivor, his name came to mind right away." [...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured.

5000|$|A {{journalist}} {{with three}} decades of experience, {{and the author of}} a dozen travel-inspired books, Winchester's initial proposal {{to write a book about}} an obscure lexicographer met with rejection. Only when Harper Collins editor Larry Ashmead read the proposal and championed the book did Winchester pursue the necessary research in earnest. [...] Of the project Ashmead said [...] "we can make lexicography cool". It was Ashmead that persuaded Winchester to call the US edition The Professor and the Madman (over Winchester's objection that Murray was not a professor), saying [...] "No one here <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> a Crowthorne is." ...|$|R
5000|$|Behind-the-scenes {{problems}} (including filming, script changes, {{and later}} constant cuts and re-editing of the movie) were {{so big and}} so bad {{that one of the}} more experienced crew members said in an interview: [...] "This was the worst-organized, most poorly prepared film I've ever been on in my life. From the first day we started, no one <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> anyone was doing." [...] This same crew member also mentioned some reasons why director Konchalovsky was fired; [...] "He found himself in over his head. There were scenes scheduled for three days that were so complicated they should have been scheduled for six or seven days. They were trying to do a 22-week movie in 11 weeks." ...|$|R

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, some of Williams's tracks were reissued by American Music Records, amongst others. His playing style was {{somewhat}} unusual, but such belated recognition failed to unearth Williams, {{the details of}} whose life remain a mystery. He was recalled briefly by Henry Townsend, who stated, [...] "I knew him from down on Biddle Street and I played guitar behind him around town". He added that Williams was [...] "an average guy {{and he was very}} entertaining ... he disappeared from St. Louis and went down in Arkansas some place. I never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> happened to him." [...] According to the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc, Williams reportedly died in Birmingham in 1953 or 1954.|$|R

The team retconned the idea that, because the Empire of Tamriel was so violent, it had been nicknamed the Arena. It was Lakshman {{who came up with}} the idea of [...] "The Elder Scrolls", and though, in the words of Ted Peterson, [...] "I don't think he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> it meant any more than we did", the words eventually came to mean [...] "Tamriel's mystical tomes of knowledge that told of its past, present, and future."

I thought they really <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> was going on,” Brown said. Via a {{psychiatric}} clinic associated with UCLA, Brown, Moses and Hopps all became male attendants to a schizophrenic young woman who Hopps recalled liked to be taken to Disneyland in Anaheim.
