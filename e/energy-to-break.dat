40|$|The {{invention}} {{pertains to}} a ballistic-resistant moulded article comprising a compressed stack of sheets comprising reinforcing tapes having a tensile strength {{of at least}} 1. 0 GPa, a tensile modulus of at least 40 GPa, and a tensile <b>energy-to-break</b> of at least 15 J/g, {{the direction of the}} tapes within the compressed stack being not unidirectional, wherein the stack comprises a first layer comprising sheets comprising reinforcing tapes and a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as matrix material and a fur- ther layer comprising sheets comprising reinforcing tapes and a thermoplastic elastomer as matrix material, wherein the further layer comprises 0. 2 - 8 wt. % matrix material. It has been found that the combination of a layer comprising HDPE as matrix with a layer comprising a thermoplastic elastomer as matrix results in an article which combines high impact re- sistance with improved constructional integrity of the article and reduced dynamic and static back face deformation upon im- pact...|$|E
