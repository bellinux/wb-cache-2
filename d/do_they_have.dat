5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category labels for IQ score ranges {{are specific to}} each brand of test. The test publishers {{do not have a}} uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into categories of the same size or with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E

25|$|Barbiturates in {{overdose}} {{with other}} CNS (central nervous system) depressants (e.g. alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines) {{are even more}} dangerous due to additive CNS and respiratory depressant effects. In the case of benzodiazepines, not only <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> additive effects, barbiturates also increase the binding affinity of the benzodiazepine binding site, leading to exaggerated benzodiazepine effects. (ex. If a benzodiazepine increases the frequency of channel opening by 300%, and a barbiturate increases the duration of their opening by 300%, then the combined effects of the drugs increase the channels overall function by 900%, not 600%).|$|E
25|$|Harming {{civilian}} {{areas and}} pillaging residential areas is also forbidden, {{as is the}} destruction of trees, crops, livestock and farmlands.

Nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the right to use the local facilities of the native people without their consent. If such a consent is obtained, the Muslim army is still under the obligation to compensate the people financially for the use of such facilities. However, Islamic law allows the confiscation of military equipment and supplies captured from the camps and military headquarters of the combatant armies.|$|E
25|$|While {{being interviewed}} by Tony Jones on Australia's ABC TV network in September 2013, Suzuki {{alleged that the}} Harper {{government}} was building prisons even though crime rates were declining in Canada. He suggested that the prisons might be being built so that Stephen Harper can incarcerate environmental activists. Jean-Christophe De Le Rue, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney, denied the claims, emphasizing that the Canadian government is not building any prisons, nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> plans to build any. There was, however, an increase in federal spending on prisons, which included expanding existing prisons, {{in order to accommodate}} the growing inmate population. This is thought to be due to legislation such as the Tackling Violent Crimes Act which increases the length of sentences.|$|E

25|$|The ADA {{provides}} explicit {{coverage for}} service animals. Guidelines {{have been developed}} not only to protect persons with disabilities, but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, {{but they are not}} allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They can not ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability can not be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner can not get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animal would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety so {{it would not be a}} valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premise. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals nor <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to provide a designated area for the service animal to use the bathroom. Lastly, people that require service dogs can not be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly. For example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities can not be treated less than other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.|$|E
500|$|In 1997 the {{scholars}} Philip J.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B-, explaining that [...] "after four solid weeks of good-to-great episodes, Fringe delivered its first semi-dud of season three" [...] because the case-of-the-week was [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "twistless", and the dialogue was [...] "too flat and too earnest". Despite this, Murray thought the episode was [...] "essential viewing" [...] for Fringe fans due to certain revelations, {{such as how}} people are actually alive in the amber, and also because it moved the plot closer to an Olivia-Altlivia confrontation. Conversely, the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson {{thought it was a}} good episode, writing [...] "This is what I love about Fringe. Not only <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the cool science, they also have the moral questions that go along". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly thought the episode was [...] "enthralling," [...] and he enjoyed the brothers' [...] "nice emotional story," [...] and praised Anna Torv's acting. TV Squad reviewer Jason Hughes enjoyed the parallel universe, and in particular the character of Lincoln Lee, believing he was [...] "too rich a character to just abandon" [...] once the series stopped alternating between universes.|$|E
500|$|Three years later, in the {{build-up}} to {{the release}} of Manhunt 2, the controversy re-ignited. Two days after announcing the game, which was set for release in July, Take-Two Interactive (Rockstar's parent company) issued a statement which read, in part: [...] "We are aware that in direct contradiction to all available evidence, certain individuals continue to link the original Manhunt title to the Warren Leblanc case in 2004. The transcript of the court case makes it quite clear what really happened. At sentencing the Judge, defense, prosecution and Leicester police all emphasized that Manhunt played no part in the case." [...] Later that day, however, Patrick and Giselle Pakeerah condemned the decision to release a sequel, and insisted that Manhunt was a factor in their son's murder. Upon the announcement of the sequel, Patrick stated [...] "I'm very disappointed. This is rubbing salt into the wounds in the month we will be marking the anniversary of Stefan's death. I'm very surprised they are doing this after all that has happened and all the publicity." [...] Giselle added [...] "It is an insult to my son's memory that they have announced this game in the month we will be marking this anniversary. These game moguls are {{making a lot of money}} out of games which are morally indecent. Why <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to pump more violence into society?" [...] Leicester East MP Keith Vaz supported the Pakeerahs, claiming he was [...] "astonished" [...] that Rockstar were making a sequel; [...] "It is contempt for those who are trying very hard to ensure something is done to control the violent nature of these games." ...|$|E
