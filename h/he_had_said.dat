5|$|In addition, Sarria gave a small {{selection}} of costumes, accessories, and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including a cape and headdress {{that he wore}} in performances of his comic version of Aida at The Black Cat. Sarria continued to own a smaller collection of art, artifacts and documentation; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that he expected to eventually donate those materials to the GLBT Historical Society. An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated materials to the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.|$|E
5|$|The Mortaras {{spent the}} morning of 24 June {{attempting}} to have Feletti's order overruled by either the city's cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided {{to take steps to}} make the separation as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be well cared for, under the protection of the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.|$|E

5000|$|Gautier {{has written}} about the book The Wonder That was India by Arthur Llewellyn Basham. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> the book {{propagated}} clichés like the caste system, Aryans, and Dravidans. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> called Basham the [...] "founding father of racism". <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that the book led to later claims of Hindu imperialism. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> also criticized Aurangzeb for his atrocities.|$|R
5|$|With the {{assistance}} of hundreds of volunteers, Aruban investigators conducted an extensive search and rescue operation. American special agents from the FBI, fifty Dutch soldiers and three specially-equipped Dutch Air Force F-16 aircraft participated in the search. In addition to the ground search, divers searched the ocean floor for Holloway's body. Her remains were not found. On December 18, 2007, Aruban prosecutors announced that the case would be closed without any charges made. The Aruban prosecutor's office reopened the case on February 1, 2008, after receiving video footage of Van der Sloot, {{under the influence of}} marijuana, saying that Holloway died on the morning of her disappearance, and that a friend had disposed of her body. Van der Sloot later denied that what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> was true, and in an interview said that he had sold Holloway into sexual slavery. He later retracted his comments. In 2012, Van der Sloot was convicted of the May 30, 2010, murder of Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru.|$|E
5|$|After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula {{replaced}} him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; {{according to the}} South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed {{by one of the}} whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would also write an endorsement of the proclamation.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> {{he would}} not be running for president, {{published}} reports in 2007 indicated that billionaire and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg had been considering a presidential bid as an independent with up to $1 billion of his own fortune to finance it. Bloomberg ultimately ended this speculation by unequivocally stating that {{he would not}} run.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} famous for wearing {{many layers of}} tzitzit. At first, he wore about 150 pairs, but later, due to his fragile health, he wore only about 70 pairs. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> that he wore them on behalf {{of people who do}} not fulfill this mitzvah, but Wittow {{believed}} that was not the main reason.|$|E

In response, Farage said that in future all UKIP MEPs would provide monthly expense details.|$|E
25|$|Haig was in England from 12 March. On 14 March, at {{a meeting}} at Downing Street, warning of serious {{manpower}} problems by June “if (sic) the Germans attacked”. Bonar Law and Lloyd George, by Haig’s account, {{tried to get him}} to say that the Germans would not attack. They accused Haig of having said that there would not be a major German offensive (which was not actually what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> – <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> it would be “a gambler’s throw”) but agreed to shelve the General Reserve for the time being until enough American troops had arrived. On the same day Haig attended two long sessions of the Supreme War Council (at one of which, to his amusement, Clemenceau told Foch to shut up). On 15 Haig took part in a long discussion about the bombing of German cities, which he regarded as a waste of effort. That night Doris gave birth to his son Dawyck. He returned to France the next day.|$|E
25|$|I met Laughton only once, at a party. Of all {{the actors}} I have seen, I {{think he would}} have come closest to doing Nero Wolfe perfectly.

25|$|Dempsey did {{not defend}} his title {{for three years}} {{following}} the Firpo fight. There was pressure from {{the public and the}} media for Dempsey to defend his title against Black contender Harry Wills. Disagreement exists among boxing historians as to whether Dempsey avoided Wills, though Dempsey claimed he was willing to fight him. When he originally won the title, however, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> he would no longer fight Black boxers.|$|E
25|$|Four of Wittgenstein's former {{students}} {{arrived at his}} bedside—Ben Richards, Elizabeth Anscombe, Yorick Smythies, and Maurice O'Connor Drury. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father Conrad Pepler, also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea for}} the game came to Ian Messiter as he rode {{on the top of}} a number 13 bus. He {{recalled}} Percival Parry Jones, a history master from his days at Sherborne School who, upon seeing the young Messiter daydreaming in a class, instructed him to repeat everything <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> in the previous minute without hesitation or repetition. To this, Messiter added a rule disallowing players from deviating from the subject, as well as a scoring system based on panellists' challenges.|$|E

When Marvis conveyed Ali's contrition to him, Frazier commented that Ali should have communicated this to him directly. After returning to the US, Ali called Butch Lewis, and asked for Frazier's private number, saying he wanted to apologize to Frazier. Lewis then conveyed this request to Frazier, but was told not {{to share it with}} Ali, according to Lewis.|$|E
