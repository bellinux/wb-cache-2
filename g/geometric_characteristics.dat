25|$|Soft tissues {{have the}} {{potential}} to undergo big deformations and still come back to the initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. their stress-strain curve is nonlinear. The soft tissues are also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis. In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear elastic material is modified by its <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rapid transit is an {{intracity}} system {{built in}} large cities and has the highest capacity of any passenger transport system. It is usually grade-separated and commonly built underground or elevated. At street level, smaller trams can be used. Light rails are upgraded trams that have step-free access, their own right-of-way and sometimes sections underground. Monorail systems are elevated, medium-capacity systems. A people mover is a driverless, grade-separated train that serves only a few stations, as a shuttle. Due {{to the lack of}} uniformity of rapid transit systems, route alignment varies, with diverse rights-of-way (private land, side of road, street median) and <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristics</b> (sharp or broad curves, steep or gentle grades). For instance, the Chicago 'L' trains are designed with extremely short cars to negotiate the sharp curves in the Loop. New Jersey's PATH has similar-sized cars to accommodate curves in the trans-Hudson tunnels. San Francisco's BART operates large cars on its well-engineered routes.|$|E

It is therefore important to analyze and evaluate network topology and its corresponding <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the overlay network. The peer-to-peer systems based on broadcast routing mechanism, typically Gnutella, are still the most popular peer-to-peer systems.

2500|$|This {{secondary}} {{assembly device}} contained the lithium deuteride fusion fuel in a stainless-steel canister. Running {{down to the}} center of the secondary was a ~1.3cm thick hollow cylindrical rod of plutonium, nested in the steel canister. This was the sparkplug, a tritium-boosted fission device, which had an aperture of about 0.5cm at its center. The sparkplug was charged with about 4 grams of tritium and, imploding together with the secondary's compression, was timed to detonate by the first generations of neutrons that arrived from the primary. Timing was defined by the <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the sparkplug (its uncompressed annular radius), which detonated when its criticality, or k, transcended 1. Its purpose was to compress the fusion material around it from its inside, equally applying pressure with the tamper. The compression factor of the fusion fuel and its adiabatic compression energy determined the minimal energy required for the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel and the tamper's momentum. The sparkplug weighed about 18kg, and its initial firing yielded [...] Then it would be completely fissioned by the fusion neutrons, contributing about [...] to the total yield. The energy required by the sparkplug to counteract the compression of the fusion fuel was lower than the primary's yield because coupling of the primary’s energy in the hohlraum is accompanied by losses due to the difference between the X-ray fireball and the hohlraum temperatures. The neutrons entered the assembly by a small hole through the ~28cm thick U blast-heat shield. It was positioned in front of the secondary assembly facing the primary. Similar to the tamper-fusion capsule assembly, the shield was shaped as a circular frustum, with its small diameter facing the primary's side, and with its large diameter locked by a type of mortise and tenon joint to the rest of the secondary assembly. The shield-tamper ensemble can be visualized as a circular bifrustum. All parts of the tamper were similarly locked together to provide structural support and rigidity to the secondary assembly. Surrounding the fusion-fuel–spark-plug assembly was the uranium tamper with a standoff air-gap about 0.9cm wide that was to increase the tamper's momentum, a levitation technique used as early as Operation Sandstone and famously quoted by Ted Taylor as hammer-on-the-nail-impact. Since there were also technical concerns that high-Z tamper material would mix rapidly with the relatively low-density fusion fuel, leading to unacceptably large radiation losses the stand-off gap also acted as a buffer to hinder to some extent the unavoidable and undesirable Taylor mixing.|$|E

40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{regularity}} and the geometric significance of {{solution of the}} Cauchy problem for a degenerate parabolic equation u_t=Δu^m. Our main objective {{is to improve the}} Hölder estimate obtained by pioneers and then, to show the <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristic</b> of free boundary of degenerate parabolic equation. To be exact, the present work will show that: (1) the weak solution u(x,t) ∈C^α,α/ 2 (R^n×R^+), where α∈(0, 1) when m≥ 2 and α= 1 when m∈(1, 2); (2) the surface ϕ=(u(x,t)) ^β is a complete Riemannian manifold, which is tangent to R^n at the boundary of the positivity set of u(x,t). (3) the function (u(x,t)) ^β is a classical solution to another degenerate parabolic equation if β is large sufficiently; Moreover, some explicit expressions about the speed of propagation of u(x,t) and the continuous dependence on the nonlinearity of the equation are obtained. Recalling the older Hölder estimate (u(x,t) ∈C^α,α/ 2 (R^n×R^+) with 0 1), we see our result (1) improves the older result and, based on this conclusion, we can obtain (2), which shows the <b>geometric</b> <b>characteristic</b> of free boundary.
