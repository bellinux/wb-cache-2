500|$|Later, Doug Herzog from Comedy Central saw the Jesus vs. Santa {{short and}} {{considered}} {{it to be}} [...] "literally the funniest thing 'd ever seen," [...] and requested Parker and Stone to develop a show for his network. During the negotiations, Parker and Stone brought {{up the idea of}} a Mr. Hankey episode, with Parker claiming to have asked [...] "one thing we have to know before we really go any further: <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> talking poo?" [...] The network's executives were receptive to the idea, which {{would be one of the}} main reasons Parker and Stone decided to sign on with the channel. The first episode of the series, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", debuted on Comedy Central on August 13, 1997, while Mr. Hankey debuted a few months later in the ninth episode, [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo".|$|E
500|$|Although the Mr. Hankey {{short film}} was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related {{animated}} short films called The Spirit of Christmas, {{which served as}} precursors to the South Park series. When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived {{the idea of a}} South Park-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it [...] "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the idea to friend Brian Graden, then a television executive with the Fox Broadcasting Company, but he rejected it and said, according to Matt Stone, [...] "I'm not putting poo on my network". Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode. Later, when Comedy Central expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, [...] "One thing we have to know before we really go any further: <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> talking poo?" [...] The executives were receptive to the idea, which Parker said {{was one of the main}} reasons he and Stone decided to sign on with the channel.|$|E

500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth whether they want it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This {{turned out to be a}} Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E
2500|$|Luckinbill's musical ability was {{utilized}} in J.T. and Colleen's storyline. He {{stated that the}} writers and producers felt {{like it would be}} a good idea. He added: [...] "They wanted me to sing a song by Alison Krauss called, [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". I liked it, was sitting at home one night working on that song and this new song just came about." [...] The new song Luckinbill wrote was entitled [...] "Feel". In writing the song, Luckinbill said he was [...] "thinking of the character's viewpoint, from J.T. to Colleen. If he were going to write her a song, what would he write? And these words came out. I ended up writing a song that night, which I took to our producers and said, 'I know you want me to sing this song, but <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> this one? It's character driven.'" [...] Smith decided Luckinbill would sing both [...] "Feel" [...] and [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". Luckinbill sang Krauss' song on the episode dated December 26, 2002, where J.T. serenades Colleen on her sixteenth birthday. Smith wrote a scene specifically for the song Luckinbill wrote, featuring J.T. playing his guitar at Colleen's Valentine's Day dance where he performed [...] "Feel". After J.T. cheats on Colleen with Anita, Luckinbill wrote an untitled song in character for the show and performed it in character on the episode dated July 24, 2003.|$|E

They kept up the pose, which was supposed to represent Dr. Martineau's philosophy, of being Man and Woman on their Planet considering its Future, but insensibly they developed the idiosyncrasies of their position.
