25|$|All {{species of}} Mandragora contain highly biologically active {{alkaloids}}, tropane alkaloids in particular. Jackson and Berry {{were unable to}} find any differences {{in the composition of}} these chemicals between Mandragora autumnalis and Mandragora officinarum (using the broader definition of M.autumnalis). Alkaloids present included <b>hyoscyamine,</b> hyoscine, cuscohygrine, apoatropine, 3-alpha-tigloyloxytropane, 3-alpha,6-beta-ditigloyloxytropane and belladonnine. Non-alkaloid constituents included sitosterol and beta-methylesculetin (scopoletin).|$|E
25|$|Reportedly {{the mixture}} was {{ground to a}} paste, boiled in water, and {{administered}} as a drink. After 2 to 4 hours the patient would become insensitive to pain and then lapse into unconsciousness. Depending on the dosage, they might remain unconscious for 6–24 hours. The active ingredients in tsūsensan were scopolamine, <b>hyoscyamine,</b> atropine, aconitine and angelicotoxin. When consumed in sufficient quantity, tsūsensan produced a state of general anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many members}} of the Solanaceae, species of Mandragora contain highly biologically active {{alkaloids}}, tropane alkaloids in particular. Hanuš et al. reviewed the phytochemistry of Mandragora species. More than 80 substances have been identified; their paper gives the detailed chemical structure of 37 of them. The different parts of the plant contain different proportions and concentrations of alkaloids, with the roots having the highest concentration. Alkaloids present include atropine, apoatropine, belladonnine, cuscohygrine, <b>hyoscyamine,</b> scopolamine (hyoscine), 3α-tigloyloxytropane and 3α,6β-ditigloyloxytropane. M.caulescens and M.turcomanica are also reported to contain anisodamine.|$|E
500|$|Alkaloids are bitter-tasting chemicals, very {{widespread}} in nature, and often toxic, {{found in many}} medicinal plants. There are several classes with different modes of action as drugs, both recreational and pharmaceutical. Medicines of different classes include atropine, scopolamine, and <b>hyoscyamine</b> (all from nightshade), the traditional medicine berberine (from plants such as Berberis and Mahonia), caffeine (Coffea), cocaine (Coca), ephedrine (Ephedra), morphine (opium poppy), [...] nicotine (tobacco), reserpine (Rauwolfia serpentina), quinidine and quinine (Cinchona), vincamine (Vinca minor), and vincristine (Catharanthus roseus).|$|E
2500|$|Methylene blue is a {{component}} of a frequently prescribed urinary analgesic/anti-infective/anti-spasmodic known as [...] "Prosed DS", a combination of drugs which also contains phenyl salicylate, benzoic acid, <b>hyoscyamine</b> sulfate, and methenamine (aka hexamethylenetetramine {{and not to be}} confused with 'methanamine').|$|E
2500|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of atropine {{starting from}} l-phenylalanine first undergoes a transamination forming phenylpyruvic acid {{which is then}} reduced to phenyl-lactic acid. [...] Coenzyme A then couples phenyl-lactic acid with tropine forming littorine, which then undergoes a radical rearrangement initiated with a P450 enzyme forming <b>hyoscyamine</b> aldehyde. [...] A dehydrogenase then reduces the aldehyde to a primary alcohol making (−)-hyoscyamine, which upon racemization forms atropine.|$|E
2500|$|The active {{ingredients}} in tsūsensan are scopolamine, <b>hyoscyamine,</b> atropine, aconitine and angelicotoxin. When consumed in sufficient quantity, tsūsensan produces {{a state of}} general anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis. Shutei Nakagawa (1773–1850), {{a close friend of}} Hanaoka, wrote a small pamphlet titled [...] "Mayaku-ko" [...] ("narcotic powder") in 1796. Although the original manuscript was lost in a fire in 1867, this brochure described the current state of Hanaoka's research on general anesthesia.|$|E
60|$|We {{will have}} a fair trial of Bang. Do bring {{down some of the}} <b>Hyoscyamine</b> pills, and I will give a fair trial of Opium, Henbane, and Nepenthe. By-the-bye I always {{considered}} Homer's account of the Nepenthe as a 'Banging' lie.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hyoscyamine</b> can be {{extracted}} from plants of the Solanaceae family, notably Datura stramonium. As <b>hyoscyamine</b> {{is a direct}} precursor in the plant biosynthesis of scopolamine, it is produced via the same metabolic pathway.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, tropinone reductase I {{converts}} tropinone to tropine which condenses with phenylalanine-derived phenyllactate to littorine. A cytochrome P450 {{classified as}} Cyp80F1 oxidizes and rearranges littorine to <b>hyoscyamine</b> aldehyde. In the final step, <b>hyoscyamine</b> undergoes epoxidation catalyzed by 6beta-hydroxyhyoscyamine epoxidase yielding scopolamine.|$|E

5000|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-hyoscyamine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase ((6S)-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include <b>hyoscyamine</b> 6beta-hydroxylase, <b>hyoscyamine</b> 6beta-dioxygenase, and <b>hyoscyamine</b> 6-hydroxylase. This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis ii. It has 2 cofactors: iron, and Ascorbate.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hyoscyamine</b> is an {{antagonist}} of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (antimuscarinic). It {{blocks the}} action of acetylcholine at parasympathetic sites in sweat glands, salivary glands, stomach secretions, heart muscle, sinoatrial node, smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract, and the central nervous system. It increases cardiac output and heart rate, lowers blood pressure and dries secretions. [...] It may antagonize serotonin. [...] At comparable doses, <b>hyoscyamine</b> has 98 per cent of the anticholinergic power of atropine.
