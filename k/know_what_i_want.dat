500|$|Etherington was {{the flag}} bearer for Great Britain at the closing ceremony, despite rupturing an ovarian cyst, which {{left her in}} a {{wheelchair}} {{for much of the}} day of the ceremony; she was able to walk and carry the flag having taken painkillers. After the end of the 2014 Winter Paralympics, she was unsure if she would continue competing at international level, saying [...] "I don't really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> right now".|$|E
500|$|After the trip, Claude says [...] "I can't {{take this}} moment to moment living on the streets.... I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be... invisible". [...] As they [...] "look at the moon," [...] Sheila and the others enjoy a light moment ("Good Morning Starshine"). [...] The tribe pays tribute to an old {{mattress}} ("The Bed"). Claude is left alone with his doubts. [...] He leaves as the tribe enters wrapped in blankets {{in the midst of}} a snow storm. [...] They start a protest chant and then wonder where Claude has gone. [...] Berger calls out [...] "Claude! Claude!" [...] Claude enters dressed in a military uniform, his hair short, but they do not see him because he is an invisible spirit. [...] Claude says, [...] "like it or not, they got me." ...|$|E
500|$|A dark, {{aggressive}} song whose lumbering, distorted guitar riff is in E minor, [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] was the band's first hit. [...] In raspy vocals against arpeggiated guitar backing, {{the lyrics}} describe the existential anguish {{of being at}} the cusp of adulthood, decrying in each verse being [...] "in the middle" [...] of something, such as [...] "life" [...] or [...] "doubt". [...] The chorus switches {{to a series of}} power chords building from A, the vocals proclaiming: [...] "I'm eighteen/ And I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want...</b> I gotta get out of this place/ I'll go runnin' in outer space". [...] The song turns around at the conclusion with an embrace of those things that had caused such anguish: [...] "I'm eighteen and I like it!" ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{descriptive}} {{qualitative study}} was to investigate women’s reasons for, and experiences of maternity care with a privately practising midwife. Data analysis from the fourteen women interviewed revealed three major categories characterising reasons for choosing private midwifery care: <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> from my care provider; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> from my pregnancy and birth experience and I was willing to do the research to get <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted...</b>|$|R

500|$|Symbolically, {{the running}} plot of Claude's indecision, {{especially}} his resistance to burning his draft card, which ultimately causes his demise, {{has been seen}} as a parallel to Hamlet: [...] "the melancholy hippie". [...] The symbolism is carried into the last scene, where Claude appears as a ghostly spirit among his friends wearing an army uniform in an ironic echo of an earlier scene, where he says, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be ... invisible". [...] According to Public Theater Artistic Director Oskar Eustis, [...] "Both [...] center on idealistic brilliant men as they struggle to find their place in a world marred by war, violence, and venal politics. [...] They see both the luminous possibilities and the harshest realities of being human. [...] In the end, unable to effectively combat the evil around them, they tragically succumb." ...|$|E
500|$|CDs were {{submitted}} to Weiland containing music in completed demo form, including scratch melodies, which Weiland {{had the option}} to use or discard. Dean did not mind when his melodies were not accepted by Weiland. [...] "hen I write a song, I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it to be melodically. But Scott always... knocks my melodies out of the water." [...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved. Weiland was credited for the lyrical melodies, but Robert pointed out, [...] "This record was made {{in a way that}} Scott wasn't really there for the creation of these songs, musically." [...] However, both Dean and Robert would be surprised at the direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision. Robert found this to be a strength within the band. [...] "People always have this misconception that a band all need to think alike... so many different ways of looking at songs and [...] put together, and that's really the beauty of a great band".|$|E
500|$|... "Young Girls" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} on Saturday Night Live {{and was released}} as the first promotional single taken from Unorthodox Jukebox, on November 6, 2012 on iTunes. Later, it was reported by Mars that the record {{was scheduled to be}} the second single from the album. This release involved little planning according to Mars [...] "I felt [...] was good. None of these things are planned, which one goes first, which one goes second. One day I wake up and I say, 'You <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> the world to hear this song that I wrote called 'Young Girls,' and I put it out". However, a week later, while performing [...] "When I Was Your Man" [...] on the third season finale of The Voice, he announced that the track played would be the second official single from the album. The fifth and overall single, [...] "Young Girls", was first liberated on Australian contemporary hit radio, on November 26, 2013, after being promoted by Mars in radio station, Nova. Subsequently, the song was released to United States and United Kingdom contemporary hit radios on December 10, 2013 and February 17, 2014, respectively. Italian radio stations began adding the track onto their playlist on February 26, 2014. Later, on April 4, 2014 a CD single containing the track as released in Finland.|$|E
5000|$|Herrera {{had first}} {{explored}} country music while in MxPx in 2005, with the track [...] "Late Again" [...] from the Panic album, which featured Parker on guitar.

2500|$|Jackson {{embarked}} on The Velvet Rope Tour, visiting Europe, North America, Japan, New Zealand, Africa, and Australia. It used an autobiographical theme derived from elements of Broadway theater. She stated, [...] "To me, being onstage is about entertaining. I {{know there are}} people who just walk onstage and give you a show by just doing their music, but <b>I</b> always <b>wanted</b> something extra". She added, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> everyone to look like, especially for the opening number. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> everyone to wear.

500|$|The {{album cover}} was photographed by Björk's former boyfriend, the French {{director}} Stéphane Sednaoui. It shows the singer {{standing in a}} London street, her pale skin and dark hair contrasting with the vivid colours of the Japanese-inspired signs behind her. An earlier shoot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino was scrapped; it would later appear in a 1995 article for The Face, in which Björk explained: [...] "It cost £24,000. But now I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want.</b> OK, I admit it, [...] I'm a pop star"! In the original cover picture, Björk was surrounded by silver balls, but she scrapped the cover in favour of something [...] "more poppy". Designer Paul White of Me Company—who had been a frequent collaborator since The Sugarcubes—"surrounded her with giant postcards to represent communication with friends and family". Me Company designed the artwork, while Martin Gardiner modelled the lotus flower used in the album's booklet and packaging. The jacket Björk wears, shown on the cover, was inspired by Royal Mail airmail envelopes, referencing the album's title. It was specially crafted from envelope paper called Tyvek by designer Hussein Chalayan. Björk {{was a friend of}} Chalayan and an admirer of his designs, modelling for him in September 1995. The jacket is displayed under glass at Hard Rock Reykjavík, and was part of a 2015 MoMA retrospective on the singer, titled Björk. Vice has identified the airmail jacket look as one the [...] "ultimate fashion moments" [...] of Björk's career.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{something}} {{just a little}} cruel {{in the way the}} painter looked at her, then seeming to feel compunction, he said quickly: [...] "I always hated--the peasant life--I wanted to get away into the world; I had a feeling in here--I wanted--I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted!</b> <b>I</b> did run away at last to a house-painter at Meran.

The tour's logo is a variation of Akan symbol the Sankofa, meaning [...] "you can't move into the future until you understand your past." [...] Jackson tattooed the symbol onto her wrist and used the image frequently throughout the tour's promotional imagery.|$|R
