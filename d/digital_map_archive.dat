50|$|For example, if an IMU {{installed}} in an aeroplane moving along a certain direction vector were to measure a plane's acceleration as 5 m/sec^2 for 1 sec, {{then after that}} 1 sec the guidance computer would deduce that the plane must be traveling at 5 m/sec and must be 2,5 m from its initial position (assuming v0=0 and known starting position coordinates x0, y0, z0). If combined with a mechanical paper map or a <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> <b>archive</b> (systems whose output is generally known as a moving map display since the guidance system position output is often taken as the reference point, resulting in a moving map), the guidance system could use this method to show a pilot where the plane is located geographically in a certain moment, as with a GPS navigation system — but without the need to communicate with or receive communication from any outside components, such as satellites or land radio transponders, though external sources are still used in order to correct drift errors, and since the position update frequency allowed by inertial navigation systems can be higher the vehicle motion on the map display can be perceived as smoother. This method of navigation is called dead reckoning.|$|E

In addition, maps—especially historical maps—are often the only information source about the earth as surveyed using geodetic techniques. In order to preserve these unique documents, increasing numbers of <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> <b>archives</b> have been established, driven by advances in software and hardware technologies. Since the early 1980 s, researchers from a variety of disciplines, including computer science and geography, have been working on computational methods for the extraction and recognition of geographic features from <b>archived</b> images of <b>maps</b> (<b>digital</b> <b>map</b> processing). The typical result from map processing is geographic information {{that can be used in}} spatial and spatiotemporal analyses in a Geographic Information System environment, which benefits numerous research fields in the spatial, social, environmental, and health sciences. However, map processing literature is spread across a broad range of disciplines in which maps are included as a special type of image. This article presents an overview of existing map processing techniques, with the goal of bringing together the past and current research efforts in this interdisciplinary field, to characterize the advances that have been made, and to identify future research directions an...|$|R

The international collaborators who have helped build these and other projects address three questions: how such projects can be created when there are typically fewer sources than for modern cities; how they facilitate more collaborative models for historical research into social relations, senses, and emotions; and how they help us interrogate older historical interpretations and create new models of analysis and communication. Four authors examine technical issues around the software programs and manuscripts. Five then describe how GIS can be used to advance and develop existing research projects.

40|$|All {{available}} synoptic {{maps of the}} solid-surface {{bodies of}} the Solar System were digitized for presentation in the planned Atlas of the Solar System by Greeley and Batson. Since the last report (Batson et al., 1990), preliminary Uranian satellite maps were replaced with improved versions, Galilean satellite geology was simplified and digitized, structure was added to many maps, and the maps were converted to a standard format, with corresponding standing colors for the mapped units. Following these changes, the maps were re-reviewed by their authors and are now undergoing final editing before preparation for publication. In some cases (for Mercury, Venus, and Mars), more detailed maps were digitized and then simplified for the Atlas. Other detailed maps are planned to be digitized {{in the coming year}} for the Moon and the Galilean satellites. For most of the remaining bodies such as the Uranian satellites, the current digitized versions contain virtually all the detail that can be mapped given the available data; those versions will be unchanged for the Atlas.

It {{is well known that}} the accuracy of <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> produced from satellite images is decided largely by the accuracy of geometric modelling. However <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> are made by a series of photogrammetric workflow. Therefore the accuracy of <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> are also affected by the quality of satellite images, such as image interpretability. For satellite images, parameters such as Modulation Transfer Function(MTF), Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR) and Ground Sampling Distance(GSD) are used to present images quality. Our previous research stressed that such quality parameters may not represent the quality of image products such as <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> and that parameters for image interpretability such as Ground Resolved Distance(GRD) and National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale(NIIRS) need to be considered. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the image quality on accuracy of <b>digital</b> <b>maps</b> produced by satellite images. QuickBird, IKONOS and KOMPSAT- 2 imagery were used to analyze as they have similar GSDs. We measured various image quality parameters mentioned above from these images.

40|$|ABSTRACT: With {{the recent}} rapid {{development}} of the Internet and portable multimedia terminals, the concept of GIS has been introduced to many aspects of our daily life. Although the <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> and GIS service systems abruptly increased on the Internet, the vast amount of geographical information data and the limited speed of the service cause problems when the GIS data for the actual users are transmitted through the Internet and saved in the portable terminals in a short time. In this study, the most efficient technique to transmit the large-volume GIS <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> images is identified to address such problems. First, the file-based <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> v 2. 0 and shape files, the XML-based 3 DF-GML, GML, CityGML and KML, and the database-based geodatabase files are used to form layers in the 3 D GIS engine, and the data are transmitted to the simulator. Second, there is the streaming technique for the <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> screen images. In this method, the administrator and users connect to the server, and the 3 D GIS engine and diverse GIS <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> information on the administrator screen are transmitted to the users in the forms of screen captures or streaming service. In this study, {{the characteristics of the}} two methods are examined, and the more efficient way to deliver the GIS <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> information is determined. The detailed features of the chosen large-volume GIS <b>digital</b> <b>map</b> transmission method are designed, and the items that should be considered are identified...|$|R
