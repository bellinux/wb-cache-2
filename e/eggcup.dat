50|$|In 2011, MTV Networks {{wanted to}} make changes to the building, {{primarily}} to {{remove some of the}} studios and replace them with modern office space. The rear of the building, facing the Regent's Canal, was repainted grey rather than blue, but the structure and the <b>eggcups</b> remained in place. The famous <b>eggcups</b> that overlook Regent's Canal were also repainted after years of damage and a large quantity of paint peeling. They were painted over the familiar blue and white <b>eggcups</b> to grey and white, matching the style of the renovated building. The front of the building was more extensively redeveloped during 2012-2013: the studio block, which had been the site of the original TV-am studios, was demolished, and replaced with a new glazed-fronted office complex. The courtyard between the prior studio and office sections was renovated and reorganised, including the installation of a 305 m² long green wall in 2013.|$|R

40|$|International audienceHibernated queens of Bombus terrestris must be stimulated {{to start}} egg laying while kept in confinement. In this study, the {{stimulating}} {{effect of a}} male pupa {{and the impact of}} the age and the fixation angle of the pupa was examined. Queens started egg laying very soon if they were provided with a young male pupa. It took queens longer to oviposit with increasing age of the supplied pupae. Moreover, queens that were provided with older pupae produced fewer <b>eggcups</b> and fewer workers in the first brood. Queens with a horizontally fixed pupa did better than with a vertical or oblique oriented pupa. Of the queens that were provided with a young pupa, 80 % produced colonies. In contrast, only 30 % of the queens that were provided with an old pupa produced a colony. In addition, the latter colonies performed worse during the entire period of colony development. In conclusion, providing one horizontally fixed young male pupa to a hibernated, single queen resulted in the production of good colonies...|$|R
40|$|Anyone who {{has paid}} the entry fee to visit Shakespeare's Birthplace on Henley Street in Stratford-upon-Avon—and {{there are some}} 700, 000 a year who do so—might be forgiven for taking the {{authenticity}} of the building for granted. The house, as the official guidebooks state, was purchased by Shakespeare's father, John Shakespeare, in two stages in 1556 and 1575, and William was born and brought up there. The street itself might have changed through the centuries—it is now largely populated by gift and tea shops—but it is easy to imagine little Will playing in the garden of this ancient structure, sitting in the inglenook in the kitchen, or reaching up to turn the Gothic handles on the weathered doors. In Shakespeare's Shrine Julia Thomas reveals just how fully the Birthplace that we visit today is a creation of the nineteenth century. Two hundred years after Shakespeare's death, the run-down house on Henley Street was home to a butcher shop and a pub. Saved from the threat of an ignominious sale to P. T. Barnum, it was purchased for the English nation in 1847 and given the picturesque half-timbered façade first seen in a fanciful 1769 engraving of the building. A perfect confluence of nationalism, nostalgia, and the easy access afforded by rail travel turned the house in which the Bard first drew breath into a major tourist attraction, one artifact in a sea of Shakespeare handkerchiefs, <b>eggcups,</b> and door-knockers. It was clear to Victorians on pilgrimage to Stratford just who Shakespeare was, how he lived, and to whom he belonged, Thomas writes, and the answers were inseparable from Victorian notions of class, domesticity, and national identity. In Shakespeare's Shrine she has written a richly documented and witty account of how both the Bard and the Warwickshire market town of his birth were turned into enduring symbols of British heritage—and of just how closely contemporary visitors to Stratford are {{following in the footsteps of}} their Victorian predecessors...|$|R
