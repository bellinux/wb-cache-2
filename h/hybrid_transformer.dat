50|$|In older audio systems (reliant on {{transformers}} {{and passive}} filter networks, {{and based on}} the telephone system), the source and load resistances were matched at 600 ohms. One reason for this was to maximize power transfer, as there were no amplifiers available that could restore lost signal. Another reason was to ensure correct operation of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>transformers</b> used at central exchange equipment to separate outgoing from incoming speech, so these could be amplified or fed to a four-wire circuit. Most modern audio circuits, on the other hand, use active amplification and filtering and can use voltage-bridging connections for greatest accuracy.

50|$|Belevitch {{obtained}} complete {{solutions for}} conference matrices for all values of n up to 38 and provided circuits {{for some of}} the smaller matrices. An ideal conference network is one where the loss of signal is entirely due to the signal being split between multiple conference subscriber ports. That is, there are no dissipation losses within the network. The network must contain ideal transformers only and no resistances. An n-port ideal conference network exists if and only if there exists a conference matrix of order n. For instance, a 3-port conference network can be constructed with the well-known <b>hybrid</b> <b>transformer</b> circuit used for 2-wire to 4-wire conversion in telephone handsets and line repeaters. However, there is no order 3 conference matrix and this circuit does not produce an ideal conference network. A resistance is needed for matching which dissipates signal, or else signal is lost through mismatch.As mentioned above, a necessary condition for a conference matrix to exist is that n&minus;1 must be the sum of two squares. Where {{there is more than one}} possible sum of two squares for n&minus;1 there will exist multiple essentially different solutions for the corresponding conference network. This situation occurs at n of 26 and 66. The networks are particularly simple when n&minus;1 is a perfect square (n = 2, 10, 26, …).|$|E

40|$|Frequency {{division}} duplex (FDD) cellular standards, like WCDMA and LTE, {{require the}} simultaneous {{operation of the}} transmitter and receiver while sharing the same antenna. A duplexer, currently implemented as two highly selective off-chip SAW filters separates the transmit and receive signals. A high isolation is required to avoid saturating the receiver and keep its noise and linearity requirements feasible. The need for high-Q resonators to implement these filters prohibits duplexer integration in a CMOS process. For each band of a modern multi-band transceiver, an off-chip duplexer is required. With over forty bands currently envisioned for mobile applications, the system cost and complexity rises significantly. Replacing the bank of off-chip duplexers with a single integrated tunable duplexer would enable a fully integrated and reconfigurable multiband transceiver. In this dissertation, the performance of <b>hybrid</b> <b>transformer</b> based integrated duplexer was significantly improved, making it suitable for reliable multiband operation. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>transformer</b> relies on electrical balance rather than frequency selectivity to achieve isolation, making duplexer integration in a CMOS process that lacks high-Q passives possible. Prior demonstrations of integrated <b>hybrid</b> <b>transformer</b> duplexers suffered from high insertion loss, poor common-mode isolation and isolation sensitivity to antenna mismatch. Novel solutions were reached in this research to solve most of these issues. Power recovery by using an RF-DC converter can effectively reduce the loss in the duplexer. A discrete prototype that achieves 60 % power recycling efficiency with constant input impedance over wide dynamic range was demonstrated. A differential implementation of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>transformer</b> allows for both high differential and common-mode isolation. Implemented in a 90 nm CMOS process, it maintains more than 60 dB of differential to common-mode isolation. And finally, an antenna impedance tracking loop was demonstrated to track any antenna impedance variation and maintain high isolation. Together with a novel high power balance network, that allows high isolation in both the transmit and receive bands, this 65 nm CMOS chip achieves an isolation of more than 50 dB in the transmit and receive bands, with an antenna VSWR within 2 : 1.

40|$|To {{accommodate}} {{the growing demand}} for wireless communications, {{new techniques are required}} to increase throughput of wireless networks. One technology aiming to increase the spectral efficiency of wireless devices is full duplex (FD) radios. These systems are capable of single carrier transmission and reception and could ideally double the spectral efficiency of future wireless systems. To make such systems a commercial reality, self-interference cancellation (SIC) techniques are required to suppress transmitter leakage into the receiver. This work investigates the level of SIC an integrated <b>hybrid</b> <b>transformer</b> can provide to make FD a reality. This work also includes an investigation in the SIC capabilities of an integrated <b>hybrid</b> <b>transformer</b> operating with a commercially available planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) and presents the design and evaluation of a prototype in UMC 180 nm RFCMOS. The prototype consists of a transformer, a tunable impedance and a LNA. Measurement results on this prototype showed isolation peaks of 80 dB, with an isolation band width of 1 MHz for 60 dB isolation and a Tx insertion loss, measured gain and NF of 3. 5 dB, 5 dB and 9 dB, respectively, while providing a IIP 3 of 0 dBm at the LNA output and a common-mode Tx isolation at the input of the LNA of 20 dB. The measurements also showed that the duplexer can be made self-tunable by using search algorithms that converge within 150 measurements. The relation between isolation and impedance resolution is derived and proven to be 6 dB every time the absolute difference between the impedances at both sides of the transformer is halved.

Multiple domain modeling, including the magnetic, thermal and magnetic aspects are applied in integrated simulations to ensure correct and complete dynamic behaviour under a range of environmental conditions. Improvements to the original Jiles-Atherton theory to more accurately model loop closure and dynamic thermal behaviour are proposed, developed and tested against measured results.

40|$|The {{onset of}} a {{ferroresonance}} phenomenon in power systems is commonly {{caused by the}} reconfiguration of a circuit into the one consisting of capacitances in series and interacting with transformers. The reconfiguration can be due to switching operations of de-energisation or the occurrence of a fault. Sustained ferroresonance without immediate mitigation measures can cause the transformers {{to stay in a}} state of saturation leading to excessive flux migrating to transformer tanks via internal accessories. The symptom of such an event can be unwanted humming noises being generated but the real threatening implication is the possible overheating which can result in premature ageing and failures. The main objective of this thesis is to determine the accurate models for transformers, transmission lines, circuit breakers and cables under transient studies, particularly for ferroresonance. The modeling accuracy is validated on a particular 400 / 275 kV transmission system by comparing the field test recorded voltage and current waveforms with the simulation results obtained using the models. In addition, a second case study involving another 400 / 275 kV transmission system with two transformers is performed to investigate the likelihood of the occurrence of sustained fundamental frequency ferroresonance mode and a possible quenching mechanism using the 13 kV tertiary connected reactor. A sensitivity study on transmission line lengths was also carriedout to determine the probability function of occurrence of various ferroresonance modes. To reproduce the sustained fundamental and the subharmonic ferroresonance modes, the simulation studies revealed that three main power system components which are involved in ferroresonance, i. e. the circuit breaker, the transmission line and the transformer, can be modeled using time-controlled switch, the PI, Bergeron or Marti line model, and the BCTRAN+ or <b>HYBRID</b> <b>transformer</b> model. Any combination of the above component models can be employed to accurately simulate the ferroresonance system circuit. Simulation studies also revealed that the key circuit parameter to initiate transformer ferroresonance in a transmission system is the circuit-to-circuit capacitance of a double-circuit overhead line. The extensive simulation studies also suggested that the ferroresonance phenomena are far more complex and sensitive to the minor changes of system parameters and circuit breaker operations. Adding with the non-linearity of transformer core characteristics, repeatability is not always guaranteed for simulation and experimental studies.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} estimating the impact of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging on overhead distribution transformers, based on detailed travel demand data and under several different schemes for mitigating overloads by shifting PEV charging times (smart charging). The paper also presents a new smart charging algorithm that manages PEV charging based on estimated transformer temperatures. We simulated the varied behavior of drivers from the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey, and transformer temperatures based an IEEE standard dynamic thermal model. Results are shown for Monte Carlo simulation of a 25 kVA overhead dis-tribution transformer, with ambient temperature data from hot and cold climate locations, for uncontrolled and several smart-charging scenarios. These results illustrate the substantial impact of ambient temperatures on distribution transformer aging, and indicate that temperature-based smart charging can dramatically reduce both the mean and variance in transformer aging without substantially reducing {{the frequency with which}} PEVs obtain a full charge. Finally, the results indicate that simple smart charging schemes, such as delaying charging until after midnight can actually increase, rather than decrease, transformer aging.
