6000|$|... "Why, yes, I {{have noticed}} that; but I have a vague sort of feeling just now {{that things are}} not going to get better.

6000|$|... "Oh, no, it isn't {{as bad as}} that. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> a bit dizzy, that's all. But I {{guess that}} will wear away, sooner or later. You see, I've been {{studying}} hard the last three days, {{trying to make up}} for lost time, and that is what's done it.
