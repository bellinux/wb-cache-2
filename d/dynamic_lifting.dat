50|$|Convective {{instability}} is also termed static instability, {{because the}} instability {{does not depend}} on the existing motion of the air; this contrasts with dynamic instability where instability is dependent on the motion of air and its associated effects such as <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under {{convective}} instability thermal mixing through convection {{in the form}} of warm air rising leads to the development of clouds and possibly precipitation or convective storms. Dynamic instability is produced through the horizontal movement of air and the physical forces it is subjected to such as the Coriolis force and pressure gradient force. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> and mixing produces cloud, precipitation and storms often on a synoptic scale.|$|E
50|$|Hydrofoil-An {{inverted}} T or an L-shaped keel/dagger board device, with hydro <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> ability, {{that extends}} vertically downwards under the hull. As boat speed increases the hull lifts {{completely out of}} the water so drag is reduced and hull speed dramatically increased. The AC 72 ft catamaran New Zealand reached 40 knots in 17 knots of wind with almost no heeling, using hydrofoils in September 2012. Sometimes called foiling or foil sailing. Most commonly used in 11 feet Moth sail boats. Also used in powerboats.|$|E

50|$|A frontal snowsquall is {{an intense}} frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes {{over as the}} wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but {{the motion of the}} line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front in situations where there are other contributing factors such as <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> from a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart.|$|E

5000|$|The {{atmosphere}} on the 28th {{was significantly}} more unstable as {{the approach of}} a low-pressure system from the northwest cooled the mid levels (and also caused <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting)</b> as instability continued to build in the capped, muggy environment, although the wind fields (strong, but out of the west-northwest and unidirectional) were not suitable for significant tornadic development. As {{a result of the}} very high low-level temperature and dew point, convective available potential energy (CAPE) values were in excess of 8,000 J/kg; generally, values of 1,500 J/kg are considered to be moderately unstable, whereas values of more than 4,000 J/kg are considered [...] "extreme". The lifted index (LI), the dominant estimate of instability used at the time, was also extreme. Generally, an LI value of -6 °C or below readily supports severe thunderstorm development, but during the day the LI value ranged from -12 °C to -14 °C. Such extreme instability can lead to explosive thunderstorm development, very strong updrafts, and modulates the updraft to better enable tornadogenesis.|$|E

Methods: Data were gathered for 84 outpatients. Psychophysical capacity (psychophysical static leg lift, psychophysical static trunk lift, and psychophysical <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> capacity), physical lifting capacity, perceived lifting effort, aerobic capacity and RMDQ were assessed. Associations between change in RMDQ and potential determinants were calculated. Variables associated with change in RMDQ were entered in a multivariate linear regression analysis (backward).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the intra- and interrater reliability of tests from the Ergo-Kit (EK) functional capacity evaluation method in adults without musculoskeletal complaints. DESIGN: Within-subjects design. SETTING: Academic {{medical center in}} The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven subjects without musculoskeletal complaints (15 men, 12 women). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seven EK tests (2 isometric, 3 <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting,</b> 2 manipulation tests) were each assessed 3 times (over 4 days), twice by 1 rater (R 1) and once by another rater (R 2). Intrarater reliability was calculated using the EK test scores assessed by R 1. Interrater reliability was calculated using the EK test scores assessed by both raters. Counterbalancing the rater order made possible the calculation of 2 interrater reliability levels (at time intervals of 4 and 8 d). All reliability levels were expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: Intrarater and interrater reliability (8 -d time interval) was high (ICC, >. 80) for the isometric lifting tests, moderate (ICC range,. 50 -. 80) for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> tests, and low (ICC,. 80), and it was moderate (ICC range,. 50 -. 80) for both manipulation tests.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{flexible}} approach for the efficient computation of the mixed volume of a tuple of polytopes. In order to compute the mixed volume, a mixed subdivision of the tuple of polytopes is needed, which can be obtained by embedding the polytopes in a higher-dimensional space, i. e., by lifting them. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> is opposed to the static approach. This means that one considers one point at a time and only fixes the value of the lifting function when the point really influences the mixed volume. Conservative lifting functions have been developed for this purpose. This provides us with a deterministic manipulation of the lifting for computing mixed volumes, which rules out randomness conditions. Cost estimates for the algorithm are given. The implications of <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> on polyhedral homotopy methods for the solution of polynomial systems are investigated and applications are presented. status: publishe...|$|E

Twenty healthy subjects performed <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> movements at 20 and 40 cycles per minute. Lyapunov exponents were calculated from the measured trunk kinematics to estimate stability. Complexity of torso dynamics required at least five embedded dimensions thereby indicating that torso dynamics requires more than the 3 -dimensions of movement for sufficient characterization. Dynamic stability is was greater in slow lifting movement than in fast movements. Asymmetric movements demonstrated greater multi-dimensional kinematic divergence than asymmetric movements.

40|$|Lifting in most {{industrial}} environments {{is performed}} on a smooth, level ground surface. There are, however, many outdoor work environments (e. g. agriculture and construction) that require manual material handling activities on variable grade ground surfaces. Quantifying the biomechanical response while lifting {{under these conditions}} may {{provide insight into the}} aetiology of lifting-related injury. The aim of the current study was to quantify the effect of laterally slanted ground surfaces on the biomechanical response. Ten subjects performed both isometric weight-holding tasks and <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> exertions (both using a 40 % of max load) while standing on a platform that was laterally tilted at 0, 10, 20 and 30 ° from horizontal. As the subject performed the isometric exertions, the electromyographic (EMG) activity of trunk extensors and knee extensors were collected and during the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lifting</b> tasks the whole body kinematics were collected. The whole body kinematics data were used in a dynamic biomechanical model to calculate the time-dependent moment about L 5 /S 1 and the time-dependent lateral forces acting on the body segments.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{acoustic}} resonance on the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lift</b> force {{acting on the}} central tube in square and normal triangle tube arrays is investigated experimentally. For each array pattern three different tube spacing ratios, corresponding to small, intermediate and large spacing ratios, are tested. The resonant sound field in the tube array is found to cause two main effects. First, it generates a “sound-induced” <b>dynamic</b> <b>lift</b> due to the resonant acoustic pressure distribution {{on the surface of}} the tube, and secondly, it synchronizes vorticity shedding from the tubes and thereby enhances the hydrodynamic lift force due to vortex shedding. The combined effect of these two unsteady lift forces depends on the phase shift between them, which is dictated by the frequency ratio of the acoustic mode to the natural vortex shedding frequencies. When the flow velocity is increased during the coincidence resonance range, the phase shift increases rapidly and therefore the effects of the two lift components change from reinforcing to counteracting each other. For the pre-coincidence lock-on range, the frequency ratio remains larger than unity and the two lift components always reinforce each other. Numerical simulations are also performed to compute the sound-induced lift force, and sound-enhancement coefficients are developed to estimate the effect of sound on the vortex shedding forces. The simulation and experimental results are implemented in a simplified design guide, which can be used to evaluate the <b>dynamic</b> <b>lift</b> forces acting on the tubes during acoustic resonances...|$|R

A relatively recent theory exploits their sparse structure by associating a point configuration to each polynomial system; however, it has so far mostly dealt with roots having nonzero coordinates. We shift attention to arbitrary affine roots, and improve upon the existing algorithms for counting them and computing them numerically. The one existing approach is too expensive in practice because of the usage of recursive liftings of the given point configuration. Instead, we define a single lifting which yields the desired count and defines a homotopy continuation for computing all solutions. We enhance the numerical stability of the homotopy by establishing lower bounds on the lifting values and prove that they can be derived dynamically to obtain the lowest possible values.

This allows the humanoid to lift up an object that could not be lifted up only by continuous force. However an impulsive force may make the humanoid unstable. Then, we propose to set the center of percussion (CoPn) of the whole system {{at the center of the}} support polygon of the humanoid when it lifts up the object.
