25|$|The {{ability of}} a curved mirror to form an image may have been known {{since the time of}} Euclid and had been {{extensively}} studied by Alhazen in the 11th century. Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> objective. Niccolò Zucchi, an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book Optica philosophia of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking into the mirror with a hand held concave lens but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the mirror, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the image.|$|E

40|$|We show that, {{when the}} <b>images</b> <b>formed,</b> the frontal {{part of the}} Shroud of Turin laid on a body in the same {{position}} as when the blood stains formed by contact. In other words, after the Shroud was laid on top of a body, no forceful flattening occurred before the <b>images</b> <b>formed.</b> Moreover, the argument that {{the top half of the}} Shroud could not have been draping a real body when the <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> – to avoid prominent image distortions – is shown to be incorrect. If a cloth is appropriately laid on the front part of a body, and a body <b>image</b> <b>forms</b> by a vertical projection on the cloth, no major image distortions occur. Small image distortions are to be expected, and indeed we can observe some on the Shroud. These two aspects – the Shroud was not forcefully flattened before the <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> and no major image distortions occur due to the way the Shroud was laid on the body – give the simplest scenario for the formation of the images. There is no need to claim a special event that would have flattened the Shroud before the <b>images</b> <b>formed.</b> Our analysis is based on precise length measurements on digital images, the blood stain locations, and geometry.

50|$|Low costIn optical {{microscopy}} systems, optical aberrations are traditionally corrected by combining lenses into {{a complex and}} costly <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> microscope objective. Furthermore, the narrow focal depth at high magnifications requires precision mechanics. The needed components for a DHM system are inexpensive optics and semiconductor components, such as a laser diode and an image sensor. The low component cost {{in combination with the}} auto focusing capabilities of DHM, make it possible to manufacture DHM systems for a very low cost.|$|E
50|$|Variations in {{surface texture}} {{directly}} influence {{the level of}} specular reflection. Objects with a smooth surface, i.e. highly polished or containing coatings with finely dispersed pigments, appear shiny to the eye due to {{a large amount of}} light being reflected in a specular direction whilst rough surfaces reflect no specular light as the light is scattered in other directions and therefore appears dull. The <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> qualities of these surfaces are much lower making any reflections appear blurred and distorted.|$|E

The pattern of the copper chloride crystals can be [...] "read" [...] based on the patterns of known samples.

40|$|We {{present an}} unusual <b>image</b> <b>form</b> of the GaAs(110) surface {{observed}} in cross-sectional {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} in UHV. It clearly shows the zig-zag row formed between the cations and anions in the top row of the GaAs(110) surface, as well as traces of the bottom row that lies between the top rows. It thereby closely resembles the true atomic lattice usually depicted by ball-and-stick models. We interpret the occurrence of this <b>image</b> <b>form</b> {{in terms of a}} chemical bond that forms between the apex of the tip and the nearest Ga atom in the top row of the sample surface. The formation of such a bond has recently been predicted theoretically. The results thus show that the tip-sample interaction, when it becomes significant, can give rise to entirely different and interesting <b>image</b> <b>form...</b>|$|R

40|$|If an {{optically}} active (chiral) {{sample is}} placed in a microscope and illuminated with circularly polarized light, an <b>image</b> can be <b>formed</b> that {{is related to the}} circular dichroism of each feature of the sample. A theoretical investigation has been done for the circular differential image obtained by subtracting the <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> under right- and left-circularly polarized light. Two types of differential images are possible: (i) dark-field <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> from light reflected or scattered by the sample and (ii) bright-field <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> from light transmitted through the sample. The sign and magnitude of each feature in a circular differential image strongly depend on the structure of the sample. The dark-field circular differential images are most sensitive to large features with dimensions similar to the wavelength of illumination whereas the bright-field images are most sensitive to the short-range molecular order. Applications of circular differential imaging may include clinical fingerprinting of normal and transformed cells and structural analysis of individual cellular components...|$|R
50|$|Further {{research}} has shown that ipRGCs project to different brain nuclei to control both non-image forming and <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> functions. These brain regions include the SCN, where input from ipRGCs is necessary to photoentrain circadian rhythms, and the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN), where input from ipRGCs control the pupillary light reflex. Hattar and colleagues conducted research that demonstrated that ipRGCs project to hypothalamic, thalamic, stratal, brainstem and limbic structures. Although ipRGCs were initially viewed as a uniform population, further research revealed that there are several subtypes with distinct morphology and physiology. Since 2011, Hattar's laboratory has contributed to these findings and has successfully distinguished subtypes of ipRGCs.|$|E
5000|$|The main <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> {{element in}} the {{iconoscope}} was a mica plate with a pattern of photosensitive granules deposited on the front using an electrically insulating glue. The granules were typically made of silver grains covered with caesium or caesium oxide. The back of the mica plate, opposite the granules, {{was covered with a}} thin film of silver. The separation between the silver {{on the back of the}} plate and the silver in the granules caused them to form individual capacitors, able to store electrical charge. These were typically deposited as small spots, creating pixels. The system as a whole was referred to as a [...] "mosaic".|$|E

Catadioptric mirrors similar to the Mangin are found in the Klevtsov-Cassegrain, Argunov-Cassegrain telescopes, and Ludwig Schupmann's Schupmann medial telescope. They are also used in compact catadioptric photographic lens designs that save on mass since aberration can be corrected by mirror itself.|$|E
