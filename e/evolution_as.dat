5|$|Marine mammals are aquatic mammals {{that rely}} on the ocean and other marine {{ecosystems}} for their existence. They include animals such as seals, whales, manatees, sea otters and polar bears.

25|$|In {{the second}} part of the 19th century, France's {{influence}} over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir. The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic <b>evolutions,</b> <b>as</b> well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.|$|R

5|$|Seabirds (also {{known as}} marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment. While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, {{behaviour}} and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent <b>evolution,</b> <b>as</b> the same environmental problems and feeding niches {{have resulted in}} similar adaptations. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene.|$|E

5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation. The modern evolutionary synthesis defines <b>evolution</b> <b>as</b> the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E
5|$|Asa Gray (November 18, 1810 – January 30, 1888) is {{considered}} the most important American botanist of the 19thcentury. His Darwiniana was considered an important explanation of how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive. Gray was adamant that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species. He was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation {{in the sense of}} its not allowing for <b>evolution,</b> <b>as</b> he felt evolution was guided by a Creator.|$|E
5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, On Growth and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. The central theme {{of the book is}} that biologists of its author's day overemphasized <b>evolution</b> <b>as</b> the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E

5|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community {{and much of the}} general public had accepted <b>evolution</b> <b>as</b> a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and {{it was not until the}} emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.|$|E
5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of <b>evolution</b> <b>as</b> we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E
5|$|However, in the 1920s Christian fundamentalists in the United States {{developed}} their literalist arguments against modernist theology into {{opposition to the}} teaching of evolution, with fears that Darwinism had led to German militarism and was a threat to religion and morality. This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting {{to the teaching of}} evolution in public schools. Although early objectors dismissed <b>evolution</b> <b>as</b> contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when the Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas in 1968 that forbidding the teaching of evolution on religious grounds violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E
