5|$|A {{second draft}} was {{finished}} by September. Captain Blumburtt, Chattar Lal, {{and the boy}} Maharaja originally had more crucial roles. A dogfight was deleted, {{as well as those}} who drank the Kali blood turned into zombies with physical superhuman abilities. During pre-production, the Temple of Death title was replaced with Temple of Doom. From March to April 1983, Huyck and Katz simultaneously performed rewrites for a <b>final</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>script.</b>|$|E

It contains the <b>final</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>script,</b> pictures from the film and additional illustrations by Stephen Player. It was published by Gollancz.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Mankiewicz's {{personal}} {{copy of the}} Citizen Kane {{script was}} auctioned at Christie's. The leather-bound volume included the <b>final</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>script</b> and a carbon copy of American that bore handwritten annotations—purportedly made by Hearst's lawyers, who {{were said to have}} obtained it in the manner described by Kael in [...] "Raising Kane". Estimated to bring $70,000 to $90,000, it sold for a record $231,000.|$|E
50|$|Wallace {{created the}} {{beauty and the beast}} theme, the overall plot {{structure}} and outline, many of the key characters, and many of the key events or episodes in the story. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack were thrilled with the screenplay and were ready to begin based on Wallace's diary notes in My Hollywood Diary (1932). Wallace's untimely death, however, cheated him of the recognition he deserved for creating the story. Wallace's 110 page script was merely the first rough draft, not a <b>final</b> and completed <b>shooting</b> <b>script.</b>|$|R

500|$|Goldman also {{approached}} Sorkin {{with a story}} premise, which Sorkin {{developed into}} the script for Malice. Goldman oversaw the project as creative consultant while Sorkin wrote the first two drafts. However, {{he had to leave}} the project to finish up the script for A Few Good Men, so screenwriter Scott Frank stepped in and wrote two drafts of the Malice screenplay. When production on A Few Good Men wrapped up, Sorkin took over and resumed working on the Malice right through the <b>final</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>script.</b> Harold Becker directed the film, a medical thriller released in 1993, which starred Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin. Malice had mixed reviews. Vincent Canby in The New York Times described the film as [...] "deviously entertaining from its start through its finish". Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars, and Peter Travers in a 2000 Rolling Stone review summarized it as having [...] "suspense but no staying power".|$|E
500|$|With most of {{the plot}} in place, Shusett and O'Bannon {{presented}} their script to several studios, pitching it as [...] "Jaws in space." [...] They {{were on the verge}} of signing a deal with Roger Corman's studio when a friend offered to find them a better deal and passed the script on to Gordon Carroll, David Giler, and Walter Hill, who had formed a production company called Brandywine with ties to 20th Century Fox. O'Bannon and Shusett signed a deal with Brandywine, but Hill and Giler were not satisfied with the script and made numerous rewrites and revisions. This caused tension with O'Bannon and Shusett, since Hill and Giler had very little experience with science fiction; according to Shusett, [...] "They weren't good at making it better, or, in fact, at not making it even worse." [...] O'Bannon believed that Hill and Giler were attempting to justify taking his name off of the script and claiming his and Shusett's work as their own. Hill and Giler did add some substantial elements to the story, however, including the android character Ash—which O'Bannon felt was an unnecessary subplot but which Shusett later described as [...] "one of the best things in the movie...That whole idea and scenario was theirs." [...] Hill and Giler went through eight drafts of the script in total, concentrating largely on the Ash subplot but also making the dialogue more natural and trimming some sequences set on the alien planetoid. Despite the fact that the <b>final</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>script</b> was written by Hill and Giler, the Writers Guild of America awarded O'Bannon sole credit for the screenplay.|$|E
500|$|The {{first time}} {{the idea of a}} special video-only anniversary special was mooted was in a memo Nathan-Turner wrote to Head of Video Production Penny Mills on 18 February 1992. With Tom Baker not averse to {{appearing}} should conditions be met, serious thought was given to an original production and there was a meeting in June 1992 to discuss the concept of the special; by 21 July 1992 writer Adrian Rigelsford (later joined by Joanna McCaul) had completed an initial outline for the story entitled Timeflyers. Shortly afterwards the project was given the cover name The Environment Roadshow. A production office was opened for the project {{in the first week of}} September 1992 with shooting planned for January–February 1993. The script was sent to Peter Cregeen on 22 March 1993, indicating at the same time that Graeme Harper was being looked at as a potential director for the special. However, issues with budget plagued the production and shooting slipped to taking place November–December 1993 with a final delivery date of 14 March 1994. Around mid-May Cregeen indicated that he'd like to see the special broadcast on the BBC in November 1993. By the end of May 1993, the project was now being referred to as The Dark Dimension before a new working title of Lost in the Dark Dimension was settled on. Harper was contracted as the director of the special in June 1993 and intended Rik Mayall to play the part of the villain, Hawkspur. What was hoped to be the <b>final</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>script</b> was completed on 21 June 1993 and with the production now aimed for broadcast than a direct-to-video release, Alan Yentob gave the special the green light with the plan to have the completed project delivered by 27 November 1993 but by the start of July 1993, budget issues continued to plague the production and on 9 July 1993 the project was officially cancelled. With the project sunk, the thirtieth anniversary was instead celebrated with the light-hearted Children in Need charity special Dimensions in Time and the documentary 30 Years in the TARDIS. The BBC press release had hinted at the plot with the following: ...|$|E

2500|$|Eichinger and screenwriter Andrew Birkin {{began to}} write a draft script. Eichinger says that their biggest problem was a {{narrative}} one, [...] "The main character doesn't express himself. A novelist can use narrative to compensate for this; that's not possible in film. An audience can usually only get a feeling for a character if the character speaks", said Eichinger. Eichinger said, [...] "With material like this {{it is especially important}} for a director {{to get involved in the}} script." [...] Eichinger met with a number of directors but felt that only Tom Tykwer was really in tune with the material. In 2003, Tykwer was invited to join Eichinger and Birkin in adapting the novel. The screenplay went through over 20 revisions to get to the <b>final</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>script.</b> The three writers worked hard to create a faithful adaptation that captured the atmosphere and climate of the novel, yet, at the same time, have a specific and individual perspective, in terms of the story and the main character.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Testament of Arkadia" [...] is the twenty-fourth {{and final}} {{episode of the}} first series of Space: 1999.

50|$|Apart from {{a couple}} of minor scenes, two scenes from the first script {{versions}} {{were not included in the}} <b>final</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>script.</b> First, a scene showing a rehearsal for the May Day parade showing tanks rolling along the street. In the <b>final</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>script</b> this scene is left out in favor of the demolition scene. This scene was intended to reference the war experience of Sergey. The second change involved the final scene of the film. In an earlier variant Sasha waits for Sergey to arrive at work. Sergey ignores Sasha, until Sasha climbs on the steamroller. An alarm clock rings, revealing this to be a dream.|$|E
