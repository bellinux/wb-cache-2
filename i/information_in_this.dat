25|$|A {{variety of}} {{scientific}} {{studies have found}} lateralization of emotions. FMRI and lesion studies have shown asymmetrical activation of brain regions while thinking of emotions, responding to extreme emotional stimuli, and viewing emotional situations. Processing and production of facial expressions also appear to be asymmetric in nature. Many theories of lateralization have been proposed {{and some of those}} specific to emotions. Please keep in mind that most of the <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> article is theoretical and scientists are still trying to understand emotion and emotional lateralization. Also, some of the evidence is contradictory. Many brain regions are interconnected and the input and output of any given region may come from and go to many different regions.|$|E
25|$|Necessarily {{much of the}} <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> large {{compilation}} {{varies in}} value. The Panarion reflects the character of Epiphanius and his method of working. Sometimes, his intense passion prevents him from inquiring carefully into the doctrines he opposes. Thus, on his own avowal (Haer., lxxi), he speaks of Apollinarianism on hearsay. At Constantinople, he had to acknowledge to the Origenist monks, whom he opposed, {{that he was not}} acquainted with either their school or their books, and that he only spoke from hearsay (Sozomen, Hist. eccl., VIII, xl). There is, however, much information not found elsewhere. Chapters devoted only to the doctrinal refutation of heresies are rare. As an apologist, Epiphanius appeared generally weak to Photius.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} poetic legacy {{received by}} Yuan dynasty poets was {{the works of}} the poets of the Song dynasty, which together with the Jin dynasty in the north, preceded the Yuan dynasty. An example of this cultural legacy {{can be seen in the}} case of Yuan Haowen (1190-1257), a northern writer and poet who served under the Jin administration, but went into retirement at the advent of its fall to the Mongols. One example of poetic continuity from the Song to the Yuan period is the case of Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322), who although a member of the royal family of the Song dynasty, both produced poetry and became rector of the Hanlin Academy under the Yuan. Although older forms of verse continued to be practiced, such as the shi form, most of innovative developments involved the fixed-rhythm Chinese poetry forms. However, the political and social disruptions associated with the founding of the Yuan dynasty have resulted in a relative lack in terms of surviving material to provide detailed <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> regard. Some information, however is available through knowledge of contemporary theater and the surviving associated documents.|$|E
25|$|Although place cells {{primarily}} rely on visuospatial input, {{some studies}} suggest that olfactory input may {{also play a role}} in generating and recalling place fields. Relatively {{little is known about the}} interaction between place cells and non-visual sensory cues, but preliminary studies have shown that non-visual sensory input may have supplementary role in place field formation. A study by Save et al. found that olfactory information can be used to compensate for a loss of visual <b>information.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> study, place fields in subjects exposed to an environment with no light and no olfactory signals were unstable; the position of the place field shifted abruptly and some of the constituent place cells stopped firing entirely. However, place cells in subjects exposed to a dark environment with olfactory signals remained stable despite a lack of visual cues. An additional study by Zhang et al. examined how the hippocampus uses olfactory signals to create and recall place fields. Similar to the Save et al. study, this study exposed subjects to an environment with a series of odors but no visual or auditory information. Place fields remained stable and even adapted to the rotation of the pattern of olfactory signals. Furthermore, the place fields would remap entirely when the odors were moved randomly. This suggests that place cells not only utilize olfactory information to generate place fields, but also use olfactory information to orient place fields during movement.|$|E
