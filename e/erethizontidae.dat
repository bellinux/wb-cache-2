50|$|The bristle-spined rat, Chaetomys subspinosus, has {{sometimes}} been classified in Echimyidae, although traditionally considered {{a member of the}} New World porcupine family <b>Erethizontidae.</b> The classification with Echimyidae is supported by similarities in the cheek teeth structure.Like all living caviomorphs except erethizontids, Chaetomys seems to lack posterior carotid foramina, and together with all echimyids and in contrast to all other caviomorphs, Chaetomys seems to retain the otherwise deciduous premolars (dP4).Some of these characters have been, however, reinterpreted as evidence for affinities between Chaetomys and the Erethizontidae.A molecular phylogeny based on the mitochondrial gene coding for cytochrome b combined to karyological evidence actually suggests Chaetomys is more closely related to the <b>Erethizontidae</b> than to the Echimyidae, although it branches as the sister group {{to the rest of the}} <b>Erethizontidae.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The thin-spined porcupine, {{also known}} as the bristle-spined rat, Chaetomys subspinosus (Olfers, 1818), the only member of its genus, figures among Brazilian {{endangered}} species. In addition to being threatened, it is poorly known, and even its taxonomic status at the family level has long been controversial. The genus Chaetomys was originally regarded as a porcupine in the family <b>Erethizontidae,</b> but some authors classified it as a spiny-rat in the family Echimyidae. Although the dispute seems to be settled in favor of the erethizontid advocates, further discussion of its affinities should be based on a phylogenetic framework. In the present study, we used nucleotide-sequence data from the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene and karyotypic information to address this issue. Our molecular analyses included one individual of Chaetomys subspinosus from the state of Bahia in northeastern Brazil, and other hystricognaths. Results All topologies recovered in our molecular phylogenetic analyses strongly supported Chaetomys subspinosus as a sister clade of the erethizontids. Cytogenetically, Chaetomys subspinosus showed 2 n = 52 and FN = 76. Although the sexual pair could not be identified, we assumed that the X chromosome is biarmed. The karyotype included 13 large to medium metacentric and submetacentric chromosome pairs, one small subtelocentric pair, and 12 small acrocentric pairs. The subtelocentric pair 14 had a terminal secondary constriction in the short arm, corresponding to the nucleolar organizer region (Ag-NOR), similar to the erethizontid Sphiggurus villosus, 2 n = 42 and FN = 76, and different from the echimyids, in which the secondary constriction is interstitial. Conclusion Both molecular phylogenies and karyotypical evidence indicated that Chaetomys is closely related to the <b>Erethizontidae</b> rather than to the Echimyidae, although in a basal position relative {{to the rest of the}} <b>Erethizontidae.</b> The high levels of molecular and morphological divergence suggest that Chaetomys belongs to an early radiation of the <b>Erethizontidae</b> that may have occurred in the Early Miocene, and should be assigned to its own subfamily, the Chaetomyinae. </p...|$|E
