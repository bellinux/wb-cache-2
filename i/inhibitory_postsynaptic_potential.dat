40|$|URL] {{present study}} was {{designed}} to elucidate the spinal interneuronal mechanisms of motor inhibition evoked by stimulating the medullary reticular formation. Two questions were addressed. First, whether there is a parallel motor inhibition to motoneurons and to interneurons in reflex pathways. Second, whether the inhibition is mediated by interneurons interposed in known reflex pathways. We recorded the intracellular activity of hindlimb motoneurons in decerebrate cats and examined the effects of medullary stimulation on these neurons and on interneuronal transmission in reflex pathways to them. Stimuli (three pulses at 10 – 60 μA and 1 – 10 ms intervals) delivered to the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis evoked <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> in α-motoneurons (n= 147) and γ-motoneurons (n= 5) with both early and late latencies. The early <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> were observed in 66. 4 % of the motoneurons and had a latency of 4. 0 – 5. 5 ms with a segmental delay of more than 1. 4 ms. The late <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> were observed in 98. 0 % of the motoneurons and had a latency of 30 – 35 ms, with a peak latency of 50 – 60 ms. Both types of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> were evoked through fibers descending in the ventrolateral quadrant. The <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> were not influenced by recurrent inhibitory pathways, but both types were greatly attenuated by volleys in flexor reflex afferents. Conditioning medullary stimulation, which was subthreshold to evoke <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> in the motoneurons, neither evoked primary afferent depolarization of dorsal roots nor reduced the input resistance of the motoneurons. However, the conditioning stimulation often facilitated non-reciprocal group I inhibitory pathways (Ib inhibitory pathways) to the motoneurons in early (< 20 ms) and late (30 – 80 ms) periods. In contrast, it attenuated test <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> evoked through reciprocal Ia inhibitory pathways, and excitatory and inhibitory pathways from flexor reflex afferent and recurrent inhibitory pathways. The inhibitory effects were observed in both early and late periods. The present results provide new information about a parallel inhibitory process from the medullary reticular formation that produces a generalized motor inhibition by acting on α- and γ-motoneurons, and on interneurons in reflex pathways. Interneurons receiving inhibition from flexor reflex afferents and a group of Ib interneurons may mediate the inhibitory effects upon motoneurons...|$|R

[...] Visually guided behaviors may be regulated through the inhibitory striato-tegmental pathway found in amphibians in a study performed at the Baylor College of Medicine and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The basal ganglia in amphibians {{is very important in}} receiving visual, auditory, olfactory, and mechansensory inputs; the disinhibitory striato-protecto-tectal pathway is important in prey-catching behaviors of amphibians.

5000|$|These receptors {{are also}} {{associated}} with Na+ and K+ channels.

50|$|The {{size of the}} neuron {{can also}} affect the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential.</b> Simple {{temporal}} summation of postsynaptic potentials occurs in smaller neurons, whereas in larger neurons larger numbers of synapses and ionotropic receptors {{as well as a}} longer distance from the synapse to the soma enables the prolongation of interactions between neurons.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>inhibitory</b> <b>post{{synaptic}}</b> <b>potential</b> (IPSP) {{is a kind}} of synaptic {{potential that}} makes a postsynaptic neuron less likely to generate an action potential. The opposite of an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> is an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which is a synaptic potential that makes a postsynaptic neuron more likely to generate an action potential. IPSPs can take place at all chemical synapses, which use the secretion of neurotransmitters to create cell to cell signalling. Inhibitory presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters that then bind to the postsynaptic receptors; this induces a change in the permeability of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane to particular ions. An electric current that changes the postsynaptic membrane potential to create a more negative postsynaptic potential is generated, i.e. the postsynaptic membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting membrane potential, and this is called hyperpolarisation. In order for an action potential to be generated, depolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane needs to occur, where the membrane potential becomes more positive than resting membrane potential. Therefore, hyperpolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane makes it less likely for depolarisation to sufficiently occur to generate an action potential in the postsynaptic neurone.|$|E

50|$|If {{a signal}} from the {{presynaptic}} neuron is inhibitory, inhibitory neurotransmitters, normally GABA will be released into the synapse. This neurotransmitter causes an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> in the postsynaptic neuron. This response will cause the postsynaptic neuron to become permeable to chloride ions, making the membrane potential of the cell negative; a negative membrane potential {{makes it more difficult}} for the cell to fire an action potential and prevents any signal from being passed on through the neuron.

Ivermectin is thought to irreversibly activate these channel receptors in the worm, eventually causing an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential.</b> The chance of a future action potential occurring in synapses between neurons decreases and the nematodes experience flaccid paralysis followed by death.|$|E
50|$|Postsynaptic depolarizations {{can either}} {{transmit}} excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters.

Alternatively, inhibitory vesicles stimulate postsynaptic receptors such as to allow Cl− ions to enter the cell or K+ ions to leave the cell, which results in an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> (IPSP). If the EPSP is dominant, the threshold of excitation in the postynaptic neuron may be reached, resulting in the generation of an action potential in the neuron(s) in turn postsynaptic to it, propagating the signal.|$|E
50|$|Synaptic noise {{refers to}} the {{constant}} bombardment of synaptic activity in neurons. This occurs {{in the background of}} a cell when potentials are produced without the nerve stimulation of an action potential, and are due to the inherently random nature of synapses. These random potentials have similar time courses as excitatory <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (EPSPs) and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (IPSPs), yet they lead to variable neuronal responses. The variability is due to differences in the discharge times of action potentials.|$|R
40|$|Postsynaptic {{inhibition}} of somatic motoneurons underlies the atonia of active sleep. This inhibitory control depends, in large measure, on the bombardment of motoneurons during active sleep by a unique class of large-amplitude <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (IPSPs). These potentials are present only during this behavioral state and have therefore been designated as active sleep-specific IPSPs (AS-IPSPs). The {{present study was}} concerned with determining the neurotransmitter that mediates these AS-IPSPs. Lumbar motoneurons were recorded intracellularly during quiet and active sleep in intact, undrugged, normally respiring cats. The frequency and waveform parameters of the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> recorded from these motoneurons were examined following the microiontophoretic juxtacellular administration of strychnine (a glycine receptor antagonist) and picrotoxin and bicuculline (GABA receptor antagonists). Microiontophoretically applied strychnine abolished the AS-IPSPs {{and a majority of}} smaller-amplitude IPSPs. Neither picrotoxin nor bicuculline modified the frequency, amplitude, or rising phase of the AS-IPSPs or the smaller-amplitude IPSPs. We conclude that the <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>inhibitory</b> drive that impinges on motoneurons during active sleep is principally mediated by glycine or a glycinergic substance. During the state of active sleep, lumbar motoneurons receive a sustained barrage of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potentials</b> (IPSPs; Morales et al., 1987). These IPSPs, which contribute to the suppression of motoneuron activity that occurs during this behavioral state, were divided into 2 groups.

50|$|Neurotransmitters are {{released}} into a synapse in packaged vesicles called quanta. One quantum generates {{what is known}} as a miniature end plate potential (MEPP) which is the smallest amount of stimulation that one neuron can send to another neuron. Quantal release is the mechanism by which most traditional endogenous neurotransmitters are transmitted throughout the body. The aggregate sum of many MEPPs is known as an end plate potential (EPP). A normal end plate potential usually causes the postsynaptic neuron to reach its threshold of excitation and elicit an action potential. Electrical synapses do not use quantal neurotransmitter release and instead use gap junctions between neurons to send current flows between neurons. The goal of any synapse is to produce either an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>postsynaptic</b> <b>potential</b> (IPSP), which generate or repress the expression, respectively, of an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. It is estimated that an action potential will trigger the release of approximately 20% of an axon terminal's neurotransmitter load.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{research}} is being {{performed in the}} field of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, which deals with reward, and the substantia nigra, which is involved with movement and motivation.
