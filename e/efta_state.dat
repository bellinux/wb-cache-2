50|$|After the 1970s Europe {{experienced}} a downturn {{which led to}} leaders launching of the Single European Act which set to create a single market by 1992. The effect of this was that <b>EFTA</b> <b>states</b> found it harder to export to the EEC and businesses (including large EFTA corporations such as Volvo) wished to relocate within the new single market making the downturn worse for <b>EFTA.</b> <b>EFTA</b> <b>states</b> began to discuss closer links with the EEC despite its domestic unpopularity.|$|R
40|$|In the {{relationship}} between the European Union and the <b>EFTA</b> <b>States</b> nearly all attention has recently been drawn to the enlargement negotiations of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria, which were recently successfully concluded. However, it should not be forgotten that the accession of the abovementioned <b>EFTA</b> <b>States</b> still depends on the outcome of their respective referenda relating to the enlargement issue. The agreement establishing the European Economic Area (EEA), which entered into force on 1 January 1994, is at present the zenith of cooperation between the European Union and the <b>EFTA</b> <b>States</b> and the EEA Agreement could remain of importance if the outcome of the referenda in {{one or more of the}} <b>EFTA</b> <b>States</b> is negative. It should be mentioned that, besides Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria, Iceland is also among the <b>EFTA</b> <b>States</b> which are party to the EEA Agreement. Liechtenstein has postponed its ratification due to its close relations with Switzerland which was unable to ratify following its referendum in 1992. The EEA Agreement deserves further attention due to the possibility that it may serve as a model for the European Union in later negotiations with other countries, especially with Eastern European countries which most likely will not be able to accede as full members for some years to come but may like to be associated with the Community within a multilateral and institutionalized framework. The purpose of this article is to present the EFTA Court and to give an introduction 2 to the organization, composition and competences of the Court and {{the relationship}} to the Court of Justice of the European Communities (abbreviated to CJEC in the following) ...|$|R
5000|$|In Joined Cases E-3/13 and E-20/13 Fred Olsen, {{concerning}} {{the application of}} Norwegian CFC rules {{to the members of}} a family for whose benefit a trust had been established in Liechtenstein as a holding entity for shares in several companies, the Court held, first, that the right of establishment, provided for in Articles 31 to 34 EEA, is granted both to natural persons who are nationals of an EEA State and to legal entities (“companies or firms”), no matter whether they have legal personality or not, provided they have been formed in accordance with the law of an EU State or an <b>EFTA</b> <b>State</b> and have their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the territory of the Contracting Parties. Secondly, the Court also recognised that the prevention of tax avoidance may provide a justification, but only where the measures taken target wholly artificial arrangements which do not reflect economic reality. The assessment of the facts in that respect was a matter for the national court. Accordingly, such a tax measure must not be applied where it is proven, on the basis of objective factors which are ascertainable by third parties, that despite the existence of tax motives a CFC is actually established in the host EEA State and carries on genuine economic activities, which take effect (sc. somewhere) in the EEA.|$|E
5000|$|In Case E-8/13, Abelia, the Court {{dismissed}} {{an action}} brought by Abelia, a trade and employers association {{that is part}} of Næringslivets Hovedorganisasjon (“NHO”), the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise. The applicant sought the annulment of ESA Decision No 160/13/COL of 24 April 2013 where ESA concluded, without initiating the formal investigation procedure, that the contested provisions of the Norwegian VAT Act and VAT Compensation Act did not have the effect of granting State aid, within the meaning of Article 61(1) EEA, to public schools or the lessors of premises to public schools. Besides the applicant’s legal interest in bringing the action for annulment, which led to the dismissal, the Court {{had to deal with the}} situation of the applicant’s counsel in light of Article 17(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which parties other than any <b>EFTA</b> <b>State,</b> ESA, the European Union and the Commission must be represented by a lawyer. The Court examined the relationship between the applicant and the two lawyers that signed the application. The independence of one lawyer was not found to be affected by her position as head of the Business Legislation Department of NHO as the Court had not been provided with information demonstrating that the interests of NHO were largely the same as those of the applicant. The other lawyer was also deemed sufficiently independent from the applicant as an employee of an independent law firm, from where she continued to receive her salary, regardless of a contract between NHO and the law firm for the temporary provision of her services. The applicant was thus found to be properly represented before the Court, showing that the right of audience of in-house counsel must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
30|$|Despite {{considerable}} restrictions to {{the movement}} of people, for nationals of an EU- 2513 or <b>EFTA,</b> <b>state</b> regulations are less restrictive because the free-movement agreement between the European Union and Switzerland applies. This arrangement is supposed to guarantee identical living and employment conditions for foreigners and national citizens of a contracting party. The provision of services is only subject to registration {{as long as the}} stay does not exceed 90  days in a calendar year. However, stays of more than 90  days are subject to authorization by cantonal administration. Authorization is regulated by legal quotas and requires labor market tests. Additionally, foreigners have to demonstrate sufficient professional and personal qualification (State Secretariat for Migration 2015).|$|E
40|$|For over 15 years, {{the reports}} of the EEA Agreement’s {{imminent}} demise {{have proven to be}} greatly exaggerated. In this article it is argued that {{a great deal of the}} credit for this accomplishment is due to the EFTA Court. Through a distinctly dynamic approach to the Agreement, the EFTA Court has been able to convince an initially sceptical ECJ that the goal of extending the internal market to include the <b>EFTA</b> <b>States</b> is actually achievable. For the <b>EFTA</b> <b>States,</b> the consequence is a more ‘supranational’ EEA Agreement than originally conceived. Further, it is shown that the EFTA Court appears, in hard cases, to lean even further towards teleological (ie integrationist) interpretation than the ECJ. It is suggested that this may be due to to structural imbalances between the two EEA courts, the EFTA Court’s desire to prove its independence from the <b>EFTA</b> <b>States</b> and its quest for recognition from the ECJ...|$|R

40|$|Association {{agreements}} concluded by the EU and non-EU States often contain {{provisions that}} are worded similarly, or even identically, as EU law. This {{is true in}} particular where an agreement provides for the association of the non-EU State with the Union’s internal market, i. e. provisions that deal with the free movement of goods, persons, services and/or capital. However, under the case-law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the same or similar wording does not necessarily lead to the same interpretation. Rather, interpretation has to be context-related. The  contribution discusses the role of this so-called Polydor principle in relation to three association systems, namely {{the law of the}} European Economic Area (EEA), which links the 28 EU Member States with the three EEA/EFTA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, further the Ankara Association Law between the EU and Turkey and, finally, Treaties concluded by the EU and Switzerland, which is the fourth <b>EFTA</b> <b>State</b> but does not participate in the EEA...|$|E
40|$|The role of parliaments and parliamentarians {{has been}} {{at the core of the}} discussions on the 'democratic deficit' in the EU. From being the 'losers' of European integration, {{representative}} institutions have during the last decade played an increasingly more prominent role in governing Europe. In the article, we argue that the parliamentary dynamism in the EU has no parallel in the EEA or the EFTA States. We have not seen a strengthening of parliamentary institutions in the EEA structures, and the national parliaments of the EFTA Member States have not made adjustments enabling them to get a stronger role in governing European affairs. There is thus an increasing gap between the EU and the EEA regarding parliamentary involvement. The article examines the process of gradually strengthening the parliaments in the EU. It documents the limited formal and actual role played by parliaments and parliamentarians in the EEA construction. In addition, it compares the activities of a national parliament in an EU Member State with those of a parliament in an <b>EFTA</b> <b>State.</b> We conclude by arguing that the new constitution is likely to further increase the gap between parliamentary involvement in the EU and EFTA.

40|$|In this paper, the {{expression}} “neighbourhood policy” of the European Union (EU) is understood {{in a broad}} way which includes {{the members of the}} European Free Trade Association (EFTA) contracting parties to the European Economic Area (EEA), the <b>EFTA</b> <b>State</b> Switzerland, candidate states, the countries of the European Neighbour-hood Policy (ENP), and Russia. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the centre of gravity in the judicial dimension of this policy. The innermost circle of integration after the EU itself comprises the EFTA States who are party to the European Economic Area. With the EFTA Court, they have their own common court. The existence of two courts – the ECJ and the EFTA Court – raises the question of homogeneity of the case law. The EEA homogeneity rules resemble the ones of the Lugano Convention. The EFTA Court is basically obliged to follow or take into account relevant ECJ case law. But even if the ECJ has gone first, there may be constellations where the EFTA Court comes to the conclusion that it must go its own way. Such constellations may be given if there is new scientific evidence, if the ECJ has left certain questions open, where there is relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights or where, in light of the specific circumstances of the case, there is room for “creative homogeneity”. However, in the majority of its cases the EFTA Court is faced with novel legal questions. In such cases, the ECJ, its Advocates General and the Court of First Instance make reference to the EFTA Court’s case law. The question may be posed whether the EEA could {{serve as a model for}} other regional associations. For the ENP states, candidate States and Russia this is hard to imagine. Their courts will to varying degrees look to the ECJ when giving interpretation to the relevant agreements. The Swiss Government is – at least for the time being – unwilling to make a second attempt to join the EEA. The European Commission has therefore proposed to the Swiss to dock their sectoral agreements with the EU to the institutions of the EFTA pillar, the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) and the EFTA Court. Switzerland would then negotiate the right to nominate a member of the ESA College and of the EFTA Court. The Swiss Government has, however, opted for another model. Swiss courts would continue to look to the ECJ, as they did in the past, and conflicts should also in the future be resolved by diplomatic means. But the ECJ would play a decisive role in dispute settlement. It would, upon unilateral request of one side, give an “authoritative” interpretation of EU law as incorporated into the relevant bilateral agreement. In a “Non-Paper” which was drafted by the chief negotiators, the interpretations of the ECJ are even characterised as binding. The decision-making power would, however, remain with the Joint Committees where Switzerland could say no. The Swiss Government assumes that after a negative decision by the ECJ it would be able to negotiate a compromise solution with the Commission without the ECJ being able to express itself on the outcome. The Government has therefore not tried to emphasise that the ECJ would not be a foreign court. Whether the ECJ would accept its intended role, is an open question. And if it would, the Swiss Government would have to explain to its voters that Switzerland retains the freedom to disregard such a binding decision and that for this reason the ECJ is not only no foreign court, but no adjudicating court at all...|$|E
