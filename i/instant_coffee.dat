5|$|American {{emergency}} rations in World War I {{consisted of}} a quarter ounce (7 grams) packet of double-strength <b>instant</b> <b>coffee,</b> packed one per man in containers with multiple types of foods meant for twenty-four men. <b>Instant</b> <b>coffee</b> was also used in reserve rations and trench rations. During World War II, the U.S. military again relied on Washington, but this time {{on an equal footing}} with the other major <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> brands that had emerged in the interwar period, most notably Nescafé, as well as the new companies formed to meet a renewed military demand.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} amount and {{estimated}} daily mineral intake of nine elements (Ca, Mg, K, Na, P, Fe, Mn, Cr and Ni) in commercial <b>instant</b> <b>coffees</b> and coffee substitutes (n = 49). Elements were quantified by high-resolution continuum source flame (HR-CS-FAAS) and graphite furnace (HR-CS-GFAAS) atomic absorption spectrometry, while phosphorous was evaluated by a standard vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method. <b>Instant</b> <b>coffees</b> and coffee substitutes are rich in K, Mg and P (> 100 mg/ 100 g dw), contain Na, Ca and Fe in moderate amounts (> 1 mg/ 100 g), and trace levels of Cr and Ni. Among the samples analysed, plain <b>instant</b> <b>coffees</b> are richer in minerals (p < 0. 001), except for Na and Cr. Blends of coffee substitutes (barley, malt, chicory and rye) with coffee (20 – 66 %) present intermediate amounts, while lower quantities are found in substitutes without coffee, particularly in barley. From a nutritional point of view {{the results indicate that}} the mean ingestion of two instant beverages per day (total of 4 g instant powder), either with or without coffee, cannot be regarded as important sources of minerals to the human diet, although providing a supplementation of some minerals, particularly Mg and Mn in <b>instant</b> <b>coffees.</b> Additionally, and for authentication purposes, the correlations observed between some elements and the coffee percentage in the blends, with particular significance for Mg amounts, provides a potential tool for the estimation of coffee in substitute blends...|$|R

5|$|Washington {{tried his}} hand at cattle {{ranching}} in Guatemala in 1906 or 1907 while, in the meantime, developed his <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> process. Washington returned to New York City after only {{a period of about}} a year in Guatemala, and then began pursuing the main part of his career in coffee manufacture. His father remained in Guatemala and died there in 1912.|$|E
5|$|An {{emigrant}} {{from his}} native Belgium, he arrived in the New York area in 1897 and dabbled in several technical fields before hitting upon <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> manufacture during a sojourn in Central America in 1906 or 1907. He began selling his coffee in 1909 and founded a company to manufacture it in 1910. Based in New York and New Jersey, his company prospered and became an important military supplier during World War I. The company's products were also advertised in New York newspapers and on the radio. The success of his company made Washington wealthy, and {{he lived in a}} mansion in Brooklyn and then moved to a country estate in New Jersey in 1927. In that same year, he lost a dispute with the tax authorities. Washington was married and had three children.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{permitted}} the POWs to build septic systems and irrigation ditches throughout the prisoner {{side of the}} camp. An onsite commissary was available to sell items such as bananas, eggs, coffee, notebooks, and cigarettes. Recreational activities allowed for baseball, horseshoes, and ping pong matches. In addition, a 3,000-book library was allowed (much of which {{was provided by the}} Red Cross), and films were shown occasionally. A bulldog was kept by the prisoners, and served as a mascot for the camp. Each year around Christmas, the Japanese guards gave permission for the Red Cross to donate a small box to each of the prisoners, containing items such as corned beef, <b>instant</b> <b>coffee,</b> and tobacco. Prisoners were also able to send postcards to relatives, although they were censored by the guards.|$|E
40|$|Caffeine {{content of}} 377 food samples {{obtained}} from the Hungarian market was measured by a validated HPLC technique. The highest caffeine levels were observed in different <b>instant</b> <b>coffees</b> (3954 ± 2355 mg/ 100 g) and ground coffee beans (1634 ± 389 mg/ 100 g). Significant amount of caffeine could be detected in energy drinks (119 mg in 100 ml at the highest end). The caffeine content of different coffee drinks varied between 40 and 203 mg/ 100 ml. Significant amount of caffeine could be measured in special <b>instant</b> <b>coffees</b> called 2 in 1 and 3 in 1 (120 mg per serving at the highest end), cacao powders (125 mg in 100 g), in chocolates (on average, 16. 1 mg and 52. 5 mg in 100 g milk and dark chocolate, respectively), breakfast cereals (between 5. 7 and 15. 8 mg per 100 g), and ice creams (1. 7 – 24. 8 mg in 100 g) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Instant</b> <b>coffees</b> {{produced}} {{from the same}} green coffee beans were supplied from a company in different roasting degrees, light, medium, and dark. Melanoidins were obtained by ultrafiltration (10 kDa) and subsequent diafiltration. Pure melanoidins were isolated from melanoidins after overnight incubation in 2 M NaCl. The antioxidant activities of <b>instant</b> <b>coffees,</b> melanoidins, and pure melanoidins were tested using the conjugated diene formation from a 2, 2 ′-azobis(2 -amidinopropane) dihydrochloride-induced linoleic acid oxidation in an aqueous system. No {{significant differences were found}} between melanoidins and pure melanoidins with different roasting degrees. Therefore, the contribution of the pure melanoidin fraction to the total antioxidant activity of melanoidins was significantly lower. More than 50 % of the antioxidant activity of melanoidins is due to low molecular weight compounds linked non-covalently to the melanoidin skeleton. A new concept of the overall antioxidant properties of food melanoidins is described, where chelating ability toward low molecular weight antioxidant compounds is connected to the stabilization of these compounds involved in the shelf life of the product. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{products}} are sold {{for the convenience}} of consumers who do not want to prepare their own coffee or who {{do not have access to}} coffeemaking equipment. <b>Instant</b> <b>coffee</b> is dried into soluble powder or freeze-dried into granules that can be quickly dissolved in hot water. Originally invented in 1907, it rapidly gained in popularity in many countries in the post-war period, with Nescafé being the most popular product. Many consumers determined that the convenience in preparing a cup of <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> more than made up for a perceived inferior taste, although, since the late 1970s, <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> has been produced differently in such a way that is similar to the taste of freshly brewed coffee. Paralleling (and complementing) the rapid rise of <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> was the coffee vending machine invented in 1947 and widely distributed since the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|Coffee's first notable Korean enthusiasts were 19th century {{emperors}} Sunjong and Gojong, {{who preferred}} to consume it after western-style banquets. By the 1980s <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> and canned coffee had become fairly popular, {{with a more}} minor tradition of independently owned coffeehouses in larger cities; {{toward the end of}} the century the growth of franchises such as Caffe Bene and Starbucks brought about a greater demand for European-style coffee.|$|E
25|$|The UK Food Standards Agency has {{recommended}} that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake, out of prudence, {{to less than}} 200mg of caffeine a day– the equivalent of two cups of <b>instant</b> <b>coffee,</b> or {{one and a half}} to two cups of fresh coffee. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200mg per day in pregnant women. For women who breastfeed, are pregnant, or may become pregnant, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300mg, or a little over two 8oz (237mL) cups of coffee.|$|E
25|$|Coffee was {{introduced}} to Japan by the Dutch in the 17th century, but remained a curiosity until the lifting of trade restrictions in 1858. The first European-style coffeehouse opened in Tokyo in 1888, and closed four years later. By the early 1930s there were over 30,000 coffeehouses across the country; availability in the wartime and immediate postwar period dropped to nearly zero, then rapidly increased as import barriers were removed. The introduction of freeze-dried <b>instant</b> <b>coffee,</b> canned coffee, and franchises such as Starbucks and Doutor Coffee in the late 20th century continued this trend, {{to the point that}} Japan {{is now one of the}} leading per capita coffee consumers in the world.|$|E

40|$|Two {{species of}} coffee bean have {{acquired}} worldwide economic importance: these are, Coffea Arabica and Coffea Canephora variant Robusta. Arabica beans are valued most highly by the trade, {{as they are}} considered to have a finer flavor than Robusta. In this work, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is explored as a rapid alternative to wet chemical methods for authentication and quantification of coffee products. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to spectra of freeze-dried <b>instant</b> <b>coffees,</b> acquired by DRIFT (diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform) and ATR (attenuated total reflection) sampling techniques, and reveals clustering according to coffee species. Linear discriminant analysis of the principal component scores yields 100 % correct classifications for both training and test samples. The chemical origin of the discrimination is explored through interpretation of the PCA loadings. Partial least squares regression is applied to spectra of Arabica and Robusta blends to determine the relative content of each species. Internal cross-validation gives a correlation coefficient of 0. 99 and a standard error of prediction of 1. 20 % (w/w), illustrating {{the potential of the}} method for industrial off-line quality control analysis...|$|R
25|$|During the 1950s, the Philippine government, {{with the}} help of the Americans, brought in a more {{resistant}} variety of coffee. It was also then that <b>instant</b> <b>coffee</b> was being produced commercially, thus increasing the demand for beans. Because of favorable market conditions, many farmers went back to growing coffee in the 1960s. But the sudden proliferation of coffee farms resulted in a surplus of beans around the world, and for a while importation of coffee was banned in order to protect local coffee producers. When Brazil was hit by a frost in the 1970s, world market coffee prices soared. The Philippines became a member of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the most}} {{widespread}} non-alcoholic beverage among the peasantry was kvass, adopted later by Polish nobility also, mainly due to its supposed healing qualities. In contemporary times, tea {{is perhaps the most}} popular, drunk sometimes with a slice of lemon and sweetened with sugar. Tea came into Poland from England shortly after its appearance in Western Europe, mainly due to the Dutch merchants. However its prevalence is attributed to the Russian invaders in the 19th century – at this time samovars imported from Russia become commonplace in Polish homes. Coffee is also widely drunk in Poland since the 18th century. Frequently consumed beverages also include: buttermilk, kefir, soured milk, <b>instant</b> <b>coffee,</b> various mineral waters and juices. Following the fall of communism in 1989, numerous brands of soft drink have also become popular.|$|E

40|$|Antioxidant {{activity}} of <b>instant</b> <b>coffees</b> produced {{from the same}} green coffee beans roasted at three different degrees was analyzed. Coffee melanoidins were obtained by ultrafiltration (10 kDa cutoff) and subsequent diafiltration. Pure melanoidins were isolated from melanoidins after overnight incubation in 2 M NaCl and then ultrafiltered. Filtrates, corresponding to the low molecular weight (LMW) fraction noncovalently linked to the melanoidin skeleton, were also preserved. Antioxidant {{activity of}} coffee brews (CB), melanoidins (M), pure melanoidins (PM), and bounded melanoidin compounds (BMC) were tested using the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2, 2 ′-azobis-(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and ferric reducing power (FRAP) methods. The correlation between the different methods was studied. The higher contribution of melanoidins to the total antioxidant activity of coffees was shown {{to be caused by}} the LMW compounds linked noncovalently to the melanoidin skeleton, as data from BMC confirmed. CB, M, and BMC fractions exert the highest antioxidant activity in aqueous media, whereas PM was not dependent on the reaction media. The highest correlation was found between DPPH and FRAP methods. © 2005 American Chemical Society. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
