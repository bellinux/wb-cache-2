These topics have been neglected in the introduction class for multiple reasons, but the <b>instructing</b> <b>group</b> feels it is possible to integrate a lab into the class demonstrating basic concepts from these subjects. The proposed prototype is a self-sufficient energy generating and transfer mechanism. Unfortunately, the primary project goals of being producible on-campus and for under a specified $ 500 per unit were not obtained with the included proposed design.

40|$|Abstract. To test a {{production}} deficiency view of learning disabilities, the perfor-mance of learning disabled and normally achieving children given minimal instruc-tion to use organizing strategies {{was compared to}} the performance of students engaged only in practice with a free recall task. Groups were selected as having equivalent pretest recall. On a posttest where strategy use was not prompted, the <b>instructed</b> <b>group</b> showed higher levels of strategy use than the control group. No differences were found between learning disabled and normally achieving subjects' strategy use. The <b>instructed</b> <b>group</b> recalled more than the control group. In contrast to predictions based on {{a production}} deficiency hypothesis, learning disabled groups recalled less than the normally achieving group. Factors that may have contributed to this finding are discussed. Flavell (1970) described a developmental se-quence for acquisition of proficient strategy use among normally developing children. At a certain period in development, some children did no...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{behaviour}} requires {{error detection}} resulting in remedial actions, such as immediate error correction. The present event-related functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} study in humans examined the neural correlates of error detection and error correction using a speeded modified flankers task. In order to investigate corrective behaviour, participants were randomly divided into two <b>groups.</b> The correction <b>instructed</b> <b>group</b> was asked to correct all encountered errors immediately. The correction not <b>instructed</b> <b>group</b> was unaware that corrective responses were recorded. The intention to correct errors significantly increased the correction rate. Brain activations correlating with error detection were isolated in the rostral cingulate zone and in the pre-supplementary motor area, supporting their important role in error processing. Error correction activated similar brain regions, suggesting a common neuroanatomical substrate. Additional activations were found in the parietal cortex, representing an interconnected cortical network, which processes somatosensory information of tactile stimuli...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of pictures and first language (L 1) vocabulary items both as instruction methods and as cues for recall in the learning of second language (L 2) vocabulary items by children. In an experimental study with Turkish EFL learners, L 2 vocabulary items were presented with L 1 words in one group and with pictures in the other one. In the post-tests which required learners to provide the L 2 vocabulary items for pictures and L 1 words, both the L 1 word <b>instructed</b> <b>group</b> and picture <b>instructed</b> <b>group</b> performed better in their L 2 responses to pictures than to L 1 word items. The {{results of the study}} suggest that superiority of pictures over L 1 words in the recall of L 2 vocabulary items by children is due to their effectiveness as cues for recall rather than due to their superiority as a learning method...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} upper-level {{university}} students of humorous versus serious instruction was studied by presenting students with sentences having introductory modifiers and {{asking them to}} edit incorrect or recognize incorrect and correct sentences. Sentences varied in the main clause, a third having active verbs, a third having passive verbs, and a third having the implied subject of the introductory modifier a possessive modifying the main clause 2 ̆ 7 s subject. Uninstructed groups were controls. To determine the relationship between treatment effectiveness and student English background, units of Iowa State English and grade point in that English were examined. All groups were given a pretest during the term 2 ̆ 7 s first week, instruction (if any) and a posttest the next day, and the posttest as a followup three months later. The editing <b>instructed</b> <b>group</b> was asked to rewrite 30 incorrent sentences; the recognition <b>instructed</b> <b>group</b> was given the same 30 incorrect sentences and 30 correct sentences to recognize as correct or incorrect. In both editing and recognition experiments, <b>instructed</b> <b>groups</b> were more effective, and type of sentence made a difference. The <b>instructed</b> <b>groups</b> best recognized correct sentences with active or passive main clauses and found the distracting possessive more difficult. Yet student edited passives best and worked equally well with actives and possessives. The recognition group was most effective with actives and passives if instructed and more effective with possessives if taught with serious rather than humorous examples. In the editing study, there was no effect of varied instruction on performance with differing types of sentences. Background variables, alone, had no effect in either experiment. In the editing study, those with many units of Iowa State English performed better than the low group with active sentences; unexpectedly, the low group performed better with possessives and best with passives. The low grade point editing group was more effective if taught with humor, whereas the high grade point group was more effective if taught with serious examples. The high grade point editing group was least effective with possessives if taught with humor, yet the low group was most effective with possessives if taught with humor...|$|R

40|$|Second {{language}} learning outcomes are highly variable, {{due to a}} variety of factors, including individual differences, exposure conditions, and linguistic complexity. However, exactly how these factors interact to influence {{language learning}} is unknown. This paper examines the relationship between these three variables in language learners. Native English speakers were exposed to an artificial language containing three sentence patterns of varying linguistic complexity. They were randomly assigned to two groups – incidental and instructed – designed to promote the acquisition of implicit and explicit knowledge, respectively. Learning was assessed with a grammaticality judgment task, while subjective measures of awareness were used to measure whether exposure had resulted in implicit or explicit knowledge. Participants also completed cognitive tests. Awareness measures demonstrated that learners in the incidental group relied more on implicit knowledge, whereas learners in the <b>instructed</b> <b>group</b> relied more on explicit knowledge. Overall, exposure condition was the most significant predictor of performance on the grammaticality judgment task, with learners in the <b>instructed</b> <b>group</b> outperforming those in the incidental group. Performance on a procedural learning task accounted for additional variance. When outcomes were analysed according to linguistic complexity, exposure condition was the most significant predictor for two syntactic patterns, {{but it was not a}} predictor for the most complex sentence group; instead, procedural learning ability was...|$|R

40|$|Avoidance of {{threatening}} or unpleasant events is usually an adaptive behavioural strategy. Sometimes, however, avoidance can become chronic {{and lead to}} impaired daily functioning. Excessive threat-avoidance is a central diagnostic feature of anxiety disorders, yet {{little is known about}} whether avoidance acquired {{in the absence of a}} direct history of conditioning with a fearful event differs from directly learned avoidance. In the present study, we tested whether avoidance acquired indirectly via verbal instructions and symbolic generalization result in similar levels of avoidance behaviour and threat beliefs to avoidance acquired after direct learning. Following fear conditioning in which one conditioned stimulus was paired with shock (CS+) and another was not (CS 2), participants either learned or were instructed to make a response that cancelled impending shock. Three groups were then tested with a learned CS+ and CS 2 (learned <b>group),</b> <b>instructed</b> CS+ (<b>instructed</b> <b>group),</b> and generalized CS+ (derived group) presentations. Results showed similar levels of avoidance behaviour and threat-belief ratings about the likelihood of shock across each of the three pathways despite the different mechanisms by which they were acquired.

We developed choreographic tasks that manipulated movement synchrony without explicitly <b>instructing</b> <b>groups</b> to move in uni- son. Wrist accelerometers measured group movement dynamics and we applied cross recurrence analysis to distinguish the temporal features of emergent unitary synchrony (simultaneous move- ment) and distributed coordination (coupled movement).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} changes in the pronunciation and intelligibility of instructed and uninstructed second language (L 2) learners over time, and to identify instructional, environmental, and methodological factors playing a role in pronunciation and intelligibility. Seventeen L 2 graduate students at an English-medium university recorded three personal anecdotes over five months. The students also regularly logged their exposure to and use of English. Nine of the students (<b>instructed</b> <b>group)</b> were concurrently taking an oral communication course focussing on suprasegmental pronunciation. Classroom instruction was regularly observed and recorded. All 17 students were interviewed at the end of the study. L 1 listeners heard anecdotes from three instructed and three uninstructed students, matched for length of residence and first language (L 1). Listeners also heard anecdotes from four L 1 English speakers. One group of listeners retold each anecdote after hearing it (discourse-level task). The other group paused the recording of each anecdote whenever a word was unclear (word-level task). Each group of listeners also rated excerpts for accentedness, comprehensibility, and fluency. Results of quantitative and qualitative analyses showed that: (a) no unambiguous changes in the pronunciation or intelligibility of either L 2 learner group occurred over time; (b) word-level intelligibility measures more consistently differentiated L 1 and L 2 <b>groups,</b> and the <b>instructed</b> and uninstructed L 2 groups; (c) compared to the <b>instructed</b> <b>group,</b> the uninstructed group logged relatively more English exposure/use for academic activities and relatively less for interactive social activities; (d) many instructed L 2 learners did not believe that their pronunciation had noticeably improved, but almost all expressed satisfaction with their ability to communicate in English; (e) at the end of the study, many uninstructed learners reported persistent difficulties in communicating in English. The results suggest that instruction in suprasegmental aspects of pronunciation sometimes may not lead to improved intelligibility or pronunciation. In addition, some L 2 learners can be as intelligible as L 1 speakers, depending on the listening task. Finally, results suggest that L 2 learners' perceptions of their communicative ability and their patterns of L 2 exposure/use are related. Implications for university preparation and support programs for L 2 graduate students are discussed...|$|R
