40|$|AbstractThe {{integration}} of <b>indicators</b> of <b>reading,</b> analytical thinking and writing abilities with indicators of subject content {{is a means}} to evaluate the assessment of reading, analyzing and writing as part ofthe curriculum. The objective {{of this study is}} to integrate the <b>indicators</b> of <b>reading,</b> analytical thinking, and writing ability with the indicators of assessment of mathematics studied by grade 9 students. This is performed by analyzing the content of both indicators. From the investigation of essential aspects and a survey of teachers, the study found that the {{integration of}} indicators comprised of three abilities and eleven <b>indicators.</b> The <b>reading</b> ability consisted of two indicators: the summarizing of the main idea of the text and the interpretation of the reading. The analytical thinking ability consisted of five indicators: analyzing reading, numerical analysis, problem solving, reasoning and creating. The writing ability consisted of four indicators: the discussion arising from reading a story, drawing a graph, writing associated with data analysis and data presentation. These assessment are useful for measuring and assessing the result of studying mathematics, and developing test item specifications for integrating between the <b>indicators</b> of <b>reading,</b> analytical thinking, and writing abilities and the indicators of the content of a subject of study...|$|R

5000|$|As titania is an N-type {{semiconductor}} with {{a structure}} TiO2−x, the x defects in the crystal lattice conduct the charge. So, for fuel-rich exhaust (lower oxygen concentration) the resistance is low, and for fuel-lean exhaust (higher oxygen concentration) the resistance is high. The control unit feeds the sensor {{with a small}} electric current and measures the resulting voltage drop across the sensor, which varies from near 0 volts to about 5 volts. Like the zirconia sensor, this type is nonlinear, such that it is sometimes simplistically described as a binary <b>indicator,</b> <b>reading</b> either [...] "rich" [...] or [...] "lean". Titania sensors are more expensive than zirconia sensors, but they also respond faster.|$|E
50|$|A pilot {{aiming for}} a 500-foot per minute descent, for example, may find himself {{descending}} too rapidly. He begins to apply up elevator until the vertical speed indicator shows 500 feet per minute. However, because the vertical speed indicator lags the actual vertical speed, the pilot is actually descending at much less than 500 feet per minute. The pilot then begins applying down elevator until the vertical speed <b>indicator</b> <b>reads</b> 500 feet per minute, starting the cycle over. It's harder than it might seem to stabilize the vertical speed because the airspeed also constantly changes.|$|R

50|$|Before using a VOR {{indicator}} for {{the first}} time, it can be tested and calibrated at an airport with a VOR test facility, or VOT. A VOT differs from a VOR in that it replaces the variable directional signal with another omnidirectional signal, in a sense transmitting a 360° radial in all directions. The NAV receiver is tuned to the VOT frequency, then the OBS is rotated until the needle is centred. If the <b>indicator</b> <b>reads</b> within four degrees of 000 with the FROM flag visible or 180 with the TO flag visible, it is considered usable for navigation.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{development of a}} computer controlled photoelectric ocular system applied for the LaCoste and Romberg G 949 gravimeter made the continuous observation of time variation of gravity possible. The system was operated for half {{a year in the}} Sopronbánfalva Geodynamical Observatory to test its capabilities. The primary aim of this development was to provide an alternative and self-manageable solution for the standard electronic (Capacitive Position <b>Indicator)</b> <b>reading</b> of this type of gravimeter and use it for the monitoring of Earth tide. It, however, turned out that this system is sensitive enough to observe the effect of variable seismic noise (microseisms) due to the changes of ocean weather in the North Atlantic and North Sea regions at microGal level (1 μGal = 10 − 8 m/s 2). Up to now not much attention was paid to its influence on the quality and accuracy of gravity observations because of the large distance (> 1000 km) between the observation place (generally the Carpathian–Pannonian basin) and the locations (centres of storm zones of the northern hydrosphere) of triggering events. Based on an elementary harmonic surface deformation model the noise level of gravity observations was compared to the spectral characteristics of seismic time series recorded {{at the same time in}} the observatory. Although the sampling rate of gravity records was 120 s the daily variation of gravity noise level showed significant correlation with the variation of spectral amplitude distribution of the analysed high pass filtered (cut-off frequency = 0. 005 Hz) seismograms up to 10 Hz. Also available daily maps of ocean weather parameters were used to support both the correlation analysis and the parameterization of the triggering events of microseisms for further statistical investigations. These maps, which were processed by standard image processing algorithms, provide numerical data about geometrical (distance and azimuth of the storm centres relative to the observation point) and physical (mass of swelling water) quantities. The information can be applied for characterizing the state of ocean weather at a given day which may help the prediction of its influence on gravity measurements in the future. Probably it is the first attempt to analyse quantitatively the effect of ocean weather on gravity observations in this specific area of the Carpathian–Pannonian region...|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 129 An update and a {{demonstration}} of the reverse indicator alignment method with graphical plotting are presented. Hot alignment methods are not covered, but it should be clear that heat rises (falls) can be plotted directly on the graph. Only sizing (scale) differentiates the alignment of pumps from compressors. The scaling presented herein is typical. Reverse indicator tooling and an alignment training model will be discussed. The concentration here is on the pure steps of alignment. The training model allows the movement of a motor relative to a pump. The pump is fixed and the motor is the moveable unit with the coupling feet (near) and outboard feet (far) adjustable by screw travel. Each foot can be adjusted vertically up and down with traversing indicators, as well as horizontally, left and right, with traversing indicators. A flexible coupling remains in place as the shaft is rotated with reverse indicator bars in place.
