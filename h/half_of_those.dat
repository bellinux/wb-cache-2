5|$|Though rare, TBI is {{a serious}} condition; it may cause {{obstruction}} of the airway with resulting life-threatening respiratory insufficiency. Other injuries accompany TBI in about <b>half</b> <b>of</b> cases. <b>Of</b> <b>those</b> people with TBI who die, most do so before receiving emergency care, either from airway obstruction, exsanguination, or from injuries to other vital organs. <b>Of</b> <b>those</b> who do reach a hospital, the mortality rate may {{be as high as}} 30%.|$|R

5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian vulture {{populations have}} {{declined}} {{in most parts}} of its range. In Europe and most of the Middle East, populations in 2001 were <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> from 1980. In India, the decline has been rapid with a 35% decrease each year since 1999. In 1967–70, the area around Delhi was estimated to have 12,000–15,000 of these vultures, with an average density of about 5 pairs per 10km2. The exact cause of the decline is not known, but has been linked {{with the use of the}} NSAID Diclofenac, which has been known to cause death in Gyps vultures.|$|E

5|$|First {{described}} in the nineteenth century, OFC is currently detected {{through a combination of}} blood testing, X-rays, and tissue sampling. Before 1950, around <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism in the United States saw it progress to OFC, but with early identification techniques and improved treatment methods, instances of OFC in developed countries are increasingly rare. Where treatment is required, it normally involves addressing the underlying hyperparathyroidism before commencing long-term treatment for OFCdepending on its cause and severity, this can range from hydration and exercise to surgical intervention.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|Improvements of {{existing}} birth control methods are needed, as around <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who get pregnant unintentionally are using birth {{control at the}} time. A number of alterations {{of existing}} contraceptive methods are being studied, including a better female condom, an improved diaphragm, a patch containing only progestin, and a vaginal ring containing long-acting progesterone. This vaginal ring appears to be effective {{for three or four}} months and is currently available in some areas of the world. For women who rarely have sex, the taking of the hormonal birth control levonorgestrel around the time of sex looks promising.|$|E
50|$|Also on {{the first}} floor, one of the {{triangular}} rooms retains its original use as the front entryway. It features a circular stairway to the second floor. The opposite triangular room was once the rear entryway, perhaps featuring another circular stairway and/or a dumb waiter {{to and from the}} basement kitchen. The other two triangular areas are now bisected by walls, such that approximately <b>half</b> <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>those</b> triangular areas became parts of their respectively adjoining rectangular rooms. This most likely occurred in the 1920s, at which time, the window in one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> triangular rooms was closed and sealed.|$|R

Early the following season, Hextall received the third significant suspension of his career, missing six games for slashing Detroit forward Jim Cummins during a pre-season game. Suspension, further injuries, and a lack of form meant Hextall appeared 45times for the Flyers. He recorded 16wins during the season, resulting in his lowest win percentage in the NHL, 35.56%.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospitalization}} {{rate for}} hyperparathyroidism in the United States in 1999 was 8.0 out of 100,000. The disease has a definite tendency to affect younger individuals, typically appearing {{before the age}} of 40, with a study in 1922 reporting that 70% of cases display symptoms {{before the age of}} 20, and 85% before 35. Primary hyperparathyoidism, as well as OFC, is more common in Asiatic countries. Before treatment for hyperparathyroidism improved in the 1950s, <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism saw it progress into OFC.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolation}} of the island and its diversity of habitats and microclimates have favoured the diversification of a highly endemic flora: Of the 850 known native plant species, 230 are endemic, and <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> are endangered. This native flora is found at various altitudes. Nearly as many exotic plants as native ones, 830, have become naturalised on the island, and 50 are considered invasive, threatening native flora and habitats.|$|E

5|$|The reform's clearest {{effect was}} {{to reduce the}} {{proportion}} of Soviet industrial labour that was paid by piece-rate, and by August 1962, 60.5 percent of Soviet workers were paid by piece-rate, down from the 1956 level of 75 percent. Around <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who remained on piece-rates would continue to receive some kind of bonus payment, but the progressive piece-rate bonuses were mostly eliminated, with only 0.5 percent of workers continuing to receive them in 1962. Workers who were taken off piece-rate payments were then paid an hourly rate or received a salary.|$|E

5|$|About <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{who lost}} their lives on the Wall were killed in the first five years after it was {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.|$|E
