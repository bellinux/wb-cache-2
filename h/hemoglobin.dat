5|$|<b>Hemoglobin</b> is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the <b>hemoglobin</b> molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between <b>hemoglobin</b> and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. <b>Hemoglobin</b> acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal <b>hemoglobin,</b> causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal <b>hemoglobin</b> has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult <b>hemoglobin,</b> causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hemoglobin</b> is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the <b>hemoglobin</b> binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by <b>hemoglobin</b> (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In <b>hemoglobin,</b> the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When <b>hemoglobin</b> is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPlant <b>hemoglobins</b> {{constitute}} {{a diverse group}} of hemeproteins and evolutionarily belong to three different classes. Class 1 <b>hemoglobins</b> possess an extremely high affinity to oxygen and their main function consists in scavenging of nitric oxide (NO) at very low oxygen levels. Class 2 <b>hemoglobins</b> have a lower oxygen affinity and they facilitate oxygen supply to developing tissues. Symbiotic <b>hemoglobins</b> in nodules have mostly evolved from class 2 <b>hemoglobins.</b> Class 3 <b>hemoglobins</b> are truncated and represent a clade with a very low similarity to class 1 and 2 <b>hemoglobins.</b> They may regulate oxygen delivery at high O 2 concentrations. Depending on their physical properties, <b>hemoglobins</b> belong either to hexacoordinate non-symbiotic or pentacoordinate symbiotic groups. Plant <b>hemoglobins</b> are plausible targets for improving resistance to multiple stresses...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} methods of reducing heme loss in <b>hemoglobins</b> to produce stability and improve expression yield of <b>hemoglobins,</b> particularly recombinant <b>hemoglobins.</b> Such methods are accomplished by introducing mutations in the alpha or beta subunits of <b>hemoglobins</b> to increase heme affinity. The present invention further relates to novel mutations that reduce such heme loss...|$|R
40|$|The heme {{prosthetic}} group {{can be held}} into proteins {{in a variety of}} ways. Most often amino acid side chains coordinate {{one or both of the}} two available axial coordination sites of the heme iron. Coordination of both sites, such as in cytochrome b 5, produces a good electron transfer protein but excludes the binding of exogenous ligands. In <b>hemoglobins,</b> coordination can occur at a single site (as in the “pentacoordinate” <b>hemoglobins</b> associated with oxygen transport), or at both sites (as in the “hexacoordinate” <b>hemoglobins</b> found in a wider distribution of organisms and functions). Surprisingly, hexacoordination in <b>hemoglobins</b> is usually reversible and a variety of exogenous ligands can bind most hexacoordinate <b>hemoglobins.</b> Reversible coordination brings a variety of chemical features to hexacoordinate <b>hemoglobins</b> by affecting their affinity for ligands, redox equilibrium, and the kinetics and extent of electron transfer. These reactions are reviewed for hexa- and pentacoordinate <b>hemoglobins</b> with the goal of using these characteristics for understanding potential functions of hexacoordinate <b>hemoglobins</b> in different species...|$|R
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is produced}} naturally {{by the body}} as a byproduct of converting protoporphyrin into bilirubin. This carbon monoxide also combines with <b>hemoglobin</b> to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to <b>hemoglobin,</b> an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by <b>hemoglobin,</b> iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological activity to happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{plays an}} {{important}} role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in <b>hemoglobin</b> and myoglobin; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. A human male of average height has about 4 grams of iron in his body, a female about 3.5 grams. This iron is distributed throughout the body in <b>hemoglobin,</b> tissues, muscles, bone marrow, blood proteins, enzymes, ferritin, hemosiderin, and transport in plasma.|$|E

50|$|The {{bright red}} {{color of the}} plume {{structures}} results from several extraordinarily complex <b>hemoglobins,</b> which contain up to 144 globin chains (each presumably including associated heme structures).

In solution, rabbit <b>hemoglobins</b> appear to have somewhat more flexibility than human <b>hemoglobins.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|It is {{not clear}} why Wilson's disease causes hemolysis, but various lines of {{evidence}} suggest that {{a high level of}} free (non-ceruloplasmin bound) copper has a direct effect on either oxidation of <b>hemoglobin,</b> inhibition of energy-supplying enzymes in the red blood cell, or direct damage to the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, <b>hemoglobin</b> {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free <b>hemoglobin,</b> and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood. Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to <b>hemoglobin,</b> myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon monoxide causing brain lipid peroxidation.|$|E

40|$|There {{are a lot}} of {{contrary}} opinions {{concerning the}} riumber and structure of embryo <b>hemoglobins.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} gather the recent works on this subjects. On the base of numberous papers publJshed in the last years it has been assumed that in human onthogenesis there are different embryo hemoglobins: Hb Gower 1, Hb Gower 2, Hb Portland, two kinds of foetal <b>hemoglobins</b> and three kinds of adult <b>hemoglobins.</b> The number, chemical, structure and physicochemical properties have been demonstrated together with oxygea-affinity especially concerning human embryonic <b>hemoglobins.</b> The development of red cells has been presented together with relation beetwen the site of erythropoesies and different kinds of synthetised <b>hemoglobins.</b> Zadanie pt. „Digitalizacja i udostępnienie w Cyfrowym Repozytorium Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego kolekcji czasopism naukowych wydawanych przez Uniwersytet Łódzki” nr 885 /P-DUN/ 2014 dofinansowane zostało ze środków MNiSW w ramach działalności upowszechniającej naukę...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} mutant <b>hemoglobins</b> are inordinately unstable, {{denaturing}} in circulating red cells into Heinz bodies, resulting in congenital Heinz body hemolytic anemia (CHBHA). We have emphasized that most such <b>hemoglobins</b> involve amino acid substitutions at sites neighboring the heme {{group of the}} β-polypeptide chain, and have shown that heme binding to globin is diminished thereby. Thus, hemes were progressively lost from four unstable <b>hemoglobins</b> (Köln, Hammersmith, San Francisco, and Zürich) as they precipitated into Heinz bodies at 50 °C...|$|R
5|$|The {{ratio of}} carboxyhemoglobin to <b>hemoglobin</b> {{molecules}} {{in an average}} person may be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%. In symptomatic poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.|$|E
5|$|When {{deoxyhemoglobin}} {{picks up}} an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached {{to form a}} hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O2–Fe bridges {{that would lead to}} electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of <b>hemoglobin.)</b> This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of <b>hemoglobin</b> changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while <b>hemoglobin</b> is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than myoglobin in the low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue, resulting in oxygen transfer. This is further enhanced by the concomitant Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), in which lowered pH (as occurs when carbon dioxide is released in the muscles) further lowers the oxygen affinity of <b>hemoglobin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another line of {{research}} involved the biochemistry of the hemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin system. Conant ran a series of experiments with electrochemical oxidation and reduction, {{following in the footsteps}} of the famous German chemist and Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. He determined that the iron centre in methemoglobin is a ferric (FeIII) centre, unlike the ferrous (FeII) centre found in normal <b>hemoglobin,</b> and this difference in oxidation state is the cause of methemoglobinemia, a medical condition which causes tissue hypoxia.|$|E
40|$|Mutant, {{unstable}} <b>hemoglobins</b> precipitate as Heinz {{bodies in}} circulating {{red blood cells}} resulting in their premature hemolysis. We stress that generally these <b>hemoglobins</b> contain amino acid substitutions in the β-chain of globin near the heme pocket, and demonstrate that heme binding suffers thereby. Four genetically unstable <b>hemoglobins</b> lost roughly half their heme content while precipitating into Heinz bodies. Conversely, repletion of hemes in vitro corrected the characteristically aberrant electrophoretic mobilities of these <b>hemoglobins</b> and concomitantly prevented their excessive denaturation into Heinz bodies. From the finding that heme-containing α-chains accumulate in solution during Heinz body formation, we propose that heme loss occurs predominantly from mutant β-chains, which then precipitate. This mechanism of Heinz body formation is valid in most, but not all, the unstable hemoglobinopathies...|$|R
40|$|After {{quantitative}} {{reaction of}} the sulfhydryl groups of chicken <b>hemoglobins</b> with para mercuribenzoate, α and β chains cannot be separated by chromatography from either major or minor component. Ultracentrifugations show that dissociation into dimers occurs, but at protein concentrations much lower than those observed for mammalian <b>hemoglobins.</b> Oxygen equilibrium is affected: cooperative effects are weakened and oxygen affinity increases, the amplitude of the alteration being different for each component in presence or in absence of inositol hexaphosphate. Comparison with the behaviour of some mammalian <b>hemoglobins</b> is discussed. © 1973. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|As a first {{approximation}} {{only the}} inert gasses {{are taken into}} account. For oxygen partial pressures above 2.4 bar, the quantity of oxygen dissolved in the arterial blood exceeds the amount that the body can use, and the <b>hemoglobin</b> is saturated with oxygen in both the veins and the arteries. If more oxygen is added, the partial pressure of oxygen in the venous blood rises.|$|E
5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} <b>hemoglobin</b> in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to <b>hemoglobin.</b>|$|E

The results obtained with <b>hemoglobins</b> from reindeer and musk ox indicate that their low oxygen affinity and their insensitivity to Gri(2, 3) P 2 are not only an intrinsic property of the molecule, as proposed in the case of ruminant <b>hemoglobins,</b> but also the results of the interplay between chloride and Gri(2, 3) P 2 interactions...|$|R

40|$|Differentiating {{cells can}} be {{characterized}} by the number and types of proteins they produce (Markert, 1963). In man and other organisms the diversity of <b>hemoglobins</b> has been correlated with ontogenetic changes which reflect the alterations of gene activity (Ingram, 1963). Furthermore, the types of proteins produced are generally specific for the species. The study of insect coelomic proteins has followed closely that of mammalian serum protein analysis; however, profound differences exist between human blood and insect coelomic fluids. For this reason, the term 'hemolymph', rather than blood, {{has been used to}} designate these fluids.
