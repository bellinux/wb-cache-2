5|$|The first USAF E-3 was {{delivered}} in March 1977, {{and during the}} next seven years, a total of 34 aircraft were manufactured. NATO, as a single identity, also had 18 aircraft manufactured, basing them in Germany. The E-3 was also sold to the United Kingdom (seven) and France (four) and Saudi Arabia (five, plus eight E-3-derived tanker aircraft). In 1991, when the last aircraft had been delivered, E-3s participated in Operation Desert Storm, playing a crucial role of directing coalition aircraft against the enemy. Throughout the aircraft's service life, numerous upgrades were performed to enhance its capabilities. In 1996, Westinghouse Electric's Defense & <b>Electronic</b> <b>Systems</b> division, was acquired by Northrop Corporation before its being renamed Northrop Grumman <b>Electronic</b> <b>Systems,</b> which currently supports the E-3's radar.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of more advanced <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> in the 1980s allowed manufacturers to produce snow groomers which could work on and replicate a much wider range of terrains, with the most modern even able to produce half-pipes and ramps for snowboarding. Snow groomers are also {{used in conjunction with}} snow cannons, to ensure that the snow produced is spread evenly across the resort. However, snow groomers have a detrimental effect on the environment within the resort. Regular pressure from the grooming vehicle increases the infiltration rate of the soil while decreasing the field capacity. This increases the rate at which water can soak through the soil, making it more prone to erosion.|$|E
5|$|The pre-mission {{briefing}} {{stage is}} where the player gets information on the background and objectives, and selects the ship and weapons. The choices of ships and weapons increase as the player proceeds further along the campaign. Certain missions, however, will dictate certain ships and weapons to be used. Weapons can be classified into primary weapons and secondary weapons. Primary weapons are kinetic and energy weapons, while missiles and torpedoes are classified as secondary weapons. Each weapon has its own specifications such as its rate of fire. They also inflict different damages on hulls (body of the ships) or shields (the protective energy fields surrounding the ships), or possess special effects such as shutting down specific <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> or propulsion.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, Pakistan was {{reportedly}} {{to select a}} Western company {{by the end of}} the year to provide and integrate the FC-1's avionics, which was expected to go into production by 1999. The avionics were said to include radar, Inertial navigation system, Head-up display, and Multi-function displays. Competing bids came from Thomson-CSF with a variant of the Radar Doppler Multitarget (RDY), SAGEM with a similar avionics package to those used in the ROSE upgrade project, and Marconi <b>Electronic</b> <b>Systems</b> with its Blue Hawk radar. FIAR's (now SELEX Galileo) Grifo S7 radar was expected to be selected due to the company's ties with the PAF. In February 1998, Pakistan and China signed a letter of intent covering airframe development. Russia's Klimov offered a variant of the RD-33 turbofan engine to power the fighter. In April 1999, South Africa's Denel offered to arm the Super 7 with the T-darter beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile (AAM), rather than the previously reported R-Darter. Previously in 1987, Pratt & Whitney offered the Super-7 project three engine options; PW1212, F404, and PW1216, with local manufacturing in either China or Pakistan. Rolls Royce offered its RB199-127/128 turbofan engine; this plan was scrapped in 1989.|$|E

40|$|Abstract –Power {{electronics}} {{systems are}} non-linear systems, which consume more reactive power {{and also the}} loads they feed are mostly inductive loads {{which leads to a}} poor power factor. Various compensation techniques are available to bring the power factor nearer to unity. In this paper, a novel compensator is proposed, where in-phase and quadrature components of the supply current are vector-controlled. Implementation of this compensator in a power <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> operating with a very poor power factor (and hence high THD), shows that the system then draws a leading current. A conventional power <b>electronic</b> <b>system,</b> A conventional power <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> with one of the traditional static VAR compensators and the conventional power <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> incorporated with the proposed compensator are simulated and the simulation results are obtained. It is shown that the proposed method offers only 0. 7 % THD, which also implies that the power factor is improved...|$|R
