The validity of four different <b>grid</b> <b>beam</b> configurations, as depicted in Fig.  13, was verified by comparing their responses with the so-called “exact” solution (the response obtained with a model that simulates the slab using layered shell elements with nonlinear material properties). Additionally, for each configuration a separate parametric study was also conducted, wherein finer discretizations and modified stiffness properties were considered. The validation included comparisons of deflection (shape and magnitude), shear and axial forces in the beams and axial forces in the columns, under both gravity loads and column removal scenarios, when large deformations and pronounced nonlinear behavior are expected.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} present thesis is the {{analysis}} and performance evaluation of multicellular WCDMA networks, where each mobile user can be equipped with an antenna array. In the frame of this thesis, a semi-static simulator has been developed, where it {{was used for the}} calculation of capacity of WCDMA networks under different traffic scenarios as well as network deployments (networks with conventional sectors/fixed <b>grid</b> of <b>beams</b> per sector/adaptive beams). Results are presented for the capacity of WCDMA networks with up to four tiers of cells around the central cell, while a new adaptive beamforming strategy is proposed and evaluated for networks with non-uniform traffic. This strategy, apart from increased throughput per beam gain compared to a network with fixed <b>grid</b> of <b>beams,</b> provides more efficient radio resource management. The decreased number of beams formed by this strategy in order to cover capacity demands compared to the fixed <b>grid</b> of <b>beams</b> network, minimizes inter-beam handovers, reduces signalling requirements and leads to more available power in downlink. The semi-static simulator has also been used for the calculation of bit error rate for different transmission techniques in networks with multiple antennas at both sides. These techniques aim at either minimizing the overall bit rate through coherent combining (diversity combining), or the maximization of the bit rate per mobile user (spatial multiplexing). A new transmission strategy is proposed based on proper antenna selection which maximizes per user bit rate, {{while at the same time}} minimizes network resources, as in each user a minimum number of codes is assigned in order to achieve the desired capacity. ...|$|R

40|$|Preclinical {{investigations}} of thick microbeams show these to be feasible {{for use in}} radiotherapeutic dose delivery. To create the beams we access a radiotherapy x-ray tube that is familiarly used within a conventional clinical environment, coupling this with beam-defining <b>grids.</b> <b>Beam</b> characterisation, both single and {{in the form of}} arrays, has been by use of both MCNP simulation and direct Gafchromic EBT film dosimetry. As a first step in defining optimal exit-beam profiles over a range of beam energies, simulation has been made of the x-ray tube and numbers of beam-defining parallel geometry grids, the latter being made to vary in thickness, slit separation and material composition. For a grid positioned after the treatment applicator, and of similar design to those used {{in the first part of}} the study, MCNP simulation and Gafchromic EBT film were then applied in examining the resultant radiation profiles. MCNP simulations and direct dosimetry both show useful thick microbeams to be produced from the x-ray tube, with peak-to-valley dose ratios (PVDRs) in the approximate range 8. 8 – 13. 9. Although the potential to create thick microbeams using radiotherapy x-ray tubes and a grid has been demonstrated, Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) would still need to be approved outside of the preclinical setting, a viable treatment technique of clinical interest needing to benefit for instance from substantially improved x-ray tube dose rates...|$|R

The {{evaluation}} of slope strengthening {{by using a}} <b>grid</b> <b>beam</b> system is carried out in this study by using a real slope existed in China is taken as the example to investigate {{the effects of the}} strengthening approach. The geological conditions of the example slope are introduced at first. The three dimensional element model of the slope is constructed with the aiding of the commercial package FLAC 3 D. The excavation process is simulated to obtain the stress distribution and displacement status. The slope performances without and with strengthening are numerical investigated and compared. The different bending moments of vertical beam of the frame and foundation pressure of slope reinforced with binding bolts, pre-pressed anchors and stress dispersion cables are computed. The made observations indicate that the stability of the slope has been obviously improved by applying the strengthening.

Meanwhile, the permeability of the vegetation-pervious concrete was studied as well. Through comparing with ordinary pervious concrete, the effect of low alkaline pervious concrete on vegetation growth was investigated in a small-scale field for ten weeks. The test results indicated that the alkalinity of the cement samples decreased with the increase of admixture content, and the vegetation grew successfully on previous concrete. By increasing the admixture content to approximately 3. 6 %, the compressive strength of pervious concrete was more than 25 MPa...|$|E

The investigate slope discussed in this paper is located at Persiaran Endah and within 10 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur. This slope is around 23 to 28 meter height and approximate 550 to 660. The pertinent engineering properties were analyzed from field test borings which were drilled up to 22 meters depth, seismic refraction survey, inclinometer data, back analysis result, and engineer judgment. Back analysis was carried out to estimate the mobilized shear strength of the problematic layer. SLOPE/W program of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia was used for analysis. Based on the result of the field investigation and numerical analysis the lowest factor of safety (FOS) that evaluated from the existing slope in critical section was found to be 0. 741. Therefore, soil nailing was recommended to reinforce the slope, which has an acceptable FOS of 1. 525 under static condition.
