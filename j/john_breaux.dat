5|$|In 2002 in the United States, Democratic senator <b>John</b> <b>Breaux</b> of Louisiana {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} prevent U.S. shipowners from using foreign flags, ostensibly as a counter-terrorism measure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring {{tax cuts for the}} rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator <b>John</b> <b>Breaux,</b> who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|On January 7, 2008, it was {{announced}} that Lott and former Senator <b>John</b> <b>Breaux</b> of Louisiana, a Democrat, opened their lobbying firm about a block from the White House.|$|E

50|$|In 1986, Moore was the {{unsuccessful}} Republican {{candidate in}} the race to replace the retiring U.S. Senator Russell B. Long. He lost to Democrat <b>John</b> B. <b>Breaux,</b> then of Crowley in Acadia Parish in southwestern Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|In {{his last}} {{election}} as mayor-president in 1976, Dumas defeated the Democrat Pete Heine, {{the mayor of}} Baker from 1964-1976 and again from 1981-1992, and the Republican choice, Jack Breaux, the mayor of Zachary (no relation to U.S. Senator <b>John</b> B. <b>Breaux).</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1986, Tiner {{opined that}} {{retiring}} U.S. Senator Russell B. Long may have stepped aside from seeking a seventh full six-year term because Long {{may have been}} unseated by Republican U.S. Representative Henson Moore of Baton Rouge. Long's successor, <b>John</b> <b>Breaux,</b> also a U.S. representative at the time from Crowley, however, defeated Moore in the general election. Moore had led in the nonpartisan blanket primary. Long said that he merely {{wanted to have a}} few years of retirement while the calendar was still somewhat favorable to him. Long lived until 2003.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} after the 2003 gubernatorial runoff, Jindal decided to run for Louisiana's 1st congressional district. The incumbent, David Vitter, was running for the Senate seat being vacated by <b>John</b> <b>Breaux.</b> The Louisiana Republican Party {{endorsed}} him in the primary although Mike Rogers, also a Republican, was running for the same seat. The 1st District has been in Republican hands since a 1977 special election and is widely considered to be staunchly conservative. Jindal's campaign was able to raise over $1million very early in the campaign, making it harder for other candidates to effectively raise funds to oppose him. He won the 2004 election with 78 percent of the vote.|$|E
500|$|A {{second round}} of Judiciary Committee {{hearings}} were also taking place on January 21, and by then, Baird was politically isolated, with no major groups coming to her defense. [...] A growing number of senators came out in opposition to Baird during the day, including two Republican members of the Judiciary Committee and influential centrist Democrats <b>John</b> <b>Breaux</b> of Louisiana and David Boren of Oklahoma. [...] Baird gamely continued to smile and testify well into the evening, but as Stephanopoulos later wrote, [...] "She didn't know it yet, but she was toast." [...] Biden called Clinton and told him the nomination was lost.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s, deGravelles {{contributed to}} the {{national}} and state parties {{as well as the}} U.S. Senate nominee, outgoing U.S. Representative Henson Moore, a narrow loser to the Democrat <b>John</b> B. <b>Breaux,</b> originally from Crowley in Acadia Parish in south Louisiana. In 2005, deGravelles received the annual Reagan Republican Gold Medal.|$|R
50|$|Knox {{frequently}} challenged Representative Huckaby, having {{run as a}} Democrat in 1980 and as an Independent in 1982, 1990, and 1992. In 1998, he even ran for the United States Senate seat held by {{the popular}} Democrat <b>John</b> B. <b>Breaux</b> of Crowley in south Louisiana. Republican Jim Donelon, currently the Louisiana state insurance commissioner, also ran for the Senate that year.|$|R
50|$|Born in Jena in La Salle Parish in North Louisiana, Francis became wealthy {{in the oil}} {{processing}} {{business from}} his base in Acadiana. His company is based in Crowley in Acadia Parish, a rice-growing region in southwestern Louisiana, which produced two of the state's political giants of the late 20th century, Democrats Edwin Edwards and <b>John</b> B. <b>Breaux.</b> Francis also has a residence in Lafayette.|$|R
2500|$|He also {{supports}} expanding SCHIP, and favors withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq. He calls himself [...] "a <b>John</b> <b>Breaux</b> Democrat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Vitter ran {{to replace}} Democrat <b>John</b> <b>Breaux</b> in the U.S. Senate. [...] Former state Senator Daniel Wesley Richey, a Baton Rouge {{political}} consultant, directed Vitter's grassroots {{organization in the}} race, with assistance from Richey's longtime ally, former state Representative Louis E. [...] "Woody" [...] Jenkins of Baton Rouge, himself a defeated U.S. Senate candidate in 1978, 1980, and 1996.|$|E
2500|$|Democratic State Representative Bobby Freeman of Plaquemine in Iberville Parish {{was elected}} to succeed Fitzmorris as {{lieutenant}} governor in 1979. He defeated fellow Democrat (later Republican) James [...] "Jim" [...] Donelon of Metairie, a Jefferson Parish suburb of New Orleans. In 1998, Donelon, then a state representative, would be the defeated Republican candidate against popular Senator <b>John</b> <b>Breaux.</b> Donelon became insurance commissioner in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Morrison patronized the Center for Southeast Louisiana Studies at Southeastern University. In 1995, Dr. John Miller, {{dean of the}} College of Arts and Sciences, inaugurated {{the annual}} James H. Morrison Lecture on Politics and Government at Southeastern. Political figures from both parties have {{delivered}} Morrison lectures, including former Democratic U.S. Senator <b>John</b> B. <b>Breaux</b> and Jack A. [...] "Jay" [...] Blossman, Jr., the Republican {{former chairman of the}} Louisiana Public Service Commission.|$|R
5000|$|<b>John</b> Berlinger <b>Breaux</b> ( [...] ; born March 1, 1944) was {{a member}} of the United States Senate from Louisiana from 1987 until 2005. He was also a member of the US House of Representatives from 1972 to 1987. He was {{considered}} one of the more conservative national legislators from the Democratic Party. Breaux {{was a member}} of the New Democrat Coalition. After his congressional tenure, he became a lobbyist, co-founding the Breaux-Lott Leadership Group. The firm was later acquired by law and lobbying firm Patton Boggs, now Squire Patton Boggs.|$|R
50|$|By 1995, some fifty-five {{years after}} Pipes made his {{rudimentary}} congressional race, Republicans had made huge strides in Louisiana. They held {{a clear majority}} of the U.S. House seats from Louisiana but had then yet to elect a single U.S. senator. That would change {{with the election of}} 2004, with the victory of David Vitter. Sugar growers, however, were independents who swung between the parties. While many in time voted Republican for president, other growers also supported such Democrats as former Senators <b>John</b> B. <b>Breaux</b> of Crowley in Acadia Parish and Mary Landrieu of New Orleans.|$|R
2500|$|According to Rebecca Despot, {{an unnamed}} aide to then U.S. Senator <b>John</b> <b>Breaux</b> {{told her that}} the outcome of Louisiana {{elections}} [...] "right after my father was ousted would have been different had he still been the chairman. I don't think people understand the passion he felt about what he was doing and that he was a man with a mission. They took his mission away, and people will never know what that did to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1980, the House Administration Committee voted 11-7 {{to reject}} Wilson's {{call for the}} {{unseating}} of Leach. The vote mirrored party alignment, with all Democrats voting to dismiss, and each Republican favoring continuance of the investigation. Finally, on March 4, 1980, the full House voted 241-153 to drop Wilson's challenge. Leach's Democratic colleagues from Louisiana, Jerry Huckaby, Gillis William Long, <b>John</b> <b>Breaux,</b> and Lindy Boggs all voted to dismiss, but the three Louisiana Republican congressmen, David C. Treen, W. Henson Moore, and Robert L. [...] "Bob" [...] Livingston abstained. A handful of Republicans voted with Leach, {{and a handful of}} Democrats sided with Wilson's allegations.|$|E
2500|$|After he won {{repeated}} legislative {{reelection in}} Jefferson Parish, Donelon became his party's [...] "sacrificial lamb" [...] in 1998 against popular Democratic U. S. Senator <b>John</b> <b>Breaux</b> of Crowley in Acadia Parish, who was seeking his third and, {{as it turned}} out, final term as senator. Donelon stepped up to run when other candidates deferred to the inevitability of Breaux's reelection. The race was not close. Breaux won the nonpartisan blanket primary, often called the jungle primary, outright with 620,504 votes (64 percent). Donelon trailed with 306,616 (32 percent). The remaining 4 percent was shared by a half-dozen minor candidates, including L.D. Knox of Winnsboro, who legally {{changed his name to}} [...] "None of the Above" [...] Knox to stress the need for greater candidate choice to reject all declared candidates.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Hayes {{was elected}} to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat to fill the seat vacated by <b>John</b> Berlinger <b>Breaux,</b> the {{candidate}} instead elected to succeed the retiring U.S. Senator Russell B. Long. Hayes led five opponents in the nonpartisan blanket primary, including fellow Democrats Margaret Lowenthal of Lake Charles and James David Cain of Dry Creek in Beauregard Parish, both of whom were state representatives, and a Republican, David Thibodaux of Lafayette. In the general election, Hayes defeated Lowenthal, who had narrowly led Cain for the second position {{in the second round of}} balloting.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, Cain ran unsuccessfully in {{the primary}} for the since disbanded Louisiana's 7th congressional district, then vacated by <b>John</b> B. <b>Breaux,</b> at the time from Crowley, the seat of Acadia Parish, who would instead win the seat of {{retiring}} U.S. Senator Russell B. Long. Cain only narrowly failed to gain a general election berth, and the seat was won by Democrat (and later Republican) Jimmy Hayes of Lafayette. Cain polled 40,554 votes (24 percent), but he was edged out of second place by legislative colleague Margaret Lowenthal of Lake Charles, who received 42,839 (25 percent). Hayes led with 51,137 (30 percent). Also in the race was the Republican David Thibodaux of Lafayette, who received 21,082 (12 percent). Two other contenders shared the remaining 8 percent of the vote. In the general election, Hayes defeated Lowenthal.|$|R
5000|$|Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} <b>John</b> Burke called <b>Breau's</b> playing [...] "tender" [...] and [...] "understated" [...] {{and stated}} in his review: [...] "... {{part of the}} fascination in hearing an imaginative player like Breau lies in how he reinterprets each song so that you hear it {{as if for the}} first time... Within the pop/country, rock/jazz frame he has set for himself, you feel Breau extend himself to the fullest. A handsome first effort." [...] Music critic Thom Jurek of Allmusic called it [...] "an impressive debut as any you're likely to find because of Breau's startling originality on the instrument." ...|$|R
2500|$|Former Governor Edwin Washington Edwards had {{initially}} told Donelon, {{who had been}} an Edwards aide prior to 1975, that Edwards would not {{become involved in the}} campaign. When Treen began to campaign for Donelon, Edwards endorsed Tauzin, a former floor leader for Edwards. Donelon entered the first round of balloting as a slight favorite in that he had won some 57 {{percent of the vote in}} the parishes which then comprised the Third District in the lieutenant governor's race against Bobby Freeman just seven months earlier. Guarisco, who was endorsed by the New Orleans Times-Picayune, which had supported Treen for governor in 1979, said that he did not want the support of either Edwards or Treen because he was [...] "independent of all that." [...] Tauzin was also endorsed by Lieutenant Governor Freeman, United States Senator Russell B. Long and Congressman <b>John</b> <b>Breaux,</b> whom Donelon would oppose eighteen years later in a Senate race.|$|E
2500|$|Nelson {{was one of}} {{only two}} Democratic {{senators}} to vote against the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. He voted with Republicans on matters of bankruptcy reform, environmental protection, lawsuit reform, and trade. In 2004 he {{was one of only}} three Democratic senators to vote to invoke cloture on the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment; in 2006 he was one of only two Democratic Senators to vote that way. He was the only Democratic senator to vote against a 2006 bill that would have extended federal funding for Stem Cell Research. He has, however, voted consistently against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He has also opposed President Bush's plan to send an additional 21,500 troops to Iraq. Early in Bush's first term he voted with the majority of his party against scrapping President Bill Clinton's expansive new rules on ergonomics regulation for workers; many of his fellow conservative Democrats like <b>John</b> <b>Breaux,</b> Max Baucus, Blanche Lincoln, and Zell Miller voted with Republicans on the issue. [...] On April 26, 2010, Nelson was one of two Democratic senators in attendance to vote against the motion to move a financial regulations bill forward, siding with Senate Republicans. [...] The other was Harry Reid, who voted against his own proposed bill out of procedure.|$|E
