2500|$|Prior to its {{merging with}} macOS, the server edition macOS Server was architecturally {{identical}} to its desktop counterpart and usually ran on Apple's line of Macintosh server hardware. macOS Server included work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services, including a mail transfer agent, a Samba server, an LDAP server, a <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>server,</b> and others. With Mac OS X v10.7 Lion, all server aspects of Mac OS X Server have been {{integrated into the}} client version and the product re-branded as [...] "OS X" [...] (dropping [...] "Mac" [...] from the name). The server tools are now offered as an application.|$|E

The problem was eventually traced to an amplified Distributed-Denial-of-service_attack (DDoS) attack. [...] In this case, the perpetrator was sending forged <b>Domain</b> <b>Name</b> Service (DNS) requests to multiple <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>servers,</b> causing the servers to send large amounts data records to the Hacker Dojo, thereby overloading {{the system and}} preventing legitimate use of the network.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, {{and requests}} discussion {{and suggestions for}} improvements. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Copyright Notice Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2000). All Rights Reserved. As the internet becomes increasingly critical to the worldâ€™s social and economic infrastructure, attention has rightly focused on the correct, safe, reliable, and secure operation of the internet infrastructure itself. The root <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> {{are seen as a}} crucial part of that technical infrastructure. The primary focus of this document is to provide guidelines for operation of the root <b>name</b> <b>servers.</b> Other major zone server operators (gTLDs, ccTLDs, major zones) may also find it useful. These guidelines are intended to meet the perceived societal needs without overly prescribing technical details. 1. Background The resolution of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> on the internet is critically dependent on the proper, safe, and secure operation of the root <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>servers.</b> Currently, these dozen or so servers are provided and operated by a very competent and trusted group of volunteers. This document does not propose to change that, but merely to provide formal guidelines so that the community understands how and why this is done...|$|R
30|$|Attacks {{compromising the}} hosting infrastrucutre are {{frequently}} occurring. In 2013 alone, multiple domains were hijacked by compromising <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> or registrars; {{some of the}} notable attacks include a compromise of google.rwgoogle.rw and even top level domains like, qa, ps, nl, be, myqa, ps, nl, be, my. Registrar, register.comregister.com was subverted, and as a result, many names related to security like metasploit.commetasploit.com and bitdefender.combitdefender.com were redirected.|$|R
5000|$|To avoid burdening the <b>Domain</b> <b>Name</b> System root <b>servers</b> with traffic, caching <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> {{should never}} request <b>name</b> <b>server</b> records for localhost, or forward {{resolution}} to authoritative <b>name</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Multigrain {{uses the}} Luhn {{algorithm}} {{to validate the}} credit and debit card details. This POS malware then infects the computer and blocks Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http) and file transfer protocol (ftp) traffic which monitors the data exfiltration. It exfiltrates the scraped information of credit and debit card via <b>Domain</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Server</b> (DNS). Then it sends the collected payment card information to a 'command and control server' server.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft's Active Directory {{is fairly}} simple by comparison, {{typically}} storing only user and machine objects in their directory. Other Windows network configuration information is scattered across other databases {{such as the}} Windows registry, the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>server,</b> and specialized services such as the global catalog. NetWare integrated all these functions into eDirectory. Even file system information is stored in the directory as volume objects.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to serve a DNSBL using any general-purpose DNS server software. However this is typically inefficient for zones containing large numbers of addresses, particularly DNSBLs which list entire Classless Inter-Domain Routing netblocks. For the large resource consumption when using software designed as {{the role of a}} <b>Domain</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Server,</b> there are role-specific software applications designed specifically for servers with a role of a DNS blacklist.|$|E
50|$|According to Sherwin Siy of Public Knowledge, past {{attempts}} to limit copyright infringement online {{by way of}} blocking domains have always generated criticism that doing so would fracture the <b>Domain</b> <b>Name</b> System and threaten the global functionality of the Internet, with the original draft of this bill being no different. By design, all <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> worldwide should contain identical lists; with the changes initially proposed, servers inside the United States would have records different from their global counterparts, making URLs less universal.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order for}} the {{exchange}} of information to be organized and searchable on the World Wide Web <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> are used. <b>Domain</b> <b>names</b> are substitutes for IP addresses, which are presented numerically, {{in order to further}} simplify the process of searching for information on the Internet. <b>Domain</b> <b>name</b> <b>servers</b> maintain the list that matches <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> to IP addresses. There are two types of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> TLDs or Top Level Domains which include: [...]com, [...]edu, [...]gov, [...]net, [...]org, etc., and SLDs or secondary level domains, which precedes TLDs in the web address, and usually refers to the organization that has been registered to TLD by ICANN.|$|R
