5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part {{in the tone of}} the novel. The tone of the novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} version, the Enterprise visits Naterra and meets the planet's leader, Zxolar, who {{is concerned that}} Captain Kirk is an alien called Komether who is due to return within twenty days to destroy their world. Zxolar suddenly collapses and Doctor McCoy tries to help him but an energy surrounds the doctor's head and he runs at a wall and disappears. The landing party search for McCoy {{but to no avail}} and Zxolar is beamed to the Enterprise. Doctor Chapel attempts to help him but the energy appears around her and she passes out. Xon and Kirk discuss the energy and realize it wants Zxolar to die as it has attacked anyone who helps him. The pair beam back down the planet to investigate the palace they met Zxolar in and discover an archive which shows them {{the original}} agreement made by six philosophers, including a much younger Zxolar, and Komether a thousand years earlier. They note one of the philosophers is Zxolar and the Komether is the energy being which attacked the two doctors. As in the later version used on Star Trek: The Next Generation, the agreement was that the being would correct the pollution of the planet in return for ownership of the planet a thousand years later. Xon and Kirk decide to move Zxolan to a life support table and ask for other volunteers as it is apparent that Komether will attack them as they attempt to save him. Scotty, Sulu and Chekov all volunteer as well, and the alien disables each of them as they move Zxolar. It is only because of Xon's strength as he is being attacked that they manage to attach Zxolar to a life support machine and his life signs immediately improve. Zxolar tells Kirk about the contract, who retrieves it from the planet's surface and challenges it. Komethar appears and agrees to a trial with the Enterprises computer acting as an impartial judge. Kirk realises that Komethar was created by the six philosophers and so as the last remaining, Zxolar <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of it. Zxolar manages to defeat the creature using his will and releases the stunned crewmen. He finds that McCoy was trapped in the wall itself and releases him too, the Enterprise departing shortly thereafter.|$|E

And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did I stop being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of himself and not dependent on others.|$|E
25|$|The referee prepares both wrestlers for {{the first}} period by making sure each wrestler is {{correctly}} in the neutral position. The neutral position has the two wrestlers standing opposite each other on their feet. Each wrestler starts with his lead foot on the green or red area of the starting lines, and his other foot even with or behind the lead foot. Both wrestlers then usually slightly crouch with their {{arms in front of}} them at or above waist level. In this position, neither wrestler <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control.</b> When the referee is certain that both wrestlers are correctly in the neutral position, he blows the whistle to begin the first period (as well as whenever wrestling is resumed, such as {{at the beginning of the}} second and third periods, when contestants resume wrestling after going out of bounds, etc.). The match commences with each wrestler attempting to take down his opponent. The first period in college and university matches is three minutes long.|$|E

[...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control,</b> not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E
500|$|Alvarez {{defies the}} Aristotelian {{notion of a}} well-knit plot, as {{the story is told}} in reverse chronological order through a series of fifteen chapters, with no linear, unifying storyline. In Julia Alvarez: A {{critical}} companion, Scholar Silvio Sirias argues that [...] "a well-constructed plot has an underlying structure that promises the reader that the author <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control,</b> and that any event she is telling will eventually make sense". Sirias then goes on to explain how Alvarez's initial exposure of the girls to the reader in their somewhat adjusted, adult states enables her to first evoke certain assumptions in the reader and subsequently shatter these assumptions with the disclosure of the Garc√≠a family's troubled past. Scholar Julie Barak argues that the reverse chronological order Alvarez employs is actually a unique stylistic technique which adds [...] "to the reader's uncertainty and instability, [...] of the Garcia girls' own ambiguities".|$|E

500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} a {{multiplayer}} mode, described by Schafer as [...] "your typical head-to-head, {{battle of the}} bands scenario. But with axes." [...] The multiplayer modes are team-based and play {{in the same manner}} as the single-player Stage Battles, with team sizes from one-versus-one to four-versus-four. Each team selects from one of three factions which affect what resources and troops they can summon, and are tasked with defending their stage from attack by the other team. The three factions available are Ironheade, mostly human-based troops led by Eddie Riggs; The Drowning Doom, with more Goth/Black Metal creatures led by Ophelia; and The Tainted Coil, evil creatures controlled by Doviculus. Each player controls a single main avatar who has the same abilities as in the main game for combat and magic spells and can also fly about the map, but also <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of troops that they may summon from the team's shared resources‚Äîfans as generated by fan geysers across the map. Different types of troops are available, costing various numbers of fans to summon, with the potential to upgrade to improved units through different routes. The number and types of troops that can be summoned is limited by a cap to prevent either team from becoming too overpowered. All of the troops can be engaged by the player to initiate various [...] "Double Team" [...] moves as with the single player game. The game can also be played by a single player with computer-controller opponents at one of five difficulty levels.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scenes in}} Inside Man {{required}} multiple-camera setups, {{which meant that}} Libatique had to instruct and work with multiple camera operators. Lee {{wanted to create a}} visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control.</b> Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, [...] "I said, 'We want {{to create a sense of}} control and largely centered frames with Clive‚Äôs character, and we want to have movement with Denzel‚Äôs.' Having three operators on the same character, I‚Äôd watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady. It was the first time I‚Äôd worked with so many operators where I wasn‚Äôt one myself." [...] Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios. [...] Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses.|$|E

It's the show's ultimate statement about the family, because we're absolutely brutalizing with each other, while there's also no mistaking that we love each other deeply." [...] Author Lynne Layton complimented the performance, saying that [...] "as in her double attitude to materialism, femininity, and everything else, what marks the performance is not that Madonna <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control,</b> but that she is open about {{the pros and cons of}} family life and obviously echoes the experience of many." [...] Her thoughts were shared by John LeLand from Newsday, who complimented the aerobics performed onstage by Madonna and her dancers. Conversely, author Allen Metz commented that although the performance was tightly choreographed, the overall feel was marred due to the song's own [...] "shortcomings". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune felt that the addition of lines from [...] "Family Affair" [...] underlined the [...] "home-is-where-the-heart-is" [...] theme of [...] "Keep It Together". Louis Virtel from The Backlot praised the performance of the song, stating that it served as the [...] "perfect concluding performance."

Sabrina refuses to help Shannon financially, despite Shannon winning a prestigious yet non-paying internship to the Martha Graham Dance Company in New York. Unable {{to come up with the}} money herself, Shannon moves to France for a short time to work as an au pair. Shannon later forms a plan to con her stepbrother, Boone Carlyle, into giving her some of the inheritance she rightly deserved. Playing on her knowledge of Boone's love for her, she makes it appear her boyfriend Brian abuses her. Boone pays Brian to leave her, and Shannon plans to secretly take half the money. During one con in Sydney, her [...] "abusive boyfriend" [...] ruins Shannon's ruse after Boone cuts him a check. Boone storms off to his hotel room and plans to return to the States. When Shannon's boyfriend takes off with all of the money, Shannon goes to Boone's hotel room in Sydney, drunk, and Boone allows her to seduce him. After they have sex, Shannon tells Boone things will go back to the way they had been before. He expresses anger because, as always, they both know she <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of their situation/ relationship. The following morning at the Sydney airport, Sayid Jarrah approaches Shannon, asking her to watch his bag for him. She deftly obliges, but soon leaves it unattended.

She smiles, the platonic love she has for Boone briefly relieving her of her misery. Six hours into the flight, only moments before the crash, Shannon and Boone are momentarily seen as Charlie Pace stumbles through their row.|$|E
