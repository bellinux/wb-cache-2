He maintained the lead until his first pit stop on lap 24 when a refuller was struck by his rear tyre, allowing Häkkinen {{to take over the}} lead until his pit stop two laps later. Michael Schumacher <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> for a further twenty-one laps as he and Häkkinen made their second pit stops together, with Häkkinen emerging in front because Schumacher experienced a slow pit stop. Häkkinen <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> for the remaining twenty-three laps to win the race.|$|E

Michael Schumacher maintained his start line advantage and <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> {{after the first round}} of pit stops. During the course of the second stint of the race, Michael Schumacher began to struggle with tyre wear, allowing Coulthard to close the gap and passed him on lap 40. Coulthard maintained his lead through the second round of pit stops and won the race. Michael Schumacher retired on lap 59 with an engine failure promoting Häkkinen into second position. Barrichello took third, ahead of BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve in fourth.|$|E
50|$|After Ghost gets {{released}} from prison, he meets {{up with the}} crew to plan a heist, {{in which it is}} discovered that two trucks will travel together but that all <b>the</b> money is <b>kept</b> in <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> truck, which holds $12 million.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 2001 the library's {{development}} {{had been}} overseen by a committee, with Ulrich Drepper <b>kept</b> as <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> contributor and maintainer. The steering committee installation {{was surrounded by}} a public controversy as it was openly described by Ulrich Drepper as a failed hostile takeover maneuver by RMS.|$|R
50|$|CityLights marked actress Anwita Paul's debut, {{known by}} her screen name Patralekha. As Paul {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> actor Rao, <b>the</b> production house did not disclose her name until the trailer was released. When press <b>kept</b> questioning about <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> actress, <b>the</b> filmmakers dismissed the question.|$|R
5|$|Di Grassi won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his start line advantage {{on the first}} lap. The race was neutralised on the same lap because of Adam Carroll's stalled car and when the race restarted one lap later Vergne challenged di Grassi for the lead and passed him on lap three. Di Grassi lost second place to Buemi shortly afterwards and the Swiss driver moved into the lead after overtaking Vergne on the sixth lap. Buemi <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> after the mandatory pit stops to switch into his second car but despite having trouble with braking {{in a straight line}} Buemi remained in first place {{for the remainder of the}} event to secure the victory. There were four lead changes among four different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|Johnny Cecotto Jr. won {{the pole}} {{position}} for the feature race by setting the fastest lap in qualifying, but lost the lead to teammate Evans heading into the first corner. Cecotto then understeered into the barrier while holding off Fabio Leimer and Jolyon Palmer spun in avoidance causing the turn to be blocked and the race was stopped because fifteen cars were stranded. Evans led the restarted race but lost the place to Bird after the pit stop phase. Bird opened up a healthy advantage {{over the rest of}} the field to win the race. Quaife-Hobbs started from pole position in the sprint race and <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until Coletti passed him on the third lap. Although his lead diminished because of tyre wear Coletti led the remaining laps of the event to secure the victory.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{maintained}} his lead at the restart, followed by Martin and Kenseth. One lap later, Montoya {{moved into the}} second position, as Martin fell to fifth.

One lap later, Jeff Gordon moved into the ninth position after passing Newman.|$|E
60|$|On and on went one taxicab {{after the}} other. Fifty-fifth Street was passed and still <b>the</b> first turnout <b>kept</b> well in <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> But then a big {{furniture}} van {{appeared out of}} a side street and the cab ahead had to slow down.|$|R
50|$|Metallic lead is {{relatively}} safe to work with, although lead oxide dross formed on <b>the</b> surface of <b>lead</b> is more easily {{absorbed by the}} body, thus {{much more of a}} hazard. As lead burning is a high temperature process, it creates a significant hazard from such dross. Safety precautions are relatively simple: goggles to protect the eyes from molten metal splash, overalls or dustcoat <b>kept</b> in <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> workshop to stop contamination spreading, and dedicated workbenches equipped with air extraction.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{his fifth}} position, Hamilton <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> Drivers' Championship <b>lead</b> with 14 points, closely {{followed}} by Räikkönen and Heidfeld on 11. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren also kept their lead, with their five-point lead from Australia staying intact. BMW Sauber moved into second place on 19, with Ferrari in third on 11.|$|R
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his start line advantage and withstood Häkkinen's attempts to pass him {{going into the}} first corner. Further around the lap, a collision involving four cars prompted the deployment of the safety car and a fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti {{was struck by a}} flying wheel. When the safety car pulled into the pit lane on lap eleven, Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull clear from Häkkinen and <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until his pit stop on the 39th lap. When Häkkinen made his own pit stop three laps later, Michael Schumacher regained the lead which he held to clinch his sixth victory of the 2000 season; Häkkinen finished almost four seconds behind.|$|E
5|$|Rosenqvist won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his start line advantage {{on the first}} lap. He {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field and <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until the mandatory round of pit stops when Buemi took over the first position for one lap until he made his stop. Rosenqvist regained the lead but was required to conserve his car's electrical energy usage because of making a pit stop one lap earlier than the rest of the field, allowing Buemi to narrow the time deficit between the two drivers. Buemi passed Rosenqvist for the lead on the 27th lap and held it for the remainder of the race to clinch the win. There were two lead changes among two different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of his 37th lap Bernhard {{reported}} a front-left puncture to his pit crew after driving over debris. He had difficulty turning into the track's right-hand turns and fell to fourth place behind di Grassi and Tréluyer. The tyre degraded further which damaged his car's bodywork, but he cautiously returned to the pit lane for a replacement front nose, and Webber took over his position. Strakka Racing's entry struck the Porsche's tyre carcass which became lodged in its right-front wheelarch but continued. Webber slowed with a punctured front-left tyre, causing him to return to the pit lane where he pushed back into his garage for ten-minute bodywork repairs. Then his front-axle energy retrieval system was changed, forcing Webber to remain in his garage for more than one hour. The second round of green flag pit stops began after 90 minutes. The No. 7 Audi and the No. 5 Toyota had cosmetic alterations to their rear-ends and the former vehicle was taken over by Fässler. The first Toyota, driven by Davidson, <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> after the pit stops. The first full course caution was shown when Nicki Thiim's No. 95 Aston Martin was hit by Dolan in the No. 38 G-Drive vehicle and went backwards into the Stavelot tyre barrier at a high rate of speed. His car flipped over but he was unhurt. Marshals were required to repair the damaged barrier, and removed debris from the track.|$|E
500|$|A {{breakaway}} {{of eight}} riders {{formed in the}} early part of the race. These were Manuele Boaro (...) , Valerio Agnoli (...) , Dennis Vanendert (...) , Nathan Haas (...) , Maarten Wynants (...) , Thomas Degand (...) , Lluís Mas (...) and Romain Hardy (...) [...] These riders stayed together for approximately the [...] controlled <b>the</b> peloton and <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> breakaway's <b>lead</b> to around three minutes. Boaro attacked the group on the second climb of the Alto de Jaizkibel and opened a gap on the other riders, but he was too far from the finish to make a solo attack last to the finish of the race.|$|R
50|$|KB took race one by just 2s from Travelodge International, then {{moderate}} {{results in}} the following two races <b>kept</b> KB near <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> Unfortunately for Porter the final two races were costly and once again it was the Holmes team's consistency which won the day to secure title number five.|$|R
50|$|Retail {{customer}} deliveries {{began in}} limited numbers in France in December 2012, and availability was increased {{during the first}} quarter of 2013. A total of 48 units were registered in France during December 2012, and cumulative sales reached 5,559 units through December 2013. The Zoe became the top selling all-electric vehicle in the country in January 2013, and <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> monthly <b>lead</b> through December 2013, representing 62.8% of electric car sales in the country during 2013. In addition, the Zoe became the best selling electric car in France accounting for registrations in the electric passenger car segment since 2010 through December 2013.|$|R
5|$|Bird set fast laps while leading and <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> {{after his}} pit {{stop at the}} end of the 16th lap ahead of the yet-to-stop Binder, Ceccon and Evans. Bird was pushing when he slid after {{clipping}} the kerb on the track and glanced the barrier leaving Portier turn on lap 18. Abt was attacking Haryanto for 13th position on lap 28 and went to the outside of Haryanto by braking later than he did. The resulting manoeuvre meant Abt punted Haryanto into the inside barrier with his car's front nose being broken as a consequence. The need for the safety car was avoided as Haryanto's car was extracted from the track quickly. Abt was adjudged to have been too aggressive towards Haryanto by the stewards and was handed a drive-through penalty and was shown a black flag with an orange disc requiring him to make repairs to his car. Dillmann attempted to pass Rosenzweig but ran deep at the Novelle Chicane. He was required to hand the position back to Rosenzweig. Binder made his pit stop on the 29th lap and emerged in seventh place behind Coletti. Bird continued to lead with a seventeen-second advantage over Ceccon who was fending off the faster Evans in third position who himself had Nasr and Calado close behind him.|$|E
5|$|When {{the race}} {{returned}} to green flag conditions on lap 26, de Silvestro held the lead ahead of Franchitti, Hunter-Reay and Kanaan with Tagliani in fifth position. De Silvestro <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> {{for a further}} two laps, with Hunter-Reay's Andretti Autosport car moving ahead of Franchitti on lap 27, repeating his move on Tagliani on the defending series champion. Not long after, Hunter-Reay moved ahead of de Silvestro as the pair were under braking for turn five. Hunter-Reay nearly lost control of his car as his car bottomed out on the straight, with lifted the car slightly airborne. Franchitti further demoted the young Swiss driver to third, moving ahead on lap 29. Behind them, Hideki Mutoh hit Vitor Meira which saw his retirement from the race, and Wheldon hit the back of Tagliani which sent him into Kanaan, resulting in the retirement of the Canadian driver. Rain started falling once again, more heavily than before {{and much of the}} field pitted to change from dry-weather tyres to wet-weather ones. Alex Lloyd aquaplaned into the wall in the second Dale Coyne car, bringing out the caution for the third time, and with rain falling relentlessly, series officials brought out the red flag to allow the weather conditions to pass. After a 36-minute red flag delay, cars returned to the circuit with slicks being the choice of tyre for the track, despite a few wet patches remaining on the circuit. Some cars gambled on wets thinking that the circuit would not dry quickly enough for their tyres to drop off compared to the slicks.|$|E
25|$|In race {{eighteen}} the Kiwis led at {{the start}} {{and up to the}} first mark. They set the speed record of the series, reaching 47.57 knots (55mph, 88 kph) as they rounded the mark, to lead by 5 seconds. They <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> during the first downwind run, but Oracle got ahead at the first crossing on the upwind leg after the Kiwis made a poor tack. Team New Zealand had starboard tack advantage and the lead at the time, but did not properly cover Oracle. The American boat was up on the foils, and powered past the Kiwis. Oracle went on to lead by 57 seconds at the windward gate and <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> for the rest of race, winning by 54 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the lack of {{definite}} articles, according to McHugo, it is clear that such an instruction cannot legitimately be taken to imply that some dogs need not be <b>kept</b> on <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> or that <b>the</b> rule applies only near some ponds. Further, McHugo points out a potential consequence of the logic employed by advocates of a [...] "some" [...] reading. Paragraph 2 (a) of the Resolution, which guarantees [...] "freedom of navigation through international waterways in the area," [...] may allow Arab states to interfere with navigation through some international waterways of their choosing.|$|R
5000|$|Berde's first Hindi {{film was}} Sooraj Barjatya's Maine Pyar Kiya {{starring}} Salman Khan in 1989.

Team Canada, however, <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> in the upset victory.|$|E
25|$|Maechler <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> {{for several}} stages. After stage nine, Maechler was still leading. The mass-start stages were {{dominated}} by break-aways of cyclists who were not considered relevant for the final victory; sixth-placed Charly Mottet was the only cyclist in the top 15 who had real chances of finishing high.|$|E
25|$|The 34th America's Cup {{began in}} stark {{contrast}} to the one-sided races that dominated the 2013 Louis Vuitton Cup. Team New Zealand skippered by Dean Barker led at the first mark, and held it for second (first downward) leg. The gap to Oracle Team USA was only 4 seconds at the bottom mark, and during the upwind third leg the lead changed several times. Team New Zealand led at the top mark by 25 seconds, and <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> until the finish line, winning by 36 seconds.|$|E
5000|$|This was an undulating course, with a {{steep hill}} shortly before the finish. A five man {{breakaway}} group escaped after 9 km, consisting of Jérémy Roy (...) , Blel Kadri (...) , Imanol Erviti (...) , Johnny Hoogerland (...) and Gorka Izagirre (...) , and remained on their own until {{the foot of the}} Mûr-de-Bretagne. Defending champion Alberto Contador was the first to attack in the closing stages, causing several splits in the field, including a group of ten {{at the front of the}} race. As Contador's initial attack failed, Jurgen Van den Broeck tried to break clear, but was caught up by the front group, and Cadel Evans, third in the overall standings at the beginning of the day, held off a final sprint from Contador to win the stage, but the presence of Thor Hushovd in <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> group meant that Hushovd <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> overall <b>lead,</b> while Evans took <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> in <b>the</b> mountains classification.|$|R
50|$|Marco Andretti gave up <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> on lap 204 when he {{made his}} final pit stop. That put Tony Kanaan back into <b>the</b> <b>lead.</b> On lap 217, after a {{brilliant}} run in the top five, Jaime Camara lost control and crashed on the frontstretch. The yellow trapped Andretti a lap down, and <b>kept</b> Kanaan in <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> after <b>the</b> final sequence of pits stops. The rain held off, and Kanaan led {{the rest of the way}} for his first victory of the season.|$|R

25|$|Seeking {{a fourth}} bronze medal, Lithuania would again face the United States. The game {{was a close}} affair, with the lead {{changing}} hands nine times and both teams attempting as many three-point shots as possible (Lithuania converted 21 of their 37 shots, and the United States had 8 out of 18). At half time, the United States were ahead 49–44, after the third quarter they maintained their advantage 74–71.

He pulled away from di Grassi until the race was neutralised on the 22nd lap when the safety car was deployed following a collision between Nelson Piquet Jr. and Jean-Éric Vergne on the previous lap. All drivers elected to switch into their second cars, and Buemi <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> at the lap-26 restart. Buemi reduced his pace to conserve electrical energy to ensure that he could finish the race and di Grassi began to narrow the deficit {{to him in the}} race's closing stages. He was unable to overtake the defensive Buemi who held the lead to secure the victory.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{were playing}} great {{baseball}} throughout the season. José Cruz and Enos Cabell both stole 30 bases. Joe Niekro {{had a great}} year with 21 wins and 3.00 ERA. J. R. Richard won 18 games and set a new personal strikeout record at 313. Joe Sambito came into his own with 22 saves as the Astros closer.
