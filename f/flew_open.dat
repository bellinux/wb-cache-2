5|$|His father William H. McCudden took a {{post at the}} Air Ministry at {{the rank}} of warrant officer after the Great War, but would die tragically at Clapham Junction railway station on 7 July 1920. When he stood up to offer a woman his seat the {{compartment}} door <b>flew</b> <b>open,</b> knocking him {{into the path of}} an oncoming train. Maurice Vincent became a pilot and served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he retired through illness in 1933. He died of colitis the following year, leaving a widow and small daughter.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors <b>flew</b> <b>open</b> and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
25|$|After {{working through}} the checklists to safely power down the shuttle, the crew egressed Atlantis into the Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV). Shortly after, the Houston Mission Control Center handed over Atlantis to the landing convoy at the KSC. The crew {{performed}} the traditional walk-around of the shuttle after walking down the stairs from the CTV. On the runway, they also met NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, KSC Center Director Robert Cabana, shuttle program manager John Shannon, launch director Mike Leinbach, Atlantis flow manager Angie Brewer, and other NASA officials. Charles Bolden and Commander Ferguson spoke briefly on the tarmac. Feguson did note that {{the door to the}} Waste Collection System in shuttle's mid-deck <b>flew</b> <b>open</b> during entry. After the speech, the crew got into the AstroVan for the ride to the crew quarters building where they spend the night before returning to Houston the next day.|$|E

500|$|According to Darryl Dawkins' autobiography, Bavetta was officiating an NBA game {{during the}} mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Earl Strom as his partner for that game. Bavetta {{overruled}} Strom on a crucial last-second personal foul call against the Nets, {{which would have}} been a victory for the 76ers. When the game ended and players were walking to their respective locker rooms, the door to the referees' locker room <b>flew</b> <b>open</b> and Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was allegedly ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom stepped out into the hallway and hollered after Bavetta, [...] "You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?" [...] Strom was fined for the incident.|$|E
500|$|The {{rail traffic}} on Polish railway lines was {{extremely}} dense. An average of 420 German military trains were passing through every 24 hours {{on top of}} internal traffic already in 1941. The Holocaust trains were routinely delayed en route; some transports took many days to arrive. Hundreds of prisoners died from exhaustion, suffocation and thirst while in transit to the camp in the overcrowded wagons. In extreme cases such as the Biała Podlaska transport of 6,000 Jews travelling only a [...] distance, up to 90 per cent of people were already dead when the sealed doors <b>flew</b> <b>open.</b> From September 1942 on, both Polish and foreign Jews were greeted with a brief verbal announcement. An earlier signboard with directions was removed because it was clearly insufficient. [...] The deportees {{were told that they}} had arrived at a transit point on the way to Ukraine and needed to shower and have their clothes disinfected before receiving work uniforms and new orders.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily <b>flew</b> <b>open</b> revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the comic strip came from Dennis Ketcham, the real life son of Hank Ketcham, who was only four {{years old when he}} refused to take a nap and somehow messed up his whole room. Hank tried many possible names for the character, and translated them into rough pencil sketches. But when his studio door <b>flew</b> <b>open</b> and his then-wife Alice, in utter exasperation, exclaimed, [...] "Your son is a menace!", the [...] "Dennis the Menace" [...] name stuck. The character of Henry Mitchell bore a striking resemblance to Ketcham. The Mitchell family of Dennis, Hank/Henry, and Alice were all named after the Ketchams.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2006, the UK BBC {{consumer}} affairs programme Watchdog aired details of over 1,000 incidents involving Clio IIs {{in which the}} bonnet <b>flew</b> <b>open</b> without warning while still being driven, usually at high speeds, and sometimes writing the cars off. [...] The problem {{was found to be}} caused by the catch not being cleaned and lubricated during servicing causing it to stick in the open position. Renault investigated the issue with the aid of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and a [...] "task force" [...] of Renault departments to test the design but found no problem with the bonnet catch and so would not issue a recall. Renault instead wrote to owners of the model and offered to [...] "remedy for free any catches where there has been poor maintenance".|$|E
2500|$|Unspecified {{number of}} {{deportees}} died in transit during Operation Reinhard from suffocation and thirst. No {{food or water}} was supplied. The Güterwagen boxcars were only fitted with a bucket latrine. A small barred window provided little ventilation, which oftentimes resulted in multiple deaths. A survivor of the Treblinka uprising testified about one such train, from Biała Podlaska. When the sealed doors <b>flew</b> <b>open,</b> 90 percent of about 6,000 Jewish prisoners {{were found to have}} suffocated to death. Their bodies were thrown into smouldering mass grave at the [...] "Lazaret". Millions of people were transported in similar trainsets to the extermination camps {{under the direction of the}} German Ministry of Transport, and tracked by an IBM subsidiary, until the official date of closing of the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex in December 1944.|$|E

2500|$|Strom was officiating a NBA game {{during the}} mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Dick Bavetta as his partner for that game.

Suddenly Dick Bavetta ran across floor to the scorer's table, saying, [...] "No! No! I got a push off against McGinnis!" [...] Strom then {{challenged}} Bavetta, [...] "Are you overruling my call? I got pushing off right here!" [...] Bavetta insisted, which reversed Strom's call and the Nets wound up with the victory. With the game over, players were walking to their respective locker rooms when the door to the referees' locker room <b>flew</b> <b>open</b> and Dick Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom.

2500|$|A {{follow up}} report was {{published}} on February 18, 1890 with the title, [...] "A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Mulhattanish Flavor from Adams Station." [...] In the late 19th century, Joseph Mulhattan was a known hoaxer of newspaper articles. The article was republished {{a few days}} later with the subtitle [...] "More Tales of a Fishy Flavor." [...] In the account, the entity was referred to only as the witch. The article reports that a Mr. Johnson was visiting Buck Smith and were discussing a recent visitation of the ghost at his home. They heard a knocking at the door, and when they opened the door, the knocking began at another door. They sat down and the dog began to fight with something invisible. Two minutes later, the door <b>flew</b> <b>open</b> and fire spread across the room blown by a cyclonic wind with the coals disappearing as they tried to put it out. That evening Mr. Johnson started home on his horse and something jumped on the back grabbing his shoulder as he tried to restrain the horse. He felt it jump off as he neared his home and move in the leaves into the woods.|$|E
