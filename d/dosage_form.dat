25|$|It {{has been}} found that {{bevirimat}} does not inhibit the cytochrome P450 system or interact with the human P-glycoprotein. Unformulated bevirimat is not well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood. Some of the less desirable properties of unformulated bevirimat and its salts include: inadequate bioavailability, poor solubility of the pharmaceutical composition in gastric fluid, insufficient dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, below standard long term safety profile for oral dosage forms, below standard long term chemical and physical stability of the final <b>dosage</b> <b>form,</b> tendency for conversion to metastable forms, lengthy dissolution times for oral dosage forms, and precipitation in gastric or intestinal fluids. Some pharmaceutical compositions of formulated bevirimat have shown to have better properties over unformulated bevirimat. Some of these properties include: improved bioavailability, improved solubility of the composition in gastric fluid, improved dispersion of bevirimat in gastric fluid, improved safety for oral dosage forms, improved chemical and physical stability of the oral <b>dosage</b> <b>form,</b> decreased conversion to metastable forms, and decreased rate of precipitation in gastric fluid. Bevirimat was rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with detectable concentrations present in the plasma within 15 minutes after administration and peak plasma concentrations were achieved approximately one to three hours after administration. The plasma had a mean plasma elimination half-life ranging from 58 to 80 hours. This long half-life of bevirimat supports once-daily dosing. Elimination of bevirimat is primarily via hepatobiliary routes, with renal elimination counting for less than 1% of the dose.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rectal route}} is an {{effective}} route of administration for many medications, especially those used {{at the end of}} life. The walls of the rectum absorb many medications quickly and effectively. Medications delivered to the distal one-third of the rectum at least partially avoid the [...] "first pass effect" [...] through the liver, which allows for greater bio-availability of many medications than that of the oral route. Rectal mucosa is highly vascularized tissue that allows for rapid and effective absorption of medications. A suppository is a solid <b>dosage</b> <b>form</b> that fits for rectal administration. In hospice care, a specialized rectal catheter, designed to provide comfortable and discreet administration of ongoing medications provides a practical way to deliver and retain liquid formulations in the distal rectum, giving health practitioners a way to leverage the established benefits of rectal administration.|$|E

40|$|Controlled (modified) release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> {{are one of}} the key {{concepts}} in drug delivery, leading to enhanced drug bioavailability and increased patient’s compliance. However conventional modified release <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> encounter one big disadvantage- lack of site-specific drug delivery. Scientists developed different kinds of targeted oral controlled release forms. One of these are gastro-retentive systems- systems which can remain in the stomach region for prolonged period of time and thereby release the active compound in controlled fashion. Floating <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> are the most promising approach of all gastro-retentive systems. They are capable to float over the gastric content in longer time intervals. This article makes a review on floating <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> in general, different approaches for achieving floatation, advantages and disadvantages of this drug delivery concept.

METHODS: Consumers were recruited from five community pharmacies in Brisbane, Queensland and invited to participate in a structured interview.

The two <b>dosage</b> <b>forms</b> were orally administrated to beagle dogs, and then the in vivo SM·HCl pharmacokinetics was investigated and compared. RESULTS: The optimal SM·HCl sustained-release formulation was achieved by mixing slow- and rapid-release pellets (9 : 1, w/w).
