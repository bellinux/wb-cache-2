40|$|The word {{tradition}} {{has a very}} specific meaning in linguistics: the passing down of a text, {{which may have been}} completed or corrected by different copyists at different times, when the concept of authorship was not the same as it is today. When reading an ancient text the word tradition must be in the reader's mind. To discuss one of the problems an ancient text poses to its modern readers, this work deals with one of the first printed medical texts in Portuguese, the Regimento proueytoso contra ha pestenença, and draws a parallel between it and two related texts, A moche profitable treatise against the pestilence, and the Recopilaçam das cousas que conuem guardar se no modo de preseruar à Cidade de Lixboa E os sãos, & curar os que esteuerem enfermos de Peste. The problems which arise out of the textual structure of those books show <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> establish a tradition of another type, the medical tradition.

40|$|There {{are several}} factors that produce {{stability}} of the multinational societies and many other that cause instability. With this work the attempt {{is to examine the}} possibilities of successful accommodation and keep the unity and {{stability of the}} country. The main three aspects that the analysis includes are: political autonomy and institutionalization of separate jurisdictions within which minorities (national groups) enjoy extensive devolved powers of self-government; power-sharing that includes representatives of minorities in the governing of the larger state; principle of inclusiveness that allows all members of a self-governing groups to accede to the state-wide political process Multinational federations with self-governing constituent units, usually combine mainly the above-mentioned three ingredients. However, the constitutional arrangement, the electoral system, party system are strongly influenced by the presence of the national minorities or national groups. The main issue is to accommodate these groups and to give them the possibility of participation in a state decision-making process. Several adjustments were made, but the empirical cases show <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find the suitable arrangement for multinational democracies. Consociational and federal arrangement were found to be most matching systems for deeply divided societies.

In the drive-by ecosystem many exploit servers run the same exploit kit {{and it is}} a challenge understanding whether the exploit server {{is part of a larger}} operation. In this paper we propose a technique to identify exploit servers managed by the same organization. We collect over time how exploit servers are configured and what malware they distribute, grouping servers with similar con-figurations into operations. Our operational analysis reveals that although indi-vidual exploit servers have a median lifetime of 16 hours, long-lived operations exist that operate for several months. To sustain long-lived operations miscre-ants are turning to the cloud, with 60 % of the exploit servers hosted by special-ized cloud hosting services. We also observe operations that distribute multiple malware families and that pay-per-install affiliate programs are managing exploit servers for their affiliates to convert traffic into installations. To understand <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> take down exploit servers, we analyze the abuse reporting process and issue abuse reports for 19 long-lived servers. We describe the interaction with ISPs and hosting providers and monitor the result of the report. We find that 61 % of the reports are not even acknowledged.

In order to understand this phenomenon it is essential to show its long and violent history as I did in the frrst part ofthis text. The core of my work focuses on the rapid growth of intemational terrorism in the late 1960 's and early 70 's with emphasis on the events that took place at the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972. On 5 th September 1972 group of eight Palestinian terrorists entered the olympic vilIage and seizured 11 Israeli athletes and coaches. The terrorists demanded the re 1 ease and safe passage to Egypt of 234 Palestinians and non-Arabs jailed in Israe 1, along with two German prisoners, Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, who were members of the Red Army Faction.

40|$|Different {{theories}} in Organizational Behavior propose different models to determine equitable treatment of employees in an organization. Justice, fairness, or equity are three overlapping concepts used by authors {{to prove their}} fundamental importance in the workplace. On the other hand, researchers have studied the cause and effect relationships between motivation and/or satisfaction and pay-for-performance in the organizational setting. There were less attentions given by researchers to the understandings {{of the needs of}} people in the organizations. Indeed, managers and supervisors need to be more familiar with the human talents and individual differences in the organizational settings. Today, businessmen are aware of <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> achieve full utilization of human resources. Increase productivity, performance, motivation, and satisfaction etc. are concepts concerned many researchers. However, a few studies discussed the relationship between the employee satisfaction and equal pay related to his or her needs. Equity, equality, and equitable situations reviewed by Adams 1965, Dittrich and Carrell 1979, and Hegtvedt 1989. Most of the studies have examined the relations between equity perceptions. employee job satisfaction, and turnover (Dittrich, and Carrel 1979). On the other hand, other researches have been focused on drawing an effective pay system in the organizations based on performance (Sullivan 1988, Minken 1988, and McGinty 1989). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to vitalize the personal needs - need for achievement, need for affiliation, and need for power- as key factors related to equitable pay. The philosophy behind this research paper is to prove that employees are motivated when their needs are not met; therefore, a relationship between the three personal needs as well as the type of paystructure under equity is taking place.

40|$|The great {{variability}} in income irradiance over a plant canopy makes difficult {{the comparison of}} photosynthesis rates among leaves in a plant and their integration. In this study, photosynthetical rates of ten different leaves of a coffee plant were obtained during a day. The daily variation in photosynthetic rates showed a peak between 7 : 00 h and 9 : 00 h with higher values measured for the leaves positioned at the sunrise direction and northern orientation. Lower values were consistently observed for leaves at inner position of the plant. After 9 : 00 h, despite the increase in photosynthetically active radiation, photosynthetic rates decreased steadily to reach negligible values at sunset. The reductions on photosynthesis ratescan also be attributed to increasing stomatal resistance. Since number of leaves is highly variable in coffee plants, those results make evident <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> integrate and estimate whole plant photosynthesis by taking the average of 10 leaves. A grande variabilidade na radiação solar incidindo em uma planta dificulta a comparação e integração das taxas fotossintéticas obtidas de diferentes folhas. Neste trabalho foram medidas, durante um dia, astaxas fotossintéticas de dez folhas, localizadas em pontos representativos em uma planta de cafeeiro. Foram observadas máximas taxas entre as 7 : 00 e 9 : 00 h, sendo os maiores valores encontrados nas folhas voltadas ao nascer do sol e na orientação norte. Os menores valores foram consistentemente observados nas folhas posicionadas no interior da planta. Após as 9 : 00 h, a despeito do aumento na radiação fotossintéticamente ativa, as taxas fotossintéticas diminuíram constantemente até o final do dia. Estas reduções podem ser atribuídas também aos crescentes valores de resistência estomática. Uma vez que o número de folhas é altamentevariável em plantas de cafeeiro, os resultados evidenciam a dificuldade em integrar e estimar a fotossíntese de uma planta inteira usando médias de medidas tomadas em dez folhas individuais...|$|E
