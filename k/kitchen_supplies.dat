50|$|Low-end {{restaurants}} and street vendors {{are the biggest}} end users of gutter oil, as they operate with lower profit margins than bigger restaurants. Oil {{is one of the}} largest <b>kitchen</b> <b>supply</b> costs for restaurants, so obtaining cheaper oil can allow a marginal restaurant to reduce its overall expenses. Chinese food is generally heavily dependent on oil due to most foods being fried, so cheaper meal prices for many price-sensitive consumers are possible if gutter oil is used instead of virgin oil. The situation becomes more serious because it is hard to distinguish reprocessed gutter oil from legitimate oil. Bleach is used to transform gutter oil's dark color into a more natural-looking one, and alkali additives are used to neutralize the abnormal pH caused by containing high concentrations of animal fats.|$|R
