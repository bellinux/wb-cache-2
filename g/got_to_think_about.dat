[...] In October 2010, when Alex Garland was asked what was happening with 28 Months Later, he declared: [...] "I'll answer that completely honestly. When we made 28 Days Later, the rights were frozen between {{a group of people who}} are no longer talking to each other. And so, the film is never going to happen unless those people start talking to each other again. There is no script as far as I'm aware."

All the old hard-and-fast traditions and drags on life are in the melting-pot. Death's boiling their bones, and they'll make excellent stock for the new soup. When you prune and dock things, the sap flows quicker. Regrets and repinings and repressions are going out of fashion; we shall have no time or use for them in the future. You're going to make life--well, that's something to be thankful for, anyway. You've kept Cyril Morland alive. And--well, you know, we've all been born; some of us properly, and some improperly, and there isn't a ha'porth of difference {{in the value of the}} article, or the trouble of bringing it into the world.

6000|$|... "Then I {{call it a}} beastly shame. More than that, I call it a downright dishonourable action!" [...] Easton said hotly. [...] "Here we {{are going}} to abandon a town of some twenty {{thousand}} inhabitants to these fanatics. Not only that, but to give up to their vengeance all the tribes between Wady Halfa and Metemmeh who have trusted in our promises, have thrown in their lot with us, and have for the last four months been doing all our transport. Our fathers used to be proud to call themselves Englishmen, but, by Jove, there is very little reason for us to be. That Boer business was shameful and humiliating enough, but this is worse still. I don't say that we are bound to go on to Khartoum, although it would be the best and cheapest and most satisfactory mode in every way of settling this Mahdi and ensuring order in the Soudan; but I do think that we are bound to hold the river from Korti downwards to protect the tribes that have been friendly to us, and to save this town from ruin and desolation. Not only this town, but all the peaceful villages down the river. Besides, so long as we are here the Arabs will see that the Mahdi is not all-powerful, and may sooner or later rise against his tyranny. Well, I never thought this campaign was going to end in the disgraceful abandonment of the Nile Valley from Korti to Wady Haifa. However," [...] he went on, checking himself suddenly, [...] "it is of no use talking of that now; we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> your expedition, which to us three is a far more important business.

"You have {{improved}} wonderfully, Fan, since you first came," [...] she said, [...] "but I fear {{that this kind}} of improvement will not be of much practical use, and my conscience is not quite satisfied about you. I have taken this responsibility on myself, and must not go on shutting my eyes to it. Some day it will be necessary for you {{to go out into the}} world to earn your own living; that is what we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> Remember that you can't have me always to take care of you; I might go abroad, or die, or get married, and then you would be left to your own resources. You couldn't make your living by simply looking pretty; you must be useful as well as ornamental; and I have taught you nothing--teaching is not in my line. It would be a thousand pities if you were ever to sink down to the servant-girl level: we must think of something better than that. A young lady generally aspires to be a governess. But then she must know everything--music, drawing, French, German, Latin, mathematics, algebra; all that she must have at her finger-ends, and be able to gabble political economy, science, and metaphysics to boot. All that is beyond you--unattainable as the stars. But you needn't break your heart about it. She doesn't get much. Her wages are about equal to those of a kitchen-maid, who can't spell, but only peel potatoes. And the more learned she is, the more she is disliked and snubbed by her betters; and she never marries, in spite of what the Family Herald says, but goes on toiling until she is fifty, and then retires to live alone on fifteen shillings a week in some cheap lodging for the remnant of her dreary life. No, poor Fan, you can't hope to be anything as grand as a governess." ...|$|E

None of that will be down to Outcast directly, but we've done our bit. We've contributed to the debate, and the debate goes on." ...|$|R

5000|$|Margot Did {{began her}} three-year-old {{debut in the}} Listed Pavilion Stakes at Ascot on 27 April, {{starting}} favourite but finishing third behind Perfect Tribute and Aneedah. Having raced over six furlongs in all of her starts up to that point, the filly was dropped in distance for a minor stakes race at York on 12 May. She finished fourth to Night Carnation but looked most unlucky as her saddle slipped during the race after she was hampered in the early stages. On 11 June the filly started second favourite behind Night Carnation in the Listed Scurry Stakes over the same distance at Sandown Park Racecourse. Turner tracked the leader Button Moon {{before going to the}} front two furlongs from the finish. She accelerated away from her rivals in the closing stages and won by five lengths from the colt Dinkum Diamond, with Night Carnation in fourth.

McCrary also said that it seemed obvious that Andersen had been guided since the details changed from interrogation to interrogation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Even though speech {{recognition}} {{is a broad}} subject, the commercial and personal use implementations are rare. Although some promising solutions are available for speech synthesis and recognition, {{most of them are}} tuned to English. The acoustic and language model for these systems are for English language. Most of them require a lot of configuration before they can be used. If we go to the rural area across the India then still there are people who don’t understand English as well as can’t speak proper English. So this available {{speech recognition}} system is of no use for these people. There are so many regional languages in India, but being Maharashtrian we <b>got</b> inspired <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Speech Recognition system for Marathi. There are several problems that need to be solved before speech recognition can become more useful. The amount of pattern matching and feature extraction techniques is large and the decision on which ones to use is debatable. After studying the history of speech recognition we found that the very popular feature extraction technique Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) is used in many speech recognition applications {{and one of the most}} popular pattern matching techniques in speaker dependent speech recognition is Dynamic time warping (DTW). The signal processing techniques, MFCC and DTW are explained and discussed in detail and these techniques have been implemented in MATLAB...|$|R

Suzain was delighted with his team’s performance and described their play {{in the first half}} as complete.

[...] "This is Maziya's first ever Charity Shield win, they can never win it again for the first time. So we've <b>got</b> the chance <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> other competitions.

To be sure we hadn't seen nothing of her at MacFarland's since the night when Andy bounced her pal with the small size in foreheads, but that didn't worry me. If I'd been her, I'd have stopped away the same as she done, seeing that young Andy still had his hump. I took it for granted, as I'm telling you, that she was all right, and that the reason we didn't see nothing of her was that she was taking her patronage elsewhere.|$|R
500|$|The {{writers and}} {{producers}} <b>got</b> together <b>to</b> discuss what direction {{they would take}} for the seventh series. They wanted to repeat the same style for series six, which was to add a serial element to be carried throughout {{the duration of the}} series. They <b>got</b> together <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what they would believe to be a big political story that would affect politics in the United Kingdom in within twelve to eighteen months after their initial meetings early in 2008. They settled on using Russia, which was facing a resurgence in power after the Cold War, which the producers felt, in subtle ways, would threaten the security of the west. Sometime through the writing process, the producers set up a story-arc, Sugarhorse, to be a threat throughout the series and have it resolved by the finale. The writers enjoyed making the Sugarhorse storyline because {{it was one of the}} instances that [...] "really brings Harry to the edge" [...] and causing him to doubt everything he has done or achieved. The writing team took several meetings together to discuss what it is and how it should work into the storyline. Christian Spurrier noted it was [...] "kind of a headache" [...] to figure out how to [...] "weave it in" [...] to the series and work out what parts would be used in which episodes. The producers wanted to use a scene relating to Sugarhorse as the finale scene of every episode it was featured in, as the producers believed it would provide a [...] "right hook" [...] to the audience. Adding the new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the characters should trust.|$|R

5000|$|In February, Darlan was matched against more {{experienced}} rivals in the Betfair Hurdle, a handicap race {{in which he}} carried a weight of 150 pounds and started at odds of 12/1 {{in a field of}} twenty runners. He was making progress towards the leaders and appeared to be going well when he fell at the second last hurdle. On 13 March, Darlan made his first and only appearance at the Cheltenham Festival when he contested the Grade I Supreme Novices' Hurdle. He was ridden by McCoy and was made the 7/1 second favourite in the nineteen runner field, behind the Dermot Weld-trained Galileo's Choice, a Group race winner on the flat. He was restrained in the early stages before making progress throughout {{the second half of the}} race. He took second place from Trifolium in the final strides, but was unable to catch the Donald McCain-trained Cinders and Ashes, who won by one and a quarter lengths. This was Darlan's only career defeat in a race in which he completed the course. A spokesman for J P McManus said that Darlan [...] "ran a cracker but just found one too good. There are no excuses." [...] A month later, Darlan started 7/4 favourite for the Grade II Tangle Teaser Top Novices' Hurdle at Aintree Racecourse with his main opposition appearing to come from Prospect Wells, a former flat racer who had won the Prix Greffulhe and finished second in the Grand Prix de Paris. Darlan took the lead at the final hurdle and went away to win by three and three quarter lengths from Captain Conan (also trained by Henderson), with Prospect Wells seven lengths back in third. After the race, Henderson said, [...] "One day Darlan will jump fences. He’s a big weakly sort of a horse. He’s got a lot of physical development in him still. I suspect he might stay over hurdles but we’ve only brushed at it. We’ve <b>got</b> all summer <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] while McCoy described the winner as [...] "a good horse with the potential to be a very good horse".
