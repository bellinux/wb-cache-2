25|$|Anyway, I keep picturing {{all these}} little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me. And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day.</b> I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E

60|$|The {{next time}} Colville came {{he found himself}} alone with Imogene, who {{asked him what he}} had been <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R

60|$|She {{walked away}} with firm footsteps. She felt stronger, more of a woman than she had <b>done</b> <b>all</b> <b>day.</b> Graveling {{made no attempt to}} follow her. He sat and smoked in stolid silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{know what}} is the matter with you," [...] said the girl, in a soft voice; [...] "you have got nothing to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> and you live alone, except for your housekeeper." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is the old}} fable reversed; {{man said}} woman had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> but to enjoy herself. Making a potato pie! What sort of work was that? Making a potato pie was a lark; anybody could make a potato pie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very kind," [...] {{said the}} latter. [...] "Ah! {{you ought to}} have seen that island. Beautiful yellow sands and palm-trees; cocoa-nuts to be ’ad for the picking, and nothing to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> but lay about in the sun and swim in the sea." ...|$|E

"Dat true enough, sar, but Sam's {{appetite}} {{bigger than}} usual, noting to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> sitting in de woods, waiting for night to come {{so as to}} go on again; so had to eat, and de food all went before Sam thought dat dere was two more days before he meet you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dammy," [...] George {{said to a}} {{confidential}} friend, [...] "she looked like a China doll, which has nothing to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> but to grin and wag its head. By Jove, Will, it was all I I could do to prevent myself from throwing the sofa-cushion at her." [...] He restrained that exhibition of sentiment, however.|$|E
60|$|Surprisingly {{to those}} who knew him, Mr. Penway {{was as good as}} his word. Certainly Kirk's terms had been {{extremely}} generous; but he had thrown away many a contract of equal value in his palmy days. Possibly his activity was due to his liking for Kirk; or it may have been that the prospect of sitting by with a cigar while somebody else worked, with nothing to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> except offer criticism, and advice, appealed to him.|$|E
6000|$|This knot I knit, [...] To {{know the}} thing I know not yet, [...] That I may see [...] The man that shall my husband be; [...] How he goes, {{and what he}} wears, [...] And what he <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>days</b> and years.|$|R

"Tell me," [...] she asked, {{as soon as}} {{the small}} maid-servant who brought in their first dish had disappeared, [...] "what have you been <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>day?</b> Have you been letting houses or {{surveying}} land or book-keeping, or have you been out to Marston Rise?" ...|$|R
50|$|Todd Barry as Todd. A {{friend and}} rival of Louie's who {{constantly}} criticizes and patronizes him, albeit in jest.

60|$|MRS. BRENNAN. In the {{new place}} she's goin' you'll {{not have to}} pay a cent, and that's a blessing! It's small good they've done her here for all the money they've taken. (Gazing about the room critically.) It's neat and clean enough; and why shouldn't it, a tiny room and the lot of them nothing to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> but scrub. (Scornfully.) Two sticks of chairs and a table! They don't give much for the money.|$|E
6000|$|... "No wonder I have to paint," [...] she said, [...] "when I am so {{worn out}} with poverty and hard work--not like the lovely Mrs. Q., who {{has nothing to}} <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> except spend the money that I ought to have. I'll {{tell you what it}} is, my fine fellow: you had better be careful, or I'll have that pretty cuckoo out of her soft nest, and pluck her {{borrowed}} feathers off her, like the monkey did to the parrot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] {{replied the}} hunter, {{resuming}} his paddle. [...] "I often wonder how them white-faced fellows in the settlements manage to keep {{body and soul}} together--a-sittin', as they <b>do,</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> in the house, and a-lyin' all night in a feather bed. For my part, rather than live as they do, I would cut my way up streams like them we've just passed every day and all day, and sleep {{on top of a}} flat rock o' nights, under the blue sky, all my life through." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> Beric?" [...] his mother asked. [...] "I looked to see you long before this, and should have thought that some {{accident}} had befallen you had I not known that the news would have been speedily brought me had it been so." ...|$|R
60|$|The colour {{was in her}} cheeks. To {{have spoken}} {{outright}} about her mother--still, it was only to Mr. Bowley, who loved her, as everybody must; but to speak was unnatural to her, yet it was awful to feel, as she had <b>done</b> <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> that she MUST tell some one.|$|R
6000|$|... 12. On {{the other}} hand, I, who {{had nothing to}} <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> but what I liked, and could wander at will among all the best beauties of the globe--nor that without {{sufficient}} power to see and to feel them, was habitually a discontented person, and frequently a weary one; and the reproachful thought which always rose in my mind when in that unconquerable listlessness of surfeit from excitement I found myself unable to win even a momentary pleasure from the fairest scene, was always: [...] "If but Mr. Harrison were here instead of me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That’s it, sir. Why, {{look at them}} at Portsmouth! They just go out of {{a morning}} and drill on the common for a bit, {{and then they have}} nothing else to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> but to stroll about the town and talk to the girls. How can you expect a man to have any muscle to speak of when he never does a stroke of hard work? I don’t say they don’t fight well, for I own they do their duty like men in that line; {{but when it comes to}} work, why, they ain’t in it with a jack-tar. I do believe I could pull a couple of them over a line.” ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{an awfully}} long time, that {{eighteen}} days at sea, on the Royal Mail Steamship Don, bound for Kingston, Jamaica, with John Cann's secret for ever on one's mind, {{and nothing to}} <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> by way of outlet for one's burning energy, but to look, hour after hour, at the monotonous face of the seething water. But at last the journey was over; and before Cecil Mitford had been twenty-four hours at Date Tree Hall, the chief hotel in Kingston, he had already hired a boat and sailed across the baking hot harbour to Port Royal, {{to look in the}} dreary, sandy cemetery for any sign or token of John Cann's grave.|$|E
6000|$|... {{advanced}} upon:e,--which he <b>did</b> <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> in {{a purely}} meditative posture. Rutowski numbers 35,000, now on this ground, with immensity of cannon; 32,000 we, {{with only the}} usual field-artillery, and such a Tschonengrund, with its half-frozen quagmires ahead. A ticklish case for the old man, as he grimly reconnoitres it, in the winter morning.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mere fact}} of being born upon {{one or the}} other side of the {{watershed}} roughly formed by these two groups is the most significant single cultural factor tending to influence what one <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> long throughout one's life; whom one marries; when one gets up in the morning; whether one belongs to the Holy Roller or Presbyterian church; or drives a Ford or a Buick....23-4 ...|$|R
60|$|It was snowing {{slowly and}} persistently, {{as it had}} <b>done</b> <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> when Henry Alton of Somasco ranch stood {{struggling}} with a half-tamed Cayuse pony in a British Columbian settlement. The Cayuse had laid its ears back, and was describing a circle round him, scattering mud and snow, while the man who gripped the bridle in a lean, brown hand watched it without impatience, admiringly.|$|R
60|$|If {{this were}} {{the history of the}} people who wait at home, instead {{of the history of the}} warriors, rich credit would be given to Mrs. Golden for {{enduring}} the long, lonely days, listening for Una's step. A proud, patient woman with nothing to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> but pick at a little housework, and read her eyes out, and wish that she could run in and be neighborly with the indifferent urbanites who formed about her a wall of ice. Yet so confused are human purposes that this good woman who adored her daughter also sapped her daughter's vigor. As the office loomed behind all of Una's desires, so behind the office, in turn, was ever the shadowy thought of the appealing figure there at home; and toward her mother Una was very compassionate.|$|E
60|$|There {{could have}} been a garden. Marguerite might have kept {{chickens}} and a cow. That sort of girl, brought up to hard work and by no means too well educated, is all the better for having something to do. Later, with the gradual arrival of the family, a good, all-round woman might have been hired in to assist. Faust, of course, would have had his study and got to work again; that would have kept him out of further mischief. The idea that a brainy man, his age, was going to be happy with nothing to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> but fool round a petticoat was ridiculous from the beginning. Valentine--a good fellow, Valentine, with nice ideas--would have spent his Saturdays to Monday with them. Over a pipe and a glass of wine, he and Faust would have discussed the local politics.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} to <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>day,</b> but to sit on deck and watch the brigantine. Most of the blacks had been landed, and {{only three or four}} sailors {{remained}} on watch on deck. Frank and George Lechmere, in their broad straw hats, sat and smoked in the deck chairs; the former's eyes wandering over the mountains as if in search of something that might point out Bertha's hiding place. The hills were for the most part covered with trees, with here and there a little clearing and a patch of cultivated ground, with two or three huts in the centre. With the glasses solitary huts could be seen, half hidden by trees, here and there; and an occasional little wreath of light smoke curling up showed that there were others entirely hidden in the forest.|$|E
60|$|Sylvia {{had known}} many sad uprisings, but never a sadder one than this, and the hours that {{followed}} aged {{her more than}} any year had <b>done.</b> <b>All</b> <b>day</b> she wandered aimlessly to and fro, for the inward conflict would not let her rest. The house seemed home no longer when its presiding genius was gone, and everywhere some token of his former presence touched her with its mute reproach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{other people}} must judge for themselves, {{and those who}} go to London may think nothing of Bath. But I, {{who live in a}} small retired village in the country, can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home; for here are a variety of amusements, a variety of things to be seen and <b>done</b> <b>all</b> <b>day</b> long, which I can know nothing of there." ...|$|R
60|$|They dined together, sumptuously. The wine flowed freely, {{as indeed}} it had <b>done</b> <b>all</b> <b>day.</b> Sir Mulberry drank to recompense himself for his recent abstinence; the young lord, to drown his indignation; and the {{remainder}} of the party, because the wine was of the best and they had nothing to pay. It was nearly midnight when they rushed out, wild, burning with wine, their blood boiling, and their brains on fire, to the gaming-table.|$|R
