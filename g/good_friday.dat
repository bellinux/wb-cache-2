5|$|According to Njal's saga, Bróðir {{tried by}} sorcery {{to predict the}} outcome of the battle against Brian. He augured that if the battle were on <b>Good</b> <b>Friday,</b> King Brian would fall but win the battle; but if they fought on any day before, all who opposed Brian would be killed. Brian was unwilling to fight on <b>Good</b> <b>Friday,</b> as he would not fight on a fast day, but the Danes forced the battle to the Friday, which fell that year on 23 April.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{establish}} the exact date of <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> by assuming that the darkness described at Jesus's crucifixion was a solar eclipse. This research has not yielded conclusive results, and <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> is recorded as being at Passover, which is held at the time of a full moon. Further, the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth, or three hours, which is much, much longer than the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse's totality. In the Western hemisphere, there are few reliable records of eclipses before 800 AD, until the advent of Arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period. The first recorded observation of the corona was made in Constantinople in 968 AD.|$|E

The organisation aims to uphold an uncompromising form of Irish republicanism and opposes any political settlement that falls short of Irish unity and independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{third section}} {{discusses}} {{the rulers of}} secular society and their flaws. The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section as he looks back on his period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{permanent}} garrisons in Northern Ireland throughout its history, the British Army was deployed as a peacekeeping force from 1969 to 2007 in Operation Banner. Initially, this was (in the wake of unionist attacks on nationalist communities in Derry and Belfast) to prevent further loyalist attacks on Catholic communities; it developed into support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and its successor, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) against the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). Under the 1998 <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> Agreement, there was a gradual {{reduction in the number}} of soldiers deployed. In 2005, after the PIRA declared a ceasefire, the British Army dismantled posts, withdrew many troops and restored troop levels to those of a peace-time garrison.|$|E
