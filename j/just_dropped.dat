5|$|In all {{first-class}} cricket in 1921, Rhodes scored 1,474 runs at {{an average}} of 39.83. This included his highest first-class score of 267 not out against Leicestershire, struck on the day England began the second Test, having <b>just</b> <b>dropped</b> Rhodes. Rhodes took 141 wickets in the season, {{at an average}} of 13.27. In the autumn, he travelled to India, coaching and playing for the Maharaja of Patiala's private team; Rhodes repeated this trip every year until 1927, sometimes accompanied by other players. On five occasions in India he completed a 1,000 runs and 100 wickets double, although most of these games were not first-class.|$|E

25|$|On June 26, 2011, Beasley {{was driving}} in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka when he was pulled over by a {{policeman}} for speeding. The policeman noticed that the car smelled of a strong odor of marijuana. The officer allegedly found marijuana {{in a plastic bag}} under the front passenger seat. However, Beasley said the marijuana was not his, but belonged to a friend whom he had <b>just</b> <b>dropped</b> off. Beasley was consequently fined and ticketed.|$|E

25|$|On 8 January 2011, one of Metrobus' {{vehicles}} was hijacked {{while in}} service in Merstham. The bus was empty having <b>just</b> <b>dropped</b> {{off the last}} passengers, and the bus driver managed to escape unharmed, along with the cash box the hijackers had tried to steal. The hijacked bus was then driven through the area, striking a number of parked cars and signs, before being reversed into another Metrobus vehicle which was in service with passengers. There were no injuries, but the road was closed {{for a number of}} hours while the police investigated. Two men, aged 23 and 25, were arrested. One was released on bail and the other was charged with seven separate offences.|$|E
25|$|Not {{everyone}} saw it that way, however, {{most notably}} the project's original producer David O. Selznick. After he sold the property to RKO to raise some quick cash, Selznick lobbied hard to get Grant replaced with Joseph Cotten; the United States had <b>just</b> <b>dropped</b> atomic bombs on Japan and Selznick argued that the first film out about atomic weaponry {{would be the most}} successful—and Grant was not available for three months. Selznick also believed that Grant would be difficult to manage and make high salary demands, but most telling of all—Selznick owned Cotten's contract. Hitchcock and RKO production executive William Dozier invoked a clause in the project sale contract, blocked Selznick's attempts, and Grant was signed to play opposite Bergman by late August 1945.|$|E

500|$|South Park became {{immediately}} one of {{the most}} popular shows on cable television, averaging consistently between 3.5 and 5.5 million viewers. The Denver-based Tele-Communications Inc., the largest cable operator in the U.S. at the time, had <b>just</b> <b>dropped</b> Comedy Central, but when South Park debuted, Denver newspapers and radio stations heavily criticized the operator for not carrying the hit show of the two local filmmakers—Parker and Stone. [...] Doug Herzog, Comedy Central's president at the time, said that the public [...] "went nuts" [...] as the network received about ten million new subscriptions through Tele-Communications Inc. alone, [...] "which at that time was unheard of." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Western Conference Finals, the Mavericks met the Spurs again. In Game 1 in San Antonio, Nowitzki scored 38 {{points on}} Duncan and led {{his team to}} a 113–110 win. In Game 2, Duncan quickly put Nowitzki in foul trouble, and the Spurs {{equalised}} the series with a 132–110 win. In Game 3, Nowitzki went up for a rebound and Spurs guard Manu Ginóbili collided with his knee, forcing {{him out of the}} series: without their top scorer, the Mavericks still fought valiantly and trailed, 3–2, before Spurs guard Steve Kerr got hot from beyond the arc late in Game 6 to help San Antonio clinch the series with a 90–78 victory. Don Nelson later commented: [...] "We were playing so well for so long and the bottom <b>just</b> <b>dropped</b> out...We went cold at the wrong time." [...] Nowitzki took very little consolation in the fact that he again was voted [...] "European Basketballer of the Year" [...] and was named [...] "Best European Basketballer" [...] in a general survey of the NBA general managers.|$|E
500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian {{was less}} favourable, stating the {{producers}} [...] "promised us a cliffhanger, and now we're left the whole summer long to contemplate whether our favourite show can really have <b>just</b> <b>dropped</b> the ball. Oh {{there was plenty}} to love about this mid-season finale, and even more to pick over. But as an hour of drama {{it was all over}} the place". Because the episode was so fast-paced with little being explained, he did not feel any emotional connection to the Anglican marines or Lorna Bucket. Unlike Fuller, Martin was not favourable to Smith's Doctor, stating [...] "the non-event of the battle means the Doctor never really gets to show this dark side we've been hearing so much about" [...] and that Smith's predecessor, David Tennant, [...] "got angrier most weeks". Martin did have praise for the final reveal of the episode, stating that although it had been [...] "hidden in plain view from the very beginning as soon as it's revealed Amy has called the baby Melody", he was unable to make the connection and was suitably surprised. Martin later rated it the second-to-worst episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in the}} list.|$|E

500|$|Casting for the {{character}} was hectic, with Oberman describing the process as a [...] "whirlwind" [...] affair. The role of the second Mrs Den Watts was highly sought after with Oberman eventually beating out high-profile stars like Patsy Kensit, Cheryl Baker and Joanna Lumley for the part. In a 2004 'Star Chat' interview featured in The People, Oberman commented on her casting: [...] "I couldn't have wished for a better part. I mean the Watts family are a national institution. When I realised I was auditioning {{for the role of}} Dirty Den's wife, my jaw <b>just</b> <b>dropped.</b> I never thought I'd get it. Amazing, swanky actresses, like Joanna Lumley and Patsy Kensit, were all considered, but Leslie Grantham and I had great chemistry from the off and I think he said: 'I want her.'" [...] Oberman was on holiday when she received a call saying she had been cast in the role and was required to be on set the next Tuesday. All told the audition process had taken just two weeks, with Oberman beginning filming a mere ten days after her initial screen test. In fact the schedule was so tight that Oberman was on set and taping scenes before a contract had even been signed.|$|E

[...] Drummer Chris Hrasky added, [...] "I think we just liked the idea of a band that there was not a leader or main songwriter, everyone sort of collaborating and has their own say. I don't think any of us want the sort of 'leader role', so a leaderless band is kind of the best option for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stories later {{circulated}} {{that the}} first shot missed but rather than taking shelter in the house, he drew his sword and advanced on his attackers, {{who were able to}} shoot and kill him. These stories often stressed that he had died a martyr. His housemaid testified that she found his drawn sword lying by his side. These details do not feature in the three witness accounts quoted by Keith Jeffery (Reginald Dunne's account smuggled out of prison, or the inquest testimonies of one of two road menders working nearby and of the taxi driver who had <b>just</b> <b>dropped</b> Wilson off). One of the road mender's accounts, as published in the [...] "Daily Mail", mentions Wilson turning on his attackers with the words [...] "you cowardly swine!" [...] but Jeffery suggests this was an embellishment by the newspaper.|$|E
2500|$|U-269 was sunk on 25 June 1944 {{south-east}} of Torquay, {{in position}} [...] The U-boat {{was detected by}} the Royal Navy frigate , of the 5th Support Group, which immediately attacked with depth charges. The first attack knocked out all the lights aboard the U-boat, while the second ruptured the seals on the drive shafts, allowing water to rush in. The frigate's third depth charge run destroyed pipes, valves and electrical connections. Realizing that the situation was hopeless, Uhl ordered U-269 to surface, and prepared to abandon and scuttle the boat. The submarine surfaced within range of the frigate, which had <b>just</b> <b>dropped</b> a fourth set of depth charges. The U-boat began to sink immediately, while the survivors swam away or escaped on rafts. Bickerton picked up the 39 survivors. There were 13 dead, including Captain Uhl.|$|E
