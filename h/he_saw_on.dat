5|$|The poem {{has three}} eleven-line stanzas which {{describe}} a progression through the season, {{from the late}} maturation of the crops to the harvest and to {{the last days of}} autumn when winter is nearing. The imagery is richly achieved through the personification of Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its sights and sounds. It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists, with Keats himself describing the fields of stubble that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> his walk as being like that in a painting.|$|E

25|$|There {{exists a}} folio of {{drawings}} by Villard de Honnecourt from Picard in France, who between {{the years of}} about 1220 and 1230 travelled, for reasons unknown, in France {{and other parts of}} Europe as far as Hungary, producing drawings of motifs architectural, scientific and figural. The drawings, for the most part, are not original designs. They are drawn from buildings and artworks that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> his travels. In order that they might be utilised as designs for students, they were carefully annotated by a skilled calligrapher and placed into a leather portfolio. They give us a clear indication {{of the way in which}} decorative motifs and figurative subjects could be transferred from one region to another and from one artform to another.|$|E

25|$|Calvin Abueva {{was born}} Calvin Sweeney to an American father, also named Calvin, and a Filipina mother, Evelyn. As {{a young boy}} in Angeles, Pampanga, he {{followed}} a routine wherein he would watch his childhood idol Robert Jaworski on television at night and by noon the next day, he would mimic what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> television on the cement courts of Bayanihan Park. He observed how Jaworski {{became one of the}} PBA's best rebounders of all-time despite being a guard and tried his best to duplicate the legendary grit with his pals. Aside from basketball, Abueva also played volleyball during his childhood years. Calvin also has a younger brother, Richard Ramsey, who after being raised by foster parents after being left for adoption at the age of three months, finally met Calvin, mother Evelyn and his three other siblings in 2010. Like his brother, Richard also plays basketball, playing for De Ocampo Memorial College in Sta. Mesa, Manila and currently serves as an assistant coach for the De Ocampo Cobras.|$|E

Barentsz did not recognize that he had discovered an archipelago, and consequently the name Spitsbergen long remained in use both for the main island and for the archipelago as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Marco's {{realization}} that Mulberry Street intersects with Bliss Street {{leads him to}} imagine a group of police escorts. The scene becomes a parade, as he then imagines a grand stand filled with the mayor and aldermen; an airplane dropping confetti; and, in the final incarnation of the scene, a Chinese man, a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, and {{a man with a}} ten-foot beard. Now almost home, he snaps back to reality and rushes up the front steps, eager to tell his father his imagined story. However, when his father questions him about what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> his way home, his face turns red and he says, [...] "Nothing...but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street." ...|$|E

500|$|The game {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics upon release. Computer and Video Games was divided over the graphics, stating {{that they were}} [...] "expecting more" [...] from an Ultimate game. Chris Anderson of Personal Computer Games felt [...] "disappointment" [...] to the overall game, stating that what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the screen was an [...] "anti-climax", given how Anderson had been [...] "waiting so long" [...] for an Ultimate release on the Commodore 64. Commodore User praised the graphics, heralding the detail as [...] "impressive", however they criticised the moving characters of the game, calling them [...] "not quite as impressive" [...] as the detail of the background, and [...] did {{not live up to}} the instruction manual's promise of [...] "cartoon quality" [...] animation.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the only}} {{surviving}} eyewitnesses to these events being from the Indian {{side and the}} passage of time since the battle, many of the details given by the Indian participants were still controversial and not believed (Custer's widow Libbie, who had dedicated her life to enshrining the memory of her husband as a hero and who attacked anyone offering a different point of view, was still alive). [...] Special exception is taken to the claim that many of Custer's men committed suicide when defeat seemed inevitable. [...] The claim that Tom Custer's body was decapitated by the Indians is also disputed for reasons that are not made clear. [...] The identification of the headless body as Tom Custer is not from Wooden Leg, who {{at the time of the}} battle knew nothing of either Custer or his brother Tom, but is information provided by Marquis. Wooden Leg had merely described the markings <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the body. [...] Tom Custer's biography describes the decapitation as indisputable fact, as the body was identified from tattoos.|$|E
500|$|Fred Dibnah {{was the son}} of Frank and Betsy Dibnah (née Travis), {{who were}} {{initially}} both employed at a bleach works. His mother later worked as a charwoman at a gas works. [...] Named after his uncle Frederick, he was born on 28April 1938 and brought up in the historic Lancashire town of Bolton, then a predominantly industrial town with a history in the spinning and weaving of cotton. As a child, Dibnah was fascinated by {{the sights and sounds of}} industry and the dozens of chimney stacks visible around Burnden Park, and paid particular attention to the steeplejacks <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> his way to school. [...] A popular pastime for local children was playing around the many mill lodges (industrial ponds) which once littered the area. [...] An inventive child, Dibnah and some friends designed a makeshift diving suit from a crisp tin, a car inner tube and some piping. After being told to remove it from the local swimming baths, they tested it in one of the lodges, but were unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|Matsui was {{not good}} at drawing humans or real life things, and {{he was about to}} lose his {{self-confidence}} when he [...] "threw things in at random" [...] to create the series. Matsui mixed his creation with real things to make his style original. To create the atmosphere of the series, Matsui used as reference paintings by Rei Kamoi, a Japanese artist <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> television, and Gōjin Ishihara, the illustrator of Edogawa Ranpo's Shōnen Tantei Dan. Matsui's creative process of art is to begin drawing erotic and grotesque images, {{and at the same time}} humorous and cute scenes. Matsui did not wish to create [...] "terrifying characters" [...] but [...] "funny-terrifying" [...] and [...] "terrifying-cute". He also tried to avoid men's idealized image of heroines and women's idealized images of heroes. Matsui decided to create characters that could exist in the real world and to make their acts and reactions realistic. As such, elaborating on [...] "why people would create such complex tricks in order to murder someone, [...] wanted to convey the extent to which humans will go in pursuit of a goal".|$|E
500|$|Hamilton remarked, [...] "Before , gadgets {{were not}} really a part of Bond's world." [...] Production {{designer}} Ken Adam chose the DB5 {{because it was the}} latest version of the Aston Martin (in the novel Bond drove a DB Mark III, which he considered England's most sophisticated car). The company was initially reluctant, but was finally convinced to make a product placement deal. In the script, the car was armed only with a smoke screen, but every crew member began suggesting gadgets to install in it: Hamilton conceived the revolving licence plate because he had been getting lots of parking tickets, while his stepson suggested the ejector seat (which <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> television). A gadget near the lights that would drop sharp nails was replaced with an oil dispenser because the producers thought the original could be easily copied by viewers. Adam and engineer John Stears overhauled the prototype of the Aston Martin DB5 coupe, installing these and other features into a car over six weeks. The scene where the DB5 crashes was filmed twice, with the second take being used in the film. The first take, in which the car drives through the fake wall, {{can be seen in the}} trailer. Two of the gadgets were not installed in the car: the wheel-destroying spikes, inspired by Ben-Hurs scythed chariots, were entirely made in-studio; and the ejector seat used a seat thrown by compressed air, with a dummy sitting atop it. Another car without the gadgets was created, which was eventually furnished for publicity purposes. It was reused for Thunderball.|$|E
500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous to take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E

He hoped that the more intense routines would widen the demographic of square dancers. [...] "I {{want to see more}} young people dancing in public squares." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first game}} of the 2008 season saw Brady suffer a torn ACL in his left knee while {{attempting}} a pass to Randy Moss. The play occurred in the first half against the Kansas City Chiefs when safety Bernard Pollard dove at Brady's leg while in his throwing motion. Moss described what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the play by saying [...] "any time you see something like that, that looks foul, it looks dirty, it opens your eyes. So, me personally, it looked dirty." [...] Matt Cassel replaced Brady {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea for}} the name of the film came to Cross from a T-shirt at a novelty store that had the phrase [...] "Normal People Scare Me" [...] printed on it.

In an appearance on Sunday Today, Cross explained to Campbell Brown: [...] "Yeah, I was thinking I--it actually just came off a T-shirt that I read, which totally makes sense either way because the real underlying message, if--if you've noticed it, even I haven't noticed it until like recently, like the whole underlying message is `What is normal anyway?' I mean, that just kind of gives it off in the title." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{club was}} widely {{known as the}} [...] "Shinboners" [...] for much of its early history. The origins of the {{nickname}} are unknown but it may {{have had something to}} do with the club's reputation for targeting the shinbones of opposition players, or to do with local butchers who showed their support for North by dressing up beef leg-bones in the club colours. By 1926, the club was known as the [...] "Blue Birds", but this nickname did not last. It was Phonse Tobin, North president from 1953 to 1956, who oversaw the club adopting the kangaroo emblem in 1954; Tobin found the image of a shinbone unsavoury and wanted the club to have a mascot it could show with pride. In selecting a new name, he wanted something characteristically Australian and was inspired by a large kangaroo <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> display outside a city store.|$|E
2500|$|The sappers {{had broken}} contact {{by the time}} the brigade commander, Col Hathaway, had his command {{helicopter}} land at Mary Ann.

Hathaway's reaction to what <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>on</b> the ground was later described by Capt Spilberg as if [...] " [...] had just walked into Auschwitz." [...] Hathaway was just the first of a number of higher-ranking officers to fly into Mary Ann. The division commander, MG Baldwin, arrived shortly after 0700 to assess the damage. By 0900 the battalion executive officer arrived to take over from Lt Col Doyle, and at 1100 Company D was lifted in to replace Company C as the FSB's garrison element. The North Vietnamese took the FSB under fire with a 12.7mm machine gun at about 1600 that afternoon, wounding one American and reminding Mary Ann's garrison that they were still under observation.|$|E
