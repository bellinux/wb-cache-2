25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can <b>gill</b> <b>box</b> (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle <b>gill</b> <b>box</b> (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine. [...] This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting <b>Gill</b> <b>Box</b> (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). [...] The <b>gill</b> <b>box</b> starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the <b>gill</b> <b>box</b> is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant.|$|E

25|$|The combed slivers {{produced}} on {{any type of}} combing machine are passed through {{a process known as}} finishing. This process takes place in a series of <b>gill</b> <b>boxes</b> in which the fibres are redistributed, the slivers made uniform in thickness and moisture added in order to give the wool its natural suppleness and condition. Blending is done where necessary to keep the top up to a given standard of quality and, if dyed, consistency of colour. The top ball produced is suitable for packing for transport and unwinding. The top represents the wool comber's finished product, and it is in this form that the wool is bought and sold as the spinner's raw material.|$|R

The output of the <b>gill</b> <b>box</b> is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The new {{technology}} {{is based on the}} original four-color <b>gill</b> <b>box,</b> and adding the application of the controller. On the one hand, achieve the sliver color’s order can be matched at will, and every single sliver can be changed about the color and length, and the length of changeover portion can be designed easily, so that the final product color can be achieved in a color from deep to shallow gradients, and also can be two colors that is one of them becomes shallow gradually while another color deepened gradually; on the other hand, achieve the ratio of the colored sliver is adjustable without basal sliver feeding. In the other words, on the premise of output sliver thickness to maintain constant, the cross-section’s color of the sliver is ensured to be any independent color of the four feeding sliver colors, you can also have two or more color combinations. Using this {{new technology}} to produce the gradient product has been very popular in foreign countries, but is still rare in the domestic market. So this new technology will have positive effect on textile field, it can provide more new opportunities to the textile enterprises...|$|E

5000|$|The {{location}} of Waldo Stadium has been home for Western football since 1914. A field, without a stadium or modern seating, existed through 1938, until {{the construction and}} completion of the stadium in 1939. It originally included an eight-lane track, which has since moved to Kanley Track across the street. Financing came through private donations, and those who donated were awarded tickets to the inaugural game against Western Kentucky University. Over the years, WMU continued adding seating to the stadium, and a renovation in 1989 pushed the available seats to 30,200. [...] Focal renovations have included the Bill Brown Alumni Center and the John <b>Gill</b> press <b>box,</b> added to the main seating on {{the north and south}} sidelines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According {{to model}} {{analysis}} of <b>gilling</b> machine’s hauling <b>box,</b> {{this paper presents}} the research on the complex structure’s model analysis. Before the analysis of box, the paper inducted general analysis process, then the box was divided into 8 modules, advanced function MPC and super-element were used to process connection among these modules, the processed model was analyzed by finite-element software Nastran. The result from Nastran include natural frequencies and mode shapes, which are similar to actual work condition. It can be concluded that the process for complex structure is accurate. The result is useful to find the reason of box vibration, {{and it is also}} used for optimization design...|$|R
50|$|Except for two {{electrically}} lit sleeping cars, {{the coaches}} were {{lit by the}} Pintsch oil gas system. The main gas pipe on the leading coach was broken off in the impact, and the entire contents of the pressurised gas cylinders escaped in under two minutes. The gas then ignited in a single flash. Driver Bath had been injured in the leg but made his way on foot to the Ais <b>Gill</b> signal <b>box</b> {{a mile and a}} half north to summon help. The signalman there (Benjamin Bellas) sent another light engine under driver Judd, with Bath, along the up line. Judd attempted to put out the fire by bucketing water from his tender. Another light engine had been sent from Hawes Junction and its crew tried to drag the rear coaches away from the fire but could move only the brake vans at the rear of the train. The six leading coaches were immovable. The engine crews and the express train's guards, the sleeping car attendants, some platelayers from a hut a short distance up the line and a shepherd whose home was nearby tried desperately to rescue the trapped passengers but were eventually driven back by thick smoke. Because a strong wind was fanning the flames, the fire could not be extinguished and all six coaches were burned out.|$|R
