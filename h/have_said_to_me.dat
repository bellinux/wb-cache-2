500|$|Smith married English-Canadian actor Christopher Grove in 1990. They were {{divorced}} in 1992, citing irreconcilable differences. She married Daniel Erickson in 2002; the marriage lasted {{for six years}} and Smith filed for divorce on May 21, 2008, citing irreconcilable differences. In a 1997 interview with The Daily Targum, Smith stated [...] "I am shy, but I have an extroverted persona which I can draw on when I need to," [...] and {{that she is a}} [...] "private" [...] actress. In 2009, she commented, [...] "People <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I'm unassuming. It's true, I'm the worst celebrity ever. But I'm trying to become better." [...] Smith had bulimia since she was a teenager. She noted [...] "It would make me high, I would feel endorphins and this great sense of victory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{why should}} I tell you? Suppose he should <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the {{confidence}} of friendship that he thinks you ugly and stupid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Guy, then," [...] she continued, with {{something}} {{very much like}} a blush, [...] "forget all that you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> at any rate for the present. Perhaps later on, when this is all over--" ...|$|E
60|$|And I {{repeated}} {{word for}} word what Lorenzo <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and, as far as I could, I reproduced his accent and gesture.|$|R
60|$|Now I {{remembered what}} old Zikali <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> years before <b>to</b> {{the effect that}} Saduko was living with a ghost which would kill him.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you must}} do it, Hughie, I suppose you must," [...] he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I'll see you through, of course. But don't blame me afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In what way?" [...] she demanded. [...] "I judge {{only by the}} facts, {{the things}} you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> your accusations against Captain Granet. Why should you go {{out of your way}} to {{investigate}} cases of suspected espionage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't feel up to it," [...] said Dorian, listlessly. [...] "But I am awfully {{obliged to}} you for all that you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You are {{certainly}} my best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{knew all}} that she knew;--all that I knew. You knew all that her mother knew. No, Lord Scroope. It cannot be {{that you should be}} so unutterably a villain. You are your own masther. Unsay what you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and her ears shall never be wounded or her heart broken by a hint of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Harold Begbie, author, {{journalist}} and playwright, {{who was then}} in Russia, said of Williams: [...] "More than one Russian <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> ‘Williams knows Russia better than we do.’" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Deeply sincere. He <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{the most}} appreciative, the most charming things about her. He would say them to you, {{if he were}} sure you would listen to him--gently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, miss, I--a--the fact is--you know a gal named Nora Jones, don't you? Anyhow, {{she knows}} you, an' <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{so often that}} you was a parfect angel, that--that--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take care, Mrs. Glenarm!" [...] she said, still {{struggling}} with herself. [...] "I am not naturally a patient woman. Trouble has done much to tame my temper--but endurance has its limits. You have reached the limits of mine. I have a claim to be heard--and after what you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I will be heard!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I have,' said Marion, hastily {{raising her}} head. 'You don't know what I do. I MUST speak to him. You {{are the best}} and truest friend {{in all the world}} for what you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but I must take this step. Will you go with me, Clemency,' she kissed her on her {{friendly}} face, 'or shall I go alone?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{this you}} <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> before. What does it mean? I fought this battle at the {{instigation}} of the family, from no feeling of my own. You are {{the head of}} the family and you were consulted on the step. Unless I had concluded that it was with your sanction, I certainly should not have made my appearance on the hustings." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{heard her}} breath quickening--I felt her hand growing cold. In {{spite of what}} she <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when we were alone, I began {{to be afraid of}} her. I was wrong.|$|R
60|$|I at once {{related the}} {{circumstances}} under which I had met the woman in white, exactly as they had occurred; and I repeated what she <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about Mrs. Fairlie and Limmeridge House, word for word.|$|R
6000|$|... "I halmost faintid with himotion. 'Ho, Jeames!' (she <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> subsquintly) 'mortial mann {{never looked}} so bewtifle {{as you did}} when you arrived {{on the day of}} the Levy. You were no longer mortial, you were diwine!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel {{somewhat}} at a loss, as to {{my future}} course. True, as you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I might mingle in the circles of the whites, in this country, my shade of color is so slight, {{and that of}} my wife and family scarce perceptible. Well, perhaps, on sufferance, I might. But, {{to tell you the}} truth, I have no wish to.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because,' said Florence, 'I {{am going}} to be his wife, to give him up my whole heart, and to live with him and die with him. He might think, if you said to him what you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that I am afraid of what is before me, or that you have some cause to be afraid for me. Why, Susan, dear, I love him!' ...|$|E
60|$|Write to ---- {{what you}} <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You need write no more. He {{is full of}} vicious fancies and wrong suspicions, even of Hardwick, and I would rather he heard it from you than from me, whom he {{is not likely to}} love much in his heart. I doubt it may be but a rusty {{instrument}} for want of use, the ----ish heart.|$|E
60|$|He {{paused for}} a moment, {{and looked at me}} intently and suspiciously; then asked if I {{believed}} all he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> so far. My instant reply in the affirmative seemed to satisfy his doubts, and he went on.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He don't {{know what}} to suppose, sir, no more than myself. I told him jest wot passed yesterday, sir, and that you <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "Can you be here by seven in the morning?" [...] and that you <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> him, through <b>me,</b> [...] "Can you be here by ten in the morning?" [...] and that I <b>had</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Yes" [...] to both. That's all, sir.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{sentence}} by sentence I repeated to him {{all that}} Zikali <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{when he called}} me back after bidding me farewell, which doubtless he did because he wished to cut his message more deeply into the tablets of my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "You gave it. Bear it in mind. I {{will think}} of what you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Farewell." [...] She stepped into the carriage, and it rolled away. Rowland stood for some minutes, looking after it, and then went his way with a sigh. If this {{expressed}} general mistrust, he ought, three days afterward, to have been reassured. He received by the post a note containing these words:-- ...|$|E
60|$|MAZZINI [troubled]. You have {{completely}} upset me, Mrs Hushabye, by all you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> That anyone could imagine that I--I, a consecrated soldier of freedom, if I may say so--could sacrifice Ellie to anybody or anyone, or that I should ever {{have dreamed of}} forcing her inclinations in any way, is a most painful blow to my--well, I suppose you would say to my good opinion of myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the only}} kind word you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> from that day to this. I try to comfort myself in {{thinking}} {{that it would have}} been so. But all that is past and gone, and done. I have had my romance and you have had yours. As you are a man, it is natural that you should have been disturbed by a double image;--it is not so with me." ...|$|E
60|$|Peter {{was only}} half awake. He {{looked up at the}} boss drowsily, and began to talk about brigands, and Dick and Ted and Alfred, the same as he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> There wasn't a sound till he had finished. Then the boss spoke.|$|R
60|$|Confronted by {{the serious}} {{responsibility}} {{that he had}} undertaken, he justified what he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Still pale, still distressed, he was now nevertheless master of himself. I turned {{to the door to}} leave him alone with the Prisoner. She called me back.|$|R
6000|$|Throughout {{all this}} my lord {{was like a}} cold, kind spectator with his wits about him. At the first cry, which was indeed enough to call the house about us, he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> over his shoulder, [...] "Close the door." [...] And now he nodded to himself.|$|R
6000|$|This was {{the most}} {{provoking}} thing he could <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> for I really wanted his further importunities, that I might be prevailed with to bring out that which indeed it was like death to me to conceal; so I answered him plainly that I could not say I was glad not to be importuned, thought I could not tell how to comply. 'But come, my dear,' said I, 'what conditions will you make with me upon the opening this affair to you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I did {{not succeed}} in seeing her," [...] he said, {{in a letter to his}} half-sister, [...] "of course I do not know what she might <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> herself. I might {{probably}} have induced her to give me another hearing. I put it all down to that abominable aunt, who probably has some scheme of her own, and would not let Miss Dormer come down to me. If you will have her again at Stalham, everything may be made to go right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "--I {{am deeply}} {{sensible}} of your generosity, and I shall treasure its remembrance to my dying hour. I know full well how changed I am, I {{know you are}} not unacquainted with my history, and I know what a noble love that is which is so faithful. What you <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> could have affected me so much from no other lips, for there are none that could give it such a value to me. It shall not be lost. It shall make me better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will be very}} angry, for he {{has nothing}} to eat. But he <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> many times that the Bhils are his children. By {{sunlight}} I believe this, but--by moonlight I am not so sure. What folly have ye Satpura pigs compassed that ye should need him at all?" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was such}} a shock of {{apprehension}} in his face, and he knew Richard so perfectly, and I too had seen {{so much of his}} gradual decay, that what my dear girl <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the fullness of her foreboding love sounded like a knell in my ears.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, mamma, why anybody should {{judge him}} yet; and as <b>to</b> what he <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I'm {{sure no one}} has a right to judge him unkindly. Dolly has been very angry with me because she saw <b>me</b> {{speaking}} <b>to</b> him in the churchyard, and <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that I was--hiding." ...|$|R
