The <b>hydrolitic</b> treatment carried out using lipase from Candida cylindracea ([E] = 50 U/ml, T = 30 °C and pH = 7. 0), showed that copolymers biodegraded more rapidly and extensively than PBS. ATRIR analysis and DSC measurements also performed on the resulting samples showed that the enzyme simultaneously attacks the amorphous phase and the PTDGS crystalline phase, which is characterized by lower packing density and degree of perfection with respect to the PBS one. This result suggested that the higher degradability of the copolymers under study can be correlated both to the crystallinity degree and to the nature of the crystalline phase.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The extensive use of Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) {{is partly due to}} the modification of properties which is possible by the addition of plasticizer. Although plasticized PVC is used at temperatures well above Tg, the properties are favourable and the material has a rubberlike behaviour. This is generally considered to be due to the presence of a physical network consisting of small crystallites. However, its service range is limited by its thermoplastic nature. At temperatures above 100 C it has a tendency to flow and to have a reduced mechanical strength. One way to increase the maximum temperature of plasticized PVC is to introduce a permanent chemical network. The reaction of plasticized PVC with [N-(2 -amino ethyl) - 3 -aminopropyl trimethoxy silane] yielded si lane-grafted PVC that was crosslinked by a <b>hydrolitic</b> mechanism. The grafting of the aminosilane was carried out during processing in both a roll mill followed by compression moulding and in a single screw extruder. A controlled reaction was observed when a tin stabilizer was selected. It was found that other thermal stabilizers accelerate the grafting reaction, but destabilize the polymer. The crosslinking of the grafted PVC has been studied in water at different temperatures. The crosslinking occurred faster at high temperatures and was diffusion controlled [...] ...|$|E
30|$|There is an {{important}} lack of literature {{about the effects of}} particulate deposition on the surface of paper, leather, textiles, paintings, varnishes and other materials typically found indoors, perhaps due to the complexity of the problem and the great variety of materials involved. A brief list of potential degradation pathways related to particle deposition is available in the literature [17]: (i) S-rich material (such as DPM, which contains oxidised sulfur compounds [41]) can cause discolouration of paintings; (ii) ammonium sulfate can induce bloom on varnish. Ammonium sulfate is a “secondary aerosol” (i.e., formed in the atmosphere), but it often coexists (and even aggregates) with carbonaceous particles [135]; (iii) The presence of CaSO 4 favours the adsorption of soot; (iv) Fe-Rich particles can catalyse the oxidation of SO 2 to H 2 SO 4. Aged diesel particulate matter is hygroscopic [136], and therefore can favour the adsorption of water that accelerates <b>hydrolitic</b> and oxidative processes, leading to fading of pigments, and degradation of paper and textiles [11]. Despite the lack of systematic investigations, the effects of fine PM deposition have been repeatedly noted by conservators. Damage layers related to black carbon deposition have been detected on indoor murals and wall paintings [137], and on polychromy [138]. The word “black crust” is sometimes used to describe these damage layers found indoors, but it is a macroscopic assessment that gives very little information about the origin of degradation.|$|E

40|$|The {{potency of}} {{plantation}} sectors (palm oil, sugar cane and cacao) as alternative feed resources for ruminants has been acknowledged since 20 – 25 years ago. However, {{the level of}} utilization of these feeds in small ruminant production system has been very low and sporadic. The typical chemical and physical characteristics of most of those feedstuffs required some steps of processing {{in order to improve}} their nutritional quality and to ease their handling. Small ruminants, like sheep and goats have relatively higher metabolic energy requirement per kg BW and anatomically have lower gut capacity to process lignocelluose materials compared to large ruminants. It is, therefore, these animals nutritionally face more constraints in handling lignocellulose and bulky materials mostly found in industrial by products or crop-residues from plantations. Physical processes (chopping, phyiscal separation, hydrothermal), chemical processes (ammoniation, hydrolyses and oxidative treatments) and bio-conversions (fermentation, ensiling) have been recommended as alternative technologies in maximizing the utilization of those feedstuffs for small ruminant animals. The principal mechanisms of those treatments are: (i) breaking the linkages between structural carbohydrate and lignin so that it could be easily digested by the animal enzyme systems and (ii) preserving the material from being spoilage due to its high moisture content or for feed stocking purposes. Priorities for choosing the most effective processing technology for implementation or adoption is depent largely on the scale of feed production. Ammoniation, chopping, physical separation, ensiling or bio-conversion are several technologies mostly recommended for small scale operation in situ. These alternative technologies should be able to be adopted by small-holders living around the plantation area. The commercial or large scale feed production could be implemented by the plantation industry by giving high priority to the processing technology such as <b>hydrolitic</b> treatment using NaOH, ammoniation, hydrothermal, pelleting, wafering or cubing. The types of products that possibly produced in this large operation scales are (i) concentrate feed, (ii) complete feed or (iii) basal feeds (roughages).

Within this system the plantation industry will have main role to supply the raw materials for the feed industries.

In sacco to observe the degradation of HBA crude protein. Results of in sacco evaluation in rumen showed that soluble and degraded crude proteins (CP) were significantly only affected by HCl concentration (P 0. 05). In vitro DM and OM digestibilities of HBA increased as the concentration of HCl was increased. The increase of DM digestibility followed the equation Y = - 0. 0231 x 3 + 0. 7323 x 2 – 1. 5716 x + 12. 383 (r = 0. 994); and the OM digestibility followed the equation Y = - 0. 0229 x 3 + 0. 7194 x 2 – 1. 0606 x + 15. 951 (r = 0. 993). Time of incubation, on the other hand, did not affect OM and DM digestibilities (P> 0. 05). DM solubility of HBA was significantly affected by HCl concentration and the length of incubation time (P< 0. 01). The increase of DM solubility was followed by the increase of NH 3 content (P< 0. 01). The relation between DM solubility and NH 3 content followed the equation Y = 0. 4365 x + 5. 4047 (r = 0. 966). The increase of DM solubility followed the equation Y = - 0. 027 x 3 + 0. 9596 x 2 – 4. 8142 x + 5. 3878 (r = 0. 973) and the increase of NH 3 content followed the equation Y = - 0. 0085 x 3 + 0. 3175 x 2 – 1. 4139 x + 7. 0889 (r = 0. 992).

Assim, este trabalho investigou, em laboratório, o efeito da germinação sobre algumas características nutricionais e sobre a estabilidade ao armazenamento de farinhas integrais de trigo germinado por 48 (FITG 48), 72 (FITG 72) e 96 horas (FITG 96). O perfil de aminoácidos das FITGs foi considerado bom, quando comparado com o da farinha controle e com o do padrão teórico da FAO para pré-escolares (2 - 5 anos). Somente a lisina (primeiro aminoácido limitante) e a treonina das FITGs mostraram valores mais baixos que o do citado padrão.

Com base nesses resultados, as características nutricionais das FITGs foram melhoradas pela germinação de trigo. Com relação à estabilidade ao armazenamento, o pH diminuiu e a acidez álcool-solúvel aumentou de acordo com o tempo de germinação de trigo. As FITGs foram estáveis até 4 meses de armazenamento, com exceção da FITG 96, que apresentou alto nível de acidez álcool-solúvel, provavelmente devido à rancidez hidrolítica.

40|$|In 1985 it was proved for {{the first}} time the {{possibility}} to recover DNA from mummified tissue; since then, the developments in the techniques of molecular biology that refer to the extraction and analysis of DNA of varying age and specially, the development of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) allowed to collect data from extinct populations in a straightforward way. Thus, the main purpose of this work was to obtain direct results, from archaeological human remains, on the genetic composition of a group of populations located across the Basque territory. We have analysed samples recovered from the sites of San Juan Ante Portam Latinam (Laguardia, Alava), dated 5, 070 ± 150 - 5, 020 ± 140 BP; Longar (Viana, Nafarroa) dated 4, 445 ± 70 - 4, 590 ± 90 BP; Urratxa III (Orozko, Bizkaia) dated 3, 405 ± 70 - 3, 475 ± 80 BP; Pico Ramos (Muskiz, Bizkaia) dated 4, 100 ± 110 - 4, 790 ± 110 BP and Aizpea (Aribe, Nafarroa) dated 6, 600 ± 50 BP (Etxeberria & Vegas, 1988, Armendariz & Irigarai, 1995; Muñoz & Basaguren, 1997; Zapata, 1991; Cava, 1994). The data obtained constitute a sample of the genetic variability existing in the Neo-Eneolithic period. The comparison of the genetic data from the prehistoric populations to the already published data on present day population allowed us to contrast some of the hypotheses proposed on the evolution of the Basque population based on the latter approach. Most of the recent research on ancient DNA (aDNA) has been focused on the investigation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), since there are thousands of copies of the mitochondrial genome per cell; this increases its survival and facilitates its recovery, in contrast for instance to the amplification of nuclear DNA, which results a much more arduous task if not impossible. Restriction enzymes, as opposed to sequencing, were chosen as the routine method for mtDNA analysis, since it constitutes a more efficient and feasible approach for these kind of studies at the population level. @@ The troublesome nature of the archeological samples, required a precise optimization of the techniques; thus, a significant part of our research has been dedicated to adjust and implement the techniques involved, as besides, this work constitutes the initiation of a new line of research in the U. P. V. /E. H. U. One of the main characteristics of aDNA is the inverse relationship between the efficiency of amplification and the length of the expected amplification product, which can be explained as a function of the degradation of the input DNA (aDNA). Additionally, the nucleotides in the sequence may have been also modified as a result of the oxidative and <b>hydrolitic</b> reactions that take place in the tissue once the organism is dead. Thus, during the amplification, most of the damaged molecules are not going to be successfully replicated, as the activity of the Taq polymerase will be inhibited. As expected, we have been able to observe a high correlation between efficiency of amplification and age of the sample, being the prehistoric samples those rendering the lowest yield, as a consequence of the damage in their DNA. The greatest danger in aDNA work is the contamination of our aDNA samples with exogenous, contemporaneous DNA. This leads us to follow a series of esterility meassures in order to avoid contamination, such as the realization of contamination controls during extraction and amplification, and the duplicate analysis of the samples. This, obviously implies an extra effort and a greater investment of resources, but becomes necessary to guarantee the reliability of the results. @@ These are the first genetic data on prehistoric populations from the Basque Country, from which it is possible to rise some hypotheses on the origin of the human groups that settled down in our territory in prehistoric times. Thus, the distribution of the mtDNA haplogroups observed is similar to that described in a sample of modern Basques, with some exceptions: we have not detected haplogroup V in any of the prehistoric samples here analytzed. This promts to questioning a recently published hypothesis (Torroni et al. 1998) which supports an origin for this haplogroup in a region North of the Iberian Peninsula, about 10, 000 - 15, 000 years ago, and a subsequent expansion towards Europe. @@ In addition, we have been able to observe that the sample of Longar shows the greatest differentiation within the three prehistoric populations analyzed, which could be explained as a consequence of a different origin for this population. However, a differentiation due to genetic drift cannot be ruled out if we consider the possible reduced size of human populations at the time. This study, in allowing to relate genetic data with archaeological, morphometric, and linguistic data, constitutes a novel contribution to the study of the biological history of the human populations. The ongoing analysis of a greater number of prehistoric sites will eventually enable us to find an answer to these and other evolutionary question...|$|E
