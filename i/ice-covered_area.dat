40|$|It is now {{generally}} accepted that {{the impacts of}} climate change in the Arctic Ocean will, over the next decades, determine its transformation from a permanently ice-covered and virtually untraversable area into a seasonally navigable sea subject to the increase of commercial navigation opportunities.

40|$|To {{safeguard}} the Canadian Arctic marine environment, Canada established an Arctic marine traffic system, {{known as the}} Northern Canada Vessel Traffic Services Zone Regulations (NORDREG). These mandatory regulations require most nongovernmental vessels to report information prior to entering, while operating within and upon exiting Canada’s northern/Arctic waters. Canada asserts that the traffic system is consistent with international law concerning <b>ice-covered</b> <b>areas,</b> in particular with the “Arctic Exception” of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Article 234.

40|$|We use a Monte Carlo {{approach}} to invert a spherical harmonic representation of cryosphere-attributed mass change {{in order to}} infer the most likely underlying mass changes within irregularly shaped <b>ice-covered</b> <b>areas</b> at nominal 26 km resolution. By inverting a spherical harmonic representation through the incorporation of additional fractional ice coverage information, this approach seeks to eliminate signal leakage between non- and <b>ice-covered</b> <b>areas.</b> The spherical harmonic representation suggests a Greenland mass loss of 251 ± 25 Gt yr − 1 over the December 2003 to December 2010 period. The inversion suggests 218 ± 20 Gt yr − 1 {{was due to the}} ice sheet proper, and 34 ± 5 Gt yr − 1 (or ~ 14 %) was due to Greenland peripheral glaciers and ice caps (GrPGIC). This mass loss from GrPGIC exceeds that inferred from all ice masses on both Ellesmere and Devon Islands combined. This partition therefore highlights that GRACE-derived "Greenland" mass loss cannot be taken as synonymous with "Greenland ice sheet" mass loss when making comparisons with estimates of ice sheet mass balance derived from techniques that only sample the ice sheet proper...|$|R

40|$|A {{complex of}} ice cover {{characteristics}} and {{the season of}} the year {{were considered in relation}} to vessel route planning in <b>ice-covered</b> <b>areas</b> on the NSR. The criteria for navigation in ice - both year-round and seasonal were analyzed. The analysis of the experts knowledge, dissipated in the literature, allowed to identify some rules of route planning in <b>ice-covered</b> <b>areas.</b> The most important processes from the navigation point of view are the development and disintegration of ice, the formation and disintegration of fast ice and behavior of the ice massifs and polynyas. The optimal route is selected on basis of available analysis and forecast maps of ice conditions and ice class, draught and seaworthiness of the vessel. The boundary of the ice indicates areas accessible to vessels without ice class. Areas with a concentration of ice from 0 to 6 / 10 are used for navigation of vessels of different ice classes. Areas of concentration of ice from 7 / 10 up are eligible for navigation for icebreakers and vessels with a high ice class with the assistance of icebreakers. These rules were collected in the decision tree. Following such developed decision-making model the master of the vessel may take decision independently by accepting grading criteria of priorities resulting from his knowledge, experience and the circumstances of navigation. Formalized form of decision making model reduces risk of the "human factor" in the decision and thereby help improve the safety of maritime transport...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aims}} of {{investigating}} {{the response of the}} smallest benthic biota to a strong ice-edge-related input of phytodetritus, and of registering supposed lateral transportation processes of phytodetrital matter with northerly direction under the ice, we analysed a number of abiotic and biotic parameters in surface sediments from the northern Fram Strait. Two transects of 14 stations in total were made. One transect, crossing the Fram Strait from the east to the west, followed mainly the ice edge. The second transect extended latitudinally in a northerly direction, starting in ice-free areas, passing the ice edge, and ending in heavy <b>ice-covered</b> <b>areas,</b> approximately 100 nm north of the ice edge. Stations along this transect were sampled at almost constant water depths to avoid depth-related influences in our investigations. Results showed the expected high phytodetritus concentrations in the ice-edge vicinity. Concentrations of sediment-bound plant pigments were approximately 5 times higher than in <b>ice-covered</b> <b>areas,</b> indicating a very strong phytodetritus input. With increasing distance from the highly productive areas at the ice edge, we found significantly decreasing concentrations of phytodetrital input to the seafloor in a northerly direction. Within the foraminiferans, generic diversity was clearly reduced in the area of strong phytodetritus deposition. Along the latitudinal transect, out of the direct ice-edge influence, foraminiferal diversities slowly increased within increasing distance from the ice edge. The integration of results from earlier foraminiferal investigations, from stations further to the north, indicates a once more decreasing diversity with continually decreasing food supply...|$|R

The century-scale loss is associated with increasing regional temperatures warming in winter and summer; precipitation shows no trend.
