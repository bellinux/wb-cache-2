40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} for <b>equipment</b> <b>substitution</b> (machines and software) when performing large-scale turbine inspections using phased array ultrasonic technology (PAUT). The major concept of <b>equipment</b> <b>substitution</b> is linked with specific tolerances of EDM notches located in reference blocks. The main features such as: detection angle, signal-to-noise ratio, index, depth, orientation and defect height are evaluated based on A- and S-scan. This approach {{is based on}} inspection scope requirements and can drastically {{reduce the number of}} checked and documented variables of phased array system when performing a substitution. Examples are given for shear- and longitudinal waves on specific blocks of GEC Alstom low-pressure turbine components (L- 0 steeple, L- 1 steeple and L- 1 blade). Tolerances on <b>equipment</b> <b>substitution</b> based on experimental results are also presented.

40|$|Despite {{the search}} for {{effective}} and less toxic substitutes, glutaraldehyde (GA) {{remains one of the}} few substances capable of high-level instrument disinfection in modern health care. Workers commonly affected include operating room nurses, radiographers, x-ray technicians and cleaners. Widespread hospital usage combined with its well-known irritant properties, has ensured an increase in occupationally-related illnesses during recent years. Operating room nurses, laboratory workers and x-ray technicians frequently contact GA in both the liquid and vapor form. Workplace exposure is usually dependent on job tasks, ventilation levels and the use of protective equipment. GA is a relatively potent irritant and sensitizer, with a well-documented history of symptoms following occupational exposure. Although mechanisms for GA toxicity have been postulated, research on the toxicological, teratogenic, and carcinogenic potential of this chemical has shown inconsistent results. Reducing workplace exposure to its lowest possible level represents the most important hazard reduction strategy. This may be achieved by keeping GA containers tightly sealed when not in use, maintaining adequate ventilation levels and the rigid adherence to appropriate personal protective <b>equipment.</b> <b>Substitution</b> with automated cold sterilization machines may be another appropriate measure, while banning unnecessary practices such as GA fogging and its use as a surface disinfectant may also be helpful in reducing occupational exposure in the health care environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{activities}} {{described in}} this publication have been conducted in Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) framework in collaboration with Alenia Aermacchi S. p. A. The aim of work is to study solutions for avionic upgrades of navigation system for allowing civil-military interoperability in a Single European Sky ATM context. Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) is the on-going European research program aiming at designing and validating a reformation of the Air Traffic Management system. The interoperability assessment of existing military platforms in terms of capability to support mission trajectory functions is the aim of WP 9. 3 project of SESAR program. First of all, investigations of SESAR operational context have been performed, identifying concept elements coming from activities carried out inside and outside SESAR Consortium, (e. g. Eurocontrol studies on the subject). The analysis of operational context has allowed to define, {{with the support of}} Eurocontrol experts, those SESAR functions relevant and applicable to military mission profiles and military users needs. The selected SESAR functions for implementation on military avionics are Initial 4 D and ASPA S&M and the have been named Key- 4 D functions. These represent important enablers for enhancing ATM efficiency in managing segregated areas where military aircraft typically perform part of their operations. Interoperability Assessment of military navigation systems versus defined Key- 4 D functions has been the first analysis conducted. A qualitative evaluation of impacts of the modifications on the military navigation equipment has been performed in order to understand how onerous (e. g. software modification, hardware modification or <b>equipment</b> <b>substitution)</b> could be the implementation of above mentioned Key- 4 D functions. Results coming from WP 9. 20 and WP 9. 24 of SESAR has also allowed to evaluate interoperability of military avionics for what concerns communication and surveillance systems. Starting from {{the state of the art}} military navigation systems based on Mission Computer (MC) and Flight Management System (FMS), after the definition of Key- 4 D functions, their implementation on the military CNS system has been designed. An important element to be considered in the Key- 4 D implementation on military aircraft has been design of Human Machine Interface. Starting from the analysis of cockpit configuration for considered military platform (i. e. Transport and Fighter), allocation of HMI functions to existing Displays and Control Panels has been defined. Data flows among CNS system, Displays and Control Panels have been defined in order to create a basis for Human Machine Interface definition. A Human Machine Interface prototype both for Transport-type and Fighter aircraft has been developed, it has been reviewed and approved by Alenia HMI operability specialists and Alenia military pilots.

The subject matter of the research is the dependence of construction industry on imports in the area of foreign technology, it is aimed at identifying the scope of the problem and justifying the mechanisms to overcome it. The article substantiates the relevance and importance of import substitution in the production of construction materials and <b>equipment.</b> Import <b>substitution</b> in the construction industry can be implemented in two main ways, requiring different approaches in supporting and encouraging. Firstly, there is the substitution of products used in construction, aimed at minimizing the risk of disruption of the supply of imported products for construction purposes and the predominant use of domestic analogues of imported products for construction purposes. Secondly, there is the substitution in the technologies of production of goods used in construction, focused on stimulating the development of the domestic production of competitive products and technological and managerial modernization of the construction materials industry, construction industry. The process of import substitution in the construction industry have a number of limitations. In this connection, the article discusses the opportunities and constraints for import substitution. A special attention is paid to the practice of the formation of regional construction clusters as a tool of implementing the policy of import substitution. The purposes and principles of the development of clusters, sources of initiatives, used systems of transfer and knowledge and innovations are considered critically. The conclusion is made about the need for the strategic development of new products for the construction market and domestic research and development projects within the framework of cross-sectoral clusters. The basic forms of state support required for the implementation of the import substitution policy in the construction industry are substantiated. These are organizational, administrative and economic measures, whose implementation during the transition to the import substitution can lead to the reduction in the cost of construction materials. In the conclusion, the article states the priorities in the support of import substitution policies for the construction industry.

40|$|Authors: Janet Hill, Bonnie Chaban, Jennifer Town, Matthew Links & Tim Dumonceaux ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{describes an}} alternative approach to performing Roche’s Paired End Rapid Library Preparation Method for 8 kb span libraries. This method uses the Corvaris g-tube for DNA fragmentation, {{eliminating the need for}} a HydroShear apparatus, and a Sage Science BluePippin electrophoresis platform to size select the 8 kb fragments, eliminating the need for agarose gel electrophoresis and sample recovery using a Whatman Elutrap device. These two modifications allow the protocol to be completed in significantly less time (eliminate an overnight step) and require significantly less capital investment in laboratory equipment. This modified library preparation protocol has yielded paired end libraries meeting all the quality control benchmarks the original protocol stipulates and has been combined with sequencing on a GS Junior instrument to generate excellent sequencing results. The <b>equipment</b> <b>substitutions</b> presented allow paired end library preparation to be practical for smaller research groups. ### Introduction In large-scale sequencing centers it is commonplace to have a range of DNA sequencing platforms (e. g. 454, Illumina, SOLiD, and PacBio) and also specialized devices for shearing of DNA molecules common in the preparation of paired-end libraries. With the introduction of laboratory-scale devices like the GS Jr and MiSeq there is a shift occurring where DNA sequencing technology is becoming directly accessible within small labs. The ability to perform whole genome sequencing and assembly within a lab is now reasonable to consider for Bacteria using the GS Jr. A crucial type of data for scaffolding of genome assemblies is paired-end data. By generating information from sequencing reads linked across some known or estimated spanning distance, bioinformatic techniques are capable of ordering and orienting contigs produced from shotgun sequencing. In terms of the GS Jr platform the system is inherently capable of sequencing paired-end libraries but there is a challenge for laboratory-scale use as the conventional protocol for library production includes shearing of DNA molecules using a Hydroshear. As a specialized device the Hydroshear represents a significant investment for a laboratory-scale setting and may present a barrier to the use of paired-end sequencing in lab settings. This protocol describes {{an alternative approach}} to performing Roche’s Paired End Rapid Library Preparation Method for 8 kb span libraries. This method uses the Corvaris g-tube for DNA fragmentation, eliminating the need for a HydroShear apparatus, and a Sage Science BluePippin electrophoresis platform to size select the 8 kb fragments, eliminating the need for agarose gel electrophoresis and sample recovery using a Whatman Elutrap device. These two modifications allow the protocol to be completed in significantly less time (by eliminating an overnight step) and simplify sheared fragment purification. This modified library preparation protocol yielded paired-end libraries meeting all the quality control benchmarks of the original protocol and has been combined with shotgun sequencing on a GS Junior to generate excellent assemblies for a range of Bacteria. The <b>equipment</b> <b>substitutions</b> and associated savings in time provide a practical protocol for laboratory-scale paired-end sequencing on the GS Jr. ### Materials Reagents unique to modified protocol: 1.

See attached Supplementary Manual. Modifications by Hill lab (Saskatoon) group: Start with 15 µg of sample genomic DNA in 150 µL Tris-HCl pH 8. 0 (genomic DNA preparation of 100 ng/µL) – same as original protocol Section 3. 1 – DNA Fragmentation (HydroShear) – completely disregard this section. Instead, use Covaris g-tubes. - Save a few µL of original genomic DNA to visualize on an agarose gel later. - Add the 150 µL genomic DNA prep to a g-tube. Follow instructions with tubes – Spin in an Eppendorf MiniSpin plus microcentrifuge at 8, 600 rpm for 1 min, flip tube over, repeat spin, remove sample from tube. - Keep 2 µL of the sheared sample to run on an agarose gel later. Section 3. 2 – Fragment End Repair - For 25 °C steps throughout protocol, set waterbath to maintain this temperature. Room temperature does not always work. - Disregard step 3 (don’t need this agarose gel). - Step 4 m – use the arm on the Labquake to keep the tube from flipping completely over when doing this gentle mixing (just rock the tube back and forth). Section 3. 3 – Circularization Adaptor Ligation - Step 1 – change the 2 x rapid ligase buffer for 10 x rapid ligase buffer (New England Biolabs product) and only add 10 µL (reduces mixture to 100 µL from 190 µL). - Stop at the end of Step 4 and disregard Steps 5 - 11. Instead, take the entire sample and load onto a BluePippin cassette. Save a few µL of the sample pre-loading to run on an agarose gel later. - To load the sample, bring the sample volume to 120 µL with Tris-HCl pH 8. 0 and add 40 µL BluePippin loading dye. Follow cassette instructions to prepare Blue Pippin cassette and load 4 lanes of a cassette by adding 40 µL of sample into each lane. Load the 5 th lane with BluePippin marker. - Run the BluePippin with the range selection from 5, 000 - 11, 000 bp. - When finished, remove the size-selected DNA from the elution well into a microfuge tube and rise the elution chamber with 40 µL 0. 1 % Tween 20 solution (supplied with BluePippin), adding this to the tube with the sample. - Concentrate and wash the size-selected sample by loading all the BluePippin eluted DNA into an Amicon filter column (0. 5 mL, 10 K) and spinning for 10 min at 14, 000 x g. Discard flow-thru and add 250 µL Tris-HCl to the column. Spin for 15 min at 14, 000 x g. Invert column in a clean collection tube and spin for 2 min at 1, 000 x g. - Save a few µL of concentrated sample to run on an agarose gel later. - Run an agarose gel of the original genomic DNA (unsheared), g-tube sheared DNA, sample before BluePipping and sample after BluePippin. - Continue to next section Section 3. 5 – Fill-In Reaction - At Step 3, quantify with Life Technologies’s Qubit BR dsDNA quantification kit. You need to achieve at least 6 ng/µL to continue. Section 3. 6 – Circularization - No changes to protocol Section 3. 7 – Nebulizer Assembly (3. 7. 1) and DNA Nebulization and Collection/Purification of the Fragmented DNA (3. 7. 2) - No changes to protocol Section 3. 8 – Fragment End Repair - No changes to protocol Section 3. 9 – Immobilization Bead Preparation - For Step 1 – prepare 2 x Library Binding Buffer by mixing 5 mL Molecular Biology Grade Water, 4 mL of 5 M NaCl and 1 mL of 10 x TE. Section 3. 10 – Adaptor Ligation - For Step 4 – incubate at 25 °C for 1 hour in a thermocycler. Section 3. 11 – Library Immobilization - No changes to protocol Section 3. 12 – Library Amplification - Prepare the PCR mixture as indicated for the sample and a second mixture to run without sample as a negative control. Save a few µL of the sample PCR after amplification and the negative PCR sample to run on the BioAnalyzer chip at the end. Section 3. 13 – Sizing Mix Preparation - No changes to protocol Section 3. 14 – Final Library Size Selection - No changes to protocol Section 3. 15 – Library Quality Assessment - Step 1 – use BioAnalyzer chip and run the PCR sample and negative control from Section 3. 12, as well as the final sample. Also, quantify final sample using Life Technologies’s Qubit ssDNA quantification kit. ### Timing Sections 3. 1 to 3. 5 can be performed in a day (including the BluePippin run). A good spot to pause overnight is either right after the BluePippin run (end of Section 3. 4) or after the fill-in reaction and quantification (end of Section 3. 5). Sections 3. 5 or 3. 6 to the end of Section 3. 11 is a good second day of work. Finishing Section 3. 12 to 3. 15 on the third morning allows for plenty of time to continue on with sequencing emPCR later in that day. ### Troublshooting Things that we have noted: 1. The AMPure size selection at the end (Section 3. 13 and 3. 14) can be variable, depending on the AMPure lot and day you do it. - We have considered running the BluePippin cassette selecting for the tighter ~ 500 bp range (instead of the larger range in the protocol) to standardize the paired end fragment size and make this selection more precise. However, if the genomic DNA shearing wasn’t precisely around the 8 kb mark, keeping the larger size window gives more DNA to work with and appears to work just fine. ### Anticipated Results Figure 1 shows typical results of shearing with the Covaris g-tubes and the purification of appropriately sized fragments using the Blue Pippin.

40|$|By sharing injecting equipment, blood borne {{infection}}s are spread among Injecting Drug Users (IDU). One infection that affects many IDU is the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), {{which can cause}} liver cirrhosis and liver carcinoma. The virus that causes AIDS, HIV, is also spread by this route. In this thesis, the simultaneous spread of HCV and HIV among IDU is addressed using mathematical modelling. Policy aimed at reducing the damage that drug users cause to themselves and to society is denoted by Harm Reduction. This includes educating drug users and providing them with clean injection <b>equipment</b> or <b>substitution</b> therapy. Recently, much attention {{is given to the}} concept of treatment as prevention. HIV medication strongly lowers infectiousness of an individual, and HCV may be cured, also stopping any further transmission. We addressed the impact of such measures. We used several quite different types of models, which were useful for studying different types of questions. We first developed a deterministic model of the spread of both HIV and HCV among IDU. This showed how the eventual HIV to HCV prevalence ratio is determined by the distribution of risk-behaviour within a population. In order to evaluate the effects of Harm Reduction policy in Amsterdam, we created a highly detailed model, describing the spread of HIV and HCV among IDU in this town within the past fifty years. For this individual-based model, parameters were informed by the Amsterdam Cohort Studies among IDU. We could not show large policy effects; although syringe sharing may have been lowered substantially, much of the noted decline in viral spread could be explained by ageing of the population and the natural progression of the epidemics. Next, we adapted this individual based model to analyse the impact that starting HIV-treatment in an earlier stage of infection could have. Such policy may strongly impact the number of HIV cases, if implemented within {{the first few years of}} an HIV outbreak. Treatment effects were overestimated when we assumed that all IDU share syringes equally often. To study per individual benefits of intervention or treatment, we used probability calculation. This included the likelihood of preventing infection for the individual under intervention, as well as the expected number of prevented infections to other IDU. Targeting interventions by syringe sharing risk-behaviour of IDU could make policy much more effective, but who are best targeted may depend on the infection and circumstances under consideration. For example, who are best treated first for HCV was found to be determined by the HCV prevalence; only at higher prevalence are lowest-risk-behaviour IDU best treated. Syringe sharing risk-behaviour is likely to be highly variable among IDU, and this heterogeneity will impact on the effects of policy aimed at lowering the spread of infections. To properly judge the impact of past policy this heterogeneity, as well as demographic changes over time, should not be ignored. Worryingly, ignoring risk heterogeneity in models may lead to overly optimistic expectations of future interventions. However, policies may also be improved by targeting IDU of certain risk-level...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) is {{a public}} health {{laboratory}} network consisting of 349 diagnostic pathology laboratories which employ approximately 4200 laboratory personnel. These laboratory workers (the majority of whom are females) may be exposed to various occupational health hazards {{during the course of}} their work, including chemical, physical, biological, ergonomic and psychosocial hazards. Some of these hazards may specifically affect the reproductive ability of both male and female workers. Study Objectives The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and assess, based on field observations, interviews and measurements, the risk to reproductive health from occupational health hazards (focusing on chemical hazards) that might be present in histopathology laboratories of the NHLS. It was expected that this study could sensitise, raise awareness and improve control strategies and procedures aimed at reducing reproductive health risks to both male and female workers in this particular work environment and in other NHLS laboratories. Materials and Methods This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study; the study population included five out of the fifteen existing NHLS histopathology laboratories in the country. Due to the limited time and resources available for this study four out of the five histopathology laboratories sampled were selected from the Gauteng Province (closest to the researcher) and an additional one from the Northern Cape Province. Results The reproductive health risk assessment process detailed in this report, has identified worker‟s exposure to formaldehyde during specimen cut-up, specimen storage and during the process of disposal and making up of formaldehyde solution, as potentially high risk. It also identified exposure to xylene vapours during the automated staining process (particularly when replacing chemicals in the equipment), as potentially high risk. Exposure to hazardous biological agents (HBAs) and various other chemical reagents, ergonomic stress and potential exposure to ionising radiation were identified as moderate reproductive health risks when performing specific histopathology laboratory processes. Discussion The outcome from the health risk assessment supported the conclusion from researchers reviewed in this study that reproductive health risks in the workplace warrant special consideration and exposure to specific hazards, such as organic solvents, might require the implementation of special measures to protect in particular, but not exclusively, pregnant workers. Some of the limitations related to this study include: limited research data on reproductive health and the difficulty of inferring from animal studies to human reproduction; another problem relates to the use of occupational exposure limits (OELs) as benchmark for acceptable or over-exposure, as OELs might be determined without sufficient consideration of reproductive health endpoints. Due to the limited scope of this study only the major chemical hazards identified (formaldehyde and organic solvents, including xylene) could be sampled. Recommendations Protection of laboratory workers from reproductive health hazards should follow the standard occupational hygiene hierarchy of control practice, i. e. substitution and engineering methods should get precedence over strategies that rely on personal protective <b>equipment.</b> Although the <b>substitution</b> of hazardous substances such as formaldehyde and xylene in pathology laboratories appears possible, the health and safety implications of using substitutes must be investigated carefully. Following observations made during this study it was recommended that local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems should be maintained in good working order and their performance routinely tested, both by workers and by an external accredited body. Administrative measures which may include work restrictions and worker transfer should be implemented with caution, and always after thorough consultation with the individual worker. Such measures, when implemented, should be activated even before pregnancy is confirmed to prevent exposure during the crucial period of early foetal growth. It was recommended that the NHLS review the current policy and safe working procedure on pregnancy to include both male and female workers within reproductive age. In terms of personal protective equipment, it was recommended that when potential short-term, high exposure to formaldehyde or xylene is anticipated a half-mask respirator with the appropriate filtering media is applied. Workers must be adequately trained and fit tested to ensure that maximum protection is achieved. Additional information, more research data and detailed survey measurements will be required to substantiate the results of this assessment. In the meantime, the precautionary approach and best control practices should apply, to provide the maximum feasible protection for both males and female laboratory workers in their reproductive age...|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology, the {{manipulation}} of matter at a nanometer scale to produce new materials, structures, and devices having new properties, may revolutionize life in the future. It {{has the potential to}} impact medicine through improved disease diagnosis and treatment technologies and to impact manufacturing by creating smaller, lighter, stronger, and more efficient products. Nanotechnology could potentially decrease the impact of pollution by improving methods for water purification or energy conservation. Although engineered nanomaterials present seemingly limitless possibilities, they bring with them new challenges for identifying and controlling potential safety and health risks to workers. Of particular concern is the growing body of evidence that occupational exposure to some engineered nanomaterials can cause adverse health effects. As with any new technology or new material, the earliest exposures will likely occur for those workers conducting discovery research in laboratories or developing production processes in pilot plants. The research community is at the front line of creating new nanomaterials, testing their usefulness in a variety of applications and determining their toxicological and environmental impacts. Researchers handling engineered nanomaterials in laboratories should perform that work in a manner that protects their safety and health. This guidance document provides the best information currently available on engineering controls and safe work practices to be followed when working with engineered nanomaterials in research laboratories. Risk Management: Risk management {{is an integral part of}} occupational health and safety. Potential exposures to nanomaterials can be controlled in research laboratories through a flexible and adaptive risk management program. An effective program provides the framework to anticipate the emergence of this technology into laboratory settings, recognize the potential hazards, evaluate the exposure to the nanomaterial, develop controls to prevent or minimize exposure, and confirm the effectiveness of those controls. Hazard Identification: Experimental animal studies indicate that potentially adverse health effects may result from exposure to nanomaterials. Experimental studies in rodents and cell cultures have shown that the toxicity of ultrafine particles or nanoparticles is greater than the toxicity of the same mass of larger particles of similar chemical composition. Research demonstrates that inhalation is a significant route of exposure for nanomaterials. Evidence from animal studies indicates that inhaled nanoparticles may deposit deep in lung tissue, possibly interfering with lung function. It is also theorized that nanoparticles may enter the bloodstream through the lungs and transfer to other organs. Dermal exposure and subsequent penetration of nanomaterials may cause local or systemic effects. Ingestion is a third potential route of exposure. Little is known about the possible adverse effects of ingestion of nanomaterials, although some evidence suggests that nanosized particles can be transferred across the intestinal wall. Exposure Assessment: Exposure assessment is a key element of an effective risk management program. The exposure assessment should identify tasks that contribute to nanomaterial exposure and the workers conducting those tasks. An inventory of tasks should be developed that includes information on the duration and frequency of tasks that may result in exposure, along with the quantity of the material being handled, dustiness of the nanomaterial, and its physical form. A thorough understanding of the exposure potential will guide exposure assessment measurements, which will help determine the type of controls required for exposure mitigation. Exposure Control: Exposure control is the use of a set of tools or strategies for decreasing or eliminating worker exposure to a particular agent. Exposure control consists of a standardized hierarchy to include (in priority order) : elimination, substitution, isolation, engineering controls, administrative controls, or if no other option is available, personal protective <b>equipment</b> (PPE). <b>Substitution</b> or elimination is not often feasible for workers performing research with nanomaterials; however, it may be possible to change some aspects of the physical form of the nanomaterial or the process in a way that reduces nanomaterial release. Isolation includes the physical separation and containment of a process or piece of equipment, either by placing it in an area separate from the worker or by putting it within an enclosure that contains any nanomaterials that might be released. Engineering controls include any physical change to the process that reduces emissions or exposure to the material being contained or controlled. Ventilation is a form of engi-neering control that can be used to reduce occupational exposures to airborne particulates. General exhaust ventilation (GEV), also known as dilution ventilation, permits the release of the contaminant into the workplace air and then dilutes the concentration to an acceptable level. GEV alone is not an appropriate control for engineered nanomaterials or any other uncharacterized new chemical entity. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV), such as the standard laboratory chemical hood (formerly known as a laboratory fume hood), captures emissions at the source and thereby removes contaminants from the immediate occupational environment. Using selected forms of LEV properly is appropriate for control of engineered nanomaterials. Administrative controls can limit workers' exposures through techniques such as using job-rotation schedules that reduce the time an individual is exposed to a substance. Administrative controls may consist of standard operating procedures, general or specialized housekeeping procedures, spill prevention and control, and proper labeling and storage of nanomaterials. Employee training on the appropriate use and handling of nanomaterials is also an important administrative function. PPE creates a barrier between the worker and nanomaterials in order to reduce exposures. PPE may include laboratory coats, impervious clothing, closed-toe shoes, long pants, safety glasses, face shields, impervious gloves, and respirators. Other Considerations: Control verification or confirmation is essential to ensure that the implemented tools or strategies are performing as specified. Control verification can be performed with traditional industrial hygiene sampling methods, including area sampling, personal sampling, and real-time measurements. Control verification may also be achieved by monitoring the performance parameters of the control device to ensure that design and performance criteria are met. Other important considerations for effective risk management of nanomaterial expo-sure include fire and explosion control. Some studies indicate that nanomaterials may be more prone to explosion and combustion than an equivalent mass concentration of larger particles. Occupational health surveillance is used to identify possible injuries and illnesses and is recommended as a key element in an effective risk management program. Basic medical screening is prudent and should be conducted under the oversight of a qualified health-care professional. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "May 2012.
