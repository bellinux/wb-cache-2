5|$|MF Global's {{stock price}} {{declined}} two-thirds {{in the final}} week of October 2011 and its credit rating was reduced making its debt high-yield debt following huge quarterly losses. On October 31, 2011, trading was halted on shares of MF Global prior to the market opening, and soon thereafter MF Global announced that it had declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Shortly afterwards, <b>federal</b> <b>regulators</b> began an investigation into {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in missing customer funds. Corzine resigned as CEO on November 4, 2011, after having retained the services of defense attorney Andrew J. Levander. It was reported that Corzine declined a severance package worth $12.1 million. MF Global's collapse was one of the ten biggest bankruptcies in U.S. history.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with <b>federal</b> <b>regulators.</b> By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E
25|$|The United States banking {{industry}} {{is one of}} the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world, with multiple specialized and focused regulators. All banks with FDIC-insured deposits have the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as a regulator. However, for soundness examinations (i.e., whether a bank is operating in a sound manner), the Federal Reserve is the primary <b>federal</b> <b>regulator</b> for Fed-member state banks; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is the primary <b>federal</b> <b>regulator</b> for national banks; and the Office of Thrift Supervision, or OTS, is the primary <b>federal</b> <b>regulator</b> for thrifts. State non-member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the FDIC. National banks have one primary regulator– the OCC.|$|R

25|$|The {{fact that}} credit card {{companies}} can change the interest rate on debts that were incurred when a different rate of interest was in place is similar to adjustable rate mortgages where interest rates on current debt may rise. However, in both cases, this is agreed to in advance, and is a trade off that allows a lower initial rate {{as well as the}} possibility of an even lower rate (mortgages, if interest rates fall) or perpetually keeping a below-market rate (credit cards, if the user makes their debt payments on time). The universal default practice was encouraged by <b>federal</b> <b>regulators,</b> particularly those at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as a means of managing the changing risk profiles of cardholders.|$|E
40|$|In {{the light}} of declines in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stocks, we sought to {{determine}} 14 {{the extent to which}} stream crossings along a newly constructed section of the Trans LabradorHighway (TLH Phase II) in southern Labrador accorded with government regulations for fishhabitat protection. We surveyed crossings of permanent streams over a 210 km road segment,containing 4 bridges and 47 culverts. Fifty-three percent of culverts posed problems to fishpassage, due to poor design or poor installation. We conjecture that cost and inadequateenvironmental oversight in the field explain the weak compliance with the relevant fisheriesguidelines. Our research has prompted the <b>federal</b> <b>regulator</b> to instigate remediation of problemswith the Phase II part of the highway. In addition many of the planned stream crossings for PhaseIII of the TLH were re-designed, and a commitment to careful monitoring of the installations hasbeen made by the <b>federal</b> <b>regulator</b> in cooperation with the indigenous inhabitants...|$|R

25|$|In {{three major}} {{metropolitan}} areas - North Jersey, South Jersey/Philadelphia, and Detroit - Conrail Shared Assets Operations continues {{to serve as}} a terminal operating company owned by both CSX and NS. The Conrail Shared Assets Operations arrangement was a concession made to <b>federal</b> <b>regulators</b> who were concerned about the lack of competition in certain rail markets and logistical problems associated with the breaking up the Conrail operations as they existed in densely populated areas with many local customers. The smaller Conrail operation that exists today serves rail freight customers in these markets on behalf of its two owners. A fourth area, the former Monongahela Railway in southwest Pennsylvania, was originally owned jointly by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Pennsylvania Railroad and Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. Conrail absorbed the company in 1993, and assigned trackage rights to CSX, the successor to the B and P With the Conrail breakup, those lines are owned by NS, but the CSX trackage rights are still in place.|$|E

The deal will result in a merger of two of the United States' three largest pharmacy chains. In response to being able to receive approval, Walgreens said that it would be willing to divest up to 1,000 stores to win regulatory approval for its Rite Aid purchase. Walgreens and Rite Aid, combined, own approximately 200 million square feet of retail space in addition to 21 million square feet of office and warehouse space.
