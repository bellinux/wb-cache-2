5|$|Traditionally, Black Christians have {{identified}} themselves spiritually with the Children of <b>Israel.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century, {{some of them}} also began to claim {{that they were the}} biological descendants of the Israelites. This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain their lost history.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned to labor in state-owned mines. Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, <b>Israel)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry mines in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and sent them to the mines of Palestine. On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E

5|$|Bethlehem {{became part}} of Jund Filastin {{following}} the Muslim conquest in 637. Muslim rule continued in Bethlehem until its conquest in 1099 by a crusading army, who replaced the town's Greek Orthodox clergy with a Latin one. In the mid-13th century, the Mamluks demolished the city's walls, which were subsequently rebuilt under the Ottomans in the early 16th century. Control of Bethlehem passed from the Ottomans to the British {{at the end of}} World War I. Bethlehem came under Jordanian rule during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and was later captured by <b>Israel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1967 Six-Day War. Since the 1995 Oslo Accords, Bethlehem has been administered by the Palestinian Authority.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, dozens of Black Hebrew {{organizations}} were established. In Harlem alone, {{at least eight}} such groups were founded between 1919 and 1931. The Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations is the oldest-known Black Hebrew group and the Church of God and Saints of Christ {{is one of the}} largest Black Hebrew organizations. The Commandment Keepers, founded by Wentworth Arthur Matthew in New York, are noted for their adherence to traditional Judaism. The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem are widely known for having moved from the United States, primarily Chicago, to <b>Israel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late-20th century.|$|E
5|$|Gaza fell to British forces during World War I, {{becoming}} {{a part of}} Mandatory Palestine. As {{a result of the}} 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Egypt administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Gaza was captured by <b>Israel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Six-Day War in 1967, but in 1993, the city was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. Egypt and Israel consequently imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing in 2011 to pedestrians.|$|E

5|$|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is a 2005 American {{documentary}} film that follows singer-songwriter Madonna on her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour.

The documentary was originally called The Re-Invented Process, referencing the tour and the Steven Klein exhibition titled X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It starts with imagery from the exhibition and Madonna auditioning dancers for the tour, continues with her entourage travelling through different cities and performing, the singer's introspection on her life, her marriage, her religion, and her children, and ends with Madonna's visit to <b>Israel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of protests.|$|E
5|$|Israel entered six athletes {{into the}} sailing {{competition}} at the Olympics. For the RS:X class, Maayan Davidovich won the bronze medal at the women's event in the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Championships while Nimrod Mashiah finished eleventh place at the Men's event. Both of them secured a place for <b>Israel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Olympics. In April 2016, Davidovich and Shahar Tzuberi, Beijing 2008 bronze medalist, secured their spots on Israel’s Olympic delegation. Tzuberi defeated Mashiah {{in the battle for}} representing Israel at the Olympics. This was the third time Tzuberi participated at the Olympic Games and the second time for Davidovich. Davidovich finished ninth in the final race, taking 24 minutes and 46 seconds to complete her sail. Her overall ranking was seventh with 78 net points. Before the final race, she was ranked fifth with 60 net points. Tzuberi failed to qualify for the finals and finished seventeenth with 160 net points.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, an Arab {{coalition}} led by Egypt and Syria, supported {{with arms}} and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked <b>Israel</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking {{personal responsibility for}} any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E
