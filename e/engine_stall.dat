2500|$|The Tu-154 is {{described}} as having an average (or better than expected) safety record considering its length of service and heavy use in demanding conditions where other airliners are unable to operate. On January 2, 2011, Russia's Federal Transport Oversight Agency advised airlines to stop using remaining examples of the Tu-154 (B variant) until the fatal fire incident in Surgut had been investigated. Its operation in Iran ceased in February 2011 due {{to a number of}} crashes and incidents involving the type (almost 9% of all Tu-154 losses have occurred in Iran). This grounding compounded the effects of US embargo on civil aircraft parts, substantially decreasing the number of airworthy aircraft in the Iranian civil fleet. In 2010 there were two fatal losses of the Tu-154 due to pilot error and/or weather conditions (a Polish presidential jet attempting a rural airfield landing in heavy fog, the [...] 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash, and a Russian-registered plane that suffered <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> after a crew member accidentally de-activated a fuel transfer pump). Following these accidents, in March 2011 the Russian Federal Bureau of Aviation recommended a withdrawal of remaining Tu-154Ms from service. In December 2010, Uzbekistan Airways also declared that it will cease to operate Tu-154s from 2011.|$|E

In an interview with Chris Economaki minutes later, Sneva said that the <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> happened because he couldn't get the car in gear and once the problem was fixed the engine began to have problems and finally came apart on Sneva's 96th lap completed.|$|E

5000|$|FSAE California 2011 Endurance [...] An extra fan {{was added}} to the {{radiator}} and all rod-ends were replaced before endurance. Because of a loose connection on the car's telemetry system (Back Seat Driver), the car had no RPM readings visible to the driver for the entire competition. The tune of the car was significantly different than the week after FSAE Michigan, therefore more tuning adjustments were completed before endurance. First driver completed the first 11 laps with no problems; {{towards the end of the}} race, the car had almost no fuel, causing an <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> during hard left turns.

50|$|The Mercedes-Benz W202, {{up until}} 1995/1996 was {{equipped}} with biodegradable wiring harnesses. Mercedes-Benz used this technology on {{the most of their}} vehicles made between the years 1992 and 1995/1996. Mercedes-Benz has never specified which cars were affected, but it is almost certain that it concerned all the W202 vehicles of that time period. The purpose of this type of wiring was for the insulation of the wiring to self disintegrate over time, leaving just clean copper wires for the recycling process. Unfortunately, this biodegradable insulation deteriorated much quicker than it was intended due to moisture and heat in the engine compartment. This unwanted deterioration may lead to electrical issues and even unexpected <b>engine</b> <b>stall,</b> which may be hazardous in various road conditions.|$|E

50|$|A car {{fitted with}} an {{automatic}} transmission could also have its <b>engine</b> <b>stalled</b> when the vehicle is travelling {{in the opposite direction}} to the selected gear.

50|$|This was a later {{model of}} the 125 that debuted for 1982 and {{included}} a torque converter clutch or TCC. The TCC acts similar to a clutch in a manual transmission vehicle, in that at speeds above 50 MPH a combination of engine vacuum- and temperature-sensing valves, and a dedicated brake switch - and in later models an ECU - activated a solenoid which engaged a clutch physically locking the impeller and turbine inside the torque converter together causing engine power to be transferred directly to the transaxle. The C in Turbo-Hydramatic 125 C denoted {{the use of a}} TCC. The solenoid that controls this is notorious for failure due to overheated plastic componentry, and problems indicated by an <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> when stopping from speeds greater than 55 MPH. This occurs because the clutch does not disengage, and as the affected vehicle's speed nears zero miles per hour, the engine is forced to decelerate to zero rpm.|$|E

The car was still rolling so he bump started it but it almost stalled again as the race started and he dropped to 7th place behind the Arrows of Eddie Cheever. Whilst he was able to recover these places and get back to second place by lap 8, he could not catch Senna who controlled the gap according to the traffic. Maintaining a lead of 6-10 seconds, Senna slowed on the last lap to make sure he finished without running out of fuel which reduced the gap to the pursuing Prost to just 2.3 seconds at the line. Prost later admitted he had turned up his turbo boost in his fight up to second and although still lapping quicker than most of the field, he was then forced to conserve {{for the rest of the}} race for fear of running dry before the end.|$|E
