Results from IMAGE, a so-called integrated assessment model, are used to link different ecological impacts to different levels of climate change. The analysis shows that, although there are large regional differences, even small increases in <b>global</b> <b>mean</b> <b>temperatures</b> will considerably impact many species, ecosystems and landscapes. Between 1 degreesC and 2 degreesC increases in <b>global</b> <b>mean</b> <b>temperatures</b> most species, ecosystems and landscapes will be impacted and adaptive capacity will become limited. With the already ongoing high rate of climate change, the decline in biodiversity will therefore accelerate and simultaneously many ecosystem services will become less abundant.

25|$|Atmospheric GHG {{concentrations}} can {{be related}} to changes in <b>global</b> <b>mean</b> <b>temperature</b> by the climate sensitivity. Projections of future global warming are affected by different estimates of climate sensitivity. For a given increase in the atmospheric concentration of GHGs, high estimates of climate sensitivity suggest that relatively more future warming will occur, while low estimates of climate sensitivity suggest that relatively less future warming will occur. Lower values would correspond with less severe climate impacts, while higher values would correspond with more severe impacts.|$|E
25|$|Conceivable {{levels of}} human-made climate forcing could yield the low-end runaway greenhouse. A forcing of 12–16 W m−2 would require carbon dioxide (CO2) levels to {{increase}} 8–16 times. If the forcing were due only to CO2 change, this {{would raise the}} <b>global</b> <b>mean</b> <b>temperature</b> by 16–24nbsp&°C with much larger polar warming. A warming of 16–24nbsp&°C produces a moderately moist greenhouse, with water vapour increasing to about 1% of the atmosphere's mass, thus increasing the rate of hydrogen escape to space. If such a forcing were entirely due to CO2, the weathering process would remove the excess atmospheric CO2 on a time scale of 104–105 years, well before the ocean was significantly depleted. Venus-like conditions on the Earth require a large long-term forcing that is unlikely to occur until the sun brightens by a few tens of percents, which will take a few billion years.|$|E
25|$|Along the {{efficient}} emission path calculated by Nordhaus and Boyer (2000) (referred to by Fisher et al.., 2007), the long-run global average temperature after 500 years increases by 6.2°C above the 1900 level. Nordhaus and Boyer (2000) stated their {{concern over the}} potentially large and uncertain impacts of such a large environmental change. It {{should be noted that}} the projected temperature in this IAM, like any other, is subject to scientific uncertainty (e.g., the relationship between concentrations of GHGs and <b>global</b> <b>mean</b> <b>temperature,</b> which is called the climate sensitivity). Projections of future atmospheric concentrations based on emission pathways are also affected by scientific uncertainties, e.g., over how carbon sinks, such as forests, will be affected by future climate change.

25|$|As stated earlier, the CO2 {{released}} by soil respiration is a greenhouse gas {{that will continue}} to trap energy and increase the <b>global</b> <b>mean</b> <b>temperature</b> if concentrations continue to rise. As global temperature rises, so will the rate of soil respiration across the globe thereby leading to a higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, again leading to higher global temperatures. This {{is an example of a}} positive feedback loop. It is estimated that a rise in temperature by 2 degrees Celsius will lead to an additional release of 10 Pg carbon per year to the atmosphere from soil respiration. This is a larger amount than current anthropogenic carbon emissions. There also exists a possibility that this increase in temperature will release carbon stored in permanently frozen soils, which are now melting. Climate models have suggested that this positive feedback between soil respiration and temperature will lead to a decrease in soil stored carbon by the middle of this century.|$|E
