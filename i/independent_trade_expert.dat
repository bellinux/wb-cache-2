40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an investment}} algorithm for a market of individual securities. The investment algorithm {{is derived from}} constraints depending on investment parameters in order to limit the risk and {{to take into account}} an individual investor. One constraint is devoted to trading costs. Purchased securities are selected randomly among securities that meet the buy condition, making trading a random trial. Simulations with historical price data are demonstrated for a simple example: The buy condition is evaluated {{on the basis of the}} price relationship for two subsequent trading days and the sales condition is defined by holding securities only for one day. A <b>trading</b> <b>expert</b> evaluates the expected return for the investment algorithm with respect to the random selection. Thus, the expert informs precisely on how many market players perform using the same investment algorithm. Its findings are for a parametrized set of buy conditions simultaneously, which makes a <b>trading</b> <b>expert</b> a valuable tool for theorists as well as for practitioners. In our example, the <b>trading</b> <b>expert</b> demonstrated clearly a significant mean reversion effect for a horizon of one day...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a {{portfolio}} optimization algorithm based on Evolution Strategies is presented. This method {{makes use of}} artificial <b>trading</b> <b>experts</b> discovered earlier by a genetic algorithm. These experts, consisting of technical analysis rules, are trained to process financial time series and to generate trading advice. Evolution Strategies lead to the optimization of portfolio structures where individual <b>trading</b> <b>experts</b> advice is integrated. This approach is tested on a sample financial time series taken from the Paris Stock Exchange. The resulting investment strategy has been compared with the Buy-and-Hold strategy and the market index. The research presented extends our previous research into stock trading. ...|$|R
