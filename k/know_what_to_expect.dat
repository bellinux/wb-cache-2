25|$|Moving {{lights are}} much more {{difficult}} to program than their conventional cousins because they have more attributes per fixture that must be controlled. A simple conventional lighting fixture uses only one channel of control per unit: intensity. Everything else that the light must do is pre-set by human hands (colour, position, focus, etc.) An automated lighting fixture can have as many as 30 of these control channels. A slew of products are available on the market to allow operators and programmers to easily control all of these channels on multiple fixtures. Lighting boards are still the most common control mechanism, but many programmers use computer software to do the job. Software is now available that provides a rendered preview of the output produced by the rig once fixtures are connected to the program or console. This allows programmers to work on their show before ever entering the theater and <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> when the lights are connected to their controller. These products usually feature some method of converting a computer's USB output to a DMX output.|$|E

500|$|Concert {{promoter}} Bill Graham billed {{the performances}} as [...] "Jimi Hendrix: A Band of Gypsys", but Hendrix's new direction since {{the breakup of}} the Experience six months earlier had not been publicized. With a new lineup and material, Cox observed, [...] "We didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from the audience and the audience didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from us". A total of 47 songs were performed and recorded; since most were played in more than one show, the number of different songs was 24. [...] The group did not prepare set lists or otherwise plan for their performances. [...] McDermott notes, [...] "Hendrix called out tunes to Miles and Cox and would often make time and tempo changes on the fly, alerting his partners with a simple head nod or raising of his guitar neck". [...] Miles also saw improvisation as a key element of their approach. [...] According to Shadwick, the first show was essentially a warm-up set and they performed eleven new songs (it was the only show not to include any familiar Experience numbers). There were some microphone problems during the first two songs, which re-appeared for the first two songs of the second show as well. Hendrix also experienced tuning problems with his guitar. [...] His heavy use of the Stratocaster's vibrato arm or [...] "whammy bar" [...] stressed the strings and led to pitch problems, which he was often forced to correct mid-song. [...] For the second show, in addition to new songs, Hendrix added [...] "Stone Free", [...] "Foxy Lady", [...] "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)", and [...] "Purple Haze" [...] to ring in the new decade.|$|E

Ry Cooder's guitar parts are handled by Manuel Galbán, a former member of Cuban vocal group Los Zafiros, who played on Ibrahim Ferrer's first solo record with Cooder and appeared in Wim Wenders' film. Following a 2007 performance in London, a reviewer at The Independent described the ensemble as [...] "something of an anomaly in music business terms, due to their changing line-up and the fact that they've never really had one defining front person", adding, [...] "It's hard to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from what is more of a brand than a band." ...|$|E

[...] "I was nervous, my hands were sweating. It was really exciting, but I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect.</b> I was a little nervous that ... {{all of a sudden}} I wouldn't be able to hit." [...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E

[...] Posner said that people would [...] "flip" [...] over the beat and that radio stations would want to play the song. Levy also commented on the track, and described it as [...] "definitely edgier, it's more grown-up, it's more developed and it's sexier."

500|$|The Wilson {{murder is}} a [...] "red ball", a police case {{involving}} an innocent victim, widely known suspects {{or a combination}} of the two. Red ball cases tend to draw attention from the media, the public and high-ranking police brass, and often result in additional detectives being added to the case. Fontana thought these elements of the red ball case would help produce a strong season premiere and tension among the veteran characters who resent the meddling of the new detectives. Julie Martin, one of the show's writers and supervising producers, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] marked a deliberate change in the series, focusing on darker story lines that are [...] "a little messier and unresolved" [...] and more interpersonal relationships: [...] "The show's been on for six seasons, and it absolutely has to change. We can't keep doing the same show." [...] Media outlets noted that [...] "Blood Ties" [...] included more action-oriented elements such as car chases and a chase sequence involving helicopters at an airport. Fontana denied allegations of tampering from NBC executives and said any such changes would have come from him: [...] "I don't want us to have a style every week that we feel we have to conform to. ...

2500|$|In later {{collections}} Lagerfeld {{chose to}} break away from the ladylike look of Chanel and began to experiment with fabrics and styles. During the 1980s, more than 40 Chanel boutiques opened worldwide. By the end of the 1980s, the boutiques sold goods ranging from US$200-per-ounce perfume, US$225 ballerina slippers to US$11,000 dresses and US$2,000 leather handbags. Chanel cosmetics and fragrances were distributed only by Chanel outlets. Chanel marketer Jean Hoehn explained the firm's approach, saying, [...] "We introduce a new fragrance every 10 years, not every three minutes like many competitors. We don't confuse the consumer. With Chanel, people <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect.</b> And they keep coming back to us, at all ages, as they enter and leave the market." [...] The 1984 launch of a new fragrance, in honor of the founder, Coco, continued the label's success. In 1986, the House of Chanel struck a deal with watchmakers and in 1987, the first Chanel watch debuted. By the end of the decade, Alain moved the offices to New York City.|$|E
