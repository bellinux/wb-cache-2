6000|$|She dropped <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the fire. [...] "No, you don't; {{not even}} the hard things a really generous nature often would." [...] She quitted, however, as if to forget that, the chimney-place. [...] "I put it THERE!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We have a {{relic of}} a {{delicate}} temple here,' said Lord Montfort, directing <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> another window. 'You see it now to advantage; the columns glitter in the sun. There, perhaps, was worshipped some wood-nymph, or some river-god.' ...|$|E
50|$|Heurodis the Medusa sacrificed {{her eyes}} (and thus <b>her</b> Flesh-to-Stone <b>Gaze)</b> <b>to</b> become a lich in Neverwinter Nights: Shadows of Undrentide. The mythal {{empowering}} Undrentide served as her phylactery.|$|R

6000|$|Tony’s cheeks {{turned a}} trifle gray, {{but this time}} he met <b>her</b> <b>gaze.</b> “Listen <b>to</b> me, Lucy. On my word of honor I had no hand in what happened,” he said. “The solemn truth is that your father had an altercation with Appleby, and {{afterwards}} fell over the bridge.” ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bowman stopped {{suddenly}} and stood regarding him. There {{was a light}} in her eye which made him feel anything but comfortable. He was glad when she transferred <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the clock. She looked at it so long that he murmured something about going.|$|E
6000|$|Miriam {{transferred}} the dark weight of <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> {{him as if}} she were practising. [...] "You won't upset her, at any rate." [...] Then she stood with her beautiful and fatal mask before her hostess. [...] "I want to do the modern too. I want to do le drame, with intense realistic effects." ...|$|E
60|$|She set {{her chair}} where he indicated, and Pierston stood close beside her, {{directing}} <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the familiar objects he had regarded thence as a boy. Her head and face--the latter thoughtful and worn enough, poor thing, {{to suggest a}} married life none too comfortable--were close to his breast, and, with a few inches further incline, would have touched it.|$|E
6000|$|... "'He was a {{remarkable}} man,' I said, unsteadily. Then before the appealing fixity of <b>her</b> <b>gaze,</b> that seemed <b>to</b> watch for more words on my lips, I went on, 'It was impossible not to--' ...|$|R
60|$|Katharine {{took the}} sheets from her mother's hand and began {{shuffling}} them absent-mindedly together, for <b>her</b> fixed <b>gaze</b> seemed <b>to</b> show that her thoughts were intent upon some other matter.|$|R
5000|$|Medusa is the [...] "mean girl" [...] at Mount Olympus Academy. In {{the first}} seven books, she is the archenemy of the four most popular goddess girls at the Academy. She is famous for <b>her</b> stoneifying <b>gaze,</b> which was accidentally caused by one of Athena's inventions. Snarkypoo, or as Athena misspelled it, Snakeypoo, dripped in Medusa's eyes when she was {{showering}} and ended up making <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> able <b>to</b> turn mortals into stone. Snarkypoo was originally made to turn snarky words into stone.|$|R
6000|$|There was a pause, {{during which}} Billie allowed <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> travel casually about the room. Sam {{occupied}} the intermission by staring furtively at her profile. He was by {{now in a}} thoroughly overwrought condition, and the thumping of his heart sounded to him as if workmen were mending the street outside. How beautiful she looked, with that red hair peeping out beneath her hat and ... However! ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Stackpole {{directed}} <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the Constable again, and Ralph bespoke {{her attention}} {{for a small}} Lancret hanging near it, which represented a gentleman in a pink doublet and hose and a ruff, leaning against the pedestal {{of the statue of}} a nymph in a garden and playing the guitar to two ladies seated on the grass. [...] "That's my ideal of a regular occupation," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|The prince was {{crossing}} the room toward the audience chamber when his glance happened to fall upon Bertha Kircher. He halted {{in his tracks}} and stood looking {{at her for a}} full minute without speaking. The girl, embarrassed by his bold stare and her scant attire, flushed and, dropping <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the floor, turned away. Metak suddenly commenced to tremble from head to foot and then, without warning other than a loud, hoarse scream he sprang forward and seized the girl in his arms.|$|E
60|$|Just then Wade {{entered the}} cabin with his soft tread, hesitated, {{and then came}} to Columbine's side. She could not unrivet <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> from Moore <b>to</b> look at her friend, but she reached out with {{trembling}} hand to him. Wade clasped it in a horny palm.|$|R
60|$|The officer {{shrugged his}} shoulders. The girl turned <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> upon him <b>to</b> note {{the effect of}} Tarzan's proposal. The Englishman grew {{suddenly}} very white, {{but there was a}} smile upon his lips as without a word he slipped {{over the edge of the}} plane and clambered to the ground behind Tarzan.|$|R
6000|$|... "But why?" [...] I persisted. I {{wanted a}} good reason for calling up all the details of the most strenuous and terrible day in my border experience. She was silent a moment. I saw <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> turn <b>to</b> the spot where Steele lay asleep, and it was a pity he could not see her eyes then. [...] "Frankly, I don't want to tell you," [...] I added, and I surely would have been glad {{to get out of the}} job.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{they looked}} at each other. Violet had a brown {{birthmark}} on her neck as large as a silver half-dollar. William fixed his eyes upon it. William Pry had inordinately bowed legs. Violet allowed <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> linger unswervingly upon them. Face to face they stood thus for moments, each staring at the other. Etiquette would not allow them to speak; but in the Caoutchouc City it is permitted to gaze without stint at the trees in the parks and at the physical blemishes of a fellow creature.|$|E
60|$|One of the two, {{with whom}} Clarence was conversing in a lively manner that showed his heart {{had not been}} irreparably broken {{as the result of}} his recent {{interview}} with Ruth, we may dismiss. Like Clarence, she is of no importance to the story. The other, who, not finding Bailey's measured remarks very gripping, was allowing <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> wander idly around the room, has this claim to a place in the scheme of things, that she had a wordless part in the comedy in which Percy Shanklyn had appeared as the English dude and was on terms of friendship with him.|$|E
60|$|Nan, however, {{was more}} than equal to the occasion. Presently she smiled at Spears, such a smile! The captain {{looked as if he}} had just partaken of an intoxicating wine. With a {{heightened}} color in her cheeks and a dangerous flash in her roguish eyes, Nan favored McCall with a look, which was as much as to say that she remembered him with a dear sadness. She made eyes at every fellow in the car, and then bringing back <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the Rube, as if glorying in comparison, she nestled her curly black head on his shoulder. He gently tried to move her; but it was not possible. Nan knew how to meet the ridicule of half a dozen old lovers. One by one they buried themselves in newspapers, and finally McCall, for once utterly beaten, showed a white feather, and sank back out of sight behind his seat.|$|E
50|$|Alquilar {{spent her}} early life working {{as both a}} teacher and a social worker. <b>Her</b> <b>gaze</b> shifted <b>to</b> art when in 1970, she and Colette Garrison opened the Jennifer Pauls Gallery in Old Sacramento. Alquilar focused on expressionistic and figurative imagery and showcased artists such as Anne Gregory, Ken Little, Joan Moment and Mary Warner. She later became the sole owner of the gallery, and took it {{with her when she}} moved to Lake of the Pines and then Roseville. She {{eventually}} returned to Sacramento, installing the Jennifer Pauls Gallery in a shared space with the Himovitz/Solomon Gallery.|$|R
5000|$|Medusa {{appears in}} the Marvel 1602 miniseries: 1602: Fantastick Four {{as a member of}} the [...] "Four Who Are Frightful", and the Wizard's lover. Like her Ultimate counterpart, she has snakes for hair. She must also wear a veil, <b>to</b> prevent <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> turning men <b>to</b> stone. While her {{introduction}} describes her as [...] "inhuman" [...] her origins are not mentioned. She appears to be a native French speaker (hence, [...] "Madame" [...] Medusa).|$|R
60|$|Kauffman {{remained}} {{in his room}} but a few moments. When he departed, carefully locking his door after him, he was still whistling. Josie ran to her own door {{and when he had}} passed it opened it just a crack, <b>to</b> enable <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>gaze</b> after him. Underneath his arm he carried a bundle of the sample suspenders.|$|R
60|$|For {{several minutes}} Dick drove along homeward, with the inner eye of {{reflection}} so anxiously set on his passages at arms with Fancy, {{that the road}} and scenery were as a thin mist over the real pictures of his mind. Was she a coquette? The balance between the evidence that she did love him and {{that she did not}} was so nicely struck, that his opinion had no stability. She had let him put his hand upon hers; she had allowed <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> drop plumb into the depths of his--his into hers--three or four times; her manner had been very free with regard to the basin and towel; she had appeared vexed at the mention of Shiner. On the other hand, she had driven him about the house like a quiet dog or cat, said Shiner cared for her, and seemed anxious that Mr. Maybold should do the same.|$|E
6000|$|As Ann came in one summer's day, [...] She {{felt that}} she must creep, So silent was the clear cool house, [...] It seemed a house of sleep. And sure, when she pushed open the door, [...] Rapt in the stillness there, Her mother sat, with stooping head, [...] Asleep upon a chair; Fast--fast asleep; her two hands laid [...] Loose-folded on her knee, So that her small {{unconscious}} face [...] Looked half unreal to be: So calmly lit with sleep's pale light [...] Each feature was; so fair Her forehead--every trouble was [...] Smooth'd out beneath her hair. But though her mind in dream now moved, [...] Still seemed <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> rest From out beneath her fast-sealed lids, [...] Above her moving breast, On Ann, as quite, quite still she stood; [...] Yet slumber lay so deep Even her hands upon her lap [...] Seemed saturate with sleep. And as Ann peeped, a cloudlike dread [...] Stole over her, and then, On stealthy, mouselike feet she trod, [...] And tiptoed out again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Without Sir Claude?" [...] Strangely, Mrs. Beale {{looked even}} brighter. [...] "Yes; in the eagerness {{to get at}} you. You abominable little villain!"--and her stepmother, {{laughing}} clear, administered to her cheek a pat that was partly a pinch. [...] "What were you up to {{and what did you}} take me for? But I'm glad to be abroad, and after all it's you who have shown me the way. I mightn't, without you, have been able to come--to come, that is, so soon. Well, here I am at any rate and in a moment more I should have begun to worry about you. This will do very well"--she was good-natured about the place and even presently added that it was charming. Then with a rosier glow she made again her great point: [...] "I'm free, I'm free!" [...] Maisie made on her side her own: she carried back <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Wix, whom amazement continued to hold; she drew afresh her old friend's attention to the superior way she didn't take that up. What she did take up the next minute was the question of Sir Claude. [...] "Where is he? Won't he come?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The film {{opens with}} Elaine, a {{beautiful}} young witch, driving to Arcata, California {{to start a new}} life after the death of her husband Jerry. It is heavily implied that Elaine murdered him. Once there she rents a room in a Victorian home owned by Elaine's mentor Barbara and kept up by its interior decorator, Trish Manning. In an attempt to befriend the young woman Trish takes Elaine to a teahouse, where she's met by her husband Richard, who is instantly besotted with Elaine after meeting <b>her</b> <b>gaze.</b> Hoping <b>to</b> find a new lover, Elaine performs a ritual to find a new man and soon meets Wayne, a literature teacher at the local college.|$|R
60|$|When {{the missionary}} left the lodge with the runner, Whispering Winds had smiled, {{for she had}} saved him whom she loved to hear speak; but the dread command that {{followed}} paled her cheek. Black paint meant hideous death. She saw this man so like the white father. <b>Her</b> piteous <b>gaze</b> tried <b>to</b> turn from that white face; but the cold, steely eyes fascinated her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Glorious!" [...] murmured Caroline, <b>her</b> desponding <b>gaze</b> raised <b>to</b> {{contemplate}} the grand head, fine brow, firm lips, and dark glancing eye, turned {{up for a}} moment in the enthusiastic spirit of self-devotion. That look, unknowing as was Marian that she wore it, penetrated into Caroline's soul, and warmed her too with the temper of martyrdom. [...] "Glorious;" [...] she repeated a second time, and the tone was not so broken and hopeless as before.|$|R
60|$|Remembering suddenly, however, {{that she}} was sitting there to clear off Mr. Balladyce, {{because it was so}} {{necessary}} to keep up with what he wrote, Cecilia dropped <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the page before her; and instantly, by uncomfortable chance, not the choice pastures of Mr. Balladyce appeared, where women might browse at leisure, but a vision of the little model. She had not thought of her for quite an hour; she had tired herself out with thinking-not, indeed, of her, but of all that hinged on her, ever since Stephen had spoken of his talk with Hilary. Things Hilary had said seemed to Cecilia's delicate and rather timid soul so ominous, so unlike himself. Was there really going to be complete disruption between him and Bianca--worse, an ugly scandal? She, who knew her sister better, perhaps, than anyone, remembered from schoolroom days Bianca's moody violence when anything had occurred to wound her--remembered, too, the long fits of brooding that followed. This affair, which she had tried to persuade herself was exaggerated, loomed up larger than ever. It was not an isolated squib; it was a lighted match held to a train of gunpowder. This girl of the people, coming from who knew where, destined for who knew what--this young, not very beautiful, not even clever child, with nothing but a sort of queer haunting naivete' to give her charm--might even be a finger used by Fate! Cecilia sat very still before that sudden vision of the girl. There was no staid mare to guard that foal with the dark devotion of her eye. There was no wise whinnying to answer back those tiny whinnies; no long look round to watch the little creature nodding to sleep on its thin trembling legs in the hot sunlight; no ears to prick up and hoofs to stamp at the approach of other living things. These thoughts passed through Cecilia's mind and were gone, being too far and pale to stay. Turning the page which she had not been reading, she heaved a sigh. Thyme sighed also.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was in}} the {{men that}} Joan felt mostly that element of wildness. Kells lay with his ghastly face clear in the play of the moving flare of light. It was an intelligent, keen, strong face, but evil. Evil power stood out in the lines, in the strange eyes, {{stranger}} then ever, now in shadow; and it seemed once more the face of an alert, listening, implacable man, with wild projects in mind, driving him to the doom he meant for others. Pearce's red face shone redder in that ruddy light. It was hard, lean, almost fleshless, a red mask stretched over a grinning skull. The one they called Frenchy was little, dark, small-featured, with piercing gimlet-like eyes, and a mouth ready to gush forth hate and violence. The next two were not particularly individualized by any striking aspect, merely looking border ruffians after the type of Bill and Halloway. But Gulden, who sat {{at the end of the}} half-circle, was an object that Joan could scarcely bring <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> study. Somehow her first glance at him put into her mind a strange idea--that she was a woman and therefore of all creatures or things in the world the farthest removed from him. She looked away, and found her gaze returning, fascinated, as if she were a bird and he a snake. The man was of huge frame, a giant whose every move suggested the acme of physical power. He was an animal--a gorilla with a shock of light instead of black hair, of pale instead of black skin. His features might have been hewn and hammered out with coarse, dull, broken chisels. And upon his face, in the lines and cords, in the huge caverns where his eyes hid, and in the huge gash that held strong, white fangs, had been stamped by nature and by life a terrible ferocity. Here was a man or a monster in whose presence Joan felt that she would rather be dead. He did not smoke; he did not indulge in the coarse, good-natured raillery, he sat there like a huge engine of destruction that needed no rest, but was forced to rest because of weaker attachments. On the other hand, he was not sullen or brooding. It was that he did not seem to think.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a morning}} when, during the hour before luncheon {{and shortly after}} {{the arrival of a}} neighbourly contingent-- neighbourly from ten miles off--whom Mrs. Verver had taken in charge, Maggie paused on the {{threshold}} of the gallery through which she had been about to pass, faltered there for the very impression of his face as it met her from an opposite door. Charlotte, half-way down the vista, held together, as if by something almost austere in the grace of her authority, the semi-scared (now that they were there!) knot of her visitors, who, since they had announced themselves by telegram as yearning to inquire and admire, saw themselves restricted to this consistency. Her voice, high and clear and a little hard, reached her husband and her step-daughter while she thus placed beyond doubt her cheerful submission to duty. Her words, addressed to the largest publicity, rang for some minutes through the place, every one as quiet to listen {{as if it had been}} a church ablaze with tapers and she were taking her part in some hymn of praise. Fanny Assingham looked rapt in devotion--Fanny Assingham who forsook this other friend as little as she forsook either her host or the Princess or the Prince or the Principino; she supported her, in slow revolutions, in murmurous attestations of presence, at all such times, and Maggie, advancing after a first hesitation, was not to fail of noting her solemn, inscrutable attitude, her eyes attentively lifted, so that she might escape being provoked to betray an impression. She betrayed one, however, as Maggie approached, dropping <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the latter's level long enough to seem to adventure, marvellously, on a mute appeal. [...] "You understand, don't you, that if she didn't do this there would be no knowing what she might do?" [...] This light Mrs. Assingham richly launched while her younger friend, unresistingly moved, became uncertain again, and then, not too much to show it--or, rather, positively to conceal it, and to conceal something more as well--turned short round to one of the windows and awkwardly, pointlessly waited. [...] "The largest of the three pieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands, looped round it, which, as you see, are the finest possible vieux Saxe, are not of the same origin or period, or even, wonderful as they are, of a taste quite so perfect. They have been put on at a later time, by a process of which there are very few examples, and none so important as this, which is really quite unique--so that, though the whole thing is a little baroque, its value as a specimen is, I believe, almost inestimable." ...|$|E
60|$|Nas Ta Bega {{turned the}} mustangs loose to fare for what scant grass grew on bench and slope. Firewood was {{even harder to}} find than grass. When the camp duties had been {{performed}} and the simple meal eaten there was gloom gathering in the cañon and the stars had begun to blink in the pale strip of blue above the lofty walls. The place was oppressive and the fugitives mostly silent. Shefford spread a bed of blankets for the women, and Jane at once lay wearily down. Fay stood beside the flickering fire, and Shefford felt her watching him. He was conscious {{of a desire to}} get away from <b>her</b> haunting <b>gaze.</b> <b>To</b> the gentle good-night he bade her she made no response.|$|R
5000|$|The tondo {{depicts a}} seated Virgin Mary {{with the baby}} Jesus {{dynamically}} sprawled across her lap, turning and looking back over his right shoulder towards the infant Saint John the Baptist, who stands before him looking down and holding a fluttering bird. Compositionally, {{the eye of the}} viewer is drawn diagonally along Christ's body, back up that of his mother, with <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> across <b>to</b> John, and from his face back to Christ. John, patron saint of Florence, with his attribute of a baptismal bowl, crosses his arms, perhaps in allusion to the cross. Most likely it is a goldfinch not a dove that he holds - Christian symbolism sees in this bird a representation of the Passion - the piece of marble below might then have been intended as a crown of thorns.|$|R
60|$|Unlike {{the women}} of most warm races, those of Hawaii age well and nobly. With no pretence of make-up or cunning {{concealment}} of time's inroads, the woman who sat under the hau tree might have been permitted as much as fifty years by a judge competent anywhere over the world save in Hawaii. Yet her children and her grandchildren, and Roscoe Scandwell who had been her husband for forty years, {{knew that she was}} sixty-four and would be sixty-five come the next twenty-second day of June. But she did not look it, {{despite the fact that she}} thrust reading glasses on her nose as she read her magazine and took them off when <b>her</b> <b>gaze</b> desired <b>to</b> wander in the direction of the half-dozen children playing on the lawn.|$|R
