5|$|Two years {{following}} Gruntilda's first defeat by Banjo and Kazooie, {{the two are}} playing poker with their friends Mumbo Jumbo and Bottles in Banjo's house. Meanwhile, Gruntilda's sisters Mingella and Blobbelda arrive in a large digging machine, the Hag 1, and destroy the boulder trapping Gruntilda with a magical spell. Unfortunately Gruntilda's time spent underground has rotted <b>her</b> <b>flesh</b> away and reduced her to a skeleton. Seeking revenge, Gruntilda destroys Banjo's house before fleeing with her sisters. Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo escape the house, but Bottles, who stays behind believing it is all a joke, gets caught in the blast and is killed. The three remaining friends swear to track Gruntilda down {{and put an end}} to her plans.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{cuts from}} Charlotte's buttocks, frying {{a strip of}} <b>her</b> <b>flesh</b> on a stove. Squires tells of how he began an affair with Monica, Tyler's wife and mother of his twin children, {{destroying}} Tyler's career. Tyler hands Squires the flesh, and he eats, fearing Charlotte will die. Tyler reveals how he hates cryptic crosswords, and how his son entered the Cambridge Crossword Competition, attempting to beat his mother's new husband: Squires. Squires realises that Charlotte is Tyler's daughter. Charlotte and Tyler sought revenge on Squires, but Tyler changed plans so Squires would include clues in the crossword. However, Simon's autopsy—Tyler explains—revealed that Simon and Charlotte were actually Squires's children, meaning Monica and Squires's relationship began earlier than he previously thought. Charlotte is past saving, and Tyler places a bullet on Squires's desk, quoting Chekhov's gun. Squires confirms that his middle name is Hector as he weeps over Charlotte, and Tyler circles something on the crossword. Charlotte is dead, and Squires loads the gun, placing it in his mouth. Blood splatters over the crossword and a second nina: RIP NHS.|$|E
5|$|While Aeron {{is within}} the Towers, a time counter is displayed, showing the {{advancement}} of Elena's curse. As Aeron defeats both normal enemies and the Masters of each Tower, he gathers flesh from them which he must give to Elena to eat and reverse the curse's effects, resetting the timer: the amount of reversion {{is dependent on the}} quality of flesh, which deteriorates over time after being extracted. Elena's state is also tied to the Affinity gauge; giving <b>her</b> <b>flesh,</b> talking with her, giving her gifts and asking her to help with tasks raise the meter, but delaying reverting Elena's transformation causes it to decrease. The strength of Aeron's relationship with Elena directly impacts the game's ending. Items and equipment are created and stored in the Observatory, with Mavda using materials brought back from the Towers to create new equipment for Aeron. She can also repair equipment that has been damaged in combat while equipped to Aeron, and upgrade existing weapons and equipment with new materials. If the time limit is exceeded and Elena completes her transformation, or Aeron falls in battle, the game ends and restarts from the last active save.|$|E

25|$|Melinoë is the {{daughter}} of Persephone, who was visited by Zeus disguised as her husband Hades. Although the wording of the hymn is unclear at this point, Pluto (or perhaps Zeus) becomes angry upon learning of the pregnancy and rends <b>her</b> <b>flesh.</b> The figure called Zeus Chthonios in the Orphic Hymns is either another name for Pluto or Zeus in a chthonic aspect.|$|E
500|$|The three {{objects on}} the bedside cabinet {{represent}} the Virgin's purity: the water flask, the candleholder, and the ropewick light. [...] The light passing through {{the glass of the}} womb-shaped flask symbolizes <b>her</b> <b>flesh,</b> pierced by divine light, its clear and undisturbed water represents her purity at the moment of conception, a device also found in the earlier paintings as a metaphor of the Virgin's sanctity. The flask shows a reflection of the window's crossbar as a cross, a symbol of the Crucifixion, another small detail in which Memling [...] "lays one translucent symbolic form upon another".|$|E

500|$|The panel {{closely resembles}} Dürer's 1514 drawing Portrait of the artist's {{mother at the}} age of 63. David Price writes of the drawing's [...] "rough {{depiction}} of <b>her</b> <b>flesh</b> emaciated by old age", and the [...] "existential piety in the cast of Barbara Dürer's right eye, which, almost unnaturally, directs her vision heavenward". Although Barbara is some 25 years older in the later drawing and by then terminally ill, the facial resemblance and pose are unmistakable. However, there is a dramatic difference between the relatively young looking 39-year-old woman in the diptych and the aged and terminally ill widow in the 1514 drawing. A family resemblance can be detected between both works and Dürer's Vienna self-portrait; most evidently around the mouth. Kemperdick concludes that these passages are so closely modeled that it is reasonable to presume they were drawn by the same hand, but is conservative in saying definitively that the sitters were related by blood, as Dürer was very young, and though precociously talented, to some extent still reliant on facial [...] "types".|$|E
500|$|For {{inspiration}} on the routines in Dance of the Hours, animators studied {{real life}} ballet performers including Marge Champion and Irina Baronova. Animator John Hench {{was assigned to}} work on the segment, but resisted as he knew little about ballet. Disney then gave Hench season tickets to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo with backstage access so he could learn more about it. According to R. D. Feild's The Art of Walt Disney, in order to draw Hyacinth, the hippo prima ballerina, a woman weighing over [...] was brought onto the live-action stage and her movements were recorded by cameramen, recording the [...] "least quiver of <b>her</b> <b>flesh,</b> noticing those parts of her anatomy that were subjected to the greatest stress and strain". Béla Lugosi, best known for his role in Dracula, was brought in to provide reference poses for Chernabog in the Night on Bald Moumtain segment. As animator Bill Tytla disliked the results, he used colleague Wilfred Jackson to pose shirtless which gave him the images he needed. There were ideas of releasing scents throughout the theater during Fantasia, including the smell of incense during Ave Maria.|$|E
500|$|A {{correspondent}} from The Daily Telegraph visited Ellen about 22months {{after she}} fell ill. He wrote:The girl's face {{is by no}} means cadaverous. There is flesh on the cheeks, which have a pinkish tint, and there is some colour in the thin lips. The eyes are calmly closed, as though in healthy sleep. I ventured to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash.... The girl's [...] was quite warm and moist, and the finger nails were neatly trimmed. The fingers are not the least bit stiffened... It is not a skeleton hand, neither are any of the girl's limbs so emaciated as, under the extraordinary circumstances alleged, might be expected.... The child's body is very thin as compared with her limbs.... There is not much substance in <b>her</b> <b>flesh,</b> however; it is soft and flabby... almost ice-cold.... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that {{it is almost impossible to}} detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth, and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plot may}} also revolve around an unexplained metamorphosis, a supernatural change, or {{a shift in}} the laws of physics.

2500|$|According to {{much later}} accounts, in October 1837 a girl {{by the name}} of Mary Stevens was walking to Lavender Hill, where she was working as a servant, after visiting her parents in Battersea. On her way through Clapham Common, a strange figure leapt at her from a dark alley. After immobilising her with a tight grip of his arms, he began to kiss her face, while ripping her clothes and {{touching}} <b>her</b> <b>flesh</b> with his claws, which were, according to her deposition, [...] "cold and clammy as those of a corpse". In panic, the girl screamed, making the attacker quickly flee from the scene. The commotion brought several residents who immediately launched a search for the aggressor, who could not be found.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah related {{that a woman}} once came to Rabbi Akiva {{and told}} him that she had {{observed}} a bloodstain. He asked her whether she perhaps had a wound. She replied that she had a wound, but it had healed. He asked whether it was possible that it could open again and bleed. She answered in the affirmative, and Rabbi Akiva declared her clean. Observing that his disciples looked at each other in astonishment, he told them that the Sages did not lay down the rule for bloodstains to create a strict result but rather to produce a lenient result, for [...] says, [...] "If a woman has an issue, and her issue in <b>her</b> <b>flesh</b> is blood" [...] — only blood, not a bloodstain.|$|E

[...] Despite her husband's attempts to break her from the spell society has on her, Mildred continues to be shallow and indifferent.

2500|$|Martin Luther, who {{initiated}} the Protestant Reformation, said: [...] "Mother Mary, like us, {{was born in}} sin of sinful parents, but the Holy Spirit covered her, sanctified and purified her so that this child was born of flesh and blood, but not with sinful flesh and blood. The Holy Spirit permitted the Virgin Mary to remain a true, natural human being of flesh and blood, just as we. However, he warded off sin from <b>her</b> <b>flesh</b> and blood so that she became {{the mother of a}} pure child, not poisoned by sin as we are. For in that moment when she conceived, she was a holy mother filled with the Holy Spirit and her fruit is a holy pure fruit, at once God and truly man, in one person." [...] Some Lutherans, such as the members of the Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church, support the doctrine.|$|E
2500|$|International {{recognition}} came to Matsunashi {{with her}} 2005 film The Way of the Director which was {{shown at the}} Fantasia Festival in Montreal in July 2005 and at the Camera Japan festival in Rotterdam in June 2006. Matsunashi has said that all her films [...] "are based on my own previous experiences with my ex-boyfriends" [...] and The Way of the Director is centered around two characters Saito and Kitagawa who both aspire to be directors. Saito makes a name for herself in independent films but Kitagawa is persuaded by a friend to become a porn director though he still dreams of going legitimate. Meeting Saito again after ten years, Kitagawa gets the idea of filming a trek to northern Hokkaido in winter with Saito. When things go wrong and Saito dies, Kitagawa eats <b>her</b> <b>flesh</b> to survive but eventually succumbs as well. A friend rescues his film footage and Kitagawa finally becomes a mainstream director.|$|E
2500|$|Newkirk founded PETA in March 1980 {{with fellow}} animal rights activist Alex Pacheco. They came to public {{attention}} in 1981, during {{what became known}} as the Silver Spring monkeys case, when Pacheco photographed 17 macaque monkeys being experimented on inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case led to the first police raid in the United States on an animal research laboratory and to an amendment in 1985 to the Animal Welfare Act. Since then, Newkirk has led campaigns to stop the use of animals in crash tests, convinced companies to stop testing cosmetics on animals, pressed for higher welfare standards from the meat industry, and organized undercover investigations that have led to government sanctions against companies, universities, and entertainers who use animals. She is known, in particular, for the media stunts that she organizes to draw attention to animal-protection issues. In her will, for example, she has asked that her skin be turned into wallets, her feet into umbrella stands, and <b>her</b> <b>flesh</b> into [...] "Newkirk Nuggets", then grilled on a barbecue. [...] "We are complete press sluts", she told The New Yorker in 2003: [...] "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves." ...|$|E
