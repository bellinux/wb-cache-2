5000|$|Library {{holdings}} reached {{1 million}} volumes in 1981. On May 4, 1983, N.C. State {{became a member}} of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL). Site preparation for the new library addition, which involved demolishing the large exterior concrete staircase leading to the library tower, began in August 1985 and ended in February 1986. Navarro Construction of Pittsburgh, PA, was selected as the general contractor in the summer of 1986, and they began construction that October. However, they abandoned the project due to financial troubles, necessitating the employment of new contractors, which delayed completion of the addition by two years. In 1986, the library system's online catalog, the Bibliographic Information System (BIS), became active. In addition to providing information on library holdings, BIS gave users access to <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>holdings</b> at the other TRLN libraries. The card catalogue fell out of use in 1987, and [...] "The NCSU Libraries" [...] became the official name of the library system. In August, Susan Nutter became the first female director of the NCSU Libraries, succeeding I.T. Littleton; she became president of the ARL six years later. In 1989, the 100th anniversary year of the founding of NCSU Libraries, the system assumed administrative control over the University Archives.|$|E
40|$|Since 1975 the ETH Library uses an {{automated}} periodicals control system called PEKOS (PEriodica-KOntroll-System). Version I, {{which could not}} yet handle title updates online, was soon replaced by the enhanced version of PEKOS- 2. A completely revised version, called PEKOS- 3 was developed and implemented {{in the course of}} 1982. Some main functions of PEKOS are: A fast method of identification for incoming copies using a simple mechanism for the abbreviation of titles each single incoming issue is recorded all recorded <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>holdings</b> can be queried and retrieved reminders are issued periodically (a list of all claims issued is printed weekly in three languages) easy checking of incoming invoices statistics in view of future development of a new circulation system for periodicals, variant identification on the form of the issue at hand (e. g. the numbering) can be stored. Three such identifications may be assigned to each issue, and any of these can consist of six hierarchical levels. In addition to numbering, months, years, dates, and a free text string are allowed. In most cases the identification as it appears on the cover of a journal can be entered unaltered. In the previcus version of the system, this possibility of identifying almost any form of an issue 2 ̆ 7 s description, existed in a very simple form only. Our automated circulation system provides for patrons to type in their order directly at one of six printing terminals (the 2 ̆ 7 ETH-Bibliothek 2 ̆ 7 is a closed access library). We plan to integrate this system with PEKOS, and then, as far as journals are concerned, any recorded issue identification may be used to order a specific copy of a journal. Issue identifications in PEKOS are used internally in a normalised format as opposed to strings of free text which may be recorded elsewhere in the system. A code for the type of identification is also stored, which enables the system to predict the number of the next journal to be issued. These predictions may of course be changed manually as needed. PEKOS- 3 has been developed by the library staff in about ten 2 ̆ 7 man 2 ̆ 7 years. It is running on the machines of the main computing center of the ETH in Zurich. We plan to rewrite it for use on our own machine (an IBM 4341) in the course of three years. It will then be an integrated part of the over-all library control system called ETHICS (2 ̆ 7 ETH Library Information Contral System 2 ̆ 7) ...|$|E

The empirical analysis {{is based on the}} Household Finance and Consumption Survey, a new harmonized data set collecting detailed <b>information</b> <b>on</b> wealth <b>holdings,</b> consumption and income at the household level. Since the data is from 2010 - 2011, strong conclusions as regards the present are difficult to draw. This is because the crisis may have affected the data, especially in countries that were severely hit. Nevertheless we find evidence of some degree of homogeneity across countries with respect to saving preferences and the relative importance of different motives for saving. In addition, credit constraints are more heterogeneous across geographic regions and perceived to be binding for specific groups of respondents. Households living in Mediterranean countries report to be more subject to binding liquidity constraints than households living in Continental Europe. Household characteristics and institutional macroeconomic variables are significant and economically important determinants of household saving preferences and credit constraints...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{we examine}} three {{issues related to}} the accrual and the net {{operating}} assets (NOA) anomalies. First, whether mutual funds trade on these anomalies. Second whether they are able to generate profits, net of transaction costs. Third, the reasons why such profits are not completely exploited. Prior studies provide evidence on the first issue by examining the trading behavior of institutional investors {{in the context of the}} accruals anomaly. However, there is little direct evidence on the second and the third issues. The primary reason, that prior studies do not address these issues is because they use data from 13 F filings. These data provide <b>information</b> <b>on</b> institutional <b>holdings</b> but do not provide <b>information</b> <b>on</b> their fund returns and fund flows, which are important for addressing these issues. We obtain data on mutual fund portfolio holdings from the 13 F filings and on mutual fund returns and fund flows from CRSP. We combine these data and provide the following results. First, mutual funds actively follow both the accrual and the NOA anomalies. Second, funds that follow these anomalies aggressively exhibit significant profits, net of actual transaction costs and fund expenses, suggesting that for the accrual and NOA anomalies transaction costs cannot completely explain the magnitude and persistence of these anomalies. Finally, funds that more aggressively follow the anomalies have higher volatility in fund returns and fund flows, suggesting that residual profits are not completely arbitraged away because of inelastic supply of arbitrage capital induced by arbitrage risks (Shleifer and Vishny 1997) ...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine a}} series of surveys of (primarily) {{industrial}} workers taken {{in the late nineteenth}} century to support the proposition that life-cycle saving was common and as a consequence that saving rates of the working class were surprisingly high. The surveys have detailed <b>information</b> <b>on</b> income, wage rates, occupation, unemployment, self-reported “productivity, ” savings, and also some limited <b>information</b> <b>on</b> asset <b>holdings.</b> I supplement the worker surveys with evidence drawn from the public-use samples drawn from the U. S. censuses of the nineteenth century. Saving behavior in this era seems to have been motivated by the fact that industrial workers of the time faced declining incomes, more frequent and longer episodes of unemployment, and voluntary or unavoidable downward occupational mobility as they aged. While full retirement was also common for the very old, accumulated assets were primarily a protection against falling income and enforced idleness at a time when many elderly could not depend upon their grown children to support them. The conclusions challenge the findings of life-cycle skeptics such as Michael Darby, Laurence Kotlikoff, Lawrence Summers, and others. This paper returns to a research topic that has interested me for many years. I hope it can serve as background for a book I am contemplating on the subject. My early collaborators on the history of saving and retirement, Susan B. Carter, Roger L. Ransom, and Samuel H. Williamson, have been a constant source of inspiration and ideas, although none of them should be implicated in the conclusions of this paper.

40|$|Abstract__ Dyakov’s {{dissertation}} bundles three {{empirical studies}} on actively managed mutual funds. His studies provide new {{knowledge of the}} costs and benefits of portfolio disclosure and shed more light into the question whether mutual fund investors have an information advantage over other market participants. Chapter 2 develops a simple trading strategy which front-runs the anticipated forced sales by mutual funds experiencing extreme capital outflows. The findings in this chapter suggest that publicly available <b>information</b> <b>on</b> fund <b>holdings</b> exposes mutual funds in distress to predatory trading. Chapter 3 studies investors’ sophistication and shows that mutual fund investors are probably more sophisticated than previously thought. The evidence in this chapter suggests that investors use portfolio holdings information in order to infer managerial skill and benefit from shifting capital towards skilled fund managers. Thus, while chapter 2 provides evidence for the potential costs of portfolio disclosure, chapter 3 quantifies the benefits from the actual use of portfolio holdings information by mutual fund investors. Chapter 4 uses disclosed fund holdings in order to study the information content of mutual funds' trades. The study documents that prior to 2001, stocks purchased by funds outperform stocks they sell. However, the opposite happens after 2001. The findings in this chapter suggest that mutual fund managers might have lost their information advantage over time. An important, although not sole reason for this effect is reduction in selective access to firm information following the implementation of Regulation Fair Disclosure in 2001...|$|R
40|$|How far can shoe-leather go in {{explaining}} the welfare cost of inflation? Using {{a unique set of}} microeconomic data on households, we estimate the parameters of the demand for money derived from a generalized Baumol-Tobin model. Our data set contains <b>information</b> <b>on</b> average <b>holdings</b> of cash, <b>on</b> deposits and other interest bearing accounts, on the number of trips to the bank, on the size of withdrawals and on the ownership and use of ATM cards. We model the adoption of new transaction technologies and use these estimates to correct for the selectivity bias induced by some households choosing to hold no interest bearing assets and some to use an ATM card. The interest rate and expenditure flow elasticities of the demand for cash are close to the theoretical values implied by standard inventory models. However, we find significant differences between the individuals with an ATM card and those without. The estimates of the demand for cash allow us to calculate a measure of the welfare cost of inflation analogous to Bailey's triangle, but based on a rigorous microeconometric framework. The welfare cost of inflation varies considerably within the population, but never turns out to be very large (about 0. 1 percent of consumption or less). Our results are robust to various changes in the specification. In addition to the main results based on the average stock of cash held, we provide some evidence {{based on the number of}} trips to the bank and on the average withdrawals that confirm our basic findings. demand for money, financial innovation, welfare cost of inflation...|$|R
40|$|One way {{to assess}} the {{effectiveness}} of a nation’s pension system is to measure its success in bringing the incomes of the aged close to those enjoyed by the nonaged. The comparability of income estimates for the aged and nonaged depends, however, on the relative accuracy of the income reports for the two populations. Unfortunately, some income items that are particularly important to the elderly, including occupational pensions, income derived from financial assets, and returns on homeowners’ net equity in their principal residence, are either unreported or significantly underreported in household surveys. In this paper we assess the effects of unmeasured and underreported income flows on the relative incomes of the aged and near-aged. We use survey data from the March Current Population Survey and the Survey of Consumer Finances. The latter survey contains <b>information</b> <b>on</b> wealth <b>holdings</b> as well as income. Using our broadest definition of income, which includes the return on net equity in an owner-occupied home and the predicted annuity flow from a household’s financial assets, the incomes of aged households {{in the middle of the}} old-age income distribution appear to be similar to those of nonaged households in the middle of the nonaged income distribution. In the top and bottom one-quarter of the old-age income distribution, incomes under the broadest income definition are substantially higher than those of nonaged households in the equivalent position of the income distribution. This income pattern diverges sharply from the one that would be inferred under the Census Bureau’s standard money income definition, which shows that aged households have noticeably lower incomes than the nonaged. ...|$|R

40|$|University Libraries manage {{increasingly}} large {{collections of}} full text digital resources. These might be repositories of born digital research outputs, e-reserves collections or online libraries of material digitised to provide open access to significant texts. Whatever {{the content of}} the material, the structured data of full text resources can be exploited to enhance research discovery. The implicit connections and cross-references between books and papers, which occur in all print collections, can be made explicit in a collection of electronic texts. Correctly encoded and exposed they create a framework to support resource discovery and navigation both within and between texts by following links between topics. Using this approach the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC) at Victoria University of Wellington has developed a delivery system for its growing online digital library using the ISO Topic Map technology. Like a simple back-of-book index or a library classification system, a topic map aggregates information to provide binding points from which everything that is known about a given subject can be reached. Topics in the NZETC digital library represent authors and publishers, texts, and images, as well as people and places mentioned or depicted in those texts and images. Importantly, the Topic Map extends beyond the NZETC collection to incorporate relevant external resources which expose structured metadata about their collection. Innovative entity authority records management enables, for example, the topic page for William Colenso to automatically provide access not only to the full text of his works in the NZETC collection but out to another book-length work in the Auckland University’s “Early NZ Books Collection” and to several essays in the National Library’s archive of the Royal Society Journals. It also enables links to externally provided services providing <b>information</b> <b>on</b> Library <b>holdings</b> of print copies of the text.

40|$|The first essay {{examines}} {{the relation between}} fund performance and stock selection process. I classify mutual funds into two groups according to their distinctive stock selection approaches: tire kickers who rely on fund managers' personal judgment and fundamental analysis to pick stocks, and quant jocks who use computer-based models to select stocks. I examine how the stock selection approach affects mutual fund performance and economies of scale. I document an increasing trend of quantitative techniques used by mutual funds, in addition to some unique characteristics of quant jocks. Quant jocks and tire kickers have similar factor-adjusted alphas, but quant jocks have higher Sharpe ratios. Quant jocks tend to be much smaller than tire kickers. I explore possible explanations for the size difference. I find that although quant jocks can cheaply screen a large universe of stocks, the stocks that quant jocks invest in are smaller and less liquid, which results in higher transaction costs and limited scalability of quantitative investment strategies. The second essay investigates mutual fund managers' private information about future stock returns as revealed in their portfolio holdings. Specifically, we develop three different stock alpha estimators to predict stock returns based on portfolio compositions and past performance of mutual funds. We find that investment strategies based on our stock alpha estimators perform well, when using <b>information</b> <b>on</b> recent fund <b>holdings</b> and fund purchases. This evidence suggests that fund managers' stock selection skills are quite persistent, and vary widely in the cross-section. We also compare our strategies with 12 quantitative investment signals based on market anomalies, and find that our strategies are not subsumed by these quantitative signals. Thus, our stock alpha estimators reflect private skills of active fund managers that are unrelated to known anomalies. Finally, we develop a conditional stock alpha estimator using <b>information</b> <b>on</b> stock characteristics and fund characteristics. Investment strategies based on the conditional stock alphas deliver further improved performance...|$|R
