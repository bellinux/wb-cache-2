50|$|A second trailer {{emphasized}} the plot concerning the United States {{losing control of}} its power lines, water supplies and air traffic control. Jon Cassar confirmed on the <b>Fox</b> <b>message</b> board that the 24: Redemption DVD would have a new alternate trailer for the season as an extra feature and that it contains scenes from the first fourteen episodes.|$|E
2500|$|Holiness Friends {{are heavily}} {{influenced}} by the Holiness movement, in particular John Wesley's doctrine of Christian perfection, also called [...] "entire sanctification". This doctrine states that loving God and humanity totally, as exemplified by Christ, enables believers to rid themselves of voluntary sin. This was a predominant view within Quakerism in the United Kingdom and United States in the 19th century, and it influenced other branches of Quakerism. Holiness Friends argue that early Friends, including George <b>Fox's</b> <b>message</b> of perfection, {{is the same as}} holiness.|$|R
2500|$|For example, Saint-Exupéry {{tells of}} a fox meeting the young prince during his travels on Earth. The story's essence is {{contained}} in the fox saying that [...] "One sees clearly only with the heart. The essential is invisible to the eye." [...] Other key morals articulated by the fox are: [...] "You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed," [...] and [...] "It is the time you have lost for your rose that makes your rose so important." [...] The <b>fox's</b> <b>messages</b> are arguably the book's most famous quotations because they deal with human relationships.|$|R
50|$|The <b>FOX</b> <b>messaging</b> system {{simplifies}} the GUI update strategy: during widget update, the widgets can ask from their targets to update them. This {{means that a}} command message does not also have to explicitly update any widgets as it is typical. In case an application implements N command messages each updating M widgets, then M*N updates must be executed and at most M*N messages must be implemented. On the other hand, if widgets request for update, only N command messages and at most M update messages are implemented. This strategy separates the GUI update from data changes, making the GUI a real-time reflection of the underlying data structures.|$|R

50|$|Mary Fisher {{was born}} in north Yorkshire, {{possibly}} at Pontefract, England. As a young woman {{she worked as a}} housemaid for Richard and Elizabeth Tomlinson in their household at Selby, where in late December 1651 she heard the ministry to the Tomlinson family and servants given by George <b>Fox.</b> His <b>message</b> and fellowship resonated profoundly with her and as a result she became an active Quaker.|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s and later, these {{categories}} were challenged by a mostly self-educated Friend, Lewis Benson, a New Jersey printer by training, a theologian by vocation. Immersing {{himself in the}} corpus of early Quaker writings, he made himself an authority on George <b>Fox</b> and his <b>message.</b> In 1966, Benson published Catholic Quakerism, a small book that sought to move the Society of Friends to what he insisted was a strongly pro-Fox position of authentic Christianity, entirely separate from theological liberalism, churchly denominationalism, or rural isolation. He created the New Foundation Fellowship, which blazed forth {{for a decade or}} so but had about disappeared as an effective group {{by the end of the}} century.|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic {{vaccination}} using T-cell receptor (TCR) peptides from V genes commonly {{expressed by}} potentially pathogenic T cells remains an approach {{of interest for}} treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other autoimmune diseases. We developed a trivalent TCR vaccine containing complementarity determining region (CDR) 2 peptides from BV 5 S 2, BV 6 S 5 and BV 13 S 1 emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant that reliably induced high frequencies of TCR-specific T cells. To evaluate induction of regulatory T-cell subtypes, immunological and clinical parameters were followed in 23 treatment-naïve subjects with relapsing-remitting or progressive MS who received 12 monthly injections of the trivalent peptide vaccine over 1 year in an open-label study design. Prior to vaccination, subjects had reduced expression of forkhead box (<b>Fox)</b> P 3 <b>message</b> and protein, and reduced recognition of the expressed TCR repertoire by TCR-reactive cells compared with healthy control donors. After three or four injections, most vaccinated MS subjects developed high frequencies of circulating interleukin (IL) - 10 -secreting T cells specific for the injected TCR peptides and significantly enhanced expression of FoxP 3 by regulatory T cells present in both ‘native’ CD 4 + CD 25 + and ‘inducible’ CD 4 + CD 25 − {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC). At the end of the trial, PBMC from vaccinated MS subjects retained or further increased FoxP 3 expression levels, exhibited significantly enhanced recognition of the TCR V gene repertoire apparently generated by perturbation of the TCR network, and significantly suppressed neuroantigen but not recall antigen responses. These findings demonstrate that therapeutic vaccination using only three commonly expressed BV gene determinants can induce an expanded immunoregulatory network in vivo that may optimally control complex autoreactive responses that characterize the inflammatory phase of MS...|$|R
