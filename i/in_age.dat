30|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the first hypothesis. For this purpose, we analyze how {{regional}} differences <b>in</b> <b>aging</b> have changed over the period 2003 – 2012. In addition, we examine whether current trends in regional variation <b>in</b> <b>aging</b> will continue. For this reason, we examine Eurostat regional population projections for the upcoming three decades. In order to examine to what extent policy measures could be effective in promoting convergence <b>in</b> population <b>aging,</b> we assess the causes {{of changes in the}} working-age population: migration, mortality, and cohort turnover. Cohort turnover is defined by the difference between the numbers of young people entering and older people leaving the working ages. To the extent that cohort turnover affects convergence <b>in</b> <b>aging,</b> there is little room for policy options as the impact of cohort turnover can only be affected in the long run. To the extent that mortality affects convergence <b>in</b> <b>aging,</b> one main question is whether convergence in mortality would lead to convergence <b>in</b> <b>aging.</b> To the extent that migration affects convergence <b>in</b> <b>aging,</b> policy makers may aim to affect the direction of migration flows between regions and countries.|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{combination}} {{of depression and}} anorexia may influence morbidity and progressive physical disability in the elderly. Gender differences exist in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activation following stress exposure. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate gender differences in feeding behavior under novelty stress <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> mice. Food intake measurement, immunohistochemical assessment, and mRNA expression analysis were conducted to investigate the role of serotonin 2 C receptor (5 -HT 2 CR) and its relationship with ghrelin in stress-induced suppression of feeding behavior <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> mice. After exposure to novelty stress, a 21 -fold increase in plasma corticosterone and remarkable suppression of food intake were observed <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> male mice. Furthermore, a 5 -HT 2 CR agonist suppressed food intake <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> male mice. Novelty stress induced a 7 -fold increase in 5 -HT 2 CR and c-Fos co-expressing cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> male mice but caused no change <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> female mice. Plasma acylated ghrelin levels decreased <b>in</b> stressed <b>aged</b> male mice and administration of the 5 -HT 2 CR antagonist inhibited this decrease. The 5 -HT 2 CR antagonist also reversed the suppression of food intake in estrogen receptor α agonist-treated aged male mice. Therefore, conspicuously suppressed feeding behavior <b>in</b> novelty stress-exposed <b>aged</b> male mice may be mediated by 5 -HT 2 CR hypersensitivity, leading to hypoghrelinemia. The hypersensitivity may partly be due to estrogen receptor activation <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> male mice...|$|R

40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} {{function is}} impaired with age, increasing {{the risk of}} cardiovascular disease. One therapeutic modality for improving arterial function <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> arteries is aerobic exercise; however, the signals associated with exercise that lead to improved arterial function are not fully understood. The {{aim of the research}} in this dissertation is to determine the importance of hemodynamic changes associated with aerobic exercise (increased intraluminal pressure and shear stress) which may serve as mechanical signals to promote healthy vascular endothelial and smooth muscle function <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> arteries. We hypothesized that a short-duration increase in intraluminal pressure would: 1) improve nitric oxide (NO) -mediated endothelium-dependent dilation <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> soleus muscle feed arteries (SFA); 2) improve vasoconstrictor responses <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> SFA via the Rho pathway; 3) improve vascular smooth muscle contractility <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> denuded (endothelium removed) SFA through the Rho pathway; and, 4) in combination with increased shear stress, induce greater improvements of endothelium-dependent dilation than a short-duration increase in pressure alone. SFA from young (4 mo) and old (24 mo) Fischer 344 rats were isolated and cannulated. Intact SFA or denuded (endothelium removed) SFA were exposed to increased intraluminal pressure for 1 h before assessment of vasodilator or vasoconstrictor function. The results from these experiments demonstrated that exposure to a short-duration increase in pressure, within a range believed to be present in SFA during exercise 1) improved NO-mediated, endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> SFA; 2) improved vasoconstrictor responses <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> intact SFA via the Rho pathway; 3) impaired vasoconstrictor responses <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> denuded SFA; and, 4) did not interact with increased shear stress to produce greater improvements in endothelium-dependent dilation than pressure alone. Collectively, these data indicate that a short-duration increase in intraluminal pressure improves age-impaired arterial function and suggests that increased intraluminal pressure is one mechanical signal associated with aerobic exercise which promotes healthy endothelial and smooth muscle function <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> arteries...|$|R

An increase in glutamate and {{a decrease in}} GABA concentration were observed <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> brain. However, the mechanism of these changes has not been very well elucidated. Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to GABA. Since the vitamin B 6 is essential for the activities of GAD, this study was undertaken to investigate the effects of vitamin B 6 administration on <b>age</b> related changes <b>in</b> rat brain.

40|$|The age-related loss of {{anti-oxidant}} defense reduces {{recovery from}} myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/R) <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> people. Our previous {{data showed that}} inactivation of thioredoxin (Trx) was involved <b>in</b> enhanced <b>aging</b> MI/R injury. Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), the enzyme known to regulate Trx, is less efficient with age. The aim of the current study was to determine why TrxR activity was reduced and whether reduced TrxR activity contributed to enhanced aging MI/R injury. Both Trx and TrxR activity were decreased <b>in</b> the <b>aging</b> heart, and this difference was further amplified after MI/R. However, MI/R injury did not change TrxR expression between young and aging rats. Increased nitrogen oxide (NOx) but decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability (decreased phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) was observed <b>in</b> <b>aging</b> hearts. Peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻) was increased <b>in</b> <b>aging</b> hearts and was further amplified after MI/R. TrxR nitration <b>in</b> young and <b>aging</b> hearts was detected by immunoprecipitation (anti-nitrotyrosine) followed by immunoblotting (anti-TrxR). Compared with young hearts, TrxR nitration was increased <b>in</b> the <b>aging</b> hearts, and this was further intensified after MI/R. The ONOO⁻ decomposition catalyst (FeTMPyp) reduced TrxR nitration and increased TrxR and Trx activity. More importantly, FeTMPyp attenuated the MI/R injury <b>in</b> <b>aging</b> hearts as evidenced by decreased caspase- 3 and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and increased cardiac function. Increased ONOO⁻ nitrated TrxR <b>in</b> the <b>aging</b> heart as a post-translational modification, which {{may be related to the}} enhanced MI/R injury of aging rats.

Apoptosis was higher <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> hamsters <b>in</b> stages I–IV, V–VI and VII–VIII. Aging increased apoptosis of spermatogonia in stages I–IV and V–VI. Apoptotic pachytene spermatocytes were significantly higher in stages I–IV, V–VI, and VII–VIII <b>in</b> <b>aging.</b> Apoptotic preleptotene and pachytene spermatocytes were higher <b>in</b> <b>aging,</b> but no differences were observed in leptotene-zygotene.

Therefore, the effect of dietary omega- 3 fatty acid supplementation on drinking responses <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> rats was examined. Omega- 3 fatty acids reversed thirst deficits <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> rats following dehydration and hypertonic stimuli; angiotensin (ANG) II induced drinking was unaffected <b>in</b> <b>aged</b> rats. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) were altered with age, but not affected by diet.

The aged low omega- 3 fatty acid fed animals had significantly elevated hypothalamic PGE 2 compared with all other groups.
