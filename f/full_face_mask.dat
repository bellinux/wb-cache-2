25|$|The pneumofathometer line on {{a surface}} {{supplied}} umbilical {{is a valuable}} backup supply in case of damage to the main supply hose, or if a diver needs to supply air to another diver on surface supply, as the usual configurations of helmet and <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> do not allow buddy breathing of the conventional kind. The Pneumo line can be tucked into the neck dam or under the skirt of a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask,</b> and provided the helmet or mask is not leaking heavily, will supply adequate air for an assisted ascent.|$|E
25|$|A {{tethered}} diver, who is {{deployed to}} work independently, should preferably {{be equipped with}} <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask,</b> voice communications {{to the surface and}} redundant air supply. This is often obligatory for professional divers.|$|E

25|$|A <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> {{is lighter}} and more {{comfortable}} for swimming than a helmet or band mask, and usually provides an improved field of vision, {{but it is not}} as secure, and does not provide the same level of protection as the heavier and more sturdily constructed equipment. The two types of equipment have different ranges of application. Most full face masks are adaptable for use with scuba or surface supply. The <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> does not usually have a bailout block fitted, and this is usually attached to the diver's harness, with a single hose to supply the mask from main or bailout gas which is selected at the block. The strap arrangement for full face masks is usually quite secure, but not as secure as a bandmask or helmet, and it is possible for it to be dislodged in the water. However it is also quite practicable for a trained diver to replace and clear a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> under water without assistance, so this is more an inconvenience than a disaster unless the diver is rendered unconscious at the same time.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{categories}} of diving mask: The half mask covers the eyes and nose, and the <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> covers eyes, nose and mouth, and therefore includes {{a part of the}} breathing apparatus. The half mask is described here.|$|E
25|$|This is {{stretching}} {{the concept of}} accessory a bit, {{as it would be}} equally valid to call the regulator an accessory of the <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or helmet, but the two items are closely connected and generally found in use together.|$|E

25|$|Most {{professional}} diving {{equipment such as}} <b>full</b> <b>face</b> diving <b>masks</b> {{and diving}} helmets include voice communication equipment, but recreational divers generally rely on hand signals and occasionally on light signals, touch signals and text written on a slate Through-water voice communications is available for recreational diving, but is restricted to <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> and is not in general use.|$|R
25|$|Lightweight demand diving helmets {{are almost}} always surface supplied, but <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> are used equally {{appropriately}} with scuba open circuit, scuba closed circuit (rebreathers), and surface supplied open circuit.|$|R
25|$|The {{demand valve}} is usually firmly {{attached}} to the helmet or mask, {{but there are a}} few models of <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> that have removable demand valves with quick connections allowing them to be exchanged under water. These include the Dr√§ger Panorama and Kirby-Morgan 48 Supermask.|$|E
25|$|A medium (intermediate) {{pressure}} hose {{is used to}} carry breathing gas (typically at between 8 and 10 bar above ambient) from the first stage regulator to the second stage, or demand valve, which is held in the mouth by the diver, or attached to the <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or diving helmet.|$|E
25|$|In all cases, if {{employer}} select respirator with tight-fitting facepiece (<b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask,</b> elastomeric half-mask or quarter-mask, or {{filtering facepiece}} respirator), all employee must be fit tested (to prevent leakage unfiltered polluted air through gaps between {{their faces and}} the tight-fitting masks, which may not match to their faces). Appendix A provides {{a detailed description of}} this testing.|$|E
50|$|Emergency {{provision}} {{of an alternative}} breathing gas source is required {{in case of a}} failure of the primary gas supply. This is managed in several ways by <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>masks.</b>|$|R

25|$|The scuba mask (half-mask) is {{equalised}} during descent by periodically exhaling {{through the}} nose. During ascent it will automatically equalise by leaking excess air round the edges. A helmet or <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> will automatically equalise as any pressure differential will either vent through the exhaust valve or open the demand valve and release {{air into the}} low-pressure space.|$|E
25|$|In a few {{models of}} <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> a {{mouthpiece}} like those used on diving regulators is fitted, {{which has the}} same function as an oro-nasal mask, but can further reduce {{the volume of the}} external dead space, at the cost of forcing mouth-breathing. A smaller volume around the mouth increases distortion of speech. This can make communication more difficult.|$|E

50|$|This {{system does}} not allow for supply of bailout gas to another diver. This system is used for most <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>masks,</b> as they have no other option. Surface {{supplied}} divers use the pneumofathometer hose to supply gas to another diver.|$|R
25|$|Despite the {{improvement}} in diver safety provided by the more secure attachment of the breathing apparatus to the diver's face, some models of <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> can fail catastrophically if the faceplate is broken or detached from the skirt, as there is then no way to breathe from the mask. This can be mitigated by carrying a standard secondary second stage, and preferably also a spare half mask.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting in the helmet. This {{can be a}} real {{emergency}} and life-threatening if not handled effectively, as the diver can aspirate the vomit and asphyxiate. Once again, the action is to open the free flow valve, preferably before vomiting, and to inhale as carefully as possible. If there is no free flow valve, as on a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask,</b> the purge button should clear the demand valve and oro-nasal mask, and the mask can be rinsed by lifting the bottom edge away from the face to let in some water, before purging again.|$|E
25|$|Most {{recreational}} {{scuba diving}} is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece {{to supply the}} breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers {{are more likely to}} use full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.|$|E
50|$|Besides these {{equipment}} differences, inline {{hockey is}} generally a less physical sport. Most leagues punish fighting harshly, and body checking {{is usually a}} penalty. Leagues generally require players to wear <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>masks,</b> but otherwise, players tend to wear lighter clothes and less protective padding.|$|R
50|$|<b>Full</b> <b>face</b> <b>masks</b> can be {{more secure}} than {{breathing}} from an independent mouthpiece; if the diver becomes unconscious or suffers an oxygen toxicity convulsion, the diver can continue to breathe from the mask unlike a mouthpiece which must be always gripped between the teeth.|$|R

25|$|Face mask ‚Äî In {{resuscitation}} and {{for minor}} procedures under anaesthesia, a face mask is often sufficient {{to achieve a}} seal against air leakage. Airway patency of the unconscious patient is maintained either by manipulation of the jaw or {{by the use of}} nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airway. These are designed to provide a passage of air to the pharynx through the nose or mouth, respectively. Poorly fitted masks often cause nasal bridge ulcers, a problem for some patients. Face masks are also used for non-invasive ventilation in conscious patients. A <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> does not, however, provide protection against aspiration.|$|E
25|$|A diving mask (also half mask, {{dive mask}} or scuba mask) is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} that allows underwater divers, including, scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers to see clearly underwater. Surface supplied divers usually use a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask</b> or diving helmet, but in some systems the half mask may be used. When the human eye is {{in direct contact with}} water as opposed to air, its normal environment, light entering the eye is refracted by a different angle and the eye is unable to focus the light. By providing an air space in front of the eyes, light enters normally and the eye is able to focus correctly.|$|E
25|$|Six IWR {{treatment}} tables {{have been}} published in the scientific literature. Each of these methods have several commonalities including the use of a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> <b>mask,</b> a tender to supervise the diver during treatment, a weighted recompression line and a means of communication. The history of the three older methods for providing oxygen at 9msw (30fsw) was described in great detail by Drs. Pyle and Youngblood. The fourth method for providing oxygen at 7.5msw (25fsw) was described by Richard Pyle at the 48th Annual UHMS Workshop on In-water Recompression in 1999. The Clipperton method involves recompression to 9msw (30fsw) while the Clipperton(a) rebreather method involves a recompression to 30msw (98fsw).|$|E
