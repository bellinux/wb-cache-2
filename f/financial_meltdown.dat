Theoretical and empirical studies on climatic and ecological dynamical systems have shown that approach to tipping points is preceded by a generic phenomenon called critical slowing down, i. e. an increasingly slow response of the system to perturbations. Therefore, {{it has been suggested}} that critical slowing down may be used as an early warning signal of imminent critical transitions. Whether financial markets exhibit critical slowing down prior to meltdowns remains unclear. Here, our analysis reveals that three major US (Dow Jones Index, S&P 500 and NASDAQ) and two European markets (DAX and FTSE) did not exhibit critical slowing down prior to major financial crashes over the last century. However, all markets showed strong trends of rising variability, quantified by time series variance and spectral function at low frequencies, prior to crashes. These results suggest that financial crashes are not critical transitions that occur in the vicinity of a tipping point. Using a simple model, we argue that financial crashes are likely to be stochastic transitions which can occur even when the system is far away from the tipping point. Specifically, we show that a gradually increasing strength of stochastic perturbations may have caused to abrupt transitions in the financial markets. Broadly, our results highlight the importance of stochastically driven abrupt transitions in real world scenarios. Our study offers rising variability as a precursor of <b>financial</b> <b>meltdowns</b> albeit with a limitation that they may signal false alarms.

The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union. Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, European Council could then ask the European Commission Bank to step into the breach and indemnify the European Commission Bank in advance against potential risks to the Treasury’s solvency. Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate “a radical change of heart.” In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it.

30|$|As is by {{well-known}} after {{a quarter}} of a century of neoliberal market hegemony allied with neoclassicism, “endogenous growth theory” holds that economic growth is primarily the result of endogenous and not external forces. Quite how globalisation, let alone financial contagion got off scot-free in that assumption is, of course, mystifying. Endogenous growth theory held that investment in human capital, innovation, and knowledge are significant contributors to economic growth. Otherwise known as “new growth theory” this justified such often publicly-funded spatial inequities as “technology clusters”. Furthermore the contemporary reification of science and technology innovation (STI) as the wellspring of economic novelty treated much more common but less elitist (Doing, Using and Interacting; DUI) “knowledge” as less pioneering, inferior and less growth-inducing. As has become clear, this “world-view” is widely presented as an apology for agglomeration, increasung returns to scale and massive social polarisation by austerity governance.
