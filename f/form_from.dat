5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to <b>form</b> <b>from</b> minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in the early Universe, which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E
5|$|A {{selected}} white-flowered <b>form</b> <b>from</b> the Errinundra Plateau, {{which was}} originally known as 'Plateau View Alba' or 'Plateau View White', was registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1990 as 'Errindundra White'. Plantsmen have also developed several hybrids with T.speciosissima, looking {{to combine the}} hardiness of T. oreades with the showier flowerheads of the latter. Red-, pink- and even white-flowered cultivars are available.|$|E
5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often <b>form</b> <b>from</b> smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E

5|$|Dhumavati's outer inauspicious, fearful form {{reveals the}} dangers of {{considering}} sensory pleasures as fulfilment-giving. The winnowing basket, used to separate the husk from the grain, symbolizes the need to separate the outer illusory <b>form</b> <b>from</b> the inner reality.

5|$|In 2002, Ruth Rosiene, a {{descendant}} of the Perkins and Ashlawn's owner, was featured in an article by The Day. Rosiene had been maintaining the house for years, which required repainting every four or five years. A photo in the article shows the latch on the door that was described as possibly original. The article notes that the original sliding shutters are now absent, whereas the original nomination <b>form</b> <b>from</b> 1979 stated they were not installed.|$|E

5|$|It is certain, however, {{that during}} the Second World War pigeon {{photography}} was introduced into German nurseries in toy <b>form.</b> <b>From</b> around 1935 the toy figures produced under the brand Elastolin, some of which show motifs from before 1918 with updated uniforms, began to include a signal corps soldier with a pigeon transport dog.

5|$|Models for a {{continuous}} formation throughout {{the age of}} the Solar System illustrate that at weak resonances within the Kuiper belt (such as 5:7 or 8:1), or at the boundaries of stronger resonances, objects can develop weak orbital instabilities over millions of years. The 4:7 resonance in particular has large instability. KBOs can also be shifted into unstable orbits by close passage of massive objects, or through collisions. Over time, the scattered disc would gradually <b>form</b> <b>from</b> these isolated events.|$|E
5|$|Moravian {{palaeontologist}} Ferdinand Stoliczka {{separated the}} Himalayan {{population as a}} third subspecies, P.g.forsythi, but {{this has not been}} widely accepted and is usually treated as synonymous with digitatus.

50|$|The andesites and dacites {{may have}} <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> basaltic magma by {{fractional}} crystallization involving amphibole, based on elemental composition data. Further, crustal materials were included into the magma. Tholeiitic and calc-alkaline magmas have different elemental compositions and probably <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> separate sources; tholeiitic magmas may have <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> partial melting of the mantle, while the calc-alkaline magmas <b>formed</b> <b>from</b> crustal assimilation in these magmas. Overall, the magma {{originated in the}} asthenospheric mantle; lithospheric components may have contributed, however.|$|R
5|$|Some species {{differ in}} <b>form</b> <b>from</b> the typical octopus body shape. Members of the {{suborder}} Cirrina have stout gelatinous bodies with webbing that reaches near {{the tip of}} their arms, and two large fins above the eyes, supported by an internal shell.

5|$|Such {{landslides}} {{are common}} at volcanoes, {{where they are}} favoured by the steep edifices that <b>form</b> <b>from</b> lava flows being stacked {{on top of each}} other. It is not usually known what triggers the collapse, although eruption-associated earthquakes are suspected to play a role. Other volcanoes in the region with sector collapses are: Lastarria, Ollague, San Pedro, Socompa, and Tata Sabaya. The Mellado and Cerro Rosado volcanoes close to Llullaillaco also display evidence of sector collapses.|$|E

5|$|The caps <b>form</b> <b>from</b> {{the top of}} {{the short}} stipe by the growth and {{expansion}} of a blunt margin and later as a thickening of the upper surface.

5|$|The {{structure}} that stands {{on what is}} known locally as the Canal Bank, called Cromwell's Castle, primarily derives its current <b>form</b> <b>from</b> the Napoleonic Wars.

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form as {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation.

Cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E
