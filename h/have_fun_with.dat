25|$|England started {{cautiously}} in {{the only}} Twenty20 International against Australia at the Rose Bowl, only hitting six runs off the first two overs as they saw off the bowlers, but Geraint Jones then decided to <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> Brett Lee. Hitting two boundaries off the next over, Lee was hit for 14, and England moved rapidly to 28 for no loss before Jones cut McGrath to deep third man, where Kasprowicz took a catch on the boundary – out for 19 with four fours. Marcus Trescothick hit a single to end the over, but England were happy enough with 29 for 1 after four overs. Lee's next over was, again, hit for 14, as Lee served up one wide and a no-ball to end with three overs for 31 as singles were taken off every ball. That prompted a bowling change, with Michael Kasprowicz coming on for Australia, and with good reward, as the penultimate ball of his over was caught by Symonds at midwicket – Andrew Flintoff out for 6. Kevin Pietersen managed to scamper a single, and after six overs, England were 50 for 2.|$|E

I {{felt the need to}} be a little playful, because there were autobiographical parts of the last novel that were difficult for me." [...] In his last novel, Until I Find You (2005) Irving had alluded to his sexual initiation when he was 11, by a woman in her 20s.|$|E

500|$|Robert Canning of IGN wrote [...] "It wasn't {{the funniest}} of foreign land adventures, {{but it was}} serviceable. [...] The saving grace of the episode was all the Irish-centric vignettes with Marge and the kids. These quick hitting gags were the funniest moments and kept the episode from being {{completely}} blah." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V.

500|$|Moore {{described}} {{the music on}} Office of Strategic Influence as [...] "a new approach to progressive rock", stating that he could use his musical roots in progressive music but [...] "was {{far enough away from}} it to play with it." [...] He said that [...] "progressive rock has been around for so long and [...] we have to stop taking it so seriously and really <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Portnoy {{described the}} album as [...] "more soundscapish" [...] than his work in Dream Theater, focusing more on composition and sounds than musicianship. He noted the style [...] "would never work in Dream Theater." ...|$|E

Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, and I go, 'Can you just do one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E
500|$|Jacqui's {{relationship}} with Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) was often strained by her desire for children. Her sister Tina McQueen (Leah Hackett) agrees to be a surrogate mother for her child. The storyline was included to help house many lies and secrets {{that had previously}} been built up prior, including Tony's affair with Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) and Tina's affair with Russ Owen (Stuart Manning), of which Kirkwood stated there was [...] "there's so much ammunition in store", which would eventually devastate Jacqui. Kirkwood also devised the plot to show of Coopers skills in playing tragedy, of this he commented: [...] "It'll also give Claire Cooper and Nick Pickard another opportunity to show off their acting talents. Tony and Jacqui are one of those couples that we can <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> - but also will blow the audience away when dealing with tragedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Jesse Schedeen gave Arrows episode an 8.7 out of 10, {{noting that}} the Flash episode was [...] "saddled with the setup" [...] while [...] "Arrow gets to <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> the payoff." [...] He felt the pace and storyline issues in [...] "Legends of Tomorrrow," [...] the Flash episode, were {{resolved}} satisfactorily. [...] The inclusion of flashbacks and time travel gave it [...] "a larger scope and an added sense of drama". As well, the Ollie subplot allowed Stephen Amell [...] "to show a much different and more vulnerable side to his character". Alisdair Wilkins awarded the episode a B+ noting [...] "how much better the show's entire dynamic is this season compared with last year".

Renée Peck of The Times-Picayune {{reported that she}} enjoyed watching Douglas <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> an [...] "off-the-wall" [...] role combining an alternate lifestyle with altered consciousness. TV Guide contributor Matt Roush, in review of season four, said that without guest appearances from actors such as Douglas, the season [...] "would be an awfully sad misfire." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that the [...] "biggest laughs" [...] in the episode come when Douglas holds hands with Will and then dances with him.

500|$|Conversely, John Levesque {{called the}} show a [...] "keeper" [...] {{in his review}} for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and applauded the series subtle, improvised style. Chicago Sun-Times {{journalist}} Phil Rosenthal commended the episode. In his review, he wrote, [...] "Rather than big laughs, it's more likely to elicit the grin of bemused recognition. It's not about sight gags or clever puns. It's not about parodying the sitcom form. This sweet ass seriesis not always subtle - unless a child showing another how to <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> a runny nose is intellectual - but it nicely plays off the inherent absurdities and weirdness of everyday modern life." [...] Dennis Landmann of DVD Freak wrote that the episode [...] "sets up the tone quite well, for it develops the aspirations of Brendon becoming a filmmaker," [...] and praised the confrontational scenes that occur between McGuirk and Brendon.|$|E

[...] When asked if he made R music, Ocean replied that he disliked how that in the United States, [...] "if you're a singer and you're black, you're an R artist. Period." [...] Ocean stated that the songs on the mixtape do contain R influences, but that it is not an R album entirely.|$|E

500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first {{recorded}} by American pop singer Katy Perry, recording the track as a demo for her debut album One of the Boys, though it was never fully executed for the album and was passed to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals, soon after a leaked version of Katy Perry on the Internet. Perry discussed her role with Bliss magazine: [...] "My vocals are actually on Breakout. I thought, 'Yes, I'm singing on a Miley single'." [...] Cyrus said naming the album Breakout {{was influenced by the}} song as it was [...] "one of [...] favorite songs" [...] on the album; this was because the song is feminine but has appeals to different age groups: [...] "Moms, dads, sisters, brothers can, you know, relate to it. And it's basically because you just {{want to go out and}} <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> your friends and sometimes, you know, go out dancing and let loose once in a while." ...|$|E
500|$|Cornell {{stated that}} the biggest two {{influences}} on [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die. [...] "I decided that I was going to sing it like Tom Jones, in that crooning style. I wanted people to hear my voice," [...] Cornell said. [...] "And 'Live and Let Die' is a fantastic song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I [...] {{wanted to write a}} song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again — a big orchestra — so I wanted to <b>have</b> <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth". And he jokingly stated [...] "Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun".|$|E
500|$|Piliero had {{the concept}} nearly {{finished}} {{by the time}} he met with Spears.

That was my goal from day one: I wanted her to be funny, badass and super cool.". During {{the first day of the}} shoot, he requested Spears to [...] "have as much fun as possible over these next two days". Pilliero also stated that the Crossroads (2002) reference [...] "s a fun Easter egg for fans. Plus, [...] is the most ridiculously awesome way to title a sequel. It just felt like the right thing to do. When Britney saw it, she loved it." ...|$|E
