40|$|Keyword : Classroom Action Research (CAR), <b>Jumbled</b> Sentences Technique, Descriptive Text, MTS Negeri Mendoyo This {{research}} {{was intended to}} improve the ability in writing descriptive texts through <b>jumbled</b> sentence technique for grade VII students at MTS Negeri Mendoyo. This study was qualitative. It consisted of two cycles. The researcher worked collaboratively with the English teacher in implementing the actions. The data of this research were mostly qualitative although there were some quantitative data. The qualitative data were obtained by observing {{the teaching and learning}} process during the implementation of the actions, and the English teacher as the collaborator, while the quantitative data were gained through assessing studentsÂ’ ability in writing descriptive texts via anInitial reflection (pre-test) and reflection(post-test). The data were in the form of field notes and test scores. The results of this study showed that the implementation of <b>jumbled</b> sentence in writing descriptive text effective to improve studentsÂ’ ability in writing descriptive texts. <b>Jumbled</b> sentence technique helped the students to organize sentence were <b>jumbled</b> into good paragraphs. They could manage the time for writing more effectively and perform the writing task more maximally. The students also perceived that <b>jumbled</b> sentence technique helps them to improve their writing ability. This implies that the implementation of <b>jumbled</b> sentence technique in the writing instructions gives positive effects in improving studentsÂ’ performance and achievement in writing descriptive text. The result of the study, <b>jumbled</b> sentence could improve the studentsÂ’ ability in writing descriptive texts in terms of encouraging the students to start with writing. <b>Jumbled</b> sentence facilitates the students to activate their prior knowledge before they practice their writings. By using the technique, the students could feel at ease in performing the writing task...|$|R
50|$|Originally, <b>jumbles</b> were {{twisted into}} various pretzel-like shapes, and boiled.

5|$|The Fasci Siciliani , {{short for}} Fasci Siciliani dei Lavoratori (Sicilian Workers Leagues), were a popular {{movement}} of democratic and socialist inspiration, which arose in Sicily {{in the years}} between 1889 and 1894. The Fasci gained {{the support of the}} poorest and most exploited classes of the island by channeling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on the establishment of new rights. Consisting of a <b>jumble</b> of traditionalist sentiment, religiosity, and socialist consciousness, the movement reached its apex in the summer of 1893, when new conditions were presented to the landowners and mine owners of Sicily concerning the renewal of sharecropping and rental contracts.|$|E
5|$|Antananarivo {{encompasses}} three ridges that intersect {{at their}} highest point. The Manjakamiadana royal palace {{is located at}} the summit of these hills and is visible from every part {{of the city and the}} surrounding hills. The Manjakamiadina was the largest structures within the rova of Antananarivo; its stone casing is the only remnant of the royal residences that survived a 1995 fire at the site. For 25 years, the roofless shell dominated the skyline; its west wall collapsed in 2004. In 2009, the stone casing had been fully restored and the building was re-roofed. It is illuminated at night. Conservation and reconstruction work at the site is ongoing. The city skyline is a <b>jumble</b> of colorful, historic houses and churches. More recent residential and commercial buildings and family rice fields occupy lower terrain throughout the capital. The Betsimitatatra and other rice fields surround the city.|$|E
5|$|On 20 February, Kroonland, {{continuing}} to sail for the American Line, returned to New York – Liverpool service after {{an absence of}} 18 months. As a ship of the still-neutral United States sailing in a war zone, Kroonland had her name painted in large letters {{on each side of}} her hull. The name was flanked on either side by large American flags and kept illuminated at night. In June, she carried US$1,500,000 of Argentine gold from London for deposit with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. On late 1916, a cook aboard Kroonland was arrested for smuggling feathers, wings, and heads of birds of paradise and crowned pigeons. The man, who was paid $300 for each load of feathers, smuggled in at least three loads of the avian contraband before his arrest. In January 1917, a <b>jumble</b> sale held in the saloon on Kroonland raised £73 15s 11d for The Times Fund, {{for the benefit of the}} British Red Cross and the Order of St. John.|$|E

5|$|With {{the recent}} {{volcanic}} activity starting in 2004, the glacier lobes were pushed aside and upward by {{the growth of}} new volcanic domes. The surface of the glacier, once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic <b>jumble</b> of icefalls heavily criss-crossed with crevasses and seracs caused by movement of the crater floor. The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the glacier have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of the glacier joined together in late May 2008 and thus the glacier completely surrounds the lava domes. In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers {{to the north of}} the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier. Crater Glacier is the only known advancing glacier in the contiguous United States.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of current state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms at image classification falls significantly short {{as compared to}} human abilities. To reduce this gap, {{it is important for}} the community to know what problems to solve, and not just how to solve them. Towards this goal, via the use of <b>jumbled</b> images, we strip apart two widely investigated aspects: local and global information in images, and identify the performance bottleneck. Interestingly, humans have been shown to reliably recognize <b>jumbled</b> images. The goal of our paper is to determine a functional model that mimics how humans recognize <b>jumbled</b> images i. e. exploit local information alone, and further evaluate if existing implementations of this computational model suffice to match human performance. Surprisingly, in our series of human studies and machine experiments, we find that a simple bag-of-words based majorityvote-like strategy is an accurate functional model of how humans recognize <b>jumbled</b> images. Moreover, a straightforward machine implementation of this model achieves accuracies similar to human subjects at classifying <b>jumbled</b> images. This indicates that perhaps existing machine vision techniques already leverage local information from images effectively, and future research efforts should be focused on more advanced modeling of global information. 1...|$|R

25|$|Interleaving is used {{to convert}} {{convolutional}} codes from random error correctors to burst error correctors. The basic idea behind the use of interleaved codes is to <b>jumble</b> symbols at the receiver. This leads to randomization of bursts of received errors which are closely located and we can then apply the analysis for random channel. Thus, the main function performed by the interleaver at transmitter is to alter the input symbol sequence. At the receiver, the deinterleaver will alter the received sequence to get back the original unaltered sequence at the transmitter.|$|E
