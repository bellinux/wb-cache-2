5|$|As of 2007, {{the total}} {{installed}} capacity of solar <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> systems was approximately 154 thermal gigawatt (GWth). China {{is the world}} leader in their deployment with 70GWth installed as of 2006 and a long-term goal of 210GWth by 2020. Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders {{in the use of}} solar <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> systems with over 90% of homes using them. In the United States, Canada, and Australia, heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> with an installed capacity of 18GWth as of 2005.|$|E
5|$|Solar <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> systems use {{sunlight}} to heat water. In low geographical latitudes (below 40degrees) from 60 to 70% {{of the domestic}} <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> use with temperatures up to 60°C can be provided by solar heating systems. The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors (44%) and glazed flat plate collectors (34%) generally used for domestic hot water; and unglazed plastic collectors (21%) used mainly to heat swimming pools.|$|E
5|$|Catering for {{visitors}} at Belle Vue {{was on an}} industrial scale, ranging from the late 19th century <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> rooms, which accommodated up to 3,000 diners each, providing crockery and <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> for those who brought their own picnics, to more upmarket themed restaurants. Belle Vue {{became a part of}} the caterer and hotelier Charles Forte's business empire towards the end of its life in the 1960s. Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to its closure in 1987.|$|E
40|$|In this study, 10 healthy {{students}} {{were subjected to}} experiments. They bathed in plain <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> and <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> with 2 % Togol mud at 39 ℃ for 10 min at an interval of 1 week. No difference in the change rates of pulse rate and blood pressure was observed between {{the two types of}} bathing. Forehead and oral temperatures decreased slightly after bathing in plain <b>hot</b> spring <b>water.</b> However, after bathing in <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> with Togol mud, the forehead temperature tended to be higher than that before bathing while the oral temperature increased significantly after bathing. Skin surface temperatures on the chest wall, left instep, and right forearm increased significantly after both types of bathing. Changes in the skin temperature after bathing in <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> with Togol mud tended to be greater than those after bathing in plain <b>hot</b> spring <b>water.</b> Eight out of 10 students felt warmer after bathing in <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> with Togol mud. These findings suggest that bathing in <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> with Togol mud is useful for medical care...|$|R

40|$|Resadiye Cermik {{travertine}} area {{is one of}} {{the main}} natural heritages located within the Kelkit valley in the Middle of the Black Sea geographical region of Turkey. It is covered by the widespread natural, white travertines, which are acquired immediately on deposition from <b>hot</b> spring <b>waters.</b> Defination of the physico-chemical characteristics of the <b>hot</b> <b>waters,</b> factors affecting the travertine deposition, sources of pollution and protection were the main objectives of this study. Thermal water emanates from a N 25 W-N 65 W oriented tension fracture which is located within the North Anatolian Fault Zone. The composition of waters in Resadiye is governed by water-rock interactions. They are bicarbonate waters but do not reflect a peripheral or steam-heated origin. The silica geothermometer gives temperature ranging from 51 to 96 oC. These <b>hot</b> <b>waters</b> are of meteoric origin and circulation in the systems is closely related to tectonic activity...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to dissolved gases, <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic {{elements such as}} mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony. These chemicals precipitate as the water cools, and can cause environmental damage if released. The modern practice of injecting cooled geothermal fluids back into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk.|$|E

40|$|Carbonization {{of biomass}} (corn cob) in <b>hot</b> {{compressed}} <b>water</b> was performed {{using a small}} bomb reactor at temperature 300 - 350 ºC and pressure 10 - 18 MPa for 30 min. Then, the solid product or biochar was subjected to various analyses in order to investigate {{the effects of the}} carbonization in <b>hot</b> compressed <b>water</b> on the characteristics of the biochar. It was found that the yield of biochar carbonized in <b>hot</b> compressed <b>water</b> at 350 ºC and pressure of 10 MPa for 30 min was 44. 7 %, whereas the yield of biochar carbonized in nitrogen atmosphere at 350 ºC is 36. 4 %. Based on the information obtained from the elemental analyses of the biochar, {{it was found that the}} oxygen functional groups in the corn cob were selectively decomposed during the carbonization in <b>hot</b> compressed <b>water.</b> The pyrolysis and combustion behaviors of the biochar were found to be affected significantly by the carbonization in <b>hot</b> compressed <b>water...</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite his namesake {{being given}} to the area, Breitenbucher {{was not the first}} white man to visit the springs. As early as the 1830s, the springs were known to be visited by pioneers and other trappers, who used the <b>hot</b> <b>waters</b> to cook meat.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> drinking in Kawayu on blood glucose levels and insulin secretions. Kawayu <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> is characterized "acid alum vitriol hydrogensulfide" with a pH of 1. 98. First, a glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed on eight non-diabetic people and nine diabetic patients after drinking of tap <b>water</b> or Kawayu <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> at a one-week interval. Plasma glucose levels after pre-drinking spring water showed significantly (p= 0. 05) decreasing compared with those after pre-drinking tap water. Serum immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels after pre-drinking <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> were tend to be higher at the early phase of GTT than those after pre-drinking tap water. And, we confirmed {{the correlation between the}} total decreasing of blood glucose levels and the reactions of insulin secretion at early phase of GTT after spring water drinking. Second, GTT was performed on seven diabetic patients before and after four-week drinking of Kawayu <b>hot</b> spring <b>water.</b> The results showed that hemoglobin A 1 c levels and total cholesterol levels ware decreased significantly (p< 0. 05). Total blood glucose levels of tested GTT were, however, almost similar before and after drinking treatment. These findings suggest that drinking of Kawayu <b>hot</b> spring <b>water</b> is beneficial for diabetic patients...|$|R
5|$|In January 2008, Speight found Collins's body in {{the bath}} of their shared London flat. He was arrested on {{suspicion}} of her murder, but not charged with any offence.

Two suicide notes were discovered, describing how he could no longer live without Collins.|$|E
5|$|Most other binary alloys are {{of little}} use: for example, silver–gold alloys are too soft and silver–cadmium alloys too toxic. Ternary alloys have much greater importance: dental {{amalgams}} are usually silver–tin–mercury alloys, silver–copper–gold alloys {{are very important}} in jewellery (usually on the gold-rich side) and have a vast range of hardnesses and colours, silver–copper–zinc alloys are useful as low-melting brazing alloys, and silver–cadmium–indium (involving three adjacent elements on the periodic table) is useful in nuclear reactors because of its high thermal neutron capture cross-section, good conduction of heat, mechanical stability, and resistance to corrosion in <b>hot</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|On most crude-oil tankers, {{a special}} crude oil washing (COW) system {{is part of}} the {{cleaning}} process. The COW system circulates part of the cargo through the fixed tank-cleaning system to remove wax and asphaltic deposits. Tanks that carry less viscous cargoes are washed with water. Fixed and portable automated tank cleaning machines, which clean tanks with high-pressure water jets, are widely used. Some systems use rotating high-pressure water jets to spray <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> on all the internal surfaces of the tank. As the spraying takes place, the liquid is pumped out of the tank.|$|E
