This observation was also evident in, and supported by, the biodistribution data which showed that the uptake in the liver and <b>pancreas</b> <b>was</b> constantly increasing over time. Although there was no significant increase in radioactivity of the tracer in the blood or bone as a result of the blocking drug treatment (data not shown), based on the increased radiotracer uptake values over time in many organs expressing σ receptors, we hypothesise that the continuing increase in pancreas and liver uptake is likely due to an increase in radioactive metabolites, rather than specific σ uptake.|$|R

An abdominal enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a poorly enhanced mass (17  mm ×  15  mm in size) in the pancreatic head.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{pancreas}} transplantation has improved {{over the past}} several decades with advancements in surgical technique, immunosuppressive medicines, and immunologic testing. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with pancreas transplantation from 1995 to 2008.

40|$|Amino acid {{decarboxylation}} {{activity in}} dispersed rat pancreas acinar cells and fractions derived by differential {{centrifugation of homogenate}} of these cells was studied. The rate of decarboxylation was measured by determining the rate of production of the [3 H]-amine from [3 H]-amino acid or the rate of production of 14 CO 2 from the [14 C]-carboxy-labelled amino acid. Only the hydroxylated amino acids L-dopa and 5 -hydroxytryptophan are decarboxylated by intact dispersed pancreas acinar cells or cell homogenates at all pH values and amino acid concentrations tested. The decarboxylase activity is located exclusively in the cell cytosol. Each substrate competitively inhibits the decarboxylation of the other and the decarboxylation of each is inhibited by NSD- 1055. The estimated Km and Vmax are, for L-dopa, 4. 8 X 10 (- 5) M and 2. 5 nmol/mg protein/min and for 5 -hydroxytryptophan, 2. 9 X 10 (- 5) M and 0. 3 nmol/mg protein/min.

40|$|The role of incretins in glucose {{homeostasis}} is well known. Yet, in recent years, the sustained {{weight loss and}} rapid glycemic control following bariatric surgery has challenged {{our understanding of the}} intestinal-pancreatic interaction. This in turn led to the introduction of metabolic surgery, an innovative medical discipline in which a surgical manipulation of the gastrointestinal tract (e. [*]g., through a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, RYGB, or Bilio-Pancreatic-Diversion, BPD) yields a sustained remission of diabetes mellitus. The pathophysiological background of this metabolic effect is, amongst other things, based on the anti-incretin theory. This theory postulates that in addition to the well-known incretin effect, nutrient passage through the GI-tract could also activate negative feedback mechanisms (anti-incretins) to balance the effects of incretins and other postprandial glucose-lowering mechanisms (i. [*]e., suppression of ghrelin, glucagon, and hepatic glucose production via activation of nutrient sensing). This in turn prevents postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The bypass of the duodenum, the entire jejunum and the first portion of the ileum by BPD induce normalization of peripheral insulin sensitivity, while the bypass of a shorter intestinal tract by RYGB mainly improves the hepatic insulin sensitivity. In addition, RYGB greatly increases insulin secretion. Therefore, metabolic surgery highlights the important role of the small intestine in {{glucose homeostasis}}, while until few years ago, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only the <b>pancreas</b> and the liver that were thought to represent the regulatory organs for glucose disposal...|$|R

40|$|Cystic {{tumors of the}} <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> less {{frequent}} than solid lesions and are often detected incidentally, {{as many of these}} lesions are small and asymptomatic. However, they may be associated with pancreatitis or have malignant potential. With advancements in diagnostic imaging, cystic lesions of the <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> being detected with increasing frequency. Many lesions can cause a pancreatic cyst, most being non-neoplastic while approximately 10 % are cystic tumors, ranging from benign to highly malignant tumors. With increasing experience <b>it</b> <b>is</b> becoming clear that the prevalence of pseudocyst among cystic lesions of the <b>pancreas</b> <b>is</b> lower than usually presumed. A presumptive diagnosis of pseudocyst based on imaging appearance alone can cause a diagnostic error, and neoplastic cysts of the <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> particularly susceptible to this misdiagnosis, which can result in inappropriate treatment. Cystic tumors of the <b>pancreas</b> <b>are</b> formed by serous or mucinous structures showing all stages of cellular differentiation.
