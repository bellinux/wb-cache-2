50|$|In the {{following}} four rows, shaped like branches of a tree, we find the ascending parallage moving through the pentachords between the <b>finales</b> <b>of</b> kyrios and plagios.

While this tree had been written on page 15 in red colour, there is another version of the ascending parallage on page 13, written in black ink.|$|R
