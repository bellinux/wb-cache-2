To help understand the importance of reducing cycle time, consider the software inspection process. Although this is an expensive process, its cost is often justified on the grounds that, since the longer a defect remains in the system the more expensive it is to repair, the cost of nding defects today must be less than the cost of repairing them in the future.

40|$|Asset {{authorities}} need {{to predict}} the future condition of infrastructure, including railway bridges as {{part of the process of}} managing asset integrity and to prioritise maintenance, repair and rehabilitation activities given a limited budget. Visual inspection-based qualitative rating of component condition on an ordinal scale generated during periodic <b>inspection</b> <b>cycles</b> may be the primary source of information. Typically this data is sparse and intermittent. A complete sequence of data is not available for most of the individual bridges or bridge components and then only for a limited period of observation relative to the total period of use to date. A review of applicable existing modelling approaches shows that they may inadequately predict the future condition of bridge components. Although many of these approaches typically assume a Markov chain transition process, they do not deal adequately with missing data which is typical of this situation. Furthermore, non-linear optimisation techniques used in many existing methods are known to lead to inaccurate condition prediction, being susceptible to settling at local optima. More accurate prediction would allow more cost effective and certain management of the integrity of structures, specifically railway bridges. By using the proposed Bayesian inference-based methods, the accuracy of various Markov deterioration models has been improved well particularly when applied to a situation where data is missing. This has been successfully demonstrated for a limited set of data associated with a network of railway bridges. Such techniques may also be applicable to other structures including pipeline networks, pavement systems and others. The results here are limited by the restricted data sets that were used for validation. Validation on data from a broader range of component groups is required for gaining further evidence of the suitability of the developed models in practical application...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{standards}} for the manufacturing inspection of railroad wheels using ultrasound, such as UIC 812, {{have been replaced by}} new standards, for example EN 13262 and RD 32. 144 - 2000, both requiring ultrasonic testing in immersion technique. These new standards require the development of an ultrasonic technique for 100 % coverage of the wheel rim and wheel hub, and in special cases for both straight and curved wheel disks. In order to encompass a large variety of railroad wheel designs, inspection and handling techniques should be capable of dealing with wheel diameters ranging from 600 mm to 1300 mm (23 " to 51 ") at testing cycles from 1 to 4 minutes per wheel. The current requirement for the minimum detectable flaw size is DSR 1 mm (disc shape reflector, DSR, 1 mm diameter) for high-speed train wheels rims and DSR 2 mm for all other wheel rims. The minimum detectable flaw size for all other wheel areas (hub and disk areas) is DSR 3 mm. To meet all these criteria, the Rail Wheel Inspection (RWI) System was developed by IZFP and their partners. The system consists of an ultrasonic testing sub-system, immersion tank and transportation/handling sub-systems. Test cycles of 1 minute per wheel require two immersion tanks and two transportation/handling subsystems. The ultrasonic sub-system features modular computer-aided 6 to 16 - channel UT electronics (PCUS 11) to employ 6 to 16 ultrasonic transducers (the precise number is determined by the testing procedure).

40|$|Fatigue {{damage is}} one of the primary safety {{concerns}} for steel bridges reaching the end of their design life. Currently, federal requirements mandate regular inspection of steel bridges for fatigue cracks with evaluative reporting to bridge management systems. The quality of the inspection is subjective and time delayed due to <b>inspection</b> <b>cycles,</b> which are scheduled for every two years. However, structural health monitoring (SHM) data collected between inspection-intervals can provide supplementary information on structural condition that ameliorates some drawbacks of current inspection methods. Through the use of SHM and finite element models, fatigue performance assessments can be utilized throughout the service life of fatigue sensitive bridge elements for mitigating fatigue damage and preventing sudden fatigue failure. These assessments will additionally be useful to inspectors when reporting bridge condition evaluations to bridge management systems. The main goal {{of this study is to}} develop a fatigue life assessment method used for determining the remaining useful life of steel bridges and to map these results to existing bridge management systems. In order to achieve this goal, the current practices and methodologies associated with fatigue life of bridge elements and the use of bridge management systems are investigated. For analyses of fatigue damage, the fatigue life is split into two different periods of analyses: a crack initiation period and crack growth period. In order to quantify the effects of fatigue damage, each period of the fatigue life is associated with a unique assessment method, an empirical correlation assessment and a fracture mechanics assessment. Structural health monitoring techniques are employed to monitor the behavior of the bridge components and bridge elements. These two assessment methods are combined to form a damage accumulation model to estimate the fatigue life. The proposed damage accumulation model uses the acquired data from structural health monitoring alongside finite element modeling to derive a damage prognosis of bridge elements. The damage prognosis attempts to forecast the structure's performance by measuring the cumulative fatigue damage, estimating future loads, and ultimately determining the remaining useful life of the bridge element. A technique for mapping the results of the damage prognosis into condition state classifications is proposed. The suitability and applicability of the proposed damage accumulation model is illustrated on an existing highway bridge. This bridge was selected as a good candidate for fatigue monitoring due to the average daily truck traffic and the identification of existing and active fatigue cracks. The application of the damage accumulation model is demonstrated and a damage prognosis is derived. Finally, the damage accumulation results are integrated with current condition state classifications used in bridge management systems...|$|R
