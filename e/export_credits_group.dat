40|$|This {{contribution}} {{examines the}} degree of policy space the WTO leaves its Members to support <b>export</b> <b>credits</b> for non-agricultural goods. In the light of existing case law, it illustrates that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> support offered by <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> agencies that aims at complementing the private trade finance market would in principle be prohibited under the SCM Agreement. However, while some low-income countries can rely on a specific exception on the prohibition on export subsidies, all WTO Members can, {{on the basis of}} the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies, justify certain subsidized <b>export</b> <b>credits</b> that are in accordance with the interest rate provisions of the OECD Arrangement. But, as the case law and the OECD Arrangement currently stand, subsidized <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> guarantees and insurance as well as subsidized short-term <b>export</b> <b>credits</b> cannot rely on this safe haven. Hence, the article shows that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> agencies, except for those of some low-income countries, cannot play a complementary role to the private market in offering such support. Moreover, this contribution demonstrates that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> support in accordance with the safe haven might still be countervailable and actionable. Finally, it is argued that an exception which can be modified by a subgroup of WTO Members, like the safe haven, can no longer be accepted. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The use of officially {{supported}} <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> programs {{for agricultural products}} has been a widely debated issue at the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations in recent years. The European Union (EU) has agreed to reduce their direct export subsidies if the United States reduces its <b>export</b> <b>credits.</b> Specifically, {{the main issue of}} contention is whether to limit the length of repayment of the U. S. <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> programs to a period not exceeding 180 days. However, the impacts of such a reduction on the importing countries and the United States are not clear. In light of this debate, we analyze the impact of a reduction in the repayment period to 180 days on importing countries and examine the subsequent effects on U. S. exports supported through <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> programs. Our results indicate that importing countries do indeed benefit from <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> programs and are likely to increase their imports when they are in place. However, the benefits are reduced when the <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> repayment period is limited to 180 days. This implies that the more restrictive terms and conditions that the WTO is trying to impose over these programs, based on their implicitly subsidized components, may have an adverse impact on importing countries. <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> programs, agricultural trade, World Trade Organization, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|Companies face various risks when {{participating}} in international business. Even though exporting {{has been argued}} to represent low level of international commitment, exporters still face more risks in comparison to companies with purely domestic business activities. Among different risks lies credit risk which refers to possible non-payment or late payment of a customer. While exporters’ credit management is responsible for controlling credit risk, credit management in an international environment requires exporters to cope with incomplete information about customers’ creditworthiness and risks related to customers’ home countries. Even though there are various ways to conduct credit management, exporters may choose to acquire <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance to support their credit management practices. By acquiring <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance, exporters can hedge credit risk to credit insurers. This mitigates exporters’ {{exposure to credit risk}} if their customers fail to pay for purchased goods or services i. e. in case when credit risk realizes. This study explored exporters’ views on the value that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides for credit management practices. In this study, value refers to the benefit or benefits that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides. Theoretical background of the study includes literature relating to themes such as <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance, credit management and risks related to internationalization. The study applied a qualitative research approach through five expert interviews from two Finnish exporters and one private <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurer. Expert interviews were considered as the most suitable method to collect data in order to create in-depth understanding of an underresearched topic, compare interviewees’ perceptions with current literature as well as to reveal new perceptions towards the value that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides for exporters and their credit management. Based on the existing literature and empirical research, it can be concluded that exporters see that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides value mainly through risk transfer. Risk transfer may also enable exporters to gain additional benefits such as expanding export sales to destinations where they have not sold before. In addition, <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance can enable exporters to outsource a part of their credit management to credit insurers and to provide clear guidelines for exporters that have sufficient resources for independent credit management practices. On the contrary, it seems that exporters’ value perceptions towards <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance are dependent on the extent of insurance coverage that exporters have for their customer base. At the same time, exporters may easily question the premise of <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance if the level of customer non-payments is low...|$|R

For the most {{part of the work}} the author deals with credit insurance market as it represents {{a key part of the}} system. Author analyses portfolio specifics of the local <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance agency and searches for the most effective risk mitigation techniques and procedures in order to maintain its long-term non-loss operations while keeping in mind its special supportive mission. Particular attention is given to the <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance agency's business policy that copes with problems of information asymmetry, moral hazard and adverse selection. Author points out the differences between state supported and commercial insurers, analyses European legislation preventing <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> agencies from competition with commercial insurers and outlines more effective endogenous and self-regulating system. Minority of the work deals with less important <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> financing agency that represents a dominant player at the <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> financing market. Author finds almost twenty reasons of its extraordinary position at the market that has no analogy within developed countries worldwide and outlines a system securing its complement role to the commercial banks.
