500|$|The Eagles {{finished}} the 2004 {{season with a}} 13–3 record and earned a trip to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they were to play the AFC Champion New England Patriots. During the week {{leading up to the}} game, Mitchell sat for a short ESPN interview conducted by Dan Patrick. [...] Asked to identify the members of the Patriots' secondary, Mitchell claimed he did not know them by name, only by number, and then deliberately stated each of their numbers incorrectly. Finally, he said he [...] "had something" [...] for safety Rodney Harrison. Harrison responded by calling Mitchell a [...] "jerk." [...] Normally tight-lipped coach Patriots head coach Bill Belichick later said of Mitchell, [...] "ll he does <b>is</b> <b>talk.</b> [...] He's terrible, and you can print that. [...] I was happy {{when he was in the}} game." [...] Mitchell caught only one pass for 11yards in the 24–21 loss. After the Super Bowl, Mitchell continued to sound off in interviews in which he criticized the Patriots, as well as Belichick, saying that the way the Patriots reacted reminded him of [...] "little girls." ...|$|E
500|$|Whenever there <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> {{about new}} {{policies}} regarding new work time policies, {{there is often}} the argument for longer work hours {{in exchange for a}} shorter work week. For example, many are in favor of longer work hours such as [...] "three ten-hour days or four eight-hour days". However, this is often not the best work hours for people who take care of children, because children go to school for perhaps six hours a day, not eight or ten. Caretakers would prefer the opposite - shorter hours and longer weeks, such as six hour work days for six times a week, with limits on evening work and overtime, as well as flexible schedules. In order to lessen the burden of taking care of children and domestic duties as well as working in the paid sector, workplaces should consider policies that take into account the preferred work hours of caretakers. In addition, it is often the case now that many workers juggle domestic work and paid work. In order to get the most effective workers, companies should consider changing their policies in order to attract the best people in the field.|$|E

500|$|Returning to the West End, Gielgud {{starred in}} JBPriestley's The Good Companions, adapted {{for the stage}} by the author and Edward Knoblock. The {{production}} ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During {{the run of the}} play he made another film, Insult (1932), a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion, and he starred in a cinema version of The Good Companions in 1933, with Jessie Matthews. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud's view of film acting: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> of my doing Inigo in the film of The Good Companions, which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket." [...] In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, [...] "I was stupid enough to toss my head and stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts." ...|$|E

[...] In the Court's biweekly conference sessions, traditionally a period for vote-counting, Frankfurter had the habit of lecturing his colleagues for forty-five minutes at a time or more with his book resting on a podium. Frankfurter's ideological opponents would leave the room or read their mail while he lectured.|$|E

2500|$|By 1937, in {{tune with}} the National Christian Party regime, Cantacuzino had embraced eugenics, racism, and antisemitism. At a meeting in Cluj, she {{proposed}} the introduction of legislation banning all [...] "foreigners" [...] and minorities from marrying Romanian state employees, as well as 10-year reviews for all Romanian citizenship applications. Additionally, she and the GFR envisaged state bonuses for [...] "eugenic" [...] marriages between full-blooded Romanian youths. Meanwhile, her connections in the international feminist movement became alarmed by the growth of antisemitic violence. In a December 1933 letter to Cantacuzino, Cécile Brunschvicg inquired: [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> of terrible antisemitic campaigns in Romania, and of the development of a Nazi spirit in your country.

Some were amazed at the comments of the Prime Minister, with one person observing that [...] "he financial markets are wrecked and all he can do <b>is</b> <b>talk</b> about a petty joke." [...] Others stated that people should [...] "calm down", [...] "get a grip", and that the subject had been [...] "blown out of all proportion". McKenzie also characterised the reaction from the news media as containing [...] "anger: some genuine, some of it synthetic. Some of {{it comes from the}} BBC's usual critics." [...] He stated that for the people who worked in the media [...] "profile and salary-envy and [...] may play a part in all this. But how many heard the original transmission and how many are responding to the newspapers' quotes or others' arguments?" ...|$|E

Following an unpromising visit to Ernie's Nightclub in Greenwich Village, Holden becomes preoccupied with his internal angst and agrees to have a prostitute named Sunny visit his room. His attitude toward the girl changes the minute she enters the room; she seems {{about the same age as}} he.

Afterwards, Holden imagines that he has been shot by Maurice, and pictures murdering him with an automatic weapon.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} {{of the use of}} NEXTEL Cup teams with their drivers in Busch Series races, most notably at NEXTEL Cup tracks where there are Busch Series support races. [...] This has been dubbed by Fox Sports announcer Mike Joy as [...] "Busch Whacking", and many underfunded (or one-car) teams have failed to qualify for these races because of this. [...] The 2006 season has been notable for those [...] "double duty" [...] drivers even traveling to sites where there are stand-alone races at Nashville Superspeedway, Kentucky Speedway, Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez and The Milwaukee Mile just to name a few, even on the rare weeks where there are no NEXTEL Cup races. [...] Kentucky was the big upset where one of the underfunded one-car teams took advantage and pulled off the big upset. [...] In the end, Kevin Harvick, who drives for Richard Childress Racing in the Cup series, won the 2006 championship on October 13, the second of his career having previously won in 2001.
