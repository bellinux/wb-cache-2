5|$|After the {{accession}} of the Roman Catholic Mary I, Cranmer was put {{on trial}} for treason and heresy.

However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a heretic to Roman Catholics and a martyr for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles, an Anglican statement of faith derived from his work.|$|E

5|$|Most churches {{used two}} acts to {{sanction}} its members: censure and excommunication. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior {{that did not}} conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal <b>from</b> <b>church</b> membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E

5|$|Symeon endured severe {{opposition}} <b>from</b> <b>church</b> authorities, {{particularly from}} the chief theologian of the emperor's court, Archbishop Stephen, who at one time was the Metropolitan of Nicomedia. Stephen was a former politician and diplomat {{with a reputation for}} a thorough theoretical understanding of theology, but one which was removed from actual experience of the spiritual life. Symeon, in contrast, held the view that one must have actual experience of the Holy Spirit in order to speak about God, at the same time recognizing the authority of scripture and of the earlier church fathers. Their differing views on the source of authority to speak on spiritual matters was the cause of several years of intense conflict, ending with Symeon's eventual exile.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} initially {{opposed the}} Swedish reforms, {{as can be}} ascertained <b>from</b> <b>church</b> records and court transcripts.

The punishments included the use of impalement breaking on the wheel, {{as well as the}} nailing of bodies to church doors. In that way, it could take four to five days before the victim died.|$|E
50|$|The {{interest}} in revivalism also included eccleastical buildings and {{beginning in the}} 1870s a number of churches in Romanesque Revival were built including Åby <b>Church</b> <b>from</b> 1872, Holme <b>Church</b> <b>from</b> 1882, St. Paul's <b>Church</b> <b>from</b> 1887, St. Nicholas' <b>Church</b> <b>from</b> 1893, St. John's <b>Church</b> <b>from</b> 1905 and Aarhus Methodist <b>Church</b> <b>from</b> 1912.

Gothic Revival in churches is most prominently represented by the Catholic Church of Our Lady which was built in 1880 by designs of a German architect who had worked on the newly completed Cologne Cathedral.

5|$|As {{the number}} of clergy was {{severely}} limited, Soegijapranata roamed <b>from</b> <b>church</b> to church to attend to parishioners, actively preaching and serving as the de facto head of the Catholic Church in the country; this was in part to counteract rumours of his detention by the Japanese. He travelled by foot, bicycle, and carriage, as his car had been seized. He sent pastors to apostolic prefectures in Bandung, Surabaya, and Malang {{to deal with the}} lack of clergy there. Soegijapranata worked to ensure that the seminary would continue to produce new pastors and appointed the recently ordained Father Hardjawasita as its rector. He also granted native priests the authority to perform marriages. To calm the Catholic populace, he visited their homes and convinced them that the streets were safe.|$|E
5|$|During the Tudor {{period the}} Reformation {{produced}} a gradual shift to Protestantism, {{and much of}} London passed <b>from</b> <b>church</b> to private ownership. Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries, where it was considered indispensable. But the reach of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England {{were likely to be}} Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565, there ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity. The Royal Exchange was founded. Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.|$|E
5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} spouses for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. It must be noted, however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him.

5|$|In May 1948, {{while he}} was holding church {{meetings}} throughout Navajo and Apache communities in Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a myocardial infarction, {{also known as a}} heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish {{throughout the rest of the}} trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an electrocardiogram, his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by discussing his wishes regarding the family's finances and investments with his wife in case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing <b>from</b> <b>church</b> president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on bed rest followed by two weeks resting on the Navajo Nation. At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near the seashore in Long Beach, California. A cardiologist that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 October, a young woman struck a marching drum {{at the edge of}} a group of market-women who were infuriated by the chronic {{shortage}} and high price of bread. From their starting point in the markets of the eastern section of Paris then known as the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, the angry women forced a nearby church to toll its bells. Their numbers continued to grow and with restless energy the group began to march. More women from other nearby marketplaces joined in, many bearing kitchen blades and other makeshift weapons, as the tocsins rang <b>from</b> <b>church</b> towers throughout several districts. Driven by a variety of agitators, the mob converged on the Hôtel de Ville where they demanded not only bread, but arms. As more and more women – and men – arrived, the crowd outside the city hall reached between six and seven thousand, and perhaps as many as ten thousand.|$|E
5|$|Parishes arose <b>from</b> <b>Church</b> of England divisions, {{and were}} {{originally}} purely ecclesiastical divisions. Over time they acquired civil administration powers. The Highways Act 1555 made parishes {{responsible for the}} upkeep of roads. Every adult inhabitant of the parish was obliged to work four days {{a year on the}} roads, providing their own tools, carts and horses; the work was overseen by an unpaid local appointee, the Surveyor of Highways. The poor were looked after by the monasteries, until their dissolution. In 1572, magistrates were given power to 'survey the poor' and impose taxes for their relief. This system was made more formal by the Poor Law Act 1601, which made parishes responsible for administering the Poor Law; overseers were appointed to charge a rate to support the poor of the parish. The 19th century saw an increase in the responsibility of parishes, although the Poor Law powers were transferred to Poor Law Unions. The Public Health Act 1872 grouped parishes into Rural Sanitary Districts, based on the Poor Law Unions; these subsequently formed the basis for Rural Districts. Parishes were run by vestries, meeting annually to appoint officials, and were generally identical to ecclesiastical parishes, although some townships in large parishes administered the Poor Law themselves; under the Parishes Act 1882, all extra-parochial areas and townships that levied a separate rate became independent civil parishes.|$|E
