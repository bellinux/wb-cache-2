40|$|AbstractThis article {{suggests}} {{the solution to}} the inverse problem of harmonic balance by the method of full-scale–model testing to obtain hysteresis weber-ampere characteristics of <b>electrical</b> <b>devices.</b> During the testing of AC <b>electrical</b> <b>devices</b> quite often it is necessary to obtain a hysteresis weber-ampere characteristic. When the magnetic material is magnetized by the alternating field, hysteresis loop that characterizes the energy consumption per cycle of magnetization reversal is expanding due to the appearance of eddy current losses and loss by aftereffect. The aim of the study is to develop a method for determining the hysteresis weber-ampere characteristics on the basis of {{the solution to the}} inverse problem of harmonic balance for <b>electrical</b> <b>devices.</b> The technique is based on the previously conducted studies to obtain weber-ampere characteristics of <b>electrical</b> <b>devices,</b> as well as the weber-ampere characteristics of the operating duty cycle of AC <b>electrical</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

25|$|Inrush {{current or}} input surge current or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} input current drawn by an <b>electrical</b> <b>device</b> when first turned on. Inrush current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially {{if there is no}} inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The newmethod {{proposed}} here {{recognizes the}} use of portable <b>electrical</b> <b>devices</b> such as digital cameras, cellphones, electric shavers, and video game players with hand-worn magnetic sensors by sensing the magnetic fields emitted by these devices. Because we live surrounded by large numbers of <b>electrical</b> <b>devices</b> and frequently use these devices, we can estimate high-level daily activities by recognizing {{the use of}} elec-trical devices. Therefore, many studies have attempted to recognize the use of <b>electrical</b> <b>devices</b> with such approaches as ubiquitous sensing and infrastructure-mediated sensing. A feature of our method {{is that we can}} recognize the use of <b>electrical</b> <b>devices</b> that are not connected to the home infrastructure without the need for any ubiquitous sensors attached to the devices.

A newer method is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula for a few seconds; a similar technique, advocated by Heston Blumenthal as ideal for home cooks, is to add dry ice to the mixture while stirring for a few minutes. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture. Another method {{is to use a}} pre-frozen solution of salt and water, which gradually melts as the ice cream freezes.|$|E

Since then, the surger has been introduced to bars in Paris. Surgers are also in use in Australia, Singapore and Greece.

2500|$|The {{kinetic energy}} {{recovery}} system—known from [...] to 2013 as KERS, and renamed from 2014 as ERS-K—was incorporated into {{the design of the}} engine and its usage increased; its function as a supplementary power source was taken by the introduction of the heat-based energy recovery system (ERS). The ERS unit captured waste heat as it was dispelled from the exhaust turbocharger, using an <b>electrical</b> <b>device</b> known as a heat motor generator unit. This waste heat was stored as an electrical charge until it was used by a complementary system called the kinetic motor generator unit. This device was connected directly to the drive train to deliver the additional power in the most direct and efficient way. In combination with the ERS-K it gave drivers an additional [...] for thirty-three seconds per lap, compared to the KERS units used prior to 2014, which gave drivers [...] for six seconds per lap. This energy was released into the powertrain by the electronic control unit (ECU) to promote the most efficient and effective application of the power, but the driver had the ability to manually override the ECU and use the remaining available power instantly.|$|E

[...] The newspaper noted that this investigation [...] "was PETA's first significant step into advocacy in the horse racing world."

[...] By contrast, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, which also received PETA's allegations, found that Asmussen did not violate any of its rules. Asmussen remains under investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.|$|E

40|$|An {{electronic}} timer consisting of CMOS integrated circuits is described that synchronously switches multiple <b>electrical</b> <b>devices</b> {{on and off}} on either circadian or noncircadian cycles. Precision is attained to within 1 min when used in the circadian mode or to within 16. 7 msec when used at the highest speed (60 Hz). The {{electronic timer}} is useful for behavioral studies, control of environmental chambers, and control of general laboratory appliances. Timers that switch <b>electrical</b> <b>devices</b> on and off are useful for automatic control of lamps, heaters, humidifiers, and other equipment in environmental chambers. Timers are also useful in many behavioral and physiological studies of organisms in which {{the presence or absence}} of various light, sound, temperature, and chemical stimuli in precise sequences and combinations is required. Commercial timers are generally limited to only two on-off switches per day or, at most, to switching every other hour. Mechanical timers are motor driven, so that the exact moment of switching is difficult to adjust with precision, thus causing inaccuracy in synchronous switching of multiple <b>electrical</b> <b>devices.</b> An electronic timer using CMOS integrated circuits (ICs) for high reliability is described here that is relatively inexpensive and precise, with an adjustable cycle speed.
