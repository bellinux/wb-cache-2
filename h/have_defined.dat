5|$|Anarchism is a {{political}} philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as stateless societies, although several authors <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> them more specifically as institutions based on non-hierarchical or free associations.|$|E
5|$|As Asian populations develop {{negative}} {{health consequences}} {{at a lower}} BMI than Caucasians, some nations have redefined obesity; Japan <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> obesity as any BMI greater than 25kg/m2 while China uses a BMI of greater than 28kg/m2.|$|E
5|$|As {{leaders in}} the punk rock scene, the Ramones' music has usually been {{identified}} with that label, while some <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> their characteristic style more specifically as pop punk and others as power pop. In the 1980s, the band sometimes veered into hardcore punk territory, as can be heard on Too Tough to Die.|$|E

5|$|The vastness {{and variety}} of Canada's climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landform separations <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> ancient peoples implicitly into {{cultural}} or linguistic divisions. Canada is surrounded north, east, and west with coastline and since the last ice age, Canada has consisted of distinct forest regions. Language contributes to {{the identity of a}} people by influencing social life ways and spiritual practices. Aboriginal religions developed from anthropomorphism and animism philosophies.|$|E

25|$|Some authors, such as Lyotard and Baudrillard, {{believe that}} modernity {{ended in the}} late 20th century and thus <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> a period {{subsequent}} to modernity, namely postmodernity, while others, such as Bauman and Giddens, would extend modernity to cover the developments denoted by postmodernity. Others still contend that modernity ended with the Victorian Age in the 1900s.|$|E
25|$|Price opposes {{abortion}} and voted to withdraw {{federal funding for}} Planned Parenthood. In 2005, he co-sponsored the Right to Life Act, which would <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> life as beginning {{at the moment of}} conception, therefore banning most abortions and many forms of contraception. On multiple occasions, Price supported the proposed Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which if passed, would have implemented a nationwide ban on abortions occurring after the twentieth week of pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not clear}} where on the BMI scale the {{threshold}} for overweight and obese should be set. Because of this the standards have varied {{over the past few}} decades. Between 1980 and 2000 the U.S. Dietary Guidelines <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> overweight at a variety of levels ranging from a BMI of 24.9 to 27.1. In 1985 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus conference recommended that overweight BMI be set at a BMI of 27.8 for men and 27.3 for women.|$|E
25|$|Referred pain, {{also called}} {{reflective}} pain, is pain perceived {{at a location}} other than {{the site of the}} painful stimulus. An example is the case of angina pectoris brought on by a myocardial infarction (heart attack), where pain is often felt in the neck, shoulders, and back rather than in the thorax (chest), the site of the injury. The International Association for the Study of Pain has not officially defined the term; hence several authors <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> the term differently.|$|E
25|$|Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes {{transcripts}} {{have been}} observed with x-ray crystallography to have a NCIN-capped RNA product {{in addition to being}} observed under in vivo condition. The efficiency of NCIN capping is largely influenced by promoter sequence especially the -35 box and -10 box upstream of the transcription start site. Studies so far <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> the mechanism and structural basis of NCIN mediated capping but the function of these caps are still to be discovered. Recent consensus is that NCIN-mediated ab initio capping occurs in all organisms.|$|E

25|$|Tausug people occupying Sulu are {{basically}} Muslims, thus, they <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> set of burial customs {{in the strong}} influence of their religion. The process of burial contains four steps: Sutchihun (cleaning the body), Saputan (wrapping the body), Sambayanganun (obligatory prayer), and Hikubul (burial). The grave is created hollow under 6 to 9 feet depth in North-South direction, which will be prayed upon by a religious man for a peaceful rest of the dead. Afterwards, the grave will be closed using ding ding hali (means “wall of the rest”) made of huge flat slab.|$|E
25|$|Molecular genetic studies <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> {{at least}} two loci for TSC. In TSC1, the {{abnormality}} is localized on chromosome 9q34, but {{the nature of the}} gene protein, called hamartin, remains unclear. No missense mutations occur in TSC1. In TSC2, the gene abnormalities are on chromosome 16p13. This gene encodes tuberin, a guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein. The specific function of this protein is unknown. In TSC2, all types of mutations have been reported; new mutations occur frequently. Few differences have yet been observed in the clinical phenotypes of patients with mutation of one gene or the other.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{regulations}} in the United States include screening requirements and restrictions on donations, but {{generally do not}} affect sexually intimate partners. However, doctors {{may be required to}} provide treatments due to nondiscrimination laws, as for example in California. The US state of Tennessee proposed a bill in 2009 that would <b>have</b> <b>defined</b> donor IVF as adoption. During the same session another bill proposed barring adoption from any unmarried and cohabitating couple, and activist groups stated that passing the first bill would effectively stop unmarried people from using IVF. Neither of these bills passed.|$|E
