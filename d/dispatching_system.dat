25|$|Westchester County has a {{wide array}} of {{emergency}} services and is the home to 58 fire departments, 42 ambulance services, two Haz-Mat teams, a volunteer technical rescue team, a fire academy and a fire investigations unit. Each department has career, volunteer or a combination of personnel. Westchester County Department of Emergency Services operates the main <b>dispatching</b> <b>system</b> for EMS and fire departments, located in Valhalla. The department also provides numerous support services for the various agencies throughout the county.|$|E
25|$|The {{department}} had serious problems: The <b>dispatching</b> <b>system</b> {{could not identify}} {{the exact location of}} structures like the United States Capitol or the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, dispatchers sent crews to the wrong locations or in the wrong directions, firefighters didn't know how to use life-saving emergency equipment such as defibrillators, injuries to civilians during fires were on the increase, fire engines and ambulances were having more accidents while responding to calls, and ambulances took twice as long to respond to calls (11 minutes and 21 seconds) than the national average. The training structures at the fire academy were in serious disrepair, trainees were found extensively cheating on tests, there were equipment and employee shortages, and equipment was old and in disrepair. Three firefighters died in 1999 in two months, creating a deep morale problem. (Prior to the incidents, just a single firefighter had died in 11 years.) Few had little experience overseeing the provision of emergency medical care, although 80 percent of calls in D.C. were of that nature. Few was also only the second fire chief hired from outside the department, and had extremely poor relations with the firefighter's union.|$|E

50|$|All Communication Operators are {{at minimum}} trained and {{licensed}} Emergency medical responders (EMR), and receive intensive in-house training. All Operators are have obtained the National Academy of Emergency <b>Dispatch</b> <b>System’s</b> Emergency Telecommunicator (ETC) Certification, Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD) Certification and Emergency Fire Dispatcher (EFD) Certification. They are also certified in {{use of the}} Medical Priority <b>Dispatch</b> <b>System</b> (MPDS) and Fire Priority <b>Dispatch</b> <b>System</b> (FPDS). Both of these <b>dispatch</b> <b>systems</b> are used internationally and guarantee consistent and accurate assessment of the caller’s emergency as well as consistent <b>dispatching.</b> These <b>system</b> help alleviate problems where the caller may exaggerate or downplay the emergency, and provides the call taker with a consistent approach to every call. All Communication Operators go through ongoing training with these systems and go through yearly recertification. The Communication Centre Shift Supervisor is responsible for overseeing all operations within the Communication Centre and review calls for continuous quality improvement.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the study of}} a novel approach towards an automated taxi <b>dispatch</b> <b>system</b> that handles current bookings in a distributed fashion. Existing systems in use by taxi operators in Singapore attempt to increase customer satisfac-tion locally, by sequentially dispatching nearby taxis to service customers. The proposed <b>dispatch</b> <b>system</b> attempts to increase customer satisfaction more globally, by concurrently dispatching multiple taxis to {{the same number of}} customers in the same geographical region, and vis-à-vis human driver and dispatcher satisfaction. To realize the system, we propose a multiagent architecture, populated with collaborative taxi agents that can actively negotiate on behalf of taxi drivers in groups of size N for available customer bookings.
