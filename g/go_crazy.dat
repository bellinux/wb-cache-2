5|$|In 1951 the Goons {{made their}} feature film debut in Penny Points to Paradise.

In 1954, Sellers was cast opposite Sid James, Tony Hancock, Raymond Huntley, Donald Pleasence and Eric Sykes in the British Lion Film Corporation comedy production, Orders Are Orders. John Grierson believes that this was Sellers's breakthrough role on screen and credits this film with launching the film careers of both Sellers and Hancock.|$|E

25|$|The novel {{presents}} {{the story from}} the perspective of Desiderio, a bureau member in the main city currently under the attack of Doctor Hoffman's desire machines. With these machines, Doctor Hoffman expands the dimensions of time and space, allowing ever-changing mirages to inhabit the same dimension as the living. Desiderio, though indifferent to the haunting apparitions, finds himself visited nightly by a glass woman, the manifestation of Albertina, Hoffman's daughter and Desiderio's lover-to-be. Unlike Desiderio, many people <b>go</b> <b>crazy</b> in response to the apparitions, and the city, severed from communication with the outside world, becomes a place of rampant insanity and crime, thereby prompting a state of emergency. Under the command of the Minister of Determination, Desiderio embarks on an undercover journey to find and assassinate Doctor Hoffman.|$|E

500|$|Eno {{developed}} [...] "I'll <b>Go</b> <b>Crazy</b> If I Don't <b>Go</b> <b>Crazy</b> Tonight" [...] {{during the}} Fez sessions, under the working title [...] "Diorama". U2 reworked it with Steve Lillywhite {{during a break}} from recording with Eno and Lanois. Some of the lyrics were influenced by Barack Obama's presidential campaign, while others referenced Bono. Album reviews described the song as a joyous pop rock composition. [...] "Get on Your Boots" [...] stemmed from a guitar riff The Edge created and recorded at his home. At 150 beats per minute, the song {{is one of the}} fastest the band have recorded. Rolling Stone called it a [...] "blazing, fuzzed-out rocker that picks up where 'Vertigo' left off." [...] Thematically, the song is about Bono taking his family on vacation to France and witnessing warplanes flying overhead {{at the start of the}} Iraq War. The chant [...] "let me in the sound" [...] was developed late in the recording sessions and became a motif throughout parts of the album.|$|E

500|$|Bono {{stated that}} the setlist was divided into two acts and a coda. The first half, from [...] "Breathe" [...] to [...] "Vertigo", focused on the personal, where Bono [...] "envisages himself as a young man, {{struggling}} to find his feet in life and in search {{of some kind of}} personal epiphany." [...] The remix version of [...] "I'll <b>Go</b> <b>Crazy</b> If I Don't <b>Go</b> <b>Crazy</b> Tonight" [...] was created by the music team Fish out of Water as a mashup of previous remixes by Redanka and Dirty South. [...] The [...] "I'll Go Crazy" [...] remix is intended to disorient the audience as the band moves into the second act, [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] to the encore, which focuses more on the political aspect of Bono's persona, where he [...] " [...] with the problems of the wider world."

500|$|Mullen has had {{tendinitis}} problems {{throughout his}} career. As {{a means to}} reduce inflammation and pain, he began to use specially designed Pro-Mark drumsticks.

[...] "Chromium Chords" [...] became [...] "Tripoli", {{and finally}} [...] "Fez– Being Born". The band {{considered}} [...] "Fez– Being Born" [...] and [...] "Get on your Boots" [...] as album openers, but ultimately decided on [...] "No Line on the Horizon". At {{the end of the}} sessions, the band chose to include [...] "White as Snow", a quiet song about a dying soldier in Afghanistan, to balance out the earlier, rockier tunes. With the exception of this track, U2 had tried to keep the theme of war out of the album. In early December 2008, Clayton stated, [...] "this is definitely the last week of recording. But then again, last week was definitely the last week of recording, and the week before that." [...] The final sessions ended later that month.

500|$|During {{the first}} leg of the tour in Europe, the band {{typically}} played songs from No Line on the Horizon early in the set. [...] "Breathe", [...] "No Line on the Horizon", [...] "Get on Your Boots" [...] and [...] "Magnificent" [...] were played as the opening quartet, while [...] "Unknown Caller" [...] and a remixed arrangement of [...] "I'll <b>Go</b> <b>Crazy</b> If I Don't <b>Go</b> <b>Crazy</b> Tonight" [...] appeared close to the halfway point. [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] closed every show. U2 made minor changes to the setlists for the second leg of the tour. [...] "No Line on the Horizon" [...] was performed later in the concerts, while [...] "Unknown Caller" [...] was dropped for several weeks before being revived {{towards the end of the}} leg. The band did not play [...] "Stand Up Comedy", [...] "Fez– Being Born", [...] "White as Snow", or [...] "Cedars of Lebanon" [...] at any point in 2009. The 25October 2009 concert at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, U2's penultimate concert of 2009, was filmed and streamed live over YouTube.

500|$|The {{tour was}} U2's first under their 12-year deal with Live Nation.

Lead singer Bono said of the new relationship, [...] "I'm very excited about this. Research in Motion is going to give us what Apple wouldn't: access to their labs and their people so we can do something really spectacular." [...] The explicit corporate sponsorship of a tour was a first for the group, and was due to the anticipated production costs being higher than for any previous U2 tour. The first commercials for a new Blackberry application, called the [...] "U2 Mobile App", began airing in early July 2009 against the song [...] "I'll <b>Go</b> <b>Crazy</b> If I Don't <b>Go</b> <b>Crazy</b> Tonight"; the application allows the user to listen to the album No Line on the Horizon, contains a news section which features updates about the tour, and an interactive section that allows the sharing of images and enables the user to see their position during a concert relative to the band and other application users.
