40|$|Linear Threshold Boolean units (LTUs) are {{the basic}} {{processing}} components of artificial neural networks of Boolean activations. Quantization of their parameters is a central question in hardware implementation, when numerical technologies are used to store {{the configuration of the}} circuit. In the previous studies on the circuit complexity of feedforward neural networks, no differences had been made between a network with "small" integer weights and one composed of majority units (LTUs with weights in f; 1 # 0 # + 1 g), since any connection of weight w (w integer) can be simulated by jwj connections of value sgn(w). This paper will focus on the circuit complexity of democratic networks, i. e. circuits of majority units with at most one connection between each pair of units. The main results presented are the following: any Boolean function can be computed by adepth- 3 non-degenerate <b>democratic</b> <b>network</b> and can be expressed as a linear threshold function of majorities; AT-LEAST-k and AT-MOST-k are computable by a depth- 2, polynomial size democratic network; the smallest sizes of depth- 2 circuits computing PARITY are identical for a <b>democratic</b> <b>network</b> and for a usual network; the VC-dimension of the class of the majority functions is n + 1, i. e...|$|E
40|$|Though commonplace, persuasion {{and other}} discursive means in {{practice}} are weak ways of creating consent. Historically, {{this has been}} reinforced as political communication has migrated from oligarchic peer to <b>democratic</b> <b>network</b> models. Manufacturing consent is typical of mass network communications. Editorial gatekeeping is a conventional technique used. The impact of this, though, is overrated. In liberal societies, opinion is always deeply divided irrespective of opinion management. Idealist attempts to overcome the manufacture of consent by melding peer and mass communications usually end in farce, not consensus. Despite this, governments in liberal societies often enjoy high levels of consent. What this suggests is that political consent is mobilised by means other than persuasion, and that consent does not rely on a consensus of opinion. The article discusses some of these nondiscursive media of consent formation...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} <b>democratic</b> <b>network</b> {{governance}} has attracted growing interest among students {{of local and}} regional governance in all the Nordic countries since the 1990 s. This article examines whether {{research in this area}} reflects a particular Nordic account of democracy. The Nordic countries have strong traditions of local autonomy, local networks and the inclusion of civil society associations. The authors find reason to expect that the Nordic traditions of local and regional governance may have stimulated a common approach to democracy questions with the features of an integrative perspective. At the same time, the differences in the history of democratisation are likely to have urged the approach in different directions. Using evidence from a literature review, the article suggests that, rather than a fully fledged theory, democracy with an intriguing potential and with nuances exists as an issue in the Nordic governance studies...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the thesis}} that the {{ecological}} crisis is rooted in our lifestyle and consumption habits {{and can not be}} solved solely through technological solutions, this report examines how it is possible to create behavioral changes, through the involvement of citizens in planning processes. This approach corresponds well with the theory of reflexive ecological modernization, which we choose to operationalize through a list of criteria borrowed from theories of <b>democratic</b> <b>network</b> management and communicative planning to use the former in a local planning context. Based on a case study on the Local Agenda 21 center in Albertslund, Denmark, the thesis analyses different strategies on how to engage people in local environmental action, and concludes that the current working practices of Agenda Center Albertslund, fail to meet the requirements of reflexive ecological modernization. Exemplified by the conference, ”I Love Albertslund”, we argue that citizen participation processes is resource-intensive and difficult to perform. On this basis, we believe that if governments seek to support environmental transformation rooted in local communities, they should comprehend the complexity of the problem and begin to act accordingly...|$|E
40|$|All {{the human}} {{organizations}} are not governed by competition, power relationships and individual interest. Sometimes well‐meaning people willingly decide {{to join their}} forces for a common project. The success of each participant, musicians of an orchestra, members of a eight rowing boat team, or of a danse troupe, is then integrally determine by the joint success. Besides the individual qualities of each member, the common success critically depends {{on the ability of}} the organizational structure to facilitate the flow of informations and orders between participants, i. e. to synchronize their individual actions. Here, in the framework of an oversimplified mathematical modelization of the individual behavior, we investigate the synchronization properties of some typical hierarchical organizations and perform the comparison with existing ones. We show that the <b>democratic</b> <b>network</b> is the most stable one. One of our most surprising results concerns the existence of evolutionary culs‐de‐sacs, i. e. hierarchical structures that, although not optimal {{from the point of view}} synchronization, are not able to improve themselves under the effect of small perturbations...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) School-community {{collaboration}} {{has received}} increasing attention {{in social work}} because of its potential for enhancing the quality of services to meet the multifaceted needs of students. However, there is little {{understanding of how to}} create and maintain successful school-community collaboration. The purpose of this research is to develop and validate a comprehensive framework for transformative school-community collaboration based on a critical paradigm and its corresponding theories. Using school survey data, an exploratory factor analysis identified the four dimensions of transformative school community collaboration, including (1) critical member capacity, (2) equal relations, (3) <b>democratic</b> <b>network</b> governance, and (4) empowering coordination. The results of multiple regression analyses showed that the identified dimensions were positively associated with the quality outcomes of Out-of-School Time programs although their significant effects varied across different quality outcomes: high-quality activities, student engagement, and linkages with family/community. Another key finding was that structural dimensions—democratic network governance and empowering coordination—appeared to be stronger factors. However, this research suggested that critical member capacity and equal relations may be associated indirectly with the quality outcomes. This dissertation paper concludes with practical implications and future research agenda to successfully build transformative school-community collaboration...|$|E
40|$|Parties‐as‐networks is an {{emerging}} approach to understanding American political parties as decentralized, nonhierarchical, fluid systems with porous boundaries {{of a wide}} array of actors. Parties‐asnetworks include interest groups, social movements, political consultants, and advocacy organizations, in additional to the usual suspects of elected officials, party officials, and citizen‐activists. This approach ameliorates several deficits of the traditional, tripartite view of parties in government, in elections, and as organizations. The authors apply the parties‐as‐networks approach using data from surveys of delegates at the 2008 Democratic and Republican national conventions. Analysis of delegates’ memberships {{in a wide variety of}} organizations demonstrates that Democrats have larger networks than do Republicans; Republican networks tend more toward hierarchy than do Democratic networks; and the content of <b>Democratic</b> <b>networks</b> is tilted toward labor and identity organizations, while Republican networks are more populated by civic, religious, ideological, and professional organizations. The parties‐as‐networks view is a potentially revealing source of insight on the dynamic evolution of party coalitions. Theoretically, approaching parties as networks deepens the understanding of how intermediary institutions matter to the functioning of democratic politics...|$|R
