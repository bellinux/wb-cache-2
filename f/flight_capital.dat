40|$|Abstract: Despite the {{substantial}} recent {{increase in capital}} flows to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the sub-continent remains largely marginalized in financial globalization and chronically dependent on official development aid. The current debate on resource mobilization for development financing in Africa has overlooked the problem of capital flight, which constitutes an important untapped source of funds. This paper argues that repatriation of <b>flight</b> <b>capital</b> deserves more attention on economic as well as moral grounds. On the moral side, {{the argument is that}} {{a large proportion of the}} capital flight legitimately belongs to the African people and therefore must be restituted to the legitimate claimants. The economic argument is that repatriation of <b>flight</b> <b>capital</b> will contribute to propelling the sub-continent on a higher sustainable growth path while preserving its financial stability and independence and without mortgaging the welfare of its future generations through external borrowing. The anticipated gains from capital repatriation are large. In particular, this paper estimates that if only a quarter of the stock of capita...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an attempt}} at explaining and analyzing <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> from Southeast Asia over the period 1970 to 2002. The research is organized into five questions. The first question is: What is <b>capital</b> <b>flight?</b> We review {{the literature on the}} meanings and measurements of <b>capital</b> <b>flight.</b> We define <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> as the movement of capital from resource-scarce developing countries in order to avoid social control. The second question is: Was capital fleeing Southeast Asia? We employ a modified residual method to estimate <b>capital</b> <b>flight.</b> We measure <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> as net unrecorded capital outflow, or the net of officially recorded capital inflows and recorded foreign exchange outflows. The third question is: Why was capital fleeing Southeast Asia? We examine direct and indirect linkages between <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> and external borrowing, using a 2 ̆ 7 revolving door 2 ̆ 7 model, and other exogenous variables. The fourth question is: Should Southeast Asia worry about <b>capital</b> <b>flight?</b> We deal with a counterfactual situation, using a planning method and a multiplier method: if there was no <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> and the <b>capital</b> was utilized in productive domestic activities, how much additional output and employment would have been generated? The last question is: What is to be done to address <b>capital</b> <b>flight?</b> We discuss some policy guidelines to restrain, reduce, and reverse <b>capital</b> <b>flight.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The authors examine <b>flight</b> <b>capital</b> in {{the context}} of {{portfolio}} choice.

There are large regional differences in the proportion of private wealth that is held abroad, ranging from 3 percent in South Asia to 39 percent in Africa. They explain differences in portfolio choice in terms of the capital to labor ratio, indebtedness, exchange rate distortions, and risk ratings - all proxies for differences in the risk-adjusted rate of return on capital. They then apply the results to four policy questions in which private portfolio choices are potentially important: the effect of the East Asian crisis on domestic capital outflows; spillovers; the effect of HIPC debt relief on capital repatriation; and why Africa has so much of its private wealth outside the continent. Their conclusions: 1) The four most severely affected East Asian countries will eventually lose about $ 250 billion in domestic wealth {{as a result of the}} deterioration in risk between March 1997 and September 1998. 2) They found some support for a spillover model. 3) The effect of the HIPC debt relief initiative on capital repatriation will vary massively between HIPC-eligible countries. 4) Africa has by far the lowest capital per worker, which makes massive capital flight from Africa all the more distinctive.

40|$|The {{decline in}} private savings since 1982 {{is arguably the}} most {{important}} problem in high debt countries. A reversal of the trend is essential if growth is to be restored. Three factors predominate : 1) the extent of intertemporal substitution; 2) attitudes toward risk; and 3) private/public savings interaction. These factors lie {{at the core of the}} authors'research. They test the issue of debt neutrality - whether future taxes are recognized as an offset for the value of any government debt held - and the response of private savings to real interest rates and uncertainty. The authors estimated two configurations of a joint portfolio-choice/savings model. First, they included equity, domestic bonds, and <b>flight</b> <b>capital.</b> In the second configuration they eliminated <b>flight</b> <b>capital.</b> The authors conclusions include the following : i) the intertemporal approach to consumption is supported by the data; ii) the results imply rejection of the traditional, expected utility approach; iii) risk aversion is significant but lower than many have argued from analysis of static versions of the capital asset pricing model; iv) results on the intertemporal substitution elasticity are much weaker; and v) domestic government bonds probably are considered as part of private wealth, although significantly less than one for one, thus rejecting debt neutrality.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} corruption in impelling <b>capital</b> <b>flight.</b> Identifying corruption as one dimension of poor governance, the empirical analysis explores direct linkages between corruption and <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> in a broad sample of countries. The novelty of this investigation {{is that it is}} based on a portfolio choice model of asset allocation that explicitly recognizes corruption as contributing to the variance of domestic investment risk. The main testable proposition emerging from our theoretical specification is stated thus: does corruption impel <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> by raising the risk of domestic investment, ceteris paribus? An econometric analysis suggests that, holding other determinants of <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> constant, corruption does have a positive and significant impact on <b>capital</b> <b>flight.</b> Based on these results, the paper concludes that advocating good governance by combating corruption makes a great deal of sense for countries aiming to staunch <b>capital</b> <b>flight.</b> JEL CLASSIFICATION: G 11, F 32 KEY WORDS: <b>Capital</b> <b>flight,</b> governance, corruption, economic risk <b>Capital</b> <b>flight</b> and corruption are some of the main causes of the poverty in the South.

40|$|The {{frequent}} {{outbreak of}} financial crisis {{in recent years}} has triggered a new discussion of <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> phenomenon in the fast growing emerging countries such as Thailand, India, and Malaysia. The <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> phenomenon has captured many scholars’ attention and interests. Previous studies of <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> phenomenon have focused on mainland China. However, Hong Kong is {{known as one of the}} dynamic financial centers in Asia and plays an important role in the development of the Chinese financial market.

What determines the <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> in Hong Kong financial market and whether there is a <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> round-trip between Hong Kong and mainland China (from Hong Kong’s point of view).

We find that total capital flight from these countries in this period amounted to $ 443 billion (in 2004 dollars).

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{increase}} in capital flows to Sub-Saharan Africa, the region remains largely marginalized in financial globalization and chronically dependent on official development aid. And with the potential decline {{in the level of}} official development assistance in a context of global financial crisis, the need to increase domestic resources mobilization as well as non-debt generating external resources is critical now more than ever before. However, the debate on resource mobilization has overlooked an important untapped source of funds consisting of the massive stocks of private wealth stashed in Western financial centers, a substantial part of which left the region in the form of capital flight. This paper argues that the repatriation of <b>flight</b> <b>capital</b> should take a more prominent place in this debate from a moral standpoint and for clear economic reasons. On the moral side, the argument is that {{a large proportion of the}} capital flight legitimately belongs to the Africans and therefore must be restituted to the legitimate claimants. The economic argument is that repatriation of <b>flight</b> <b>capital</b> will propel the sub-continent on a higher sustainable growth path while preserving its financial stability and without mortgaging the welfare of its future generations through external borrowing. The analysis in the paper demonstrates quantitatively that the gains from repatriation are large and dominate the expected benefits from other sources such as debt relief. It is estimated that if only a quarter of the stock of capital flight was repatriated to Sub-Saharan Africa, the region would go from trailing to leading other developing regions in terms of domestic investment, thus initiating a ‘big-push’-led sustainable long-term economic growth. The paper proposes some strategies for inducing capital flight repatriation, but cautions that the success of this program is contingent on strong political will on the part of African and Western governments and effective coordination and cooperation at the global level.

Our {{results suggest that the}} same economic factors influence human and financial portfolio decisions, namely the relative returns and the relative risks in the competing locations. We focus on the estimated model's implications for Africa, finding that the severe financial <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> that Africa experienced until the late 1980 s has started to be reversed. The factors that have accounted for this repatriation are probably the reduction in the parallel market premium and African indebtedness, the reduction in the incidence of civil war (a phenomenon true only of our sample countries, rather than a general African phenomenon) and the decline in real US interest rates. In contrast, we find that human <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> is rapidly increasing, as the emigration of the educated is subject to much more powerful momentum effects than financial <b>capital</b> <b>flight.</b> Finally, we find that for both types of <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> policy changes only affect outcomes with long lags, suggesting that Africa's human capital exodus will be an increasingly important problem...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the very}} factors that {{influence}} massive capital outflow from an economy is vitally important as it may assist decision makers in formulating effective strategies which can not only mitigate such <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> but also slow down {{the deterioration of the}} economy and even re-generate it. This paper analyzed the dynamic interaction between macroeconomic fundamentals and <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> using co-integration and vector auto-regression. The macroeconomic fundamentals considered were exchange rates, consumer price index, gross domestic products and interest rates. The results show that macroeconomic fundamentals and <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> are associated in the long run. In terms of short-run dynamics and interactions between <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> and macroeconomic fundamentals, variations in <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> are predominantly attributed to its own variations and exchange rate variations. Innovations in <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> explain substantial fractions of the GDP, exchange rate, interest rate and CPI variations...|$|R
40|$|We study China's illicit {{capital flow}} and {{document}} {{a change in}} its pattern. Specifically, we observe that China's <b>capital</b> <b>flight,</b> especially the one measured by trade misinvoicing, exhibits a weakened response in the post- 2007 period to the covered interest disparity, which is a theoretical determinant of <b>capital</b> <b>flight.</b> Further analyses indicate that the post- 2007 behavior is influenced by quantitative easing and other factors including exchange rate variability, capital control policy and trade frictions. Our study confirms that China's <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> pattern and its determinants {{are affected by the}} crisis event. Further, both the canonical and additional explanatory variables have different effects on different measures of <b>capital</b> <b>flight.</b> These results highlight the challenges of managing China's <b>capital</b> <b>flight,</b> which requires information on the period and the type of <b>capital</b> <b>flight</b> that the policy authorities would like to target...|$|R
