5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E

25|$|Some newborns <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine,</b> downy body hair called lanugo. It may be {{particularly}} noticeable on the back, shoulders, forehead, ears and face of premature infants. Lanugo disappears within a few weeks. Infants may be born with full heads of hair; others, particularly caucasian infants, may have very fine hair or may even be bald. Amongst fair-skinned parents, this fine hair may be blonde, even if the parents are not. The scalp may also be temporarily bruised or swollen, especially in hairless newborns, and {{the area around the}} eyes may be puffy.|$|E
25|$|The {{tailpiece}} anchors {{the strings}} {{to the lower}} bout of the violin {{by means of the}} tailgut, which loops around an ebony button called the tailpin (sometimes confusingly called the endpin, like the cello's spike), which fits into a tapered hole in the bottom block. Very often the E string will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> tuning lever worked by a small screw turned by the fingers. Fine tuners may also be applied to the other strings, especially on a student instrument, and are sometimes built into the tailpiece. The fine tuners enable the performer to make small changes in the pitch of a string. At the scroll end, the strings wind around the wooden tuning pegs in the pegbox. The tuning pegs are tapered and fit into holes in the peg box. The tuning pegs are held in place by the friction of wood on wood. Strings may be made of metal or less commonly gut or gut wrapped in metal. Strings usually have a colored silk wrapping at both ends, for identification of the string (e.g., G string, D string, A string or E string) and to provide friction against the pegs. The tapered pegs allow friction to be increased or decreased by the player applying appropriate pressure along the axis of the peg while turning it.|$|E

2500|$|Sandwich bread (also {{referred}} to as sandwich loaf) is bread that is prepared specifically {{to be used for}} the preparation of sandwiches.

Sandwich bread may be formulated to slice easily, cleanly or uniformly, and may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> crumb (the soft, inner part of bread) and a light texture. Sandwich bread may be designed to have a balanced proportion of crumb and crust, whereby the bread holds and supports fillings in place and reduces drips and messiness. Some may be designed to not become crumbly, hardened, dried or have too squishy a texture. Sandwich bread can refer to cross-sectionally square, sliced white and wheat bread, which has been described as [...] "perfectly designed for holding square luncheon meat". The bread used for preparing finger sandwiches is sometimes {{referred to}} as sandwich bread. Pan de mie is a sandwich loaf. Some sandwich breads are designed for use in the creation of specific types of sandwiches, such as the submarine sandwich.
