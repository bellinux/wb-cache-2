5000|$|The {{typology}} {{consisting of}} these three dictionaries is important {{for a number of}} reasons.

40|$|The {{present study}} wishes to {{illustrate}} the types of scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>dictionaries</b> produced in France over the centuries. The description of some scientific and technical dictionaries/glossaries affords an understanding of their diversity, which culminates in Diderot and D’Alembert’s Encyclopédie. The relationships between specialist knowledge and lexicographical description are illustrated through the dictionaries and glossaries, which are the repository of many applied sciences and technologies (e. g. Medieval Lapidaries, veritable sources of specialist nomenclatures; the glossary {{at the end of}} Bernard Palissy’s 1580 Treatises; scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>dictionaries</b> compiled by Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-century intellectuals, for example, Thomas Corneille’s important collection of terms, compiled in 1694, and Henry-Gabriel Duchesne’s 1776 Dictionnaire de L’industrie). This historical approach evidences two different modes of term collection: on the one hand, term collections were elaborated on the basis of specialist treatises and works; on the other hand, scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>dictionaries</b> were built on the basis of oral and written data, in order to fix the definition of concepts in the subject field at hand. This study wishes to demonstrate that every specialist lexicographical work, involving distinctive choices in terms of macro- and microstructure, is born and developed on the basis of precise specialist communication needs...|$|R

40|$|Many <b>technical</b> <b>dictionaries</b> {{take the}} form of glossaries which only lemmatize a source and target word without {{presenting}} any additional information about terms. While examples of use are frequent in general language dictionaries, they are rare in technical ones. Some lexicographers even share the opinion that {{there is no need to}} include examples in a <b>technical</b> <b>dictionary</b> because terms are generally monosemous and do not present any lexical problems. Using examples taken from the fields of garment and traffic engineering, this article is intended to show that many contrastive differences exist between Slovene and English terms from these fields. They should be included into dictionary articles to support the intended uses of a dictionary. A well composed dictionary article will help a professional user, especially a student, to formulate correct native and foreign language sentences...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} common types of {{specialized}} dictionary is what is often referred to in English as a <b>technical</b> <b>dictionary</b> and in German as a Fachwörterbuch. These dictionaries cover the terminology of a particular subject field or discipline. As described in Nielsen (1994), dictionaries of this type can be classified in various ways. A dictionary that covers more than one subject field is called a multi-field dictionary; one that covers one subject field is called a single-field dictionary; and one that covers a limited part of a subject field is called a sub-field <b>dictionary.</b> A <b>technical</b> <b>dictionary</b> that attempts to cover as much of the relevant terminology as possible is called a maximizing dictionary, whereas one that attempts to cover only a limited part of the relevant terminology is called a minimizing dictionary.|$|R

40|$|Language {{for special}} {{purposes}} ("LSP") is {{a variety of}} standard language, whose primary objective is exchange of information among specialists (speakers {{of one or more}} languages). Among other things, the LSP speciality consists of lexical units, so-called technical vocabulary, included in <b>technical</b> <b>dictionaries.</b> This thesis deals with issues regarding the creation of a German-Czech Dictionary of Aerial Terms, a multilingual <b>technical</b> <b>dictionary,</b> which is primarily designed for translators, interpreters, students and readers of popular science texts and easier LSP literature. The core of the dictionary consists of vocabulary from the area of aircraft construction and types of airplanes, aircraft engine, equipment and emergency devices. By comparing concept systems from subareas of both languages, an essential analysis regarding questions in the fields of synonymy and equivalence was accomplished, and 500 vocabulary items with linguistic as well as encyclopaedic information were compiled. These terms will now be subjected to lexicographic and technical correction...|$|R

50|$|In their modern form, encyclopedias {{consist of}} alphabetized {{articles}} written by teams of specialists. This format {{was developed in}} the 18th century by expanding the <b>technical</b> <b>dictionary</b> to include non-technical topics. The Encyclopédie (1751-1772), edited by Diderot and D'Alembert, was a model for many later works. Like Renaissance encyclopedists, Diderot worried about the possible destruction of civilization and selected knowledge he hoped would survive.|$|R
