The results showed that veterinary practitioners were not ignorant of the hazardous status of many of their wastes and were aware of the legislation governing waste management in Ireland. Veterinary practices were successfully managing municipal waste streams with many of them recycling certain waste streams. Veterinary cadavers were disposed of through a pet cremation company, returned to the client for burial or sent for rendering to a rendering plant.

40|$|<b>Clinical</b> <b>waste</b> poses serious {{threats and}} hazards to human health. <b>Clinical</b> <b>waste,</b> which is {{categorized}} as a scheduled waste in Malaysia, {{has been increasing}} over the years. Thus, proper <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> management is important as improper <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> handling has led to many incidents involving handlers over the years (Arab et al., 2008). However, research on hazard and risk assessment for <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> management has been very limited, {{and there is a}} serious dearth of information for risk control planning. This project seeks to document the hazards found during <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> collection and disposal practices in a healthcare establishment and hazards involving the operators at a <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> treatment incinerator.

The {{study was conducted to}} evaluate <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> management practices and to determine the amount of waste generated in five purposively selected healthcare facilities in Gaborone City Council. The surveyed healthcare facilities were of different size, specialization and category and included a referral hospital, two clinics and two health posts. To examine <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> management practices the study employed a range of methods including questionnaire survey which targeted 105 stratified randomly selected healthcare workers and ancillary staff, formal interviews with facility managers, field observations and literature reviews. Compliance with the Botswana <b>Clinical</b> <b>Waste</b> Management Code of Practice, 1996 and Waste Management Act, 1998 and other related documents were used as standards to assess <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> management practices. The waste management practices were analysed for a week in each healthcare facility to capture the daily management practices. The generated <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> was weighed to compute the generation rates and was followed through the various management practices to the final disposal. Findings of the study revealed that <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> generation rates were: 0. 75 kg/patient/day for Princess Marina Hospital and 0. 1 - 0. 3 kg/patient/day for clinics and health posts. Numerous aspects of <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> management were found to comply with the expected rules and standards at Princess Marina Hospital, but the clinics and health posts had less appropriate practices. <b>Clinical</b> <b>waste</b> generated at Princess Marina Hospital is quantified in reliable records and dedicated Infectious Control Officers are responsible for monitoring the {{management of}} <b>clinical</b> <b>waste.</b> The study revealed that clinics and health posts do not quantify <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> and there are no officers responsible for monitoring <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> and there are no documents for monitoring the management of <b>clinical</b> <b>waste.</b> The main treatment method of <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> for the surveyed healthcare facilities is incineration and it is being done properly.

40|$|Market-based {{instruments}} such {{as environmental}} taxes and tradable permit systems {{may be an}} attractive alternative to traditional control-and-command regulation where appropriate, as they allow the polluter the flexibility to comply in a cost-effective manner.

This study examines the possibilities of using a tradable permit system based on the PRN system, but without its legislative backing, in the management of <b>clinical</b> <b>waste.</b> Through a number of interviews with key players in the healthcare, waste management and reprocessing sectors, it aims to assess the feasibility of recycling <b>clinical</b> <b>waste,</b> which has been sterilised by microwave or heat treatment, and of creating an end market for products made from the recyclate. The discussion focuses on issues of segregation of and public perception towards the sterilised waste and explores the influence of these issues on the viability of a tradable permit system for <b>clinical</b> <b>waste.</b> Two approaches of applying a tradable permit system to the recycling of <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> are considered, one involving a tight relationship between <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> management company and the hospital trust, the other adding the participation of reprocessors to create an open market scenario. The absence of legislative targets for <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> management and the uncertainty of an end market for the recyclate necessitate incentivisation of such a system possibly through a government fund, which may undermine the critical factor of reducing the cost of compliance inherent to a tradable permit system.

First, the FACS is defined in terms of omega algebra, giving the omega algebra of FACS. Next, the semigroup of omega algebra of FACS is constructed using the omega algebra of FACS. The membership value of fuzzy edge connectivity is also determined to complete the definition of the omega algebra of FACS.
