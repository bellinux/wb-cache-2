40|$|This {{graduation}} thesis {{presents the}} method of deep soil mixing, its usage, execution possibilities, and its suitability for the soft soil of the Port of Koper. It further on specifies various types of this method’s usage, gives the comparison to other methods, and describes the complete process of its incorporation to the soft soil of the Port of Koper. As this method has never been applied in Slovenia, the present thesis also gives some specific examples of its usage abroad. Based on previously executed field and laboratory research, we have performed computer simulations of various modes of deep soil mixing which could be applied in the <b>foundation</b> <b>ground</b> beneath the reservoir and coal depot of the Port of Koper. In addition to that, this work explains {{the functioning of the}} program Plaxis 2 D under different circumstances, and shows the influence of soil treatment on deformations and on load capacity of <b>foundation</b> <b>ground.</b> The research has shown that {{the method of}} deep soil mixing is suitable for the port ground, especially if deep foundation with columns is applied. With the help of recommendations and price estimates of foreign companies, the indicative value of this specific type of stabilisation has been calculated for the ground beneath the reservoir and embankment of the Port of Koper...|$|E

30|$|The vehicle {{passage on}} {{irregular}} road pavement surfaces generates the oscillation {{of the vehicle}} mass, with a consequent increase of the load applied on the pavement. The load which a vehicle axle transfers on the pavement surface is not constant in time and space, but is variable in function of several factors such as: vehicle mass, speed, suspension type, road surface irregularities, etc. It {{is clear that the}} produced dynamic force is responsible for the generation of vibrations in road pavement. These vibrations are diffused through the <b>foundation</b> <b>ground,</b> and then to adjacent buildings.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake, {{which had}} a {{magnitude}} of 9. 0, many soil-made infrastructures, such as river dikes, road embankments, railway foundations and coastal dikes, were damaged. The river dikes and their related structures were damaged at 2115 sites throughout the Tohoku and Kanto areas, including Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima, Ibaraki and Saitama Prefectures, {{as well as the}} Tokyo Metropolitan District. In {{the first part of the}} present paper, the main patterns of the damaged river embankments are presented and reviewed based on the in situ research by the authors, MLIT (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) and JICE (Japan Institute of Construction Engineering). The main causes of the damage were (1) liquefaction of the <b>foundation</b> <b>ground,</b> (2) liquefaction of the soil in the river embankments due to the water-saturated region above the ground level, and (3) the long duration of the earthquake, the enormity of fault zone and the magnitude of the quake. In the second part of the paper, we analyze model river embankments on a <b>foundation</b> <b>ground</b> with various soil profiles, including a clayey soil layer and various ground water tables, using a dynamic liquefaction analysis method. From the analysis results, we find the effects of the soil profiles and the duration time of the earthquake motion on the deformation behavior of the river embankments. The results are consistent with those of the investigation of the features of the deformation and the failure of the embankments due to the 2011 off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake...|$|E
