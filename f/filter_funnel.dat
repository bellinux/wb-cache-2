50|$|A <b>filter</b> <b>funnel</b> is a {{laboratory}} funnel used for separating solids from liquids via the laboratory process of filtering.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{filtration}} techniques {{depending on the}} desired outcome namely, hot, cold and vacuum filtration. Some of the major purposes of getting a desired outcome are, {{for the removal of}} impurities from a mixture or, for the isolation of solids from a mixture.Hot filtration method is mainly used to separate solids from a hot solution. This is done in order to prevent crystal formation in the <b>filter</b> <b>funnel</b> and other apparatuses that comes in contact with the solution. As a result, the apparatus and the solution used are heated in order to prevent the rapid decrease in temperature which in turn, would lead to the crystallization of the solids in the funnel and hinder the filtration process.One of the most important measure to prevent the formation of crystals in the funnel and to undergo effective hot filtration is the use stemless <b>filter</b> <b>funnel.</b> Due to the absence of stem in the <b>filter</b> <b>funnel,</b> there is a decrease in the surface area of contact between the solution and the stem of the <b>filter</b> <b>funnel,</b> hence preventing re-crystallization of solid in the funnel, adversely effecting filtration process.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>funnels</b> have a neck of a thin {{capillary}} tube and ribs which increase the filter-papers' effectiveness and thus accelerate {{the process of}} filtering.|$|R
50|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>funnels</b> vary in size {{depending}} on the volume of suspension required to be filtered. They are usually constructed out of plastic, except where the filtering of certain solvents {{requires the use of}} glass.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{laboratory}} {{drying rack}} {{can be used}} to drain other types of laboratory glassware as well. For instance, in terms of funnel, it is used to dry up separating funnel, dropping funnel, <b>filter</b> <b>funnel,</b> and Thistle funnel.|$|E
50|$|One way {{to achieve}} this is to heat a conical flask {{containing}} {{a small amount of}} clean solvent on a hot plate. A <b>filter</b> <b>funnel</b> is rested on the mouth, and hot solvent vapors keep the stem warm. Jacketed filter funnels may also be used. The filter paper is preferably fluted, rather than folded into a quarter; this allows quicker filtration, thus less opportunity for the desired compound to cool and crystallize from the solution.|$|E
50|$|The {{last two}} {{attributes}} of Erlenmeyer flasks make them especially appropriate for recrystallization. The sample to be purified is heated to a boil, and sufficient solvent is added for complete dissolution. The receiving flask {{is filled with}} a small amount of solvent, and heated to a boil. The hot solution is filtered through a fluted filter paper into the receiving flask. Hot vapors from the boiling solvent keep the <b>filter</b> <b>funnel</b> warm, avoiding the premature crystallization.|$|E

40|$|The most usual {{method of}} {{preparing}} orientated clay specimens for X-ray analysis using a powder diffractometer, is to pipette a clay suspension onto a glass slide and {{allow it to}} dry. However, Gibbs (1965) and other workers have shown that this method plus several other preparation techniques, though reasonably precise, do lead to large inaccuracies in estimating the relative amounts of each clay mineral in a clay mixture. The principle cause of these inaccuracies i the segregation of the various clay minerals due to their different settling rates as they settle through an aqueous medium. The effect is particularly noticeable where montmorillonite is present with other clay minerals. Gibbs (1965) recommended that a smear mount or suction-onto-ceramic tile method should be used to produce well-orientated clay samples with minimal segregation effects. Suction-onto-ceramic tile methods involve filtering a clay suspension under suction through a ceramic medium so that the clay material is deposited on the ceramic.

A spectacular evolutionary achievement allowed the aphid to produce carotenoids obviously by lateral transfer of genes from fungi. We have recently documented that these molecules {{are involved in}} photo conditioning of metabolism such ATP synthesis in this insect model. The carotenoid synthesis in aphid was directly determined in living insects without extraction procedure by Raman imaging technique and the analysis was compared between insects raised in distinct environments. In contrast with the Raman spectrum that provides information on molecular motifs recognition (conjugated double bonds) but does not discriminate between isomers and ester forms, the mass spectrometry technology allowed us to analyze finely the variations in carotenoid composition. In parallel to these spectral analysis and chemistry determination, series of dosage of ATP were performed in order to correlate carotenoid synthesis and metabolism in aphid. ### Introduction Carotenoids are constituted of five joined isoprenoid units. These highly unsaturated and lipophilic molecules are very unstable, due to their susceptibility to isomerize and/or to oxidize rapidly during the analytical procedures. Thus, precautionary measures to avoid formation of artifacts and quantitative losses should be standard practice in the laboratory. Therefore, the major focus should be to complete the analysis within the shortest timing, to avoid reaction with oxygen and acids, to protect samples from light and high temperature. The use of high purity solvents that are free from harmful impurities is a strong recommendation (Rodriguez-Amaya, 2001). Oxygen, especially in combination with light and heat, is highly destructive for carotenoid molecules. Exposure to sunlight and/or ultraviolet light induces trans/cis photoisomerization and photo-cleavage of carotenoids. Thus, the experimental work must be done under red light and/or in dark. The frequent errors and drawbacks commonly associated with the extraction, identification and quantification of carotenoids are carefully pinpointed in the Procedures in the next section. To allow {{the reliability of the}} results, each analysis was performed in triplicate. More precisely, the following points should be considered: - The amount of extracted matrix must be representative of the biological material. - Before extraction, the matrix is stored at - 80 °C but not the extract which is very sensible to oxidation (when the extracted samples are thawed/frozen repeatedly). - The efficiency of extraction should be complete (see Troubleshooting section). - The amount of loss during the different steps of extraction should be reduced by cautious handling of samples. - The chromatographic separation must be adapted to the specific carotenoid distribution. - The mass spectrometry data and literature information should be combined to limit the failure of identification. In parallel with this analytical procedure aimed to identify the repertoire of the carotenoid family, a direct molecular imaging is performed using the Raman imaging spectrometry and living animals without previous extraction. Although this does not allow us to identify specifically each isomer of the carotenoid repertoire, a global quantification can be done based on common molecular motifs generating specific Raman profiles. This procedure is non-destructive and allows researchers to visualize the molecules of interest in their cellular and/or organ context. ### Reagents All solvents were of HPLC grade, purchased from Carlo Erba (Val de Reuil, France) or Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). ATP dosage was performed with the kit FLASC purchased from Sigma Aldrich, based on quantification of emitted visible light proportional to the concentration of ATP in the reaction medium. List of molecules and organic solvents used for the mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS) : 1. Ethanol RPE-ACS (Carlo Erba, cat. n° 4146312) - Methanol RPE-ACS (Carlo Erba, cat. n° 414816) - Hexane RPE-ACS (Carlo Erba, cat. n° 446903) - Dichloromethane RS HPLC stabilized with ethanol (Carlo Erba, cat. n° 412662) - Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (Carlo Erba, cat. n° 432032) - Ammonium acetate RPE-ACS (Carlo Erba, cat. n° 418776) - Magnesium carbonate RPE (MgCO 3) (Carlo Erba, cat. n° 459285) - Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (Aldrich, cat. n° B 1378) - Sodium chloride ≥ 99. 8 % (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. n° 31434) - Anhydrous sulphate sodium ≥ 99. 0 % (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. n° 31481) - β-carotene standard ≥ 98 % (Extrasynthese, cat. n° 0303 S) ### Equipment For mass spectrometry analysis: 1. Pipetman (Gilson, P- 20, P- 200, P- 1000) and pipette tips - <b>Filter</b> <b>funnel</b> porosity n° 2 (vol. 50 mL) - Glass cotton - Separatory funnel (vol. 100 mL) - Rotary evaporator (T°C bath = 40 °C) - HPLC apparatus coupled with a photodiode array detector (UV-visible) - HPLC apparatus coupled with a LCQ mass spectrometer fitted with an electrospray interface - C 30 column (250 X 4. 6 mm, 5 µm particle size) (YMC EUROP, GmbH). For Raman imaging analysis, the equipment was a spectrophotometer Labram HR 800 Horiba Jobin-Yvon. An ion laser beam was focused on the immobilized aphids (legs were cut or alternatively fixed with glue) on a glass slide by using a 100 x objective (NA 0. 9) and/or a 50 x LWD objective (NA= 0. 45) depending on the depth of the analysis of the biological sample. Raman back scattered light is collected by the same objectives. Then, we estimated the analyzed area to about 1 μm square with a 100 x objective and about 10 μm square with a 50 x objective. ### Procedure ** 1) Mass spectrometry analysis**. The β-carotene standard amount (Extrasynthese, cat n° 0303 S) is very low (~ 1 mg). To overcome these limitations, the concentration of the initial solution was determined by measuring its specific absorbance in hexane solution at 451 nm and using the extinction coefficient of β-carotene (ε 1 %) in hexane (= 2592). The successive dilutions of the initial solution were then prepared in hexane and injected into HPLC. The β-carotene chromatographic profiles were used to standardize the concentrations. The initial β-carotene solution was kept in amber vial under nitrogen atmosphere at - 80 °C for a maximum of one week. - CRITICAL STEP 1 : For each carotenoid analysis, one gram of aphids was hand-milled using liquid nitrogen. Aphids were weighed before milling and then the resulting powder was carefully recovered. We notice that the water condensation on the aphid cuticle after defrosting tends to bias the weighing. - CRITICAL STEP 2 : Carotenoids are light sensible. Consequently all the extractions and standard solution preparations are performed under red-light. Furthermore, these compounds being easily oxidized, the extracts are injected immediately into HPLC column. - CRITICAL STEP 3 : Carotenoid extracts dissolved in dichloromethane / [MTBE/methanol], v/v) (see below: Step S 9) were not filtrated before HPLC analysis. The solvent mixture is extremely volatile and filtration would considerably reduce the volume of extract. - CRITICAL STEP 4 : Carotenoids are also highly heat sensitive. The temperature along the full process and particularly the concentration step in the water bath should not exceed 40 °C. - CRITICAL STEP 5 : Carotenoids being easily oxidized particularly when extracted out of the matrix, we advice to keep these molecules under their native form in insects stored at - 80 °C instead of freezing the extract. *GENERAL EXTRACTION AND ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE*. The procedure was adapted from the article published by Taungbodhitham et al. (1998), Dhuique-Mayer et al. (2005) and Mertz et al. (2010). Each analysis was made in triplicate. The major points of carotenoid analysis are the sampling and sample preparation, extraction, partition/solubilization in appropriate solvents depending on their polar/apolar properties, washing, evaporation of solvents, chromatographic separation, and finally {{at the end of this}} process, identification and quantification of the carotenoid compounds. * 1 st Step: extraction and solvent preparation*. - Prepare 15 mL of solvent A: ethanol (20 mL) /hexane (15 mL) containing 35 mg of BHT as antioxidant. - Prepare 80 mL of 10 % sodium chloride. * 2 nd Step: extraction and purification steps*. This entire step was conducted under red light until transfer in an amber vial. Figure 1 presents the main steps of this procedure. - S 1 : weight 1 g of aphids (balance precision ± 0. 01 mg). - S 2 : carefully milled the aphids in a mortar pestle with liquid nitrogen (very low T°C breaks easily the cuticle of the insects). - S 3 : in a 50 mL beaker, add 15 mL of solvent A and 80 mg of MgCO 3 to neutralize the acidity of the mixture and stir for 5 min. - S 4 : filtrate the mixture on a <b>filter</b> <b>funnel</b> n° 2 and wash the precipitate successively with 15 mL of solvent A, 15 mL of ethanol, then with 15 mL of hexane to recover most of lipophilic compounds. - S 5 : transfer the solvent mixture in a separatory funnel and washed: - S 5 - 1 : once with 40 mL of 10 % sodium chloride (salt enhances the ionic strength of the solution. The hydrophilic compounds are concentrated in the water phase). - S 5 - 2 : twice with 40 mL of distilled water to rinse the eventual salty traces. - S 6 : recover the hexanic phase in a beaker. - S 7 : dry the phase with 1 g of sodium sulphate and filtrate on a cotton glass in a 100 mL conical ball. - S 8 : evaporate the dried organic phase using a rotavapor with a T°C of the water bath not exceeding 40 °C. - S 9 : the residue is recovered with 250 µL of dichloromethane and 250 µL of MTBE/methanol (80 : 20, v/v). These solvents being very volatile, it is important to pipette immediately in an amber vial. - S 10 : the extract is injected quickly on HPLC for analysis purpose. *HPLC-MS ANALYSIS OF CAROTENOIDS*. - Carotenoids separation with a C 30 column (250 X 4. 6 mm, 5 µm particle size). - Gradient solvent program is presented Table 1. Injection volume: 10 µL, UV-vis. Detection: 250 - 600 nm. Acetate ammonium (20 mM) was added in solvent A and B to favor ionization of the molecules in the ESI chamber. - In order to get simultaneously UV-visible and MS data, after passing through the flow cell of the diode array detector, the column eluate was split and 0. 5 ml was directed to the ion trap of the LCQ mass spectrometer. - MS experiments in (+) ion mode, scan range: 100 – 2000 amu, scan rate: 1 scan/s and temperature for dissolving: 250 °C. *HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY QUANTIFICATION OF CAROTENOIDS*. - Column and gradient conditions (Table 1, below) were the same as used in mass spectrometry analysis. Ammonium acetate was not added. - Injection volume: 20 µL, absorbance followed at 450 nm. - All carotenoids concentrations are expressed in β-carotene equivalent (standard solutions injected at 450 nm). These data are summarized in figure 1. ** 2) Raman imaging spectrometry**. Raman spectrometry provides a fingerprint of molecules specific of its global structure and/or some of its motifs (Roman et al. (2010). The intensity of the peaks is proportional to the quantity of molecules which generate them and can be determined in cell context without destructive extraction process. Raman imaging spectrometry can be also used for a spatial visualization of molecules in tissue allowing the analysis of molecular dynamics. Briefly, υ(C=C) 1500 – 1900 cm- 1 and υ(C≅C) 2100 – 2250 cm- 1 and υ(C−Η) 2800 – 3000 cm- 1 give strong Raman signal. Three peaks specify carotenoid molecules in Raman analysis: C-CH 3 (1000 cm- 1), C-C (1150 cm- 1), C=C(1500 cm- 1). Different ratios were determined: the ratio C-C/C=C; C=C (torulene/carotene); C-C / C=C; C-CH 3 / ½ (C-C + C=C;); C-CH 3 /C-C and C-CH 3 /C=C. Considering that the Raman peaks result from inelastic scattering involving vibrational levels of molecules, the baseline is related to radiative relaxation processes giving rise to fluorescence. The latter phenomenon strongly depends on the excitation wavelength and the interaction of molecules with its environment (Figure 3). ** 3) ATP dosage of individual aphid extract in a complex population**. The dosage was conducted according to the recommendation of the company and is based on the visible light production obtained with an equal amount of protein in tested samples (Figure 4). ** 4) Maintenance and propagation of aphids: selection of aphid variants synthesizing carotenoid molecules**. The pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Homoptera order, Aphididae family) are raised on the Vicia faba plant. Aphids were maintained in cages in a Sayo incubator at about 22 ˚C ± 3 ˚C and/or at 8 °C ± 1 °C, humidity 60 % and with a photoperiodicity of 16 / 8 hours light/dark. Three colored phenotypes are the orange, the white and the green. Basically the white phenotype emerged when the plants are declining and food resources are rare. The orange phenotype is dominant in optimal temperature and food resources. Finally the green phenotype was selected over 5 months by placing 10 orange adults each day at 8 °C ± 1 °C. The orange phenotype was not viable in these conditions (orange larvae died at the stage 3 or 4), but the selected green variant turned out to be robust at this temperature. Placing back the green variant at room temperature results in the fast fading of the green pigment in each individual and its disappearance in approximately two days (aphids become orange again). ### Timing - Mass spectrum analysis: two days work. - Raman analysis: about one minute for single point analysis and a few hours for mapping. - ATP dosage: few hours. ### References 1.

Peptides are synthesized from their carboxyl termini using Fmoc-amino acid derivatives. After completion of the synthesis and cleavage of all side-chain-protecting groups, the peptide array on the membrane is incubated with the potential interaction partners to identify their target sequences. ### MATERIALS **Reagents** *Buffer salts and ingredients should be of biochemical grade. * 1. Acetic acid - Acetylation mix - Acid aluminum oxide - Alkaline phosphatase (AP) -conjugated detection antibodies - AP-conjugated streptavidin - Bromophenol blue indicator stock solution - Chemiluminescence detection kit (e. g., ECL western blotting detection reagents; Amersham Biosciences) (optional; see Step 31) - Citrate-buffered saline (CBS) - Color developing solution (CDS) - Deprotection mix - DIC (N,N′-Diisopropylcarbodiimide), ≥ 98 % - DMF - *DMF should be free of contaminating amines and thus of the highest affordable purity (e. g., peptide synthesis grade from Biosolve BV). Purity can be checked by adding 10 μl of bromophenol blue indicator stock solution to 1 ml of DMF. If the resulting color is yellow, the batch can be used without further purification. Be sure to check each new batch. * - Ethanol, technical grade (95 %) (optional; see Step 12) - Fmoc-AA stock solutions - *Fmoc-amino acid (Fmoc-AA) derivatives of all 20 L-amino acids as well as β-alanine and other special amino acid derivatives are available from several suppliers at sufficient quality (Novabiochem/Merck Biosciences or Bachem). The side-chain-protecting groups should be Cys(Acm) or Cys(Trt), Asp(OtBu), Glu(OtBu), His(Trt), Lys(Boc), Asn(Trt), Gln(Trt), Arg(Pmc), Ser(tBu), Thr(tBu), Trp(Boc), and Tyr(tBu). HOBt-esters of these amino acid derivatives must be prepared in NMP for use throughout in spotting reactions. Dissolve 1 mmol of each Fmoc-AA in 5 ml of NMP containing 0. 25 M HOBt to give 0. 2 M Fmoc-AA stock solutions. These are kept in 10 -ml plastic tubes that are closed tightly, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at - 70 °C. For use in coupling reactions with amino acid mixtures at randomized positions in the peptide sequences, combine equal aliquots of Fmoc-AA stock solutions for the respective amino acids to be incorporated, dilute with twofold volume of NMP to give 66 mM solutions, and store as described above*. - Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated detection antibodies - N-Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), anhydrous (ISOCHEM) - *Store tightly closed at room temperature in a dry place*. - Immun-Star Chemiluminescent Kit (No. 170 - 5018, Bio-Rad) - Membrane blocking solution (MBS) - Methanol, technical grade (95 %) (optional; see Step 12) - 1 -Methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP) - *For use {{in the preparation of}} Fmoc-AA stock solutions, NMP should be of the highest purity available. Amine contamination can be checked by adding 10 μl of bromophenol blue indicator stock solution to 1 ml of NMP. If the resulting color is yellow, the NMP can be used without further purification. Most commercial products, however, are not acceptable. To purify an unsuitable batch, treat 1 liter of NMP with 100 g of acid aluminum oxide overnight under constant vigorous shaking at room temperature. The next day, retest the purity; a 1 -ml aliquot should give a yellow BPB test. Filter the slurry through a bed of dry silica gel (for flash chromatography, Mallinckrodt Baker BV) in a closed glass <b>filter</b> <b>funnel</b> (slight nitrogen pressure can speed up the process, but is not necessary). Divide the clear liquid into 100 -ml portions and store tightly closed at - 20 °C*. - Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) - Piperidine mix - Special chemical derivatives - *Free thiol functions of cysteine may be problematic because of post-synthetic uncontrolled oxidation. To avoid this, Cys may be replaced by Ser, Ala, or α-aminobutyric acid (Abu). Alternatively, choose the hydrophilic Cys(Acm) and leave protected. For the simultaneous preparation of peptides of different size with free amino termini, couple their terminal amino acid residues as αN-Boc derivatives so that they will not become acetylated during the normal elongation cycle. Boc is then removed during the final side-chain de-protection procedure*. - Stripping mix A (SM-A) - Stripping mix B (SM-B) - Transfer buffer for western blotting - Tris-buffered saline (TBS) without phenol red - T-TBS (TBS buffer plus 0. 05 % Tween 20) - Tween 20 ### Equipment *All equipment used for membrane synthesis and regeneration should be resistant to organic solvents. Glassware or polypropyleneware should be exclusively used in all steps involving organic solvents. Standard micropipetting tips (Gilson, Eppendorf) can be employed. * 1. 3 MM paper (Whatman) - Blotting apparatus (e. g., Biometra-Fast-Blot) - Digital recording device - *Scanner or CCD camera for documentation of signal patterns on membranes plus analysis software for quantification of signals. In case of radioactive or chemiluminescence detection, autoradiography films can be used. * - Dispensers, adjustable from 5 ml to 50 ml for DMF and alcohol containers - Flat glass tray to hold at least one membrane - Flat reaction/washing troughs with a tightly closing lid made of chemically inert material (glass, Teflon, polypropylene) with dimensions slightly larger than the membranes used - Hair dryer, hand-held with cold-air function - Microfuge tubes, 1. 5 ml (e. g., Eppendorf, safe twist) and appropriate racks as reservoirs for amino acid solutions - Nitrocellulose membrane suitable for electro-transfer (e. g., Protan Nitrocellulose Transfer Membrane; Schleicher & Schuell) - Pencil (lead type H or 2 H) for marking membranes - Plastic bags and sealing device - Polystyrene plates (12 × 12 cm) with covers, as used in cell culture - Rocking platform - Sonication bath with temperature control - SPOT membranes: - *AC-S 01 type amino-PEGylated membranes (AIMS-Scientific-Products GmbH) are recommended and available from several suppliers (Hartmann Analytic GmbH; Rapp Polymere GmbH; Intavis AG). Ready-to-use membranes in an 8 × 12 format with 96 spots of βAla anchors are available from Sigma-Genosys*. - *The ASP 222 instrument requires a special format of membrane with perforations for the holder pins on the robot. These are available only from Intavis AG* - SPOT synthesis kit (Sigma-Genosys) - *Software for the generation of peptide lists and pipetting protocols is included in the Sigma-Genosys synthesis kit and the operation software of the spotting robot. A freeware package is also available from the authors (frank@gbf. de) *. - Spotting robot, model ASP 222, or MultiPep peptide synthesizer with spotting tray (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments AG) Previous Section ### METHOD *All volumes given below are for one standard AC-S 01 paper sheet of 8 × 12 cm and must be adjusted for more sheets, or other paper qualities and sizes. Unless otherwise stated, washes and incubation steps are carried out in sealed troughs at room temperature with gentle agitation on a rocking platform. Solvents and solutions are decanted after the time indicated. During incubations and washes, the troughs are closed with a lid*. **Stage 1 : Preparative Work** 1. Generate a list of peptides to be prepared. Multiple lists can be combined on a single membrane to fill up a complete array. The peptides can be separated after synthesis by simply cutting the membrane into appropriate sections. - *Cutting lines between sections can be marked out on the membrane in pencil*. - Select the appropriate array(s) for the chosen experiment according to number, spot size, and scale required. - *For manual spotting, use an 8 × 12 format (spot distance, 9 mm; spot volume, 0. 5 μl for array generation and 0. 7 μl for elongation cycles). An array of 17 rows with 25 spots each (spot distance 4 mm, volume 0. 1 μl for array generation and 0. 2 μl for elongation cycles) is recommended for the ASP 22 *. - Calculate the required volumes of Fmoc-AA solutions for each derivative and cycle. - *Remember that a triple coupling procedure may be necessary, and that each vial should contain a minimum of 50 μl. Consider, for example, a list of peptides that requires alanine for 26 peptides at cycle 1 on a 17 × 25 array. This cycle will require 26 (peptides) × 0. 2 (μl per elongation) × 3 (couplings) = 15. 6 μl of Fmoc-Ala stock solution. Therefore, you will take the minimum of 70 μl of stock solution for this vial. The SPOT software can perform this calculation*. - Label a set of 1. 5 -ml microfuge tubes with derivative and cycle code (e. g., A 1), and distribute the Fmoc-amino acid stock solutions according to the calculated volumes required. Snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at - 70 °C. **Stage 2 : Generation of the SPOT Array** 5. Mark each membrane used with a pencil label (e. g., a number or letter at the right bottom edge) for proper orientation and tracking throughout the synthesis process. For manual synthesis, mark the spot positions on the membranes with pencil dots, and place the membrane in the reaction trough. For automated synthesis, fix membranes on the platform of the spot robot. 6. Take a 100 -µl aliquot of the Fmoc-βAla stock from the freezer and bring it to room temperature. Add 1 μl of BPB stock and 4 μl of DIC. Mix, and leave for 30 minutes. Spot aliquots (0. 5 μl for 8 × 12 array, or 0. 1 μl for 17 × 25 array) of this solution on all positions of the chosen array configuration. Cover the membrane with glass plates, and allow the reaction to proceed for 60 minutes. - *For peptides longer than 20 -mers, reduce the loading of the spots by applying a mixture of the Fmoc-βAla stock and an N-acetyl-alanine stock (1 : 9). This will avoid molecular crowding*. 7. Wash each membrane twice in 20 ml of acetylation mix; once for 30 seconds, and once for 2 minutes. Incubate the membranes overnight in acetylation mix. 8. Wash each membrane in 20 ml of DMF (three times for 10 min each). 9. To remove Fmoc blocking groups, incubate the membrane for 5 min in 20 ml of piperidine mix. 10. Wash each membrane in 20 ml of DMF (four times for 10 min each). 11. Visualize the spots by incubating each membrane in 20 ml of DMF containing 1 % BPB indicator stock solution. - *Spots should be stained only light blue! If traces of remaining piperidine on the membranes turn the liquid dark blue, renew the staining solution and continue the staining*. 12. Wash each membrane in 20 ml of methanol or ethanol (two times for 10 min each). 13. Transfer the membranes to 3 MM paper folders, and dry them using cold air from a hair dryer. Store dried membranes in a sealed plastic bag at - 20 °C. **Stage 3 : Assembly of Peptides on SPOTs** 14. Take the membranes from Step 13 and, for manual synthesis, number the blue spot positions with a pencil (according to the peptide lists). Place the membranes in separate reaction troughs. For automated systems, fix the unmarked membranes on the platform of the synthesizer. If necessary, cutting lines should be marked in pencil. If bound protein is to be eluted from individual spot positions after probing, these should also be marked. 15. Take the appropriate set of Fmoc-amino acid stock aliquots for cycle 1 from the freezer, bring to room temperature, and activate by adding DIC (4 μl per 100 -μl vial; ~ 0. 25 M). Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature. For manual experiments, pipette aliquots of the Fmoc-amino acid solutions onto the appropriate spots on the membrane. For automated experiments, place the vials containing the activated Fmoc-AA solutions into the rack of the spotting robot, and start cycle 1. Leave for 15 minutes. Repeat the spotting twice, and allow the reaction to proceed for 2 hours (cover the membranes on the spotter with glass plates). - *Monitor the amino acid coupling reaction by inspection of the spot color change. Spots should turn yellow-green during this step. If some spots remain dark blue, additional applications of Fmoc-amino acid stock solution can be made*. - i. For the introduction of randomized X positions in the peptide sequences, take the appropriate Fmoc-AA-mix stock solution from the freezer, bring to room temperature, and activate by adding DIC (1. 5 μl per 100 μl-vial; ~ 0. 09 M). Incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. Perform spotting four times. 16. Wash each membrane twice with 20 ml of acetylation mix (once for 30 seconds, and twice for 2 min). Incubate the membranes in fresh acetylation mix for ~ 10 minutes (until all remaining blue color has disappeared). 17. Wash each membrane in 20 ml of DMF (three times for 2 min each). 18. Add 20 ml of piperidine mix, and incubate for 5 minutes. 19. Wash each membrane in 20 ml of DMF (at least six times). 20. Incubate membranes in 20 ml of DMF containing 1 % BPB bromophenol blue indicator stock solution. - *Again, the spots should be stained only light blue. If traces of remaining piperidine on the membranes turn the liquid dark blue, replace the solution and continue the staining. BPB staining is charge-specific. Therefore, it does not only bind to amino-terminal amino groups. The side chains and protecting groups of the amino acids in the peptide chain can strongly influence staining intensity. The visible color of the peptides depends on the overall charge and, therefore, on the individual amino acid sequence*. 21. Wash each membrane with 20 ml of methanol or ethanol (two times for 5 min each). 22. Transfer the membranes to 3 MM paper folders, and dry them using cold air from a hair dryer. 23. Repeat this procedure from Steps 15 to 23 for successive elongation cycles. **Stage 4 : Terminal Acetylation** *Synthetic peptides mimicking fragments of a longer continuous protein chain should be amino-terminally acetylated to avoid the production of an artificially charged terminus. To accomplish this, continue as follows after the final amino acid elongation cycle from the stage above:* 24. Incubate each membrane in 20 ml of acetylation mix for a minimum of 30 minutes (until all remaining blue color has disappeared). 25. Wash the membranes in 20 ml of DMF (three times for 2 min each), and then in 20 ml of alcohol (two times for 5 min each). 26. Transfer the membranes to 3 MM paper folders, and dry them using cold air from a hair dryer. **Stage 5 : Side-Chain De-protection** *After the peptide assembly is complete, all side-chain-protecting groups are removed from the peptides. Trifluoroacetic acid is extremely hazardous; the following procedure must be performed in a chemical fume hood*. 27. Prepare 40 ml of de-protection mix. 28. Place the dried membrane in the reaction trough, add de-protection mix, close the trough very tightly, and incubate overnight with gentle agitation. - *This harsh treatment is required for complete cleavage of protecting groups. Cellulose membranes less resistant than AC-S will not survive this treatment*. 29. Subject each membrane to the following series of washes: - i. 20 ml of DCM (four times for 5 min each) - ii. 20 ml of DMF (three times for 5 min each) - iii. 20 ml of alcohol (three times for 5 min each) - iv. 20 ml of acetic acid (1 M in H 2 O) (three times for 5 min each) - Wash each membrane with 20 ml of alcohol (three times). 30. Transfer the membranes to 3 MM paper folders, and dry them using cold air from a hair dryer. Store dried membranes in a sealed plastic bag at - 20 °C, or process further as described in the next section. **Stage 6 : Protein-Binding Assay** *This basic procedure has been optimized for use with AP-conjugated detection antibody and a color signal development. As mentioned above, horseradish peroxidase-labeled detection agents require the use of hydrogen peroxide, which gradually destroys the peptides on the array. More sensitive detection can be achieved with a chemiluminescent substrate of AP (e. g., Immun-Star). If such a substrate is used, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for Steps ix to xi of Method A. Alternatively, test proteins can be labeled prior to incubation with the peptide array by chemical biotinylation and subsequently detected using AP-conjugated streptavidin (under the same conditions as for AP secondary antibody). If fluorescent or radioactive labeled reagents are used, adapt Steps v to xi of Method A accordingly*. *IMPORTANT: If using Method A, prior to probing your protein with the peptide spots on the membrane, always do a “pre-run” in which you first apply this protocol while omitting Steps v and vi. This is necessary to control for unspecific signals from components of the detection process or remaining proteins from a previous experiment on the same membrane. However, in case the proteins are electro-transferred and detected on a secondary nitrocellulose membrane (Method B, below), this precaution does not apply*. 31. Perform protein-binding assay using either Method A or Method B. ***Method A*** - i. Place a single membrane in a polystyrene plate, and wet it with a few drops of methanol or ethanol. - *This is to enhance rehydration of any peptide spots that might be hydrophobic. The peptide locations should not be visible as white spots! If this happens, extend the alcohol treatment in a sonication bath at room temperature until spots have disappeared*. - ii. Wash the membrane in 10 ml of TBS (three times for 10 min each). - iii. Incubate overnight in 10 ml of MBS. - *The blocking conditions can be {{critical to the success of}} an experiment, and, depending on the protein of interest, it may be necessary to try several different blocking solutions to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. The following solutions represent increasingly stringent blocking conditions: (1) 2 % (w/v) skim milk powder in TBS; (2) 2 % (w/v) skim milk powder, 0. 2 % (v/v) Tween 20 in TBS; (3) MBS; (4) MBS with 50 % (v/v) horse serum. Blocking solution 3 is recommended for most applications*. - iv. Wash the membrane once in 10 ml of T-TBS for 10 minutes. - v. Incubate for 2 - 4 hours in the presence of probe antibody (or protein) diluted in 8 - 10 ml of MBS. - *For monoclonal antibodies, or pure proteins, use ~ 4 - 5 μg of purified antibody per milliliter of incubation volume. When using a polyclonal serum, we recommend a dilution of 1 : 100. It is not necessary to use a large volume of protein solution for the incubation. However, make sure that the membrane is completely covered throughout the incubation. To prevent drying out, use a lid, or seal the membrane in a plastic bag*. - vi. Wash the membrane three times in 10 ml of T-TBS (for 10 min each). - vii. Incubate for 1 - 2 hours with AP-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted in 10 ml of MBS. - viii. Wash the membrane two times in 10 ml of T-TBS (for 10 min each). - ix. Wash the membrane two times in 10 ml of CBS (for 10 min each). - x. Transfer the membrane to a flat glass tray and add 10 ml of CDS. Incubate without agitation until good signals are obtained. - For individual peptides on spots, this usually takes 10 - 30 minutes; peptide pools may require longer incubations (2 hr to overnight). - xi. Stop the reaction by washing the membrane twice in PBS. Keep the membrane wet, either in PBS or covered in plastic wrap. Store at 4 °C. - The picture of signals on the membrane can now be documented by photography or (better) be electronically digitized with a scanner. A high-quality electronic image can be used to quantify signal intensities. Avoid drying of the membrane at this stage. If the membrane dries out, proteins may denature and become difficult to remove. After successful documentation of signals by photography or electronic scanning, continue with membrane stripping (see Steps 32 - 35). ***Method B*** *If only weak binding of the test protein is anticipated, or if excessive background was observed in Method A, it may help to electro-transfer the bound test protein onto a secondary nitrocellulose membrane and repeat the detection procedure. Here, any detection system appropriate for nitrocellulose can be used (e. g., HRP conjugates), as the peptides will not be affected. * - i. Place a single membrane in a polystyrene plate, and wet it with a few drops of methanol or ethanol. - *This is to enhance rehydration of any peptide spots that might be hydrophobic. The peptide locations should not be visible as white spots! If this happens, extend the alcohol treatment in a sonication bath at room temperature until spots have disappeared*. - ii. Wash the membrane in 10 ml of TBS (three times for 10 min each). - iii.
