25|$|On October 6, 1978, Hanna {{sold the}} {{railroad}} to John Larkin, a businessman from Minneapolis who had organized a passenger excursion {{on the railroad}} earlier in the decade. He planned to return the railroad to profitability by reducing labor costs and entering the business of leasing boxcars to other railroads. Shortly thereafter, the leasing market collapsed. Additionally, with the Milwaukee Road going bankrupt in 1977, it planned to abandon its trackage in Michigan, consisting largely of a route between Ontonagon, Michigan, and Green Bay, Wisconsin. This plan would break the ELS's connections at Channing, as well as <b>end</b> <b>rail</b> service to shippers on the line. One of these shippers, Champion Paper, which operated a mill in Ontonagon, approached the ELS with a proposal for the railroad to buy the Milwaukee Road track to Ontonagon.|$|E
25|$|The North Shore Line {{was formed}} in 1916, when {{industrialist}} Samuel Insull acquired the Chicago and Milwaukee Electric Railway Company. During the Roaring Twenties the railroad underwent a period of expansion and modernization until the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought an end to Insull's electric utility empire. Despite subsequent financial woes, the North Shore Line survived the Great Depression and experienced record levels of passenger ridership during World War II. This change in fortunes {{would prove to be}} temporary however, and during the post-war era the railroad found itself faced with stiff competition from both the proliferation of the automobile and the modernization of commuter service on competitor railroads. After {{more than a decade of}} declines in both passenger ridership and profit, the company petitioned to <b>end</b> <b>rail</b> service in 1958, but faced several years of legal opposition from an organization of regular commuters. Despite efforts to save the railroad, the company was ultimately granted permission to end all rail service. The final trains reached their destinations in the early morning hours of January 22, 1963, and the North Shore Line became the final interurban railroad to undergo complete abandonment.|$|E

Work on this section had nearly finished at an expense of nearly 24 million Euro, when flooding in July 1999 destroyed much of the line. It took until spring 2002 to decide to rebuild the section. Further delays were caused by destructions on the line between Olbernhau and Flöha by severe flooding in August 2002.|$|E

50|$|In {{support of}} the Anzio landings, it was {{required}} to cut rail links north of Rome, and elsewhere on the east coast. To this <b>end,</b> <b>rail</b> lines around Terni and Orvieto were to be attacked by four men of Operation Thistledown; this was successful, but all the teams members were captured. Driftwood consisted of two four man teams intended to cut the lines between Urbino and Fabriano, and Ancona and Rimini. Their fate is unknown, but they were surmised to be drowned, or captured and executed. A reinforcement party (Baobab) was landed by sea on 30 January and successfully destroyed a bridge between Pesaro and Fano.|$|E

5000|$|In those days, railroads {{were often}} built in {{sections}} using different contractors and money sometimes ran {{out before the}} line was tied together. This happened to the [...] narrow gauge Cheraw and Chester. In 1879, it made it the 22 mi from Chester County to the Catawba River but did not cross it. On the other <b>end,</b> <b>rail</b> was laid from Cheraw to Pageland before the capital was exhausted in that direction. It operated for three years in these sections before being split. The Chester section was leased to the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad who built a wooden bridge across the Catawba and extended the track one mile (1.6 km) beyond Lancaster in 1883. It was then leased to the Richmond and Danville Railroad, which in turn went into receivership. Meanwhile, the line from Cheraw to Pageland became the Chesterfield and Lancaster Railroad but never extended any further.|$|E
50|$|In late 1973 the SAR {{banned the}} use of E type {{carriages}} on regular services, {{and when they were}} running they were restricted to 80 km/h (50 mph), and the VR matched this with a similar ban on Joint Stock through the VR system. This reduced the usefulness of the afflicted carriages, so in 1974, 6AE, 9AE, 10AE, 39AE, 40AE, 41AE, 42AE, 6BE, 7BE, 10BE and 42BE were condemned. 10AE, 6BE, 7BE and 10BE were scrapped at Newport Workshops in 1976, around the same time as 40AE and 42AE; the others at undetermined times and locations. 40AE had been sold in 1975, so its scrapping in 1976 is unusual. The frame and bogies from 39AE were eventually sold to West Coast Railway, then when that company folded in 2004 they were onsold. 42BE was held until 1975, then placed in the Mile <b>End</b> <b>Rail</b> Museum in South Australia. In 1988 it was moved {{with the rest of the}} rollingstock to the Port Dock Station Museum, now known as the National Railway Museum.|$|E

50|$|The {{passenger}} train service was never profitable and only lasted two years. Parts {{of the rail}} line then sat unused. In 1910, the Grand Trunk rebuilt the northern portion of the Yonge St. Loop for freight service. Trains ran along this line until the late 1960s when {{a small part of}} the right-of-way was expropriated to build the Spadina Expressway, now the Allen Road. This <b>ended</b> <b>rail</b> service east of Marlee Avenue, just before the Allen.|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, the rump 315th was {{transferred}} briefly to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding, {{then into the}} rear of Stalingrad Front on September 25, along with the rebuilding 87th Rifle Division, first to Kamyshin on the Volga and ultimately to the 10th Reserve Army, positioned 70 - 80km southwest of Kamyshin. In late October these divisions were officially subordinated to 62nd Army, but they remained on the east bank as a strategic reserve. As the planning for Operation Uranus progressed, its starting date was postponed several times, {{in part due to}} delays in making these two divisions completely operational. Gen. G.K. Zhukov sent a message to the STAVKA on November 11 notifying that he was postponing the offensive until the 15th in part because: [...] "The two rifle divisions (the 87th and 315th) assigned to Yeryomenko... have still not entrained because they have not received transport and horses up to this time... dispatch the 87th and 315th Rifle Divisions as rapidly as possible..." [...] In the <b>end,</b> <b>rail</b> and road transport remained inadequate and major bottlenecks existed throughout the buildup; when the offensive finally opened on November 19, the two divisions, which were supposed to be in Stalingrad by this time, were stranded at the railroad station at Borisoglebsk.|$|E
5000|$|To {{protect its}} {{investment}} and enable transportation, the Virginia General Assembly then incorporated and financed a new entity, the Blue Ridge Railroad, {{to accomplish the}} hard and expensive task of crossing the Blue Ridge mountain barrier to the west. Rather than attempting the more formidable Swift Run Gap, {{under the leadership of}} the great early civil engineer Claudius Crozet, the state-owned Blue Ridge Railroad built over the mountains at the next gap to the south, Rockfish Gap near Afton Mountain, using four tunnels, including the 4,263-foot Blue Ridge Tunnel {{at the top of the}} pass, then one of the longest tunnels in the world. The tunnel was 'holed-through' on Christmas Day, 1856, and was less than six inches off perfect alignment, as construction had proceeded from either <b>end.</b> <b>Rail</b> service didn't begin until April 1858, although temporary tracks over the top of the gap were in operation as early as 1854. Due to the extreme grade, the first train to cross over the mountain wrecked on its return journey eastwards the following day. The Blue Ridge Tunnel eliminated this grade. As a corporate entity, the Blue Ridge Railroad ceased to exist when the tunnels were completed, becoming part of the Virginia Central Railroad. (During the American Civil War, the tunnels were utilized as part of the so-called foot cavalry movements of the Confederate troops of General Stonewall Jackson).|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{improvements}} {{made to the}} train, however, patronage was not sufficient to retain the service, {{particularly in light of}} the region's improving roads and increased automobile traffic. The Rio Grande discontinued the Shavano on November 24, 1940, <b>ending</b> <b>rail</b> passenger service to Gunnison and leaving the San Juan Express as the railroad's last daily narrow-gauge passenger train. The train's old route over Marshall Pass was completely abandoned by the railroad in 1955; most of the route is now an automobile road.|$|R
40|$|There are {{two types}} of Insulated rail joints (IRJs) in the railway track: {{inserted}} and glued. The IRJs in the track are significant components in relation to integrity and safety of rail signalling operations. Because of low values of vertical bending rigidity of IRJs, cyclical dynamic wheel loading forces increase significantly at IRJs, thus accelerating material degradation and damage of their components such as <b>rail</b> <b>ends,</b> endposts, joint bars, etc. As a result, relatively free <b>rail</b> <b>ends</b> are created at IRJs that further amplify dynamic wheel load impacts. Only limited literature are available addressing the free <b>end</b> of <b>rail</b> effects at IRJs targeting stress distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} rail joints. To understand clearly the delamination process of inserted endpost IRJs and the damage of the endpost and <b>rail</b> <b>end</b> material, a thorough analysis targeting the modes of failure of both glued and inserted IRJs and subsequent damage of the railhead material is necessary to find ways to improve the joint’s life. In this paper, a 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) is carried out to assess damage when the endpost is either initially installed loosely (“inserted” rather than “glued”) in between the <b>ends</b> of the <b>rail</b> at the IRJ or becomes a loose fit due to plastic delamination of a glued joint, or when a gap is created between the rail and endpost due to pull-apart problems as the rails contract longitudinally in winter. Both 5 mm and 10 mm gaps (inserted endpost IRJs) are considered, using a peak vertical pressure load of 2500 MPa applied at one <b>rail</b> <b>end.</b> This peak load ensures a ratchetting failure mode of the <b>rail</b> <b>end</b> material. Plastic deformations and stress distributions in the vicinity of inserted IRJs are quantified using FEA data and compared with that of the glued IRJs (5 mm and 10 mm endpost thicknesses) to show the free <b>end</b> of <b>rail</b> effects. Residual stress and strain distributions indicate the damage of the railhead material. The progressive damage of the railhead material at the <b>rail</b> <b>ends</b> can be quantified by equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ). The free <b>end</b> of <b>rail</b> effects can be further illustrated by comparing PEEQ for inserted and glued IRJs. The railhead material of 5 mm and 10 mm inserted endpost IRJs is more sensitive to permanent deformation compared to that of the corresponding glued IRJs. Therefore, inserted IRJs pose an increased potential threat to rail operations in relation to damage of railhead and endpost materials and premature failure of IRJs...|$|R
50|$|After {{a series}} of reorganizations, the {{railroad}} along Pine Creek {{became a part of}} the New York Central Railroad and eventually Conrail. Freight and passenger service continued for many years. In 1988, Conrail <b>ended</b> <b>rail</b> service. The tracks were removed, and the first section of the Pine Creek Rail Trail opened in 1996. The trail opened in stages with the most recent section (from Ansonia to just north of Wellsboro) being completed in 2007. The trail is operated by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.|$|R
