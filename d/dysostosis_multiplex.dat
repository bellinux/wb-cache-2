A five-year old child with psychomotor development retardation, which started {{at his age}} of two, was presented in our study. Clinical examination showed big head with rough facial features, skeleton deformities and hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis <b>Dysostosis</b> epifisealis <b>multiplex</b> was also confirmed by the X-ray examination of skeleton. Karyotype: 46, XY. Mental retardation: IQ- 48. Clinically suspected mucopolysaccharidosis called for metabolic screening of first morning urine and the positive toluidine blue test result indicated the increased excretion of mucopolysaccharides. Further enzyme analyses of peripheral blood leucocytes confirmed the heparin sulphate sulphatase deficiency {{on the basis of}} which A (MPS III) Sanfilippo syndrome was defined. Our patient was born as a twin sibling. The other sibling is clinically healthy and of normal metabolic screening. It was not possible to define precisely the healthy heterozygote by testing the enzyme activities. A large number of mutations at various loci and big genetic heterogeneity of mucopolysaccharidoses made molecular diagnostics difficult. In the subsequent pregnancy, the mother was recommended prenatal diagnostics by enzyme analysis from the cultured chorionic villus.

Other clinical findings may include cardiac valve disease, reduced pulmonary function, hepatosplenomegaly, sinusitis, otitis media, hearing loss, sleep apnea, corneal clouding, carpal tunnel disease, and inguinal or umbilical hernia. Although intellectual deficit is generally absent in MPS VI, central nervous system findings may include cervical cord compression caused by cervical spinal instability, meningeal thickening and/or bony stenosis, communicating hydrocephalus, optic nerve atrophy and blindness. The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the ARSB gene, located in chromosome 5 (5 q 13 - 5 q 14). Over 130 ARSB mutations have been reported, causing absent or reduced arylsulfatase B (N-acetylgalactosamine 4 -sulfatase) activity and interrupted dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate degradation. Diagnosis generally requires evidence of clinical phenotype, arylsulfatase B enzyme activity < 10 % of the lower limit of normal in cultured fibroblasts or isolated leukocytes, and demonstration of a normal activity of a different sulfatase enzyme (to exclude multiple sulfatase deficiency). The finding of elevated urinary dermatan sulfate with the absence of heparan sulfate is supportive. In addition to multiple sulfatase deficiency, the differential diagnosis should also include other forms of MPS (MPS I, II IVA, VII), sialidosis and mucolipidosis.

One {{of the hallmarks of}} <b>dysostosis</b> <b>multiplex</b> in MPS I-H is hip dysplasia, which often requires surgical intervention. We sought to describe in detail the course of hip dysplasia in this group of patients, as assessed by radiographic analysis, and to identify potential outcome predictors. Longitudinal data were obtained from digitally scored pelvic radiographs of patients with MPS I-H using OrthoGon software for parameters including, but not limited to, the acetabular index, migration percentage, Smith ratio, and neck-shaft angle. Scoring was performed independently by two blinded observers. Additional information on genotype, enzyme replacement therapy pre-HSCT, donor chimerism, and enzyme activity post-HSCT were obtained. General trends and potential correlations were calculated with mixed-model statistics. Fifty-two patients (192 radiographs) were included in this analysis. Intraobserver and interobserver variation analysis showed an intraclass correlation coefficient ranging from 0. 78 to 1. 00. Among the twenty-one patients with follow-up beyond the age of five years, the acetabular index was in the range of severe hip dysplasia in up to 86 % of the patients. Severe coxa valga was seen in 91 % of the patients. Lateral and superior femoral displacement were highly prevalent, with the migration percentage outside the reference range in up to 96 % of the patients. Finally, anterior pelvic tilt increased with age (p = 0. 001). No correlations were identified between clinical parameters and radiographic findings. Our study shows that progressive acetabular dysplasia as well as coxa valga and hip displacement are highly prevalent and progressive over time {{in patients with}} MPS I-H, despite successful HSCT.

40|$|Among {{the many}} new {{diseases}} {{which have been}} described during the present century, there are a remarkable number of disea§es of the osseous system.

The rarity of the conditions and the reluctance of writers of textbooks to list them as distinct diseases will also have militated against their general recognition. In the case of fenestrae parietales symmetricae both causes have been operative. Probably this heredo-familial condition occurs more frequently than is generally supposed, but has received little attention. It is, however, entirely comparable to such a disease as cleidocranial dysostosis, which is widely known, not from personal experience but from its established place in textbooks.
