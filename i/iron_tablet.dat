40|$|Abstract Background Conducting iron supplementation {{programs}} {{has been a}} major strategy to reduce iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. However, only a few countries have reported improvements in the anemia rate at a national level. The strategies used for control of nutrition problems need regular review to maintain and improve their effectiveness. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the factors in compliance with taking <b>iron</b> <b>tablets,</b> where daily doses of iron (60 mg) and folic acid (400 μg) were distributed in rural Vietnamese communes. Methods A cross sectional survey was conducted in Nghe An province, Vietnam in January, 2003. The study population was adult women aged less than 35 years who delivered babies between August 1 st 2001 and December 1 st 2002 (n = 205), of which 159 took part in the study. Data for the study were collected from a series of workshops with community leaders, focus group discussions with community members and a questionnaire survey. Results Improvements in the rate of anemia was not given a high priority as one of the commune's needs, but the participants still made efforts to continue taking <b>iron</b> <b>tablets.</b> Two major factors motivated the participants to continue taking iron tablets; their experience of fewer spells of dizziness (50 %), and their concern for the health of their newborn baby (54 %). When examining the reasons for taking <b>iron</b> <b>tablets</b> for at least 5 – 9 months, the most important factor was identified as 'a frequent supply of iron tablets' (OR = 11. 93, 95 % CI: 4. 33 – 32. 85). Conclusion The study found that multiple poor environmental risk factors discouraged women from taking <b>iron</b> <b>tablets</b> continuously.

Study Design Survey evaluation of HHT patients, and a randomized control trial in healthy volunteers. Methods Nosebleed severity in response to iron treatments and standard investigations were evaluated by unbiased surveys in patients with HHT. Serial blood samples from a randomized controlled trial of 18 healthy volunteers were used to examine responses to a single <b>iron</b> <b>tablet</b> (ferrous sulfate, 200 mg). Results <b>Iron</b> <b>tablet</b> users {{were more likely to have}} daily nosebleeds than non–iron-users as adults, but there was no difference in the proportions reporting childhood or trauma-induced nosebleeds. Although iron and blood transfusions were commonly reported to improve nosebleeds, 35 of 732 (4. 8 %) <b>iron</b> <b>tablet</b> users, in addition to 17 of 261 (6. 5 %) iron infusion users, reported that their nosebleeds were exacerbated by the respective treatments. These rates were significantly higher than those reported for control investigations. Serum iron rose sharply in four of the volunteers ingesting ferrous sulfate (by 19. 3 – 33. 1 μmol/L in 2 hours), but not in 12 dietary controls (2 -hour iron increment ranged from − 2. 2 to + 5. 0 μmol/L).

In {{spite of the fact}} that most ministries of health in developing countries have policies to provide pregnant women with iron in a supplement form, maternal anemia prevalence has not declined significantly where large-scale programs have been evaluated. During the period 1991 - 98, the MotherCare Project and its partners conducted qualitative research to determine the major barriers and facilitators of iron supplementation programs for pregnant women in eight developing countries. Research results were used to develop pilot program strategies and interventions to reduce maternal anemia. Across-region results were examined and some differences were found but the similarity in the way women view anemia and react to taking <b>iron</b> <b>tablets</b> was more striking than differences encountered by region, country or ethnic group. While women frequently recognize symptoms of anemia, they do not know the clinical term for anemia. Half of women in all countries consider these symptoms to be a priority health concern that requires action and half do not. Those women who visit prenatal health services are often familiar with iron supplements, but commonly do not know why they are prescribed. Contrary to the belief that women stop taking <b>iron</b> <b>tablets</b> mainly due to negative side effects, only about one-third of women reported that they experienced negative side effects in these studies. During iron supplementation trials in five of the countries, only about one-tenth of the women stopped taking the tablets due to side effects. The major barrier to effective supplementation programs is inadequate supply. Additional barriers include inadequate counseling and distribution of <b>iron</b> <b>tablets,</b> difficult access and poor utilization of prenatal health care services, beliefs against consuming medications during pregnancy, and in most countries, fears that taking too much iron may cause too much blood or a big baby, making delivery more difficult. Facilitators include women's recognition of improved physical well being with the alleviation of symptoms of anemia, particularly fatigue, a better appetite, increased appreciation of benefits for the fetus, and subsequent increased demand for prevention and treatment of iron deficiency and anemia.

50|$|The body {{is able to}} {{substantially}} {{reduce the}} amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It {{does not seem to be}} able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of <b>iron</b> <b>tablets</b> produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of iron overload. Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the liver, the heart and other metabolically active organs.|$|R
50|$|Treatment of HHT is {{symptomatic}} (it {{deals with}} the symptoms rather than the disease itself), {{as there is no}} therapy that stops the development of telangiectasias and AVMs directly. Furthermore, some treatments are applied to prevent the development of common complications. Chronic nosebleeds and digestive tract bleeding can both lead to anemia; if the bleeding itself cannot be completely stopped, the anemia requires treatment with iron supplements. Those who cannot tolerate <b>iron</b> <b>tablets</b> or solutions may require administration of intravenous iron, and blood transfusion if the anemia is causing severe symptoms that warrant rapid improvement of the blood count.|$|R
