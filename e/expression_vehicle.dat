In this study, a cholera toxin B (CTB) -ApxIIA# 5 fusion protein and full-size ApxIIA expressed in corn seed, as a subunit vaccine candidate, were observed to induce Apx-specific immune responses in mice.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi has revolutionized loss-of-function genetic studies in mammalian systems. However, significant challenges still remain to fully exploit RNAi for mammalian genetics. For instance, genetic screens and in vivo studies could be broadly improved by methods that allow inducible and uniform gene expression control. To achieve this, we built the lentiviral pINDUCER series of <b>expression</b> <b>vehicles</b> for inducible RNAi in vivo. Using a multicistronic design, pINDUCER vehicles enable tracking of viral transduction and shRNA or cDNA induction {{in a broad}} spectrum of mammalian cell types in vivo. They achieve this uniform temporal, dose-dependent, and reversible control of gene expression across heterogenous cell populations via fluorescence-based quantification of reverse tet-transactivator expression.

In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenic and antitumor effects of tum- 1, {{a fragment of}} tumstatin, gene transduction into HCC in vitro and in vivo. Tum- 1 gene was cloned into a pSecTag 2 B mammalian <b>expression</b> <b>vehicle</b> to construct pSecTag 2 B-tum- 1. pSecTag 2 B-tum- 1 or vehicle were transfected into human HCC cells, PLC/PRF/ 5 cells stably and Huh- 7 cells tran-siently. pSecTag 2 B-tum- 1 transfection slightly repressed the proliferation of both PLC/PRF/ 5 and Huh- 7 cells in vitro. Addition of conditioned media (CM) from tum- 1 expressing PLC/PRF/ 5 cells significantly inhibited the spontaneous and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -induced proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro with diminishing the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of both Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) that are known to mediate VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. In in vivo experiments, intratumoral injection of pSecTag 2 B-tum- 1 significantly repressed the growth of pre-established Huh- 7 tumors in athymic mouse models accompanying the decreased density of CD 34 positive vessels in tumors.

40|$|Abstract The {{temperature}} inducible expression system, {{based on}} the pL and/or pR phage lambda promoters regulated by the thermolabile cI 857 repressor has been widely use to produce recombinant proteins in prokariotic cells. In this expression system, induction of heterologous protein is achieved by increasing the culture temperature, generally above 37 °C. Concomitant to the overexpression of heterologous protein, the increase in temperature also causes a variety of complex stress responses. Many studies have reported {{the use of such}} temperature inducible expression system, however only few discuss the simultaneous stress effects caused by recombinant protein production and the up-shift in temperature. Understanding the integral effect of such responses should be useful to develop improved strategies for high yield protein production and recovery.

40|$|The Myf- 6 gene, a novel {{member of}} the human gene family of muscle {{determination}} factors has been detected by its highly conserved sequence coding for a putative helix-loop-helix domain. This sequence motif is a common feature of all Myf factors and other regulatory proteins. The new Myf gene is located on human chromosome 12, approximately 6. 5 Kb upstream of the Myf- 5 locus in a closely linked cluster of myogenic determination genes. Myf- 6 cDNAs were isolated from human and mouse skeletal muscle, the only tissue in which expression of the corresponding mRNA was observed. In contrast to human primary muscle cell cultures which express moderate levels of Myf- 6 mRNA, most established rodent muscle cell lines completely lack this mRNA. Myogenic 10 T 1 / 2 cells, however, induced by the expression of either pEMSV-Myf- 4 or pEMSV-Myf- 5 activate their endogenous mouse Myf- 6 gene. Constitutive expression of Myf- 6 cDNA in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 fibroblasts establishes the muscle phenotype at a similar frequency to the previously characterized myogenic factors. Moreover, muscle-specific CAT reporter constructs containing either the human myosin light chain (MLC) enhancer or the promoter of the embryonic myosin light chain gene are activated in NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts or in CV 1 kidney cells by cotransfection of Myf- 6 <b>expression</b> <b>vehicles.</b> This transcriptional activation occurs {{in the absence of}} any apparent conversion of the cellular phenotype of the recipient cells. Glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins with Myf- 3, Myf- 4 or Myf- 5 specifically bind to a MEF-like consensus sequence present in the human MLC enhancer and the MLC 1 emb promoter. In contrast, the Myf- 6 hybrid protein interacts weakly with the same sequences showing lower affinity and reduced specificity. Since co-expressed pEMSV-Myf- 6, nevertheless, is able to activate transcription of the MLC-CAT reporter constructs in non-muscle tissue culture cells, the different DNA binding properties in vitro might suggest that transactivation of gene expression by Myf- 6 involves distinct binding sites and/or additional protein factors...|$|R

The demand for {{reliable}} autonomous systems capable {{to detect and}} identify heavy military vehicles becomes an issue of paramount importance in the current complicated and delicate political climate.

40|$|The {{increasing}} interest in genetic manipulation of bacterial host metabolic pathways for protein or small molecule production {{has led to}} a need to add new genes to a chromosome quickly and easily without leaving behind a selectable marker. The present report describes a vector and four-day procedure that enable site-specific chromosomal insertion of cloned genes in a context insulated from external transcription, usable once in a construction series. The use of rhamnose-inducible transcription from rhaBp allows regulation of the inserted genes independently of the commonly used IPTG and arabinose strategies. Using lacZ as a reporter, we first show that expression from the rhamnose promoter is tightly regulatable, exhibiting very low leakage of background expression compared with background, and moderate rhamnose-induced expression compared with IPTG-induced expression from lacp. Second, the expression of a DNA methyltransferase was used to show that rhamnose regulation yielded on-off expression of this enzyme, such that a resident high-copy plasmid was either fully sensitive or fully resistant to isoschizomer restriction enzyme cleavage. In both cases, growth medium manipulation allows intermediate levels of <b>expression.</b> The <b>vehicle</b> can also be adapted as an ORF-cloning vector...|$|R

The same mutation has been reported by Lin et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 175 : 4891 - 4895, 1978). The structural gene of the mutant prolipoprotein was inserted into an inducible <b>expression</b> cloning <b>vehicle.</b> When the mutant prolipoprotein was produced in lipoprotein-minus host cells, 82 % of the unprocessed protein {{was found in the}} membrane fraction, with the remaining 18 % localized in the soluble fraction.

In addition, the assembly of the wild-type lipoprotein in these cells was not affected, whether the mutant prolipoprotein was produced or not. These results suggest that secretions of both mutant and wild-type prolipoproteins utilize the same component(s) responsible for the initial stages of secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane.

Because GLT 1 {{is responsible for the}} uptake of � 90 % of extracellular glutamate, we tested the hypothesis that increased GLT 1 expression attenuates cocaine relapse. Rats were trained to selfadminister cocaine (0. 125 mg per intravenous infusion) in a lever-pressing task in a daily 2 h session for 10 – 14 d followed by 5 dof extinction training. Immediately after each extinction session, rats received ceftriaxone (intraperitoneally), a �-lactam antibiotic believed to increase GLT 1 <b>expression,</b> or <b>vehicle.</b> On the following day, presentation of the cue (light and tone) previously associated with cocaine self-administration reinstated lever pressing in rats treated with vehicle, whereas 100 or 200, but not 50 mg/kg ceftriaxone blocked this response. Immunoblotting confirmed that the ceftriaxone-induced blockade of cocaine relapse was associated with an increase in GLT 1 expression in both PFC and NAcc. In separate groups of rats, 200 mg/kg ceftriaxone failed to block cue-induced food seeking, arguing against a ceftriaxone-induced effect unique to extinction training or lever pressing.

Furthermore, we investigated in vitro the effect of aliskiren on the interactions between renin and the (pro) renin receptor and between aliskiren and prorenin. Aliskiren distributed extensively to the kidneys of normotensive (non) diabetic rats, localizing in the glomeruli and vessel walls after 2 hours exposure. In diabetic TG(mRen- 2) 27 rats, aliskiren (10 or 30 mg/kg per day, 10 weeks) lowered blood pressure, prevented albuminuria, and suppressed renal transforming growth factor-β and collagen I <b>expression</b> versus <b>vehicle.</b> Aliskiren reduced (pro) renin receptor expression in glomeruli, tubules, and cortical vessels compared to vehicle (in situ hybridization). In human mesangial cells, aliskiren (0. 1 μmol/L to 10 μmol/L) did not inhibit binding of I-renin to the (pro) renin receptor, nor did it alter the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 by renin (20 nmol/L) preincubated with aliskiren (100 nmol/L) or affect gene expression of the (pro) renin receptor. Evidence was obtained that aliskiren binds to the active site of prorenin. The above results demonstrate the antihypertensive and renoprotective effects of aliskiren in experimental diabetic nephropathy.

The nucleotide sequences of the - 10 and the - 35 regions of the lpp promoter were altered in a step-wise manner to conform to their respective consensus sequences by synthetic oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. The mutated promoters were then fused to the lacZ gene to measure promoter activity. The beta-galactosidase activity increased approximately 1. 9 and 2. 4 fold when the - 10 region (AATACT) was altered to TATACT(P 1) and TATAAT (consensus sequence; P 2), respectively. Similarly, it increased approximately 1. 2 and 4. 2 fold, when the - 35 region (TTCTCA) was altered to TTCACA(R 1) and TTGACA (consensus sequence; R 2), respectively. When the mutations at the - 10 and - 35 regions were combined, the overall improvement of the promoter activity for R 2 -P 1 was 4. 0 fold over that of the wild-type promoter, while it was only 2. 5 fold for R 2 -P 2. These results indicate that substantial improvement of the promoter activity can be achieved by changing either of the two key regions to their respective consensus sequences.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{centered}} on how we can accurately estimate the robot pose uncertainty and how this uncertainty is propagated to future states (the robot state, in this context, is its pose). Some {{attention has been paid}} to this issue in the past. The first approach considering the uncertainty of position estimation. A min/max error bound approach is proposed resulting in bigger and bigger circles in the x-y plane representing the possible positions for the robot. Those circles are computed as projections of cylinders in the configuration space. Basically, the same approach was independently derived using a scalar as an uncertainty measure in the plane position but without reference to the orientation error. The main contribution of this article is the proposal of a novel solution for the calculation of such cross-covariance terms. In this way, we are able to catch the highly nonlinear behavior of the pose uncertainty while accurately estimating it. The basic idea is to fit the covariance matrix for the previous pose using a set of equations obtained by eigen decomposition. The cross-covariance terms are then derived using these set of equations together with the already-known <b>expressions</b> for the <b>vehicle</b> pose incrementsPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

The English historian believes that, on the contrary, this system proves itself weak with reference to the psychological introspection. Various elements, however, convey the impression that the social use of the seven vices' structure never obscured the interior life of the individual. On the contrary, in a first moment the capital vices (as delineated by Giovanni Cassiano) are actually <b>expression</b> and <b>vehicle</b> of a solitary morality: the one of the monk, who sees in the genealogy of the seven vices a series of psychological conditions progressively turned towards evil and who aims to self-knowledge and self-dominion within a search of purification and of approach to God. Even when, from Gregory the Great's age onwards, the interlocutor of the moral message is all mankind and the "mundane" use of the seven vices is favoured by the elimination of sloth and by the introduction of envy, the system's strong social character does not lessen its individual and psychological dimension. When the individual confession of the vices becomes obligatory for everyone, the seven vices' structure proves to be a perfect system of individuation and classification of the various vices, capable of guiding the whole social body through the administration of the souls, by tracing from the external actions the interior movements which have caused them. And even if the genealogical order of the vices tends to turn into a taxonomic, the system does not lose its guiding function of penetrating the human soul's recesses: on the contrary, the powerful psychological analysis of the capital vices, previously guaranteed by the monastic knowledge, finds new strength in the suggestions that, with special reference to human passions, derive from the discovery of Greek psychology...|$|R
40|$|Vehicles {{are sold}} in many {{variants}} with different engine horsepower, wheel dimensions, type of headlights etc. Vehicle customers specify individual vehicles by the selection of such features during the so-called “sales configuration” process. Logic <b>expressions</b> called <b>vehicle</b> configuration rules are often utilized for automating the sales-to-delivery process. 	The development of vehicle configuration rules includes authoring and evaluation of the configuration rules. The goal is the {{make sure that the}} configuration rules specify so-called “valid” configurations. Valid in this context is a user-defined state based on perception of domain specialists, e. g. design engineers of brakes. The aim of this thesis is to develop methods for configuration rules development that efficiently ensure that configurations are buildable by making the configuration rules development process more time-efficient and less error-prone. 	The problem is that the industrial visualization tools for developing configuration rules, henceforth CR visualization tools, are argued to be difficult to use. Consequently, the users find it difficult to validate configuration rules. The problem is in this thesis approached from scratch by first suggesting a generalized information model for vehicle configuration rules. The information model was derived from industrial studies and literature reviews. Then, user studies at three vehicle manufacturing companies were conducted in order to formalize the authoring methods and for study existing CR visualization tools. Limitations of current CR visualization tools were identified, which were addressed in a new CR visualization tool. This new tool uses one single user interface, which eliminates the swapping between windows. Also, the alternative authoring methods and potentially missing items are visualized. Some activities when evaluating the configuration rules are thereby facilitated. The new CR visualization tool has been iteratively developed and evaluated through formative usability tests. The test results were positive in terms of real users correctly conducting test tasks, appreciating the new CR visualization method as well predicting a more time-efficient CR development process. The planned future work includes more usability tests to study if there are any unforeseen usability threats. </p...|$|R
