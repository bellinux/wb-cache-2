5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, which has no purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept was}} also {{brought about by}} the lyrics, which are about sneaking out in the night and getting up to no good without your parents knowing. The idea of her {{crawling}} through her bed into this other world made it fantastical and have creative licence to have a few surreal elements. The bed scene was made up of thirty or so mattresses inside a tent of giant silk. The light was amazing, and once inside the bed set <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> calming and peaceful. This serenity really reflects Pixie's performance in this section.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} being {{depicted}} {{as having a}} good temperament or state of mind, Patrick {{has been shown in}} some episodes to have a tantrum. Patrick's emotional outbreak was originally written only for the first season episode [...] "Valentine's Day", where SpongeBob and Sandy try to give Patrick a Valentine's Day gift, and [...] "was supposed to be a one-time thing". However, according to episode writer Jay Lender, [...] "when that show came back <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> right that his dark side started popping up everywhere. You can plan ahead all you want, but the characters eventually tell you who they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad of <b>it.</b> I <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> {{myself and}} thought we 'd have a jolly little party {{all in the}} family," [...] said Tom, looking much gratified at her delight.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't help <b>it,</b> I <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> {{lonely and}} sad, {{and was so}} very glad to see you. It was such a {{surprise}} to look up and find you, just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn't come," [...] she said, trying in vain to speak quite naturally.|$|R
5000|$|Williams added [...] "We had tons {{of friends}} there, and <b>it</b> really just <b>felt</b> like a hangout session. And Marcos was so cool about it. He said, 'Bring your friends.' We shot {{it in some}} of our friends' houses, and <b>it</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> real ... and I think it's {{the first time in}} a video you're gonna get to see who we really are." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] {{is a power}} ballad {{that was}} written by Clarkson, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke and {{produced}} by the latter two. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 90 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F sharp minor with Clarkson's vocal range spanning over two octaves from F#3 to F#5. The bridge was {{the only part of}} the song that was written by Dr. Luke and Martin together with Clarkson face to face. The song begins with Clarkson wailing [...] "oh oh oh" [...] over a restless percussion. In the first verse, the music becomes quiet to focus on Clarkson's vocal as she wails [...] "Seems like just yesterday/You were a part of me/I used to stand so tall/I used to be so strong/Your arms around me tight/Everything <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> right/Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong." [...] During the chorus, the sound of electronic guitar is dominant as she vocalizes [...] "Here I am/Once again/I’m torn into pieces/Can’t deny it/Can’t pretend/Just thought you were the one/Broken up deep inside/But you won’t get to see the tears I cry/Behind these hazel eyes." [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV noticed that the song [...] "soared on crunchy guitars, driving beats and anthemic, agitated choruses." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an American nurse {{committed}} suicide and the Paranoid album {{was found on}} her turntable. The album's possible influence in her decision to commit suicide was mentioned in the inquest, but ultimately {{it was decided that}} Black Sabbath were not to blame for her death. [...] "A lot of the words in the songs a lot of the moods of the songs are aggressive," [...] Iommi acknowledged. [...] "Especially in the early days Satanic, if you like... That was the way <b>it</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>so</b> that was the way we played. But it got out of hand. With Paranoid in England, for instance. There was a girl found dead a nurse she was: dead in her room with our album on the turntable going round. And it was taken to court saying that {{it was because of the}} album that she was depressed and killed herself, which was totally ridiculous, I think." ...|$|E
2500|$|Webb {{also stated}} that Deschanel's {{character}}, Summer, {{is based on a}} stock character type; [...] "Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase." [...] Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. [...] "I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about 500 Days of Summer is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny".|$|E

40|$|This book {{offers a}} nuanced {{understanding}} of ‘offensive’ television content by drawing on an extensive research project, involving in-depth interviews {{and focus groups}} with audiences in Britain and Germany. Provocative Screens asks: what makes something really offensive and to whom in what context? Why <b>it</b> offence <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> differently? And how does offensive content matter in public life, regulation, and institutional understandings...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will be {{very nice}} indeed, Mark. Millicent is not complaining, but she must have <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> very dull. I have even <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> myself after the cheerful society we had at home." ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the initial}} {{recording}} sessions, Aguilera released her first greatest hits album, , which featured two new songs that {{were derived from}} electronic music, and she announced that the compilation was in the vein of where the upcoming album was going to go, which was a very futuristic approach to music. [...] "I get off on working with creative energy", Aguilera said. [...] "That's when I'm most at home and feel happiest. And all these people brought about new sides of me. It was a big collaboration-fest, and <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> good and rewarding in the end, because I was just so happy with the work and the new territories that I ventured out to." [...] Aguilera also remarked that her son inspired her to experiment in ways [...] "that maybe I've been afraid {{to do in the}} past, to allow myself to go to a place of 'less singing,' [...] " [...] she says. [...] " [...] is just about the future – my son in my life, motivating me to want to play and have fun." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{attempted}} to obviate this by plastering himself {{from head to}} foot with mud, but this dried and fell off. Besides <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> uncomfortable that he quickly decided that he preferred the shame to the discomfort.|$|E
5000|$|In a June 2007 Entertainment Weekly article, Maupin said, [...] "I was {{interested}} in pursuing {{the life of an}} aging gay man, and Michael was the perfect vehicle ... However, as soon as I started writing, I found that, one by one, all the other characters stepped forward and asked to be present. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> natural, <b>so</b> I went with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never, never!" [...] whispered she. [...] "What we did had a consecration of its own. We <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>so!</b> We said so to each other. Hast thou {{forgotten}} it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's dreadful! But I never <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> keenly before. You {{have opened}} my eyes to it. Of course, I've been on a farm but not to live there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I tried," [...] said Mrs. Wragge, {{with a fresh}} {{burst of}} tears--"but she only opened the door far enough to put out her hand. I took {{and gave it a}} little squeeze--and, oh poor soul, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> cold in mine!" ...|$|E
60|$|Bill untied {{the rope}} that held Dick's arms, but left his feet bound. I was freed entirely, and <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> {{good to have}} the use of all my limbs once more that I pranced round in a rather lively way. Either my antics annoyed Herky-Jerky or he thought it a good {{opportunity}} to show his skill with a lasso, for he shot the loop over me so hard that it stung my back.|$|E
60|$|She had so indescribably {{touched and}} {{interested}} me, stranger as I was, that the sudden cessation of her faint, sweet tones affected me almost {{with a sense}} of pain. In trying (clumsily enough) to help her with the pillows, I accidentally touched her hand. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> cold and so thin, that even the momentary contact with it startled me. I tried vainly to see her face, now that it was more within reach of my range of view. The merciless darkness kept it as complete a mystery as ever. Had my curiosity escaped her notice? Nothing escaped her notice. Her next words told me plainly that I had been discovered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, I never <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> cold {{in my life}} as I did to-day," [...] he said, {{turning on}} Dr Slumpy {{for the third time}} with that remark.|$|R
6000|$|Pay day came, and she {{received}} four pounds two shillings and one penny. She {{was very proud}} that day. She had never had so much money before. And she had earned it all herself. She sat {{on the top of}} the tram-car fingering the gold and fearing she might lose <b>it.</b> She <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> established and strong, because of it. And when she got home she said to her mother: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Coyote {{followed}} him, {{still trying}} to make his voice sound like the voices of many. Mr. Lynx gave a hurried {{look over his shoulder}} and began to run. Mr. Coyote kept after him, yelping and howling, until he was sure that Mr. Lynx was so frightened that he wouldn't dare come back. Then Mr. Coyote returned to the dinner Mr. Lynx had left, and ate and ate until he couldn't hold another mouthful. His throat was very raw and sore because he had strained it trying to make his voice change so often, but he didn't mind this, because, you know, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> good to have all he could eat at one time once more.|$|E
60|$|The white {{curtain of}} the room was drawn; but though the light was softened, the {{apartment}} was by no means obscure. Ferdinand was sitting in an easy-chair, supported by pillows. A black handkerchief was just twined round his forehead, for his head had been shaved, except a few curls on the side and front, which looked stark and lustreless. He was so thin and pale, and his eyes and cheeks were so wan and hollow, that it was scarcely credible that in so short a space of time a man could have become such a wreck. When he saw Katherine he involuntarily dropped his eyes, but extended his hand to her with some effort of earnestness. She was almost as pale as he, but she took his hand. It was so light and cold, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> much like death, that the tears stole down her cheek.|$|E
60|$|Jack Lawton {{looked over}} from his side. The little silk badge {{with the red}} rose on it looked very rich {{because he had a}} blue sailor top on. Stephen felt his own face red too, {{thinking}} of all the bets about who would get first place in elements, Jack Lawton or he. Some weeks Jack Lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard Father Arnall's voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white because <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> cool. He could not get out the answer for the sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place and second place and third place were beautiful colours too: pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.|$|E
5000|$|Back in the present, the {{characters}} {{can no longer}} stand each other's presence. However, the male character cannot possibly break his vow and hence is now praying {{for the end of}} time to relieve him from his obligation. The song fades out on the situation, juxtaposing his gloomy [...] "It was long ago, it was far away, it was so much better than it is today!" [...] in the left channel with her nostalgic [...] "It never <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> good, <b>it</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> right, we were glowing like the metal {{on the edge of a}} knife" [...] in the right channel.|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{tell the}} bitter {{disappointment}} that took possession of me when my search {{proved to be}} of so little avail; for I had <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> sure of finding the jewel or some traces of <b>it,</b> and had <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> sure {{of being able to}} secure it again, that I could not bear to give up my search, but continued it after every hope had expired.|$|R
50|$|The very {{worst part}} was, after that surgery {{they had to}} take all my {{bandages}} off in this place called the whirlpool room. That was pure hell because <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> like they were just ripping my skin off. The pain wasn’t like anything I’ve ever <b>felt.</b> <b>It’s</b> <b>so</b> different from anything that I’ve ever felt happen to me on a skateboard. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>it</b> was constantly burning, like I was still on fire.|$|R
5000|$|Under the GUM moniker, Watson {{released}} Delorean Highway digitally in Australia on 30 May 2014. Most of {{the material}} had been recorded in 2011, leaving Watson to note that [...] "when it finally came out <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> good! But <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> old to me". An LP release of Delorean Highway was restricted to a thousand copies. The album {{was described as a}} collection of [...] "paranoid pop songs" [...] that are [...] "mostly about falling in love and {{all of the things that}} he Watson thinks are going to kill him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Joshua Alston from The A.V. Club gave a B rating to the episode, {{calling the}} Gloria-Manny sub-plot smart [...] "because <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> organic to the characters, with Gloria ... {{learning}} {{the concept of}} shame" [...] but criticizing the Luke-Phil-Jay story, feeling that even though Burrell gave a good performance, the character of Thorpe was overused.|$|E
5000|$|... "Our {{producer}} Erik Ron {{will always}} start an album by asking me 'what {{are you feeling}} right now?" [...] to which I replied 'pissed off.' I think anyone that has suffered through loss, betrayal, insecurity and abandonment will absolutely relate to it. For me, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> good to get everything I had been bottling up out and hopefully it helps others in the process." ...|$|E
