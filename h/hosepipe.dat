5|$|In east Kent, {{the warmest}} {{time of the}} year is July and August, when maximum {{temperatures}} average around 21°C (70°F); the coolest months are January and February, when minimum temperatures average around 1°C (34°F). East Kent's average maximum and minimum temperatures are around 1/2°C higher than the national average. Herne Bay is sometimes warmer than other parts of Kent as it is backed by the North Downs to the south. Between 1999 and 2005, Herne Bay recorded the highest daily temperature in the United Kingdom nine times. East Kent's average annual rainfall is about 728mm (29inches), the wettest months being October to January. This was lower than the national average annual rainfall of 838mm (33inches), and recent droughts have led to <b>hosepipe</b> bans by Mid Kent Water.|$|E
5|$|Following the takeover, a new {{stationmaster}}'s {{house was}} built at Sea Mills, {{at a cost of}} £240. The stationmaster is recorded as having kept a variety of farm animals and sold eggs to passengers. Increased levels of traffic saw the line through Sea Mills doubled in the early 1900s, and the opportunity was taken to rebuild the station. A second platform opened on 6 January 1907 {{to the west of the}} tracks to serve northbound trains. The original platform now exclusively served southbound trains, and was lengthened to , the same length as the new platform. A station building was constructed on the original platform in a domestic style, with an arched terracotta entrance, spar-covered walls and a high-pitched tiled roof. The building contained a booking hall, booking office, toilets and a ladies' waiting room. A smaller building on the northbound platform contained a general waiting room. The subway under the bridge over the River Trym was also built at this time, with the porter's job being expanded to include washing the rubbish out of the subway after high tide, for which the railway provided a <b>hosepipe</b> and Wellington boots. By 1910 there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth and 15 back, increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920, though not all stopped at Sea Mills. The station was completely closed on Sundays.|$|E

25|$|Gas vacuoles are membrane-bound, {{spindle-shaped}} vesicles, {{found in}} some planktonic bacteria and Cyanobacteria, that provides buoyancy to these cells by decreasing their overall cell density. Positive buoyancy is {{needed to keep the}} cells in {{the upper reaches of the}} water column, so that they can continue to perform photosynthesis. They are made up of a shell of protein that has a highly hydrophobic inner surface, making it impermeable to water (and stopping water vapour from condensing inside) but permeable to most gases. Because the gas vesicle is a hollow cylinder, it is liable to collapse when the surrounding pressure increases. Natural selection has fine tuned the structure of the gas vesicle to maximise its resistance to buckling, including an external strengthening protein, GvpC, rather like the green thread in a braided <b>hosepipe.</b> There is a simple relationship between the diameter of the gas vesicle and pressure at which it will collapse - the wider the gas vesicle the weaker it becomes. However, wider gas vesicles are more efficient, providing more buoyancy per unit of protein than narrow gas vesicles. Different species produce gas vesicle of different diameter, allowing them to colonise different depths of the water column (fast growing, highly competitive species with wide gas vesicles in the top most layers; slow growing, dark-adapted, species with strong narrow gas vesicles in the deeper layers). The diameter of the gas vesicle will also help determine which species survive in different bodies of water. Deep lakes that experience winter mixing expose the cells to the hydrostatic pressure generated by the full water column. This will select for species with narrower, stronger gas vesicles.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{embarked}} on her Drowned World Tour in 2001, [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] was added {{as the second}} song in the setlist. The costumes were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, and had varied accessories like spiked dog collars, Swarovski crystal-encrusted bracelets and tattered tops. Michael Schimdt {{was responsible for the}} accessroies; he was sought out by Madonna and her stylist Arianne Phillips, to help with finishing touches for many of the outfits. Madonna opened the show with the punk section, wearing tattered black garments and a tartan kilt and belting out the first song, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love". As the song ended, Madonna started with [...] "Impressive Instant", accompanied by her dancers wearing gas masks and encased in rolls of black mesh, chasing the singer around the stage. In the middle of the song, she was carried around by her dancers. According to Stuart Lenig, author of the book The Twisted Tale of Glam Rock, Madonna merged choreography with narrative in the performance, as she and her dancers crossed the stage. The 1984-style robotic movements denoted fascism with the dancers stalking and then trying to grope Madonna; in the end one dancer dressed as a robot grabbed a big <b>hosepipe</b> and thrust it between Madonna's legs, as it emitted fog towards the audience. Lenig deduced that this could denote both an act of achieving orgasm or urination towards the crowd. Santiago Fouz-Hernández, {{one of the authors of}} the book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, found similarities with Madonna's exploration of lesbian cultural references from her earlier works, with the performance of [...] "Impressive Instant". The placement of the fogging machine between Madonna's legs were seen as symbols for the phallus and ejaculation, and was deduced as an example of the singer's insistence on masculinity as [...] "performance". The dancers ultimately get subdued by Madonna, who finish off singing the song and takes up a Gibson Les Paul electric guitar to perform the next track, [...] "Candy Perfume Girl".|$|E
40|$|Treball final de Màster Universitari Erasmus Mundus en Tecnologia Geoespacial. Codi: SIW 013. Curs {{academic}} 2015 - 2016 In Western Honduras, most {{of people}} live in rural areas under extreme conditions of poverty. This area {{is part of the}} Centro American dry corridor which is affected by droughts and, therefore, water scarcity. Access to water is limited; which affects human welfare and agricultural production. As a plausible solution, this thesis work provides a tool to identify feasible water catchments for small irrigation projects in Western Honduras based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and surface features. This tool can support decision makers to address water catchments in the study area. Two versions of this tool were developed. Both desktop and online versions allow the user to find potential sites to take water from streams through <b>hosepipes.</b> The suggested paths, over which these <b>hosepipes</b> can be installed, are modeled by using the Least-Cost Path (LCP) approach. We contrasted the results provided by the tool with two actual cases. The results showed the potential of this tool to find possible water intakes different from the current cases. In both cases, the tool was capable of finding water intakes very close to the current sites. This thesis proves that the use of GIS technologies in combination with decision rules and surface features can provide a novel solution to the real problem of water scarcity in Western Honduras...|$|R
50|$|Detainees were blindfolded {{to prevent}} them {{identifying}} their assailants. Almost all detainees had marks on their noses and wrists caused by tight blindfolding and handcuffing. Sometimes handcuffs were applied so tightly as to cause a loss of sensation in the hands. Sleep deprivation techniques included the use of cold water, physical beatings and loud noises. Most detainees reported being forced to remain standing for long periods, often on one leg, and sometimes being suspended by ropes in painful positions. The effect of extremely cold temperatures was enhanced by wetting clothes and bedding. Cigarette burns and electric shocks were inflicted on at least 100 detainees. A number of detainees were sexually assaulted by touching and violent handling of their genitals or finger thrusts and the insertion of objects including <b>hosepipes</b> and ends of rifle barrels into the anus.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in Ruwa to assess the town’s water {{allocation}} capacity and drought contingency measures. Structured questionnaires and interviews were used to collect data from 60 residents and selected key respondents. The results showed that Ruwa dormitory town did not have an independent water supply system and was linked to the City of Harare water supply system. Water storage facilities at Ruwa consisted of one, 2, 000 m 3 reinforced concrete ground reservoir and the other, 1800 m 3 braithwaithe tank on a 12 m high stand. Some 16. 6 % of the residents (n= 60) had unprotected illegal wells dug on their stands to supplement water during needy times. Ruwa Local Board had a total of five boreholes to supplement the piped water system within the town. Water supply rate by the Board has been increasing from 8, 671 cubic metres in 1987 to a peak of 797, 216 cubic metres in 1998.

500|$|Trying {{to resolve}} Larkin's {{contradictory}} opinions on race {{in his book}} Such Deliberate Disguises: The Art of Philip Larkin, the writer Richard Palmer quotes a letter Larkin wrote to Betjeman, as if it exposes [...] "all the post-Motion and post-Letters furore about Larkin’s 'racism' as the nonsense it is":"The American Negro is trying {{to take a step}} forward that can be compared only to the ending of slavery in the nineteenth century. And despite the dogs, the <b>hosepipes</b> and the burnings, advances have already been made towards giving the Negro his civil rights that would have been inconceivable when Louis Armstrong was a young man. These advances will doubtless continue. They will end only when the Negro is as well-housed, educated and medically cared for as the white man."Reviewing Palmer's book, John G. Rodwan, Jr. proposes that: [...] "a less forgiving reader could counter by asking if this does not qualify as the thought of a “true racist”: 'I find the state of the nation quite terrifying. In 10 years’ time we shall all be cowering under our beds as hordes of blacks steal anything they can lay their hands on.' Or this: 'We don’t go to cricket Test matches now, too many fucking niggers about.'"Despite controversy about his personal life and opinions, Larkin remains one of Britain's most popular poets. In 2003, almost two decades after his death, Larkin was chosen as [...] "the nation's best-loved poet" [...] in a survey by the Poetry Book Society, and in 2008 The Times named Larkin as the greatest British post-war writer. Three of his poems, [...] "This Be The Verse", [...] "The Whitsun Weddings" [...] and [...] "An Arundel Tomb", featured in the Nation's Top 100 Poems as voted for by viewers of the BBC's Bookworm in 1995. Media interest in Larkin has increased in the twenty-first century. Larkin's collection The Whitsun Weddings is one of the available poetry texts in the AQA English Literature A Level syllabus, while High Windows is offered by the OCR board. Buses in Hull displayed extracts from his poems in 2010.|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Doctor of Technology: Chemical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 The subject {{of this investigation was}} a highly concentrated water-in-oil emulsion (HCE), explosive grade, with volume fraction of approximately 88 vol%, wherein the dispersed phase was comprised of a super-cooled solution of inorganic salts. Explosive emulsions are thermodynamically unstable compounds and this instability is related to crystallisation in the dispersed phase, which is a supersaturated solution (> 75 wt%) of an oxidiser (e. g. ammonium nitrate salt (AN) in water). Slow crystallisation of droplets can occur during shelf life storage, transportation and application, thereby suppressing the sensitivity of the emulsion to detonation. The structure of these emulsions with respect to their stability has been studied and their rheological properties have been well described. Explosive emulsions are commonly stabilised by poly (isobutylene) succinic anhydride (PIBSA) -based surfactants that provide optimal shelf life stability, but become unstable during high shear conditions. This adversely affects the quality of these emulsions during their transportation through long <b>hosepipes,</b> as occurs in the relevant industry. Other issues {{associated with the use of}} PIBSA surfactants include long refinement times required, which increase the energy costs to form stable explosive emulsion. The trend of using surfactant mixtures to provide overall stability, both during shelf life and high shear, has grown in recent years. Among other advantages of this approach are associated economic benefits, and improved safety and technological properties of emulsions. The choice of co-surfactants depends on the nature of the components of the emulsion and is mainly empirically-based. The key concept is using synergetic binary surfactant systems, which may impact on the stability and properties of the emulsions. This study presents results from such an investigation, bearing in mind that the emulsion performance depends on the fundamental physicochemical properties of the mixed surfactants. Initially, two groups of surfactants (block copolymers named Pluronics and water soluble surfactants named Tweens), as well as their combination with a PIBSA-based surfactant (PIBSA-Mea) and sorbitan monooleate (SMO) were selected to stabilise HCEs. Pluronics, when combined with PIBSA-Mea and SMO, were unsuccessful in forming stable emulsions, while the emulsions consisting of PIBSA-Mea/water soluble surfactants showed acceptable stability. Attempts at dissolving water-soluble surfactants in the aqueous phase were unsuccessful. This was attributed to the salting-out effect of Tweens in the presence of large quantities of AN in the water phase. In the current study, the water soluble surfactants were successfully dissolved in the oil phase containing industrial grade oil (Ash-H). The stability and interfacial behaviour of one the most stable novel emulsions, stabilised by PIBSA-Mea/water soluble surfactants (Tween 80), and developed during this study, was then compared to the current standard industrial explosive formulation (PIBSA/SMO). Results showed an acceptable stability of the new emulsion formulation in both shelf life and under high shear. More interestingly, it was observed that there were markedly different interfacial behaviours of PIBSA-Mea/water soluble Tween 80 and PIBSA-Mea/oil soluble SMO at the water-oil interface over a wide range of surfactant/co-surfactant ratios. Based on the results obtained from the aforementioned comparative studies, a series of nonionic oil-soluble (Spans) and water-soluble (Tweens) compounds with systematically varying structure (length, presence of double bonds and number) of hydrophobic tails were identified and subsequently mixed with PIBSA-Mea. This was done in order to elucidate the effect of compatibility and synergism between PIBSA and co-surfactant, with particular reference to the interface to stability under shear and on-shelf of final explosive emulsions. An investigation of the effect/s of co-surfactant structure on interfacial properties at the water-oil interface was performed. The Rosen method was used to characterise synergism between the two surfactants. This was correlated with the stability on shelf and under shear as well as with the rheological properties/pumpability of the novel manufactured emulsions. The degree of synergism (interaction parameter) for PIBSA-Mea/Spans decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the length of alkyl tails, as well as the presence of a double bond in tail. There was a major antagonism noted for PIBSA-Mea/multi tails Span mixtures. In all the PIBSAMea/ Tweens mixtures the opposite effect of tail length on interaction parameter was observed. However, the effect of tail structure on synergism was less pronounced for the Tweens group than it was for Spans. Emulsification was markedly more rapid for the PIBSA-Mea/water soluble Tweens mixtures, and an improved stability on shelf and under high shear was recorded for this group when compared to PIBSA-Mea/Span mixtures. In the current study, depending on the structure of the surfactant, it was shown that synergism between the surfactant and co-surfactant is one of the major factors in determining stability of the emulsions. In addition, the influence of the chemical structure of co-surfactants on the rheological properties of the emulsions was studied. Higher pumpability of the explosive emulsions stabilised with water soluble Tween is attributed to a lower yield stress of the PIBSA-Mea/Tweens emulsions, compared to the PIBSA-Mea/Spans emulsions. Finally, the partial replacement of PIBSA by certain suitable water-soluble Tweens offers a cost-effective, easily available and environmentally friendly alternate. Additionally, such a system could provide acceptable stability for different technological applications associated with emulsions, including droplet refinement during emulsion production, adequate long-term storage and acceptable pumping characteristics of these mixtures. Overall, this would reduce the cost of the final product on an industrial scale...|$|R
