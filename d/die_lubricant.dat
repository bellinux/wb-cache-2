40|$|In high {{pressure}} die casting, {{it is necessary}} to apply a lubricant {{to the surface of the}} die in order to prevent soldering and decrease the cycle time of the casting process. The traditional approach uses a continuous spraying method to apply the lubricant; this can be wasteful. The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of a pulse spray application process to apply <b>die</b> <b>lubricant</b> onto the die surface. A previous study at Purdue University concluded that the pulsed spray method of <b>die</b> <b>lubricant</b> application could result in a significant reduction of the amount of spray runoff and consumption of <b>die</b> <b>lubricant,</b> leading to large cost reductions. The study examined the cooling rates and the resulting temperature differences for different spray pressures and frequencies. After spraying, the affected area of the surface was examined, and the number of particles and coverage area of the particles were measured. The parameters adjusted for this study were the spray pressure, spray duration, and the surface temperature of the hot plate. It was found that a spray pressure of 20 psi does not apply lubricant effectively at 400 °C at one, two, or four seconds of spray. At 400 °C, {{it is necessary to}} have a longer spray duration to apply <b>die</b> <b>lubricant</b> with a spray pressure of 20 psi. It was also concluded that higher pressure and longer spray duration result in a larger affected area of the spray. The research concluded that there is a possible optimal temperature window to apply <b>die</b> <b>lubricant.</b> Further research is necessary to find this temperature window. ...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to study the {{combined}} effects of die design, proper internal cooling and efficient <b>die</b> <b>lubricants</b> on <b>die</b> life. The project targeted improvements in die casting insert life by: Optomized Die Design for Reduced Surface Temperature: The life of die casting dies is significantly shorter when the die is exposed to elevated temperature for significant periods of time. Any die operated under conditions leading to surface temperature in excess of 1050 oF undergoes structural changes that reduce its strength. Optimized die design can improve die life significantly. This improvement {{can be accomplished by}} means of cooling lines, baffles and bubblers in the die. A key objective of the project was to establish criteria for the minimal distance of the cooling lines from the surface. This effort was supported with alloys and machining by BohlerUddeholm, Dunn Steel, HH Stark and Rex Buckeye. In plant testing and evaluation was conducted as in-kind cost share at St. Clair Die Casting. The Uddeholm Dievar steel evaluated in this program showed superior resistance to thermal fatigue resistance. Based on the experimental evidence, cooling lines could be placed as close as 0. 5 "Â from the surface. Die Life Extension by Optimized Die Lubrication: The life of die casting dies is affected by additions made to its surface with the proper lubricants. These lubricants will protect the surface from the considerable temperature peaks that occur when the molten melt enters the die. Dies will reach a significantly higher temperature without this lubricant being applied. The amount and type of the lubricant are critical variables in the die casting process. However, these lubricants must not corrode the die surface. This effort was supported with alloys and machining by BohlerUddeholm, Dunn Steel, HH Stark and Rex Buckeye. In plant testing and evaluation was conducted as in-kind cost share at St. Clair Die Casting. Chem- Trend participated in the program with <b>die</b> <b>lubricants</b> and technical support. Experiments conducted with these lubricants demonstrated good protection of the substrate steel. Graphite and boron nitride used as benchmarks are capable of completely eliminating soldering and washout. However, because of cost and environmental considerations these materials are not widely used in industry. The best water-based <b>die</b> <b>lubricants</b> evaluated in this program were capable of providing similar protection from soldering and washout. In addition to improved part quality and higher production rates, improving die casting processes to preserve the life of the inserts will result in energy savings and a reduction in environmental wastes. Improving die life by means of optimized cooling line placement, baffles and bubblers in the die will allow for reduced die temperatures during processing, saving energy associated with production. The utilization of optimized <b>die</b> <b>lubricants</b> will also reduce heat requirements in addition to reducing waste associated with soldering and washout. This new technology was predicted to result in an average energy savings of 1. 1 trillion BTU's/year over a 10 year period. Current (2012) annual energy saving estimates, based on commercial introduction in 2010, a market penetration of 70 % by 2020 is 1. 26 trillion BTU's/year. Along with these energy savings, reduction of scrap and improvement in casting yield will result in a reduction of the environmental emissions associated with the melting and pouring of the metal which will be saved {{as a result of this}} technology. The average annual estimate of CO 2 reduction per year through 2020 is 0. 025 Million Metric Tons of Carbon Equivalent (MM TCE) ...|$|R

Native milled and fractioned (125 – 250  μm) crustacean chitin of lobster origin was blended with microcrystalline cellulose, MCC (Avicel® PH 102) and spray-dried lactose–cellulose, SDLC Cellactose® (composed of a spray-dried mixture of alpha-lactose monohydrate 75 % and cellulose powder 25 %). An instrumented single-punch tablet machine was used for tablet compactions. The flowability of the powder mixtures composed of {{a high percentage of}} chitin and SDLC was clearly improved. The fractioned pure chitin powder was easily compressed into tablets by using a magnesium stearate level of 0. 1 % (w/w) but, as the <b>die</b> <b>lubricant</b> level was 0. 5 % (w/w), the tablet strength collapsed dramatically. The tablets compressed from the binary mixtures of MCC and SDLC exhibited elevated mechanical strengths (> 100  N) independent of the <b>die</b> <b>lubricant</b> level applied. In conclusion, fractioned chitin of crustacean origin can be used as an abundant direct-compression co-diluent with the established cellulosic excipients to modify the mechanical strength and, consequently, the disintegration of the tablets.

Main reason of the damages {{is the loss of}} material strength at the die surfaces caused by the thermical load originated by the high heat transmission during dwell time under load. The temperature peaks can exceed the annealing temperature of the tool steel and cause a permanent softening of the die surface. Long-time forging tests using an automized forging press are carried out to evaluate the effects of different cooling and lubrication conditions on tool life quantity.

40|$|The {{wedge shape}} {{is a fairly}} common {{cross-section}} found in many non-axisymmetric components used in machines, aircraft, ships and automobiles. If such components are forged between two mutually inclined dies the metal displaced by the dies flows into the converging as well as into the diverging channels created by the inclined dies. The extent of each type of flow (convergent/divergent) depends on the die—material interface friction and the included die angle. Given the initial cross-section, the length {{as well as the}} exact geometry of the forged cross-section are therefore uniquely determined by these parameters. In this paper a simple stress analysis is used to predict changes in the geometry of a wedge undergoing compression between inclined platens. The flow in directions normal to the cross-section is assumed to be negligible. Experiments carried out using wedge-shaped lead billets show that, knowing the interface friction {{and as long as the}} deformation is not too large, the dimensional changes in the wedge can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. The predicted flow behaviour of metal for a wide range of die angles and interface friction is presented: these characteristics can be used by the die designer to choose the <b>die</b> <b>lubricant</b> (only) if the die angle is specified and to choose both of these parameters if there is no restriction on the exact die angle. The present work shows that the length of a wedge undergoing compression is highly sensitive to die—material interface friction. Thus in a situation where the top and bottom dies are inclined to each other, a wedge made of the material to be forged could be put between the dies and then compressed, whereupon the length of the compressed wedge — given the degree of compression — affords an estimate of the die—material interface friction...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium {{pressure}} diecasting is a frequently applied {{manufacturing process}} for the near netshape production of precision parts. State of the art production techniques still demand considerable amounts of die lubricants. But {{the side effects of}} these lubricants include a decrease in surface quality of the cast part as well as a prolongation of the casting cycle time. The job quality decreases and the waste and exhaust disposal during production and application of lubricants is ecologically risky. In this study different wear resistant coating systems have been developed in order to minimize the use of the lubricants in the casting process {{while at the same time}} increasing the service life of the diecasting tools. Nitrides, carbides and borides of titanium were synthesized by means of DC-pulsed-PACVD. The influence of the process parameters gas composition, pressure, voltage and pulse/pulse repetition ratio was investigated. Compositional analysis was performed by analytical methods such as XRD, EDS, WDS and SIMS. Hardness, adhesion and friction behaviour of the layers were determined in order to describe their mechanical properties. The wetting angle was determined and the corrosion resistance was evaluated in dip tests in aluminium melt. A selection of the best coatings was then compared in diecasting praxis tests under tightened-up conditions reducing the amount of lubricants. TiN, Ti(B, N), TiC and multilayers of the system Ti-C-N were deposited exhibiting a wide range of stoichiometry. The coatings reached hardness values of up to 4400 HK 0. 005 and the friction coefficient #mu# was in the range of 0. 3. In the diecasting praxis test the amount of <b>die</b> <b>lubricant</b> could be reduced by 97 %. Under most severe conditions all layer types led to a minimum increase in the lifetime of the tool of factor 60 compared to an untreated dummy. A strong dependence on the layer type and on its stoichiometry could be observed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{hydrodynamic}} lubrication regime {{is reported to}} exist in numerous metal forming applications, such as wire drawing and hydrostatic extrusion, {{but it has not}} been achievable in the drawing of large diameter rods due to the relatively low drawing speeds common for larger parts. By creating a stable fluid film between the workpiece and the die during the drawing process friction and die wear could be significantly reduced, leading to energy savings, increased achievable reductions, and increased die life. An analytical model of the hydrodynamic drawing process is proposed which considers the geometry of the workpiece and die, as well as, the material properties (including work hardening effects), and (temperature dependent) fluid properties to determine the fluid film thickness over the reduction die. This model is then used to analyze several case studies, including a proposed multiple reduction die with high pressure lubricant supplied to the space between the dies.

Second, the lubricant was applied in a pulsed, static manner, in which the nozzle was held over the same surface while it was turned on and off several times. Third, the lubricant was applied in a sweeping manner, in which the nozzle was moved along the die surface while it was held open. The experiments were conducted at several die tem-peratures and at sweep speeds of 20, 23, and 68 cm/s. The heat flux data, which were obtained with a sensor that was located in the centre of the test plate, were presented and discussed.
