I thought if it could be a single that it would be incredible to perform it all the time ... What stands out about the song [...] I can dance to it and rock out to it, which is ultimately my goal. I was just so excited when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>this</b> one, 'cause it's the epitome of where I want to go with the future.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1948, as a captain, Griffin {{received}} sudden {{orders to}} report to the Strategic Plans Division (OP-30) in the Department of the Navy as officer in charge of special projects. [...] "That meant practically nothing to me when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>this.</b> It wasn't too long after I got back there that I got head over heels into the business of the so-called revolt of the admirals -- the B-36 affair. I found that the special projects {{had to do with the}} preparation of statements for the chief of naval operations on very critical points." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 15, 2013, Mohammad Nourizad {{kissed the}} feet of a 4-year-old Bahá'í boy whose parents {{had been arrested for}} {{participation}} in the Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education saying: [...] "…why shouldn't I kiss your feet {{as a representative of the}} office of [...] and the [...] Shi'ite sources of emulation?" [...] and published the event on his blog. The boy's father responded in a letter from prison dated July 18 saying in part: [...] "Mr. Nourizad! You asked Artin to slap you and to spit on you. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>this</b> request as your attempt to ease his pain, and the utmost sign of your honesty and your acceptance of responsibility. At the same time, I wish that no human body should have to be exposed to such a thing, as the body houses the human spirit and the human spirit is a display of the Divine one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Their {{first known}} mission sent the two {{brothers}} {{to the front lines}} of the Iberian War against the Sassanid Empire, reinforcing Belisarius at Mindouos. Belisarius was attempting to construct a fortress at this location. [...] "When the emperor (Justinian <b>I)</b> <b>heard</b> <b>this,</b> inasmuch as Belisarius was not able to beat off the Persians from the place with the army he had, he ordered another army to go thither, and also Coutzes and Bouzes, who at that time commanded the soldiers in Libanus. These two were brothers from Thrace, both young and inclined to be rash in engaging with the enemy. So both armies were gathered together and came in full force to the scene of the building operations, the Persians in order to hinder the work with all their power, and the Romans to defend the labourers. And a fierce battle took place in which the Romans were defeated, and there was a great slaughter of them, while some also were made captive by the enemy. Among these was Coutzes himself. All these captives the Persians led away to their own country, and, putting them in chains, confined them permanently in a cave; as for the fort, since no one defended it any longer, they razed what had been built to the ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{possibility}} of Indiana Jones 5 {{continued to be}} discussed through 2009 and 2010. Reports speculated in June 2009 that the next installment would start filming in 2011 with a plot involving the Bermuda Triangle, although these rumors were later described as [...] "completely false" [...] by Frank Marshall on his Twitter page. Speaking to BBC journalist Lizo Mzimba in June 2009, LaBeouf confirmed that [...] "Steven [...] just said that he cracked the story on it , I think they're gearing that up." [...] Lucas stated {{he was working on}} the film as of December 2009. In November 2010, Ford said that he and Spielberg were waiting for Lucas to present an idea to them. In March 2011, the Deadbolt website interviewed Karen Allen and asked her about the fifth film's status. [...] "What I know is that there's a story that they like", said Allen, [...] "which is a huge step forward. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>this</b> about six months ago, that they have a story that they like and they're working on it." [...] In July 2012, Frank Marshall indicated that the film was unlikely to be announced in the near future, saying: [...] "I don't know if it's definitely not happening, but it's not up and running... It's not on until there is a writer on the project. There is no writer on Indy." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Buffalo Chips was {{standing}} opposite me. [...] He {{was one of}} those long-haired scouts, and claimed to be a partner of Buffalo Bill’s. [...] He {{thought it was a good}} place to make name for himself, I suppose, for he told Big Bat that he was going to have one of the Indians’ scalps. [...] He had no more than got the words out of his mouth before he yelled, [...] "My God, I am shot." [...] <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>this</b> cry and looked around, Buffalo Chips was falling over into the hole where the Indians were hiding. [...] Bat was looking into the cave where the Indians were, and about five seconds afterwards jumped out with an Indian’s scalp in his hand, telling me that he had scalped one of the redskins alive, which I found out to be true. [...] He had seen the Indian that killed Buffalo Chips, and he jumped down onto him as the Indian was reaching to get White’s six-shooter. [...] Bat had jumped right down on top of him and scalped him and got out of the cave before anybody knew what he was doing." [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] White was a boyhood friend of Col. Cody and also a scout. He wanted to be like Buffalo Bill and acquired the sobriquet [...] "Buffalo Chips" [...] when Gen. Phillip Sheridan said he was more like Buffalo Chips than Buffalo Bill. Major Bourke described him as a [...] "good-natured liar who played Sancho Panza to Buffalo Bill’s Don Quixote." [...] Gen. [...] Charles King said he was a good man.|$|E
