Meanwhile, the Czech <b>Insolvency</b> <b>Register</b> contains publicly available data concerning approximately 160 000 insolvency proceedings. The subjects participating in insolvency proceedings include debtors, creditors, senates deciding in the respective insolvency matter and insolvency administrators who handle debtor's assets during the proceedings. Often, the involved subjects participate in several insolvency proceedings thus forming a complex social network that evolves over time. In order to better understand emerging trends in such a type of networks, we orient our research towards the identification of influential individuals.

Combining microdata from <b>Insolvency</b> <b>Register,</b> Business Register, Ministry of Finance and other sources, we construct a unique dataset of more than 2, 600 cases. We identify several basic determinants of satisfaction: a higher share of secured claims, real estate and cash in assets of a company, submission of financial statements into Business Register, selling the business as a whole within the proceedings, and entrepreneur cases. We find no such effect for the audit of financial statements or for the age of a company. Moreover, we search for other indicators that may result in the lower satisfaction of claims, out of which five are statistically significant: a homeless person in statutory body, registered office at a firm nest, being listed as unreliable VAT payer, a connection to persons that have multiple records in <b>Insolvency</b> <b>Register</b> and a substantial increase in depreciation in the period between the last two submitted financial statements.

2500|$|Liquidation is the final, most frequent, {{and most}} basic <b>insolvency</b> procedure. Since <b>registered</b> {{companies}} became {{available to the}} investing public, the Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844 and all its successors contained a route for a company's life {{to be brought to}} an end. The basic purpose of liquidation is to conclude a company's activities and to sell off assets (i.e. [...] "liquidate", turn goods into [...] "liquid assets" [...] or money) to pay creditors, or shareholders if any value remains. Either the company (its shareholders or directors) can initiate the process through a [...] "voluntary liquidation", or the creditors can force it through a [...] "compulsory liquidation". In urgent circumstances, a provisional liquidation order can also be granted if there is a serious threat to dissipation of a company's assets: in this case, a company may not be notified. By contrast, a voluntary liquidation begins if the company's members vote to liquidate with a 75 per cent special resolution. If the directors can make a statutory declaration that the company is solvent, the directors or shareholders remain in control, but if the company is insolvent, the creditors will control the voluntary winding up. Otherwise, a [...] "compulsory liquidation" [...] may be initiated by either the directors, the company, some shareholders or creditors bringing a petition for winding up to the court. In principle, almost any member (this is usually shareholders, but can also be anyone registered on the company's member list) can bring a petition for liquidation to begin, so long as they have held shares for over six months, or there is only one shareholder. In Re Peveril Gold Mines Ltd Lord Lindley MR held that a company could not obstruct a member's right to bring a petition by requiring that two directors consented or the shareholder had over 20 per cent of share capital. A member's right to bring a petition cannot be changed by a company constitution. However, in Re Rica Gold Washing Co the Court of Appeal invented an extra-statutory requirement that a member must have a sufficient amount of money (£75 was insufficient) invested before bringing a petition. For creditors to bring a petition, there must simply be proof that the creditor is owed a debt that is due. In Mann v Goldstein the incorporated hairdressing and wig business, with shops in Pinner and Haverstock Hill, of two married couples broke down in acrimony. Goldstein and his company petitioned for winding up, claiming unpaid directors fees and payment for a wig delivery, but Mann argued that Goldstein had received the fees through ad hoc payments and another company owed money for the wigs. Ungoed Thomas J held the winding-up petition was not the place to decide the debt actually existed, and it would be an abuse of process to continue.|$|R
40|$|The {{key term}} “financial crisis” reaches about 50 million hits {{when it is}} typed into Google. The news media had been {{constantly}} broadcasting current developments {{since the beginning of}} the disaster. Although originated in the United States, the financial crisis turned into a global problem with disastrous consequences. Despite numerous actions to stabilize the markets, Germany is nearing its peak of <b>registered</b> <b>insolvencies</b> with an assumed 40. 000 new bankruptcies in 2010, with the number of illiquid, nonregistered companies even being higher (Die Welt, 2009). Debts and bankruptcies bring layoffs, which result in a lower economic spending power since consumers have lesser to no income, hence, cannot re‐inflate the economy through investments, which can eventually generate more bankruptcies. Even companies that are not affected by the economic downturn were confronted with the pressure to lower their business expenses as a precaution. Also hotels have been facing a difficult time, since fewer people are able to travel with less money available. Canceled meetings or a need to stick to a tighter expense plan reduce the revenue of hotels almost immediately (Ryan, 2009). To finance temporary losses or to start reviving a business through sanitation or expansion, money is essential [...] Financing conditions are not only a huge challenge for the management but also for creditors. Their concern is a lucrative investment and a guarantee of repayment of the credit in a timely matter. Hence, both perspectives are analyzed throughout this work. Therefore, this paper examines the financial crisis’ and Basel II’s impacts on operation and financing issues on Small and Medium Sized Hotels since 2007. This work discusses warning signs of the implementation of Basel II and III regulations, as well as the development of the financial crisis with actions that are taken to mitigate impacts on the financial market and the economy. By the use of an online survey with a total of 68 Small and Medium Sized Hotels in Franconia, important individual experiences and general trends on these topics are analyzed. Although most hotels from the survey were not as badly affected as the average of hotels worldwide and in some cases even profited from the financial crisis, they still have to overcome major obstacles in banking negotiations when financing their business with new credits. Small and Medium Sized Hotels’ possibilities are therefore limited which places them in a disadvantage in contrast to usually bigger hotel chains that are composed of several securities for new credits unlike privately run, individual small enterprises. Although Basel II had the intention to create a fairer distinction process between enterprises it oversaw several mistakes such as securitizations that are now to be changed. Since adjustments now need to be made within a short time, impacts cannot be fully analyzed beforehand. This provides another threat for the financial market as well as the whole economy in case of severe consequences that had been missing in primary evaluations. The accuracy of answered questions is different for some hotels which makes the survey’s outcome volatile in reliance. Nevertheless, a good overview is given that provides suggestions for more detailed research, also for further in‐depth interviews to ensure consistency and credibility over a longer period of time...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work, except for clarifying the legislation which defines the process of reorganization under the Czech Insolvency Act 182 / 2006 as amended, is also to introduce a sample of allowed reorganizations {{from the perspective of}} selected economic and non-economic factors. The sample consists of all companies in which reorganization has been authorized by the court from 1. 1. 2008 to 31. 12. 2012. The fundamental factors of analysis are causes of default, the processes leading to the approval of reorganization, a way of ensuring operational funding, the duration of the reorganization, the methods of solution, the rate of satisfaction of creditors and others. The methods that were used in the analysis are analytical and descriptive, then evaluation method and comparison. The research was based on publicly available data of the reorganized companies located in the <b>Insolvency</b> <b>register.</b> According to the results it can be generally said that the reorganization is more favorable to creditors than bankruptcy, mainly due to higher rate of speed and satisfaction of creditors. However, the reorganization is not common way of resolving insolvency. For successful completion of the reorganization, directors should start insolvency process at a time when a company is only in a state of imminent bankruptcy. Also, an important aspect is realistic and well-prepared reorganization plan which should be sold to its creditors before deciding on the insolvency by the court. Debtor should have in his mind that just creditors are the crucial factor whether the whole reorganization process will be successful...|$|E
40|$|According to statistics, the {{indebtedness}} of Czech households {{has been}} on the rise since 2000, while a broadening supply from the financial sector, the growing standard of living (which is connected with debt financing of housing) and the tendency to favour a consumer lifestyle have contributed to the growing volume of credits. The aim of our survey is to ascertain the extent to which creditors of debtors in debt relief are satisfied. A sample of insolvency proceedings permitted in 2008 was surveyed. Of these insolvency proceedings, we selected personal bankruptcies which underwent the five-year repayment period required by the insolvency act. A situation emerges in which we can for the first time evaluate the success of creditors satisfaction on the basis of concrete data which we gained from the <b>insolvency</b> <b>register.</b> On the basis of a survey, it was found that individual creditors are satisfied to 50 % of their ascertained receivables. The given initial finding is interesting especially {{in view of the fact}} that the law itself prescribes a 30 % minimal limit of satisfaction for debtors. Further, the survey focused on the problem of securing receivables. The insolvency act has markedly changed the position of the creditor which secures its receivable by some form of collateral. A secured receivable can be monetized during the course of insolvency proceedings, and following the deduction of connected expenses the entire proceeds from the monetized property belong to the secured creditor. By contrast, in a case of personal bankruptcy a non-secured creditor is satisfied according to a percentage in a payment schedule. We surveyed especially the proportion of secured receivables and the form of collateral. From the data it stemmed that 19. 62 % of receivables are secured with the debtor's property, most frequently a house, plot of land, flat or other form of collateral...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The doctor's {{dissertation}} paper {{addresses the}} social problem, how business units {{should use the}} standard economic tools to prevent crisis. The importance {{of the problem is}} supported by the fact, that last year more than eleven thousand economic entities in the Czech Republic became insolvent. The Set of Tools for Corporate Crisis Prevention shall help to better adjust the internal control mechanisms, using which businesses could better prevent crisis. Application of this Set of Tools for Corporate Crisis Prevention is verified based on two completely different companies. The dissertation addresses the question of how use standard tools such as loan and leasing for crisis prevention, possibly secure the recovery of growth opportunities. This support is implemented by using an external financial institution, or the Intercompany bank. In the chapter entitled "intercompany bank", I describe the basic principles of operation and its importance for internal control. This internal organization has been used in many companies, but today is back to support the sales department and help reduce risk associated with the greater indebtedness of the company. I am describing the Intercompany bank in the context of internal processes and forms of cooperation with the sales department. Functionality of the intercompany bank is supplemented with examples from practice. The chapter called "Micro-enterprise approach of the crisis" is complemented by the complexity of internal financial perspective to company's management. This chapter describes three main sources of the company crisis from a microeconomic perspective. It is decreasing demand, the impact of interest rate exchanges on corporate governance and the impact of exchange rate changes on the financial stability of the company. The analytical part of presented dissertation thesis deals with development of insolvency proposal, bankruptcy, and reorganization proposals in The Czech Republic between 2008 and 2013. The main target is finding the causal dependences between insolvency requirements in the <b>Insolvency</b> <b>Register</b> and a few key macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rate, industrial production growth and the amount of loans granted to the corporate sector. For a more comprehensive view of insolvency arrangement of The Czech Republic is accompanied by description of the legislative settings in The UK, Germany and France.
