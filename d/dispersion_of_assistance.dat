40|$|How does aid impact {{democracy}} in sub-Saharan Africa? Drawing on existing literature, this study elaborates {{on the various}} channels, direct and indirect, through which development and democracy aid has influenced transitions to multi-party regimes and democratic consolidation within the region. The study's findings are at least threefold. First, development aid was effective at promoting democratic transitions during the 1990 s in those African countries that were beset by economic crisis, faced domestic discontent, or possessed a high dependence on aid, as well as when major donors took concerted action. Second, development and democracy aid demonstrate disparate effects on key elements of consolidation, including the avoidance of democratic erosion, the enhancement of accountability, {{and the promotion of}} competitive party systems. Development aid's most direct influence is with respect to preventing democratic backsliding, though this is often done in an inconsistent manner. Democracy aid plays a more direct role with respect to enhancing accountability and party systems but, its cumulative impact remains hindered by the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> across different activities and its temporal focus on elections. Third, in some areas of consolidation, the disparate objectives of development and democracy aid create clear trade-offs that remain unresolved...|$|E
40|$|Static {{mechanical}} properties (e. g. elastic modulus) and fatigue properties of a material all have dispersions. Material inhomogeneity (it {{can be characterized}} well by the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> elastic modulus) is the internal factor <b>of</b> <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> fatigue properties and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the load is the external factor. In this paper, according to theoretical derivation and preliminary experiments verification, the following relationships between <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> fatigue properties and <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> static {{mechanical properties}} of a material are obtained: the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> fatigue life is n (the fatigue index) times of the sum <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> elastic modulus and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the load. The corresponding <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> fatigue life is a decreasing function of the given fatigue strength in the stage of high cycle fatigue; P-S curve (the probability statistical distribution of fatigue strength) under the given fatigue life cannot be directly by test, but P-S curve can be obtained on the bias of P-N curve (the probability statistical distribution of fatigue life), and the corresponding <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> fatigue strength is a decreasing function of the given fatigue life. On bias of conclusions above, not only the inhomogeneity of material but also the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the load needs {{to be considered in}} the fatigue design, especially in high cycle fatigue design.

40|$|To {{study the}} role <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> atrial repolarization (DAR) in {{the genesis of}} atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), monophasic action potentials (MAP) were recorded simultaneously from a catheter at the high lateral right atrium (HLRA) and a catheter moving around the high, middle and low lateral right atrium (RA) the high, anterior and posterior septal RA and the RA appendage in 15 patients with paroxysmal AF and 15 patients with atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) or concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) without history of AF. After recordings during sinus rhythm (SR), MAPs were recorded during programmed stimulation (PS) via the HLRA catheter at a drive cycle length (CL) of 500 ms. Thus, MAPs were recorded simultaneously from 2 sites {{at a time and}} sequentially from 4 to 12 sites during SR, drive pacing and PS. Taking the MAP at the HLRA as reference, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization time (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT) and its two components, the <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> activation time (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> AT) and MAP duration (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> MAP duration) among the 4 to 12 sites were calculated and taken as parameters of DAR. RESULTS: During SR and PS, the maximal <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT was significantly greater in AF than in control patients, 113 +/- 49 ms vs 50 +/- 28 ms (P< 0. 001) and 114 +/- 56 vs 70 +/- 43 ms (P< 0. 05) respectively. The increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT in the AF group was caused by increases in both <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> MAP duration and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> AT. CONCLUSION: During SR and PS, DAR increased in patients with paroxysmal AF due to increases in <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> MAP duration and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> AT, which suggests the involvement of both repolarization and conduction disturbances in the development of paroxysmal AF...|$|R

30|$|The as-prepared RGO-Pt hybrid {{materials}} {{could not}} be dispersed well in any polar and nonpolar solutions because the oxygen-containing groups were decreased in the reduction process. However, the RGO-Pt hybrid materials assisted by OA could be dispersed well in nonpolar solvents such as DCB, toluene, and chlorobenzene. The dispersion can remain stable for several months. The <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the RGO-Pt hybrid materials in DCB {{is caused by the}} coordination between OA and Pt nanoparticles, which is similar to the OA-assisted <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> CNT [51 – 53]. The weak nucleophilicity of OA ensures that the Pt nanoparticles are kept bonded together with the reduced GO. In order to investigate the interaction between OA and reduced GO, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the RGO-NoPt- 10 was attempted in DCB with the <b>assistance</b> <b>of</b> OA. It is worth mentioning that the RGO-NoPt- 10 {{could not be}} dispersed satisfactorily in DCB even with the <b>assistance</b> <b>of</b> OA. Therefore, it is believed that the intercalation of Pt nanoparticles into the stacked graphene sheets and the coordination with OA are crucial for the redispersion of RGO-Pt hybrid materials. As a weak ligand, OA can also be very easily washed away by common solvents, like ethanol [54, 55], hexane [56], and acetic acid [55].|$|R

40|$|Objectives. This study {{tested the}} {{correlation}} of QT and JT dispersion and other potentially useful electrocardiographic (ECG) indexes with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization and recovery time. Background. <b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization is currently being assessed noninvasively from the surface ECG by means of QT and JT dispersion, although their correlation with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization as measured directly from the myocardium is not well established. Methods. Multiple monophasic action potentials were recorded simultaneously with a 12 -lead ECG from isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. The QT and JT dispersion was compared with the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> monophasic action potential duration at 90 % repolarization (APD 90) and with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> recovery time. As new ECG indexes, total T wave area, T wave area after the peak (late T wave area) and T peak to T end interval were also tested. Results. The QT and JT dispersion showed a significant correlation with the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> APD 90 and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> recovery time (r values between 0. 58 and 0. 64, respectively, p < 0. 001). However, total T wave area showed better correlation, respectively, with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> APD 90 and recovery time (r = 0. 79 and r = 0. 82, p < 0. 0001), as did late T wave area (r = 0. 81 and r = 0. 81, p < 0. 0001) and T peak to T end interval (r = 0. 81 and r = 0. 82, p < 0. 0001).

40|$|To {{study the}} <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> {{ventricular}} repolarization following double and triple programmed stimulation and its correlation with the inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias, monophasic action potentials were simultaneously recorded {{from the right}} ventricular apex and outflow tract during programmed stimulation in 12 patients with ventricular arrhythmias and a normal QT interval. The time difference between {{the ends of the}} two monophasic action potentials were used as a measure <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization, which consists of the activation time difference and the monophasic action potential duration difference. During double and triple programmed stimulation, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization increased significantly with the shortening of the coupling interval but decreased slightly with the shortening of the preceding interval. The induction of the ventricular arrhythmias in these patients was invariably associated with a marked increase in the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization. The maximal <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization was significantly larger in the seven patients with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular flutter/fibrillation induced than in the four patients with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced. Analysis of the two components <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization revealed that the increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization was mainly caused by an increase in the activation time difference in the monomorphic ventricular tachycardia subgroup, and by increases in both the activation time difference and monophasic action potential duration difference in the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation subgroup.

To {{establish}} {{a set of}} reference values for regional <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization of the right atrium in the in situ heart of pigs and {{to see if the}} global <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization could be estimated from regional mapping. Design. Monophasic action potential (MAP) were sequentially recorded from 28 Â± 3 sites in seven different regional areas of the right atrium: lateral, anterior and posterior wall, septum, sinoatrial node (SAN), appendage, and near the tricuspid annulus (TA) in 10 healthy pigs using the CARTO mapping system. Results. The activation time (AT), MAP duration (MAPd) and end of repolarization time (EOR) of the whole right atrium were 68 Â± 7, 239 Â± 20 and 270 Â± 23 ms, respectively. There were no significant differences on MAPd and EOR among the seven regional areas, nor between each of the regional and global values. The global <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> the MAPd and EOR were 75 Â± 19 and 103 Â± 13 ms, which were significantly greater than those obtained from any of the seven regional areas and those between two remote regions, SAN vs. TA and SAN vs. appendage regions.
