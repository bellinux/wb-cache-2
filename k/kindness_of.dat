40|$|Much {{has been}} written about random acts <b>of</b> <b>kindness</b> – acts {{performed}} spontaneously and often to strangers. The topic <b>of</b> <b>kindness</b> and the benefits arising from performing kind acts holds both empirical and applied interest in the fields of education and psychology.

25|$|This poem {{is a clear}} {{description}} of Martí’s societal hopes for his homeland. Within the poem, he talks about how regardless of the person, whether kind or cruel he cultivates a white rose, meaning that he remains peaceful. This coincides with his ideology about establishing unity amongst the people, more so those of Cuba, through a common identity, with no regards to ethnic and racial differences. This doctrine could be accomplished if one treated his enemy with peace as he would treat a friend. The <b>kindness</b> <b>of</b> one person should be shared with all people, regardless of personal conflict. By following the moral that lies within “Cultivo Rosa Blanca”, Martí’s vision of Cuban solidarity could be possible, creating a more peaceful society that would emanate through future generations.|$|E

Possessing an efficient intelligence network, however, Aramburu foiled the plan, having the plot's leader, General Juan José Valle, and 26 others executed.
