40|$|Abstract. The {{microstructure}} and the <b>formation</b> mechanism <b>of</b> <b>martensite</b> in W 6 Mo 5 Cr 4 V 2 steel was {{studied by}} metallographic microscope and JEM- 2100 {{transmission electron microscope}} after the samples were austenized between the temperatures of Ac 1 ~Accm and then quenched. The results show that When heating W 6 Mo 5 Cr 4 V 2 steel samples between the temperatures of Ac 1 ~Accm and then quenching, the cryptocrystalline martensite will be obtained. The cryptocrystalline martensite is plate martensite actually. It is considered that the <b>formation</b> cause <b>of</b> the cryptocrystal <b>martensite</b> is extremely inhomogeneous chemical composition in the austenite grains and the difference <b>of</b> <b>martensite</b> starting point (Ms point) of every small area in austenite grains.

50|$|An {{undercut}} crack, {{also known}} as a heat-affected zone (HAZ) crack, is a crack that forms a short distance away from the fusion line; it occurs in low alloy and high alloy steel. The exact causes of this type of crack are not completely understood, but it is known that dissolved hydrogen must be present. The other factor that affects this type of crack is internal stresses resulting from: unequal contraction between the base metal and the weld metal, restraint of the base metal, stresses from the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>martensite,</b> and stresses from the precipitation of hydrogen out of the metal.|$|E

40|$|Aiming at {{understanding}} the governing microstructural phenomena during heat treatments of Ni-free Ti-based shape memory materials for biomedical applications, {{a series of}} Ti–Nb alloys with Nb concentrations up to 29 wt% was produced by cold-crucible casting, followed by homogenization treatment and water quenching. Despite {{the large amount of}} literature available concerning the thermal stability and ageing behavior of Ti–Nb alloys, only few studies were performed dealing with the isochronal transformation behavior of initially martensitic Ti–Nb alloys. In this work, the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>martensites</b> (α' and α'') and their stability under different thermal processing conditions were investigated by a combination of x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, dilatometry and electron microscopy. The effect of Nb additions on the structural competition in correlation with stable and metastable phase diagrams was also studied. Alloys with 24 wt% Nb or less undergo a transformation sequence on heating from room temperature to 1155 K. In alloys containing > 24 wt% Nb α'' martensitically reverts back to β 0, which is highly unstable against chemical demixing by <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> isothermal ωiso.

5000|$|The {{scenario}} {{described above}} (cooling austenite to form martensite, deforming the martensite, then heating {{to revert to}} austenite, thus returning the original, undeformed shape) {{is known as the}} thermal shape memory effect. To fix the original [...] "parent shape," [...] the alloy must be held in position and heated to about abbr=on 500 °C F. This process is usually called shape setting. A second effect, called superelasticity or pseudoelasticity, is also observed in nitinol. This effect is the direct result of the fact that martensite can be formed by applying a stress as well as by cooling. Thus in a certain temperature range, one can apply a stress to austenite, causing martensite to form {{while at the same time}} changing shape. In this case, as soon as the stress is removed, the nitinol will spontaneously return to its original shape. In this mode of use, nitinol behaves like a super spring, possessing an elastic range 10-30 times greater than that of a normal spring material. There are, however, constraints: the effect is only observed about 0-40 K (0-40 °C; 0-72 °F) above the Af temperature. This upper limit is referred to as Md, which corresponds to the highest temperature in which it is still possible to stress-induce the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>martensite.</b> Below Md, martensite formation under load allows superelasticity due to twinning. Above Md, since martensite is no longer formed, the only response to stress is slip of the austenitic microstructure, and thus permanent deformation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract, The {{martensitic}} transformation behaviour, morphology and microstructures in copper-based {{shape memory}} alloys are {{strongly influenced by}} the post-quench heat treatments and ageing. Martensitic transformation initiates at a critical temperature and grows by the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>martensite</b> variants on cooling up to martensite finish temperature. These alloys are metastable at the matrix p-phase condition, and reversibility of transformation and <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>martensite</b> variants from the matrix {{are related to the}} elementary mechanisms. The interfacial motion between martensite variants is also important in shape memory. Vickers hardness shows a trend to increase with holding duration at ageing temperature of 200 °C for both alloys.
