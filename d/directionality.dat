5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have <b>directionality.</b> One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E
5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The <b>directionality</b> is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the tone sandhi {{phenomenon in the}} Tibeto-Berman language of Hakha-Lai, which is special for the complex interactions among its elementary rules. The rules interactions in Hakha-Lai lead to both left-to right and right-to-left rule <b>directionalities</b> in sequences of three or more tones. The rule application <b>directionalities,</b> however, appear to be ungoverned, as none of the principles proposed to date that may contribute to determining <b>directionalities</b> can account for them. IN this paper, I argue that the tone sandhi operation <b>directionalities</b> in Hakha-Lai {{are by no means}} ungoverned. Normally tone sandhi operates from right to left for identity reasons. This is forced by the IDENT-BOT constraint. The right-to-left direction is sacrificed only when such direction would result in output forms that contain marked sequences or tonal changes at the prominent position. Which are forbidden by u[AGREE-t and IDENT-IO-T-L respectively. Thus, the <b>directionalities</b> of tone sandhi operation in Hakha-Lai are naturally predicted by the interaction of the IDENT-BOT constraint, the u[AGREE-t constraint, and the IDENT-IO-T-L constraint where IDENT-BOT must be dominated by the latter two constraints...|$|R

5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's <b>directionality</b> which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E
5|$|The end-fire array trades a few {{decibels}} {{of output}} power for <b>directionality,</b> so it requires more enclosures {{for the same}} output power as a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of enclosures. Sixteen enclosures in four rows were used in 2007 {{at one of the}} stages of the Ultra Music Festival, to reduce low frequency interference to neighboring stages. Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it. The output pattern suffers from comb-filtering off-axis, but can be further shaped by adjusting the frequency response of each row of subwoofers.|$|E
5|$|The {{backbone}} of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix, {{the direction of the}} nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a <b>directionality</b> of five prime (5′) and three prime (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.|$|E
40|$|The {{citric acid}} cycle forms a major {{metabolic}} hub {{and as such}} it is involved in many disease states involving energetic imbalance. In {{spite of the fact}} that it is being branded as a "cycle", during hypoxia, when the electron transport chain does not oxidize reducing equivalents, segments of this metabolic pathway remain operational but exhibit opposing <b>directionalities.</b> This serves the purpose of harnessing high-energy phosphates through matrix substrate-level phosphorylation in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation. In this Mini-Review, these segments are appraised, pointing to the critical importance of the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex dictating their <b>directionalities.</b> (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe enzymatic {{degradation}} of the closely related insoluble polysaccharides; cellulose (β(1 – 4) -linked glucose) by cellulases and chitin (β(1 – 4) -linked N-acetylglucosamine) by chitinases, is of large biological and economical importance. Processive enzymes with different inherent <b>directionalities,</b> i. e. attacking the polysaccharide chains from opposite ends, are crucial for the efficiency of this degradation process. While processive cellulases with complementary functions differ in structure and catalytic mechanism, processive chitinases belong to one single protein family with similar active site architectures. Using the unique model system of Serratia marcescens with two processive chitinases attacking {{opposite ends of the}} substrate, we here show that different <b>directionalities</b> of processivity are correlated to distinct differences in the kinetic signatures for hydrolysis of oligomeric tetra-N-acetyl chitotetraose...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the question of}} the <b>directionality</b> of the text on the disc itself, different viewpoints are held as to how the Phaistos Disc characters should be displayed when transcribed into text. The disc itself probably has right-to-left <b>directionality,</b> if reading proceeds from the outside to the centre; this means that the reading direction is into the faces of the people and animals, as it is in Egyptian and Anatolian. Phaistos Disc characters are shown with left-to-right <b>directionality</b> in this article, with the glyphs mirrored compared to their orientation on the disc; which is also the typical practice for edited Egyptian and Anatolian hieroglyphic text.|$|E

40|$|The {{lamellar}} architecture {{found in}} many natural fibrous tissues has a significant bearing on their specific functions. However, current engineered tissues have simultaneously no realistic structures and no adequate functions. This study demonstrates a two-step process for obtaining structurally mimicking laminates in natural fibrous tissues with good optical and mechanical characters from purified-clinically-safe collagen molecules. Stacked lamella structures can be created by repeating flow casting, with the controlling parallel/orthogonal <b>directionalities</b> of each thin single-layer (2 – 5 μm in thickness). The transparency of laminates is successfully improved by a unique multi-cyclic vitrification with chemical cross-linking. The <b>directionalities</b> of optical and mechanical functions in laminates are strongly related with the preferential collagen alignments in the laminates. The tensile strength of laminates is extremely higher than any other engineered materials as well as native cornea, which exhibit an orthogonal laminated collagen structure and a good optical transmission...|$|R
40|$|Prediction of {{more than}} four ears in a cup drawing process can be {{successfully}} achieved by considering r-value and stress <b>directionalities.</b> Yld 2004 - 18 p based on associated flow rule and Yld 2000 - 2 D based on non-associated flow rule are the examples. The former, however, is more costly in terms of computational efficiency than the latter. In this work, an anisotropic constitutive model based on non-associated flow rule which combines two different functions, Hill (1948) and Yld 2000 - 2 d, is implemented to a user defined material model. The accuracy of the anisotropic <b>directionalities</b> (yield stresses and plastic strain ratios) is evaluated. Simulation of a mini-die cup drawing with a body stock alloy predicted eight ears, in good agreement with the experimental results. The use of Hill (1948) model for the yield function and Yld 2000 - 2 d for plastic potential under the framework of non-associated flow rule led to accurate prediction of up to eight ears at the lower computational cost...|$|R

40|$|Misinterpretations {{of visual}} {{information}} {{received by the}} retina are called visual illusions, which are known to occur in higher brain areas. However, whether they would be also processed in lower brain structures remains unknown, and how to explain the neuronal mechanisms underlying the motion after-effect is intensely debated. We show by extracellular recording that all motion-sensitive neurons in the pigeon’s pretectum respond similarly to real and illusory contours, and their preferred directions are identical for both contours in unidirectional cells, whereas these directions are changed by 90 deg for real versus illusory contours in bidirectional cells. On the other hand, some pretectal neurons produce inhibitory (excitatory) after-responses to cessation of prolonged motion in the preferred (null) directions, whose time course {{is similar to that}} of the motion after-effect reported by humans. Because excitatory and inhibitory receptive fields of a pretectal cell overlap in visual space and possess opposite <b>directionalities,</b> after-responses to cessation of prolonged motion in one direction may create illusory motion in the opposite direction. It appears that illusory contours and motion could be detected at the earliest stage of central information processing and processed in bottom-up streams, and that the motion after-effect may result from functional interactions of excitatory and inhibitory receptive fields with opposite <b>directionalities...</b>|$|R

Here, we summarize recent knowledge {{on the individual}} roles of plant hormone transporters in local and long-distance transport. Our inventory reveals that many hormones are transported by members of distinct transporter classes, with an apparent dominance of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family and of the Nitrate transport 1 /Peptide transporter family (NPF).

40|$|The {{application}} of the wavelet transform in image processing is most frequently based on a separable transform. Lines and columns in an image are treated independently and the basis functions are simply products of corresponding one-dimensional functions. Such a method keeps simplicity in design and computation. A new two-dimensional approach is proposed, which retains the simplicity of separable processing, but allows more <b>directionalities.</b> The method can be applied in many areas like denoising, nonlinear approximation and compression. The results on nonlinear approximation and denoising show interesting gains compared to the standard two-dimensional analysis...|$|R
25|$|The same <b>directionality</b> {{occurs when}} rats {{participate}} in the radial arm maze. The radial arm maze consists of a central circle from which several arm-like projections radiate. These projections either contain food or do not. Some consider the firing or lack of firing of place cells depending on the arm to {{be a function of}} goal-oriented behavior. However, when moving from one arm to another when they both contain food, place cells only fire in one direction, meaning that one cannot attribute firing purely to a goal-approach. A <b>directionality</b> component must be added: for example, a North goal as opposed to a South goal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this report, {{we present}} a {{framework}} that applies directional adaptive transforms to motion-compensated residuals of video sequences. Residual blocks are first clustered based on the <b>directionalities</b> present in the block, and then used to train Karhunen-Lo‘eve Transform (KLT) for each direction category. We define this set of KLT transform as the Directional-Adaptive KLT(DA-KLT). We compare the coding performance of DA-KLT against other standard transforms in terms of coding gains and rate-distortion curves. We also investigated whether a universal DA-KLT can be found that achieves better coding gain compared to DCT on various video sequences {{in order to make}} our framework function in practical settings...|$|R

We find that organisms with multiple compartments and extremophiles present challenges for modeling and thermodynamics-based flux analysis.

40|$|The {{research}} regards A Voyage to New Guinea, and the Moluccas, {{written by}} Thomas Forrest (c. 1729 -c. 1802), {{as a piece}} of eighteenth-century English travel writing on Southeast Asia. It proposes three reading <b>directionalities</b> for the travelogue, namely, horizontal, vertical and spherical readings, in order to underscore the flexibility of textual interpretation. Horizontal reading entails a concatenation of events that turns the narrative text into chronologically sequenced segments without attempting to establish a relationship between the linguistic signs and their inherent meanings. Vertical reading configures the text in multiple layers of meanings as well as cultural and historical inferences, which interact with one another and require in-depth textual analysis. The reading approach does not look for hidden meanings; instead, it aims to base the generated meanings on the reader's background knowledge. Spherical reading conceptualizes the narrative text in a spherical shape, regarding Forrest's voyage account as a story line that travels {{in the form of a}} circle, and as a cultural production anchored in the realm of eighteenth-century English travel writing, with its distinctive literary conventions. Additionally, the research considers Forrest's travel account as island writing by pointing out the parallel between the instability of meaning in a text such as A Voyage to New Guinea, and the Moluccas and the definitional precariousness of "island" that historically defies monolithic interpretation of scholars in cartography, geography and literary studies. By drawing the connection between three reading <b>directionalities,</b> travel writing and island writing, the research wishes to establish itself as an intersection of three academic branches, i. e., Comparative Literature, British Literature and Southeast Asian Studies...|$|R
