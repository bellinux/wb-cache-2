Whether Mr. Constable was right in recommending further advances to the London house is doubtful; but if it was an error of judgment, it was one which appears to have been shared by Mr. Cadell and Mr. James Ballantyne. It must be admitted that the three firms were equally culpable in maintaining for so many years a system of <b>fictitious</b> <b>credit.</b> Constable, at least, from a letter to Scott, printed in vol. iii. p. 274, had become seriously alarmed as early as August 8, 1823.|$|E

[...] In reality, the sound was improved when the compiled CD was mastered at Bernie Grundmans mastering facilities, but it sounded punk to say that it wasnt. While many might question Yarmouth spending money on such poor source material, the audio quality of the CD was optimized.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} rise of the modem fiscal state, which enabled the state to use centrally collected revenues from indirect taxes to mobilize financial resources either through long-term borrowing or issuing paper notes. The modem fiscal state greatly enhanced state capacity and stimulated financial development; it thus represented a crucial stage in the transformation from early modem to modem state and economy. My comparative analysis of England, Japan, and China shows multiple sequences and outcomes. All three cases had well-established early modem states and sophisticated market economies. Under the pressure of increasing spending demands, state actors conducted similar experiments, such as short-term borrowing, issuing of paper notes, and the collection of taxes upon domestic consumption. England became a modem fiscal state by the 1750 s when its government used the revenues from excises and the customs to service its massive long-term debt. Japan made the leap in the late 1880 s when tax revenues were employed to back up paper money, i. e., banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan. China, however, failed to develop into a modem fiscal state. I put forward a temporally-based causal mechanism which resulted from the interactions between a profound state credit crisis and socio-economic conditions. Such credit crises were caused by excessive dependence upon <b>fictitious</b> <b>credit</b> instruments such as bills of short-term borrowing unfunded by tax revenue in England or non-convertible paper notes in Japan. As these credit crises were an unintended consequence of earlier policies or events, they were exogenous to subsequent institutional development. (cont.) As a problem that had to be solved, they forced experimentation, "selected" effective institutional arrangements and competent financial officials, and facilitated a continuous learning and accumulation of effective elements in a process full of uncertainties. Socio-economic conditions, such as the size of consumption and the degree of concentration of production, were important to sustain this process in which various elements came to form a mutually reinforcing system. The lack of such an interactive process is used to explain the absence of a modem fiscal state in China. This institutional model reconciles the uncertainties and multiplicity of possible outcomes {{in the early stages of}} the process and the eventual observed outcome. This dissertation contributes to the study of institutional dynamics, which aims to understand how specific institutions emerge and consolidate. by Wenkai He. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Structural {{failures}} of bulk carriers continue {{to account for}} the loss of many lives every year. Capes are particularly vulnerable to cracking because of their large length, their trade in high density cargos, and the high rates of cargo operations. Rapid loss often occurs allowing little reaction time which has alarmed the industry. The Cape market is extremely volatile with ship values appreciating in some cases by over 500 % and then returning to original levels, all within a few years. Recent market changes have rendered conventional pricing methods inaccurate and often inapplicable, resulting in a pressing need for alternate valuation models. Very little research combines the closely interlinked technical and financial elements which are crucial for valuation and decision making by various parties in the shipping industry. The present research involves the collection and analysis of one of the largest ship cracking surveys. It is focused specifically on capes which lie {{at the core of the}} problem and is based on the records of ship owners, classification societies and shipyards. A location coding system was specifically designed to analyze the data and present the frequency, size and estimated crack growth rates with respect to location and ship age. The results were compared with existing knowledge based on surveys conducted over the past 50 years, the stress distribution based on an investigation of loading patterns, and theoretical fracture mechanics predictions. They were then combined with the frequency of crack failures, derived from an investigation of an extensive fleet sample, to develop a reliability model which yields the hazard function throughout the ship's life. Repair procedures and design modifications were also examined and a model was designed to assess their cost effectiveness based on the present value of projected crack costs. The crack repair costs were calculated as a function of ship age to be used in conjunction with the safety assessment for decision making by ship owners, insurance companies, classification societies and others. A new state of the art valuation model was developed combining both technical and financial aspects in a fundamental valuation based on risk-adjusted discounting of expected cash flows. A forward view of the main parameters was obtained from derivatives and financial securities that include shipping futures, FFAs, options, interest rate swaps and inflation protected bonds. The inherent risk of cracks is treated as a <b>fictitious</b> <b>credit</b> risk, derived from the reliability model, and is incorporated into the discount rate along with other risk premiums. Other inputs include repair costs and off-hire time, which were calculated with respect to ship age using a database of repairs, while the records of public and private companies were used along with surveys to estimate operating expenses. The resulting valuations were found to be in very close alignment with recent transaction prices across all ship ages. The model also estimates the volatility of the ship value and uses it to price optionalities that are often included in ship transactions. The combination of technical and financial analysis of this thesis is valuable to many involved in the shipping industry including brokers, accountants, analysts, shipping banks and investors interested in valuation; ship owners when making managerial or investment decisions; shipyards when designing ships, setting prices and deciding payment structures and options; insurance companies when covering total loss or emergency repairs; the IMO when setting regulations; and classification societies when scheduling inspections and deciding which areas to focus on. by Nicholas Andrew Hadjiyiannis.

Victims who decide to sue Madoff or third parties, believing they might have the possibility of some recovery, may still deduct 75 percent of their investment. The deduction will {{not be subject to}} the limitations on deduction of itemized deductions. Any loss exceeding current income may result in a net operating loss, which can be carried back, at the taxpayer's election, 3, 4, or 5 years, with any loss still remaining carrying forward 20 years. These rules apply to all Ponzi schemes where there has been a federal or state indictment of the lead promoter.|$|R
