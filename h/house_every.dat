He explains that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He explains that they could not stand the thought of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend all eternity together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the <b>house</b> <b>every</b> Christmas Eve.|$|E

The sets were designed by Charles-Antoine Cambon and Joseph Thierry, and the choreography was by Lucien Petipa. (The seventeen-year-old Jules Massenet was the orchestra's timpanist. During the rehearsals Berlioz had complimented the young player on the accuracy of his tuning.)

The first Once Upon a Child store was opened in 1985 in Perrysburg, Ohio, by Dennis and Lynn Blum in 1985 after they observed Goodwill Industries accepting and selling used baby attire. Prior to opening a store, Judy Blum had been selling her three sons' and friends' and neighbors' clothing {{in a garage}} sale from her <b>house</b> <b>every</b> week. Her husband resigned from his employment in 1989 to work with Judy. Winmark purchased the company in 1992.

25|$|Mothers {{and older}} generations of women joined the {{opposition}} movement, as advocates {{for peace and}} people opposed {{to the effects of}} the war and the draft on the generation of young men. These women saw the draft {{as one of the most}} disliked parts of the war machine and sought to undermine the war itself through undermining the draft. Another Mother for Peace and WSP often held free draft counseling centers to give young men legal and illegal methods to oppose the draft. Members of Women For Peace showed up at the White <b>House</b> <b>every</b> Sunday for 8 years from 11 to 1 for a peace vigil. Such female antiwar groups often relied on maternalism, the image of women as peaceful caretakers of the world, to express and accomplish their goals. The government often saw middle-aged women involved in such organizations as the most dangerous members of the opposition movement because they were ordinary citizens who quickly and efficiently mobilized.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} reasons which had brought about this {{situation}} – most significantly in the early 20th century there was no firmly upheld legislation to protect what is now {{considered to be the}} nation's heritage. Additionally, public opinion did not have the sentiment and interest in national heritage that is evident in Britain today. When the loss of Britain's architectural heritage reached its height at the rate of one <b>house</b> <b>every</b> five days in 1955, few were particularly interested or bothered. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, to the British public still suffering from the deprivations of food rationing and restriction on building work the destruction of these great redundant houses was of little interest. From 1914 onwards there had been a huge exodus away from a life in domestic service; having experienced the less restricted and better paid life away from the great estates, few were anxious to return – this in itself was a further reason that life in the English country house was becoming near impossible to all but the very rich.|$|E

She and fifteen other women were arrested for picketing at the White House on Bastille Day, in July 1917, charged with obstructing the sidewalk, and served three days of their 60-day sentence at Occoquan Workhouse before receiving a pardon from President Wilson.

500|$|The White House is {{also said}} to be visited by three specters who did not live there. The first is that of David Burns, who owned the ground on which the White House stands before selling it to the federal {{government}} in May 1791, and whose spirit has been seen in Oval Office. A reporter told a security guard during the Truman administration that, while standing in the Yellow Oval Room, he heard a faint ghostly voice which said, [...] "I'm Mr. Burns." [...] The second spirit is allegedly that of a British soldier dressed in a uniform from the War of 1812 and carrying a torch. In August 1814, a combined British land and sea force captured Washington, D.C., and set fire to the White House, Treasury Building, Capitol, and other buildings in retaliation for the American looting of York, Upper Canada (now the city of Toronto) and the burning of the Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada after the Battle of York in 1813. The fires were put out only when a hurricane and tornado passed through Washington the following day, extinguishing the blazes. The soldier is claimed {{to be one of those}} who burned the White House, or who lost his life the following day in the storm. Another shade alleged to visit the White House is the ghost of Anna Surratt, daughter of convicted Lincoln assassination co-conspirator Mary Surratt, who forced her way into the White House the night before her mother's execution and unsuccessfully begged for her mother's life. It is claimed by some White House staff that Anna's ghost returns to the White <b>House</b> <b>every</b> July 6, silently banging on the front door to seek entrance and continue her futile pleas for her mother's life.|$|E
