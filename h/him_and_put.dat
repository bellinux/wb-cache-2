Mulder—against Agent Kazdin's orders—tells Barry that he believes his story, convincing him to let two more hostages go. However, when Mulder questions whether Barry is lying, he becomes enraged.

25|$|In the sabbatical year of 2000, Bakshi-Doron became {{involved}} in a disagreement {{with some of the}} leading rabbis in Israel. In order to get around the Halakhic prohibitions of shmita, in which farmland must lie fallow once every seven years, some Sephardi and Zionist rabbis had allowed the use of land-sale contracts (heter mechira), through the use of which farmers could symbolically sell their land to non-Jews for the sabbatical year, thereby permitting them to continue farming. The permits immediately came under fire by Haredi rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv. Bakshi-Doron and Lau, with the support of former Sephardi Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, ruled that the permits were valid. When Bakshi-Doron publicly told the farmers that they could rely on the sales, the Haredi newspaper Yated Ne'eman began to leak word that Eliashiv would deligitimize <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> him and his family in herem (excommunication) if he refused to back down. Distraught, Bakshi-Doron went to meet with Israeli President Moshe Katsav, reportedly bursting into tears. Despite the open support of Katsav and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Bakshi-Doron ultimately succumbed to the pressure from Eliashiv. This was widely seen by the National Religious camp as surrender to the Haredim.|$|E

25|$|At 10:41, {{a second}} caller {{reported}} the incident, and {{was transferred to}} the State Police. At 10:55, Roberts was reaching the final stages of his plan. He had arranged the bound girls {{at the front of the}} classroom, near the chalkboard. Roberts made two cell phone calls, one to his wife and the next to police. He warned the 911 dispatcher that if state police were not off the property in two seconds, he would kill the children. The dispatcher attempted to delay <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> him in touch with the State Police, but Roberts ended the call. Two of the girls then began negotiating with Roberts. They pleaded for him to shoot them first. This allowed the girls a little extra time for possible rescue. At approximately 11:07a.m., Roberts followed through with his threats and the sound of rapid gunfire was heard. At 10:58, Mrs. Roberts called 911 after arriving home from a prayer study group meeting. She had discovered a suicide note left on the kitchen table and had received a brief and disturbing emotional phone call from her husband. The 911 dispatcher put her in touch with State Police.|$|E
25|$|Rosenblat, a Polish Jew, {{lived in}} the town of Piotrków Trybunalski before World War II. Following the {{invasion}} of Poland, the Nazis rounded up his family in 1939 along with thousands of others when the Piotrków Trybunalski Ghetto was set up. His father had previously died of typhus. Two years later, when Rosenblat was 12 years old, his mother was separated from <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> on a Holocaust train to Treblinka extermination camp during one of the ghetto liquidation actions. About 90% of the inhabitants of the ghetto were sent to Majdanek and Treblinka death camps. He later wrote that he lied to the Germans about his age because the Nazis used older boys for slave labor, and sent younger ones for extermination. In July 1944, with the front lines approaching, he was deported with his three older brothers to Schlieben sub-camp of the Buchenwald concentration camp, until February 1945. He claimed in his memoir that his future wife Roma, a nine-year-old Jewish girl hiding {{in the town of}} Schlieben with her family, threw him apples and bread over the electrified, guarded fence of the camp on a daily basis throughout the seven months' period.|$|E
25|$|After Phil {{is treated}} at a clinic, Alan confesses {{that he had}} drugged some of the marshmallows from the {{previous}} night with muscle relaxers and ADHD medication in order to sedate Teddy but accidentally mixed up the bags.

They notice something on Alan's stomach: an address and a time for a meeting. They meet a gangster named Kingsley, who demands Chow's bank account password by the next morning in exchange for Teddy.

After taking the code and leaving the monkey at a veterinary clinic, the group completes the deal with Kingsley. Suddenly, Interpol agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that the police had used the information that Teddy had disappeared to arrest Chow and Kingsley actually does not know where Teddy is.|$|E

Upon landing in Detroit, Abdulmutallab was arrested and taken to a hospital for treatment of his burns. On December28, 2009, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing.

500|$|Director Ardolino {{encouraged}} the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling, even if actors went [...] "off script". One {{example of this}} was the scene where Grey was {{to stand in front}} of Swayze with her back to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar to the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and tender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior annoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, [...] "as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film." ...|$|E
