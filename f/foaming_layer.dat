The thick coating realized by embedding optical fiber in polyurethane. A flexible composite fiber-optic interferometric acoustic sensor has been developed by wrapping single mode fiber in a winding manner and then embedding a fiber in a thin polyurethane layer. The acoustic sensitivity has to be found more in a frequency range of (2. 5 - 5. 0 KHz). In this paper we studied the structural and material properties of a mandrel sensor with <b>foaming</b> <b>layer</b> in such way to get the optimal performance. The sensor was found to be compatible with water. Also the performance of optical fiber is analytically verified using the MATLAB software. In this paper the design was simulated in ANSYS Cad Tool, to verify the sensitivity of the Optical Mach-Zehnder Interferometric Sensor for increased sensitivity.

40|$|Foaming {{incidents}} {{have been}} recorded in many biogas plants causing severe operational, economical and environmental problems (Kougias et al., 2014). However, the foaming phenomenon in biogas reactors fed with agro-industrial wastes has not been extensively investigated, especially {{with respect to the}} microbial composition of the digesters (Moeller et al., 2012). In the cited literature, {{it has been reported that}} specific microorganisms, which are mainly filamentous (e. g. Gordonia species, Microthrix parvicella), are attached to biogas bubbles and transferred to the air/liquid interface of sludge reactors or wastewater treatment works (Ganidi et al., 2009). Once these microorganisms accumulate on the liquid surface, they initiate biosurfactants production due to their metabolic activity, leading to the decrease of the surface tension and thus generate foaming. The aim of the present study was to investigate the microbial diversity in the liquid versus the <b>foaming</b> <b>layer</b> in manure-based biogas reactors suffering by foaming incidents in order to elucidate potential role and contribution of the microorganisms in foam promotion. The experimental work was carried out in three thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR) fed with manure and supplemental amounts of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Once foaming was formed in the reactors, samples from the liquid and <b>foaming</b> <b>layer</b> were obtained and screened using 16 S rDNA sequencing. The results of these analyses revealed that there are indeed some species that significantly vary their relative abundance in the <b>foaming</b> <b>layer</b> compared to the liquid one (e. g. Methanoculleus sp., Dialister sp.). However, based on the cited literature and to the best of our knowledge there was not a direct correlation of these species with foaming. Further investigation is needed in order to define the properties of these species on foam generation. Finally, it was observed that particles of barley plant (that was contained in the raw manure as ingredient of animal nutrition) were accumulated in the <b>foaming</b> <b>layer.</b> It has been previously documented that barley contributes in stabilization of beer foam due to the activity of one of its proteins (Brey et al., 2003). For that reason, it could be hypothesised that the existence of barley particles in our reactors could contribute in foaming although their presence was also prior to the foaming incidents; their effect on foam formation or stabilization might be enhanced in correlation with other parameters (i. e. presence of specific microorganisms).

30|$|The melt {{beneath the}} <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> convects, but the melt {{trapped in the}} foam is not replaced, so that the {{volcanic}} gas in the plume above the vent represents the pressure {{at the bottom of}} the <b>foam</b> <b>layer,</b> as denoted by the black-dashed line in Fig.  14 a–d. Such high-porosity foam does not generate a stress on the liquid-rich layer because of its low density. Thus, the pressure at the dashed line can be close to atmospheric pressure, explaining the estimated low-pressure range of 0.2 – 20  MPa by gas observations (Shinohara et al. 2018 b). The thermal conductivities of foams are usually low, and the <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> insulates the convecting liquid layer. The temperatures of the magma foam and magma column must approximately be constant. The pressure gradient within the <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> is quite small, making it difficult to estimate the depth and thickness of the <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> from the erupted products.

In the present study, possible correlation between foaming {{and the presence of}} specific microorganisms in biogas reactors was elucidated. The microbial ecology of continuous fed digesters overloaded with proteins, lipids and carbohydrates before and after foaming incidents was characterized using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Moreover, the microbial diversity between the liquid and <b>foaming</b> <b>layer</b> was assessed. A number of genera that are known to produce biosurfactants, contain mycolic acid in their cell wall, or decrease the surface tension of the media, increased their relative abundance after foam formation. Finally, a microorganism similar to widely known foaming bacteria (Nocardia and Desulfotomaculum) was found to increase its relative abundance in all reactors once foam was observed, regardless of the used substrate. These findings suggest that foaming and specific microorganisms might have direct association which requires to be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|Many {{types of}} fire-retardants {{are used in}} poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET, formulations, and two {{commercial}} fire retardants, Ukanol(TM) and Phosgard(TM), {{have been shown to}} improve significantly PET flame-retardancy when used as comonomers. Phosgard incorporates a phosphorus atom within the main chain whereas Ukanol incorporates a phosphorus atom as a pendent substituent. Despite their acknowledged effectiveness, the mode of action of these fire retardants remains unclear, and in this paper we present a comparison of the overall thermal degradation behaviour of PET and Ukanol and Phosgard fire retarded formulations. DSC and particularly TGA data show that both Ukanol and Phosgard have some stabilising influence on PET degradation, especially under oxidative conditions. TGA and pyrolysis experiments both clearly indicate that neither additive acts as a char promoter. Only the Phosgard formulation shows any release of volatile phosphorus species which could act in the gas phase. On the other hand, the most striking feature of the pyrolysis experiments is the macroscopic structure of the chars produced by the fire-retarded formulations, which hints at their fire-retardancy action - an open-cell charred foam was obtained upon charring at 400 °C or 600 °C. This <b>foaming</b> <b>layer</b> between the degrading melt and the flame would lower the amount of fuel available for combustion, and would also limit the feedback of heat to the condensed phase...|$|E

Continuous measurements allowed to discover the occurrence of gravity decreases {{before the onset of}} most fountaining episodes. We propose that the gravity changes are due to the pre-fountaining accumulation of a <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> at shallow levels in the plumbing system of the volcano. Relying on the relationship between amount of gas trapped in the foam and amount of gas emitted during each episode, we develop a conceptual model of the mechanism controlling the passage from Strombolian to lava fountaining activity. Gas leakage from the <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> during the late stages of its accumulation increases the gas volume fraction at upper levels, thus inducing a decrease of the magma-static pressure in the trapping zone and a further growth of the foam. This feedback mechanism eventually leads to the collapse of the <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> and to the onset of lava fountaining. The possibility to detect the development of a <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> at depth and to set quantitative constraints on the amount of trapped gas is important because of the implications for forecasting explosive eruptions and predicting their intensity...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{a theory}} has been {{developed}} which describes wave propagation in relatively stiff, partially reticulated polyurethane foams, the type most commonly used in noise control applications [J. S. Bolton and E. Gold, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. Suppl. 1, vol. 77, S 59 (1985) ]. A high impedance wave associated with the bulk mechanical properties of the foam matrix is usually significantly excited in these materials. As a consequence, the acoustical performance of finite depth <b>layers</b> of <b>foam</b> of this type is very sensitive to the boundary conditions which apply at {{the front and rear}} layer surfaces. Specifically, it will be shown in this paper that the action of a film facing is dependent on how it is attached to the <b>foam</b> <b>layer.</b> In addition it will be demonstrated that a small gap, e. g., 1 mm, separating a <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> from a hard backing can increase the low-frequency absorption dramatically.

In this study a direct-indirect hybrid implosion mode is discussed in heavy ion beam inertial confinement fusion (HIF) in order to release sufficient fusion energy in a robust manner. In the direct-indirect hybrid mode target, a low density <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> is inserted, and the radiation energy is confined in the <b>foam</b> <b>layer.</b> In the <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> the radiation transport is expected to smooth the HIB illumination non-uniformity in the lateral direction.

40|$|International audienceWhile {{the control}} of high {{frequency}} noise {{by the use of}} porous treatments is relatively straightforward, it is correspondingly difficult to control low frequency noise owing to the general requirement that a porous layer should be a significant fraction of a wavelength in depth. Thus, it is of interest to develop low frequency sound absorbing treatments that are relatively compact by the use of surface treatments. Here, we illustrate an approach, in which a surface film is cut, to allow the incident sound to communicate directly with the air within the foam behind the film facing. The present work was inspired by standing wave tube measurements of film-faced foams. It was found that measurements of unfaced <b>foam</b> <b>layers,</b> or of <b>foam</b> <b>layers</b> with a loosely attached film layer could be reproduced well by existing theories. However, when a film was bonded {{to the surface of the}} <b>foam</b> <b>layer,</b> the results did not conform to the expected values, and showed an anomalous absorption peak at relatively low frequencies. Upon careful examination of the experimental arrangement, it was noticed that there was a narrow gap around the circumference of the film facing: i. e., there was a leak around the edge of the sample. When that leak was sealed by using a bead of silicone sealant, the anomalous low frequency peak disappeared, and the absorption was then as expected for a continuous film-faced layer. Thus, it was apparent that the low frequency absorption peak was due to the presence of the thin gap around the circumference of the <b>foam</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|R

With foam-controlled experiments, emissivities of a foam-covered water surface at low SST (− 1. 4 °C to 1. 7 °C) are measured for varying SSS, foam thickness, incidence angle, and polarization. Furthermore, a theoretical model of emissivity is introduced by combining wave approach theory with the effective medium approximation method. Good agreement is obtained upon comparing theoretical emissivities with those of experiments. The results indicate that foam parameters have a strong influence on increasing emissivity of a foam-covered water surface.

40|$|AbstractThe {{propagation}} of compaction waves in <b>layered</b> metal <b>foam</b> materials subjected to impact loading is analysed {{in order to}} examine the mechanism of compaction and reveal the phenomena that develop at the interface between the <b>foam</b> <b>layers.</b> The analysis is focused on double-layered configurations in which the individual materials exhibit strain hardening in the quasi-static regime of loading. Complex patterns of compaction due to impact are revealed depending on the foam quasi-static stress–strain characteristics, sequence of layers and impact velocity. The compaction of the individual <b>foam</b> <b>layers</b> under an increasing and decreasing velocity is distinguished. It is established that either a strong discontinuity wave or a simple compression wave can start propagating from the layers interface inside the distal layer depending on the material properties. It is shown that a secondary compaction of the proximal <b>foam</b> <b>layer</b> is possible to occur due to the {{propagation of}} the reflected wave from the layers interface when a particular layer sequence is arranged.
