500|$|Instigated by Kushner's wife, Velvet Revolver reunited for a one-off {{performance}} with Scott Weiland at a benefit concert {{for the late}} John O'Brien, on January 12, 2012. Following a benefit show for the Road Recovery in 2011 with the other Velvet Revolver members, each one agreed to a one-off reunion before Kushner invited Weiland, who also agreed. Kushner also stated it was then unknown what Velvet Revolver's plans were for the future after the reunion show; [...] "I know everyone’s got other commitments, but I think everyone’s like, 'Let’s <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> done and get through this and then we’ll see.'".|$|E
500|$|When Bender {{first saw}} Gore's visual {{presentation}} he had concerns about connection with viewers, citing a [...] "need {{to find a}} personal way in." [...] In the string of interviews with Gore that followed, Gore himself felt like they [...] "were making Kill Al Vol. 3". Bender had other issues including a time frame that was [...] "grueling" [...] {{and needed to be}} done in [...] "{{a very short period of}} time" [...] despite many filming locations planned. These included many locations throughout the United States and also included China. [...] "It was a lot of travel in a very short period of time. And they had to <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> edited and cut starting in January, and ready to screen in May. That’s like a seriously tight schedule. So the logistics of pulling it off with a low budget were really difficult, and if there’s one person who gets credit, it’s Leslie Chilcott, because she really pulled it together." ...|$|E

It debuted at number forty-six on the Belgian Tip Chart, where it reached {{a peak of}} number twenty-four. On the Dutch singles chart, the track debuted at number eighty-one and peaked at twenty-six. On the UK Singles Chart, [...] "Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)" [...] debuted at number fourteen, {{becoming}} Furtado's highest charting single since 2006's All Good Things (Come to an End). On the North American Billboard charts, the song became Furtado's first since 2010's [...] "Night Is Young" [...] to not enter the Billboard Hot 100. However, [...] "Big Hoops (Bigger the Better)" [...] reached the top forty of the Pop Songs chart and the top ten of the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Smith felt the underperformance was helped by moving The Spirit Indestructibles release date, [...] "so there’s no need to <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> that supposed to be this club banger intro track and force it up the chart." ...|$|E

500|$|Brian Riordan, {{one of the}} {{engineers}} who worked on mastering the audio for the DVD described in a video interview with Rolling Stone how the mix was achieved. He recalled getting a call {{from one of the}} show's producers who were looking for specialized sound arrangements to acquire an authentic live concert feeling for the release. Riordan remembered that the main difficulty was trying to preserve the [...] "craziness" [...] of the audience and Gaga's fans, and their screaming during the concert, nevertheless make the music of the show primary. His team used Lossy which did not use compression, instead one-to-one audio mixing giving the whole sound system [...] "much more of an impactful experience". Riordan decided to engineer the concert sound as [...] "center-channeled" [...] since Gaga did not use backing audio, resulting in the listener getting the whole impact of her vocals, when listened with a headphone. Other difficulty faced by team included converting the heavy production of Gaga's songs to a live format and utilizing the singer's bands. [...] "You also have the crowd, the house [...] going nuts and all the reverberations at Madison Square Garden, so it was really difficult for me to figure out globally how real, how dry, how punchy can we <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> to sound", he added. Initially Riordan had featured more of the live instrumentation and mixed the songs a number of times, however felt that they needed a dry reverb hence he pondered on the mix along with co-producer coming to a consensus regarding the sound. According to Riordan, the mixing process was approved by Gaga who watched the cuts while travelling on the tour however, she did not ask Riordan to change anything, unlike previous projects the engineer had undertaken. The 5.1 mix was further orchestrated by using the sound recordings from the microphones placed around the audience members in Madison Square Garden, giving a new dimension to the surround sound in the Blu-ray.|$|E

He would have to pitch it strong in his speech at the general meeting. With freights so low, there {{was bound to be}} opposition. No dash nowadays; nothing but gabby caution!

40|$|Most {{software}} engineering approaches restrict the user interface to everything a user may perceive or experience. As a result, {{it is often}} designed rather independently of the system's functionality. Chances are then {{that it does not}} get the attention it deserves. In the approach to software development we sketch, the design of the user interface and the design of the functionality go hand in hand. We give a number of examples of user interface problems, and illustrate how these can be caught early if a more integrated approach is taken. We conclude with an outline of a minimal course on human-computer interaction that we feel should be part of everyone's {{software engineering}} curriculum. 1 Introduction We can't worry about these user interface issues now. We haven't even <b>gotten</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> to work yet! [Mulligan et al., 1991] The user interface of a system is important.

60|$|Within a {{month after}} washing the faces and combing the hair of all her {{brothers}} and sisters who would suffer it at her hands, Clementina's own head was under the brush of a lady's maid, who was of as great a discreetness {{in her own way}} as Clementina herself. She supplied the defects of Mrs. Lander's elementary habits by simply asking if she should <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> and that thing for the toilet, without criticising its absence,--and then asking whether she should get the same things for her young lady. She appeared to let Mrs. Lander decide between having her brushes in ivory or silver, but there was really no choice for her, and they came in silver. She knew not only her own place, but the places of her two ladies, and she presently had them in such training that they were as proficient in what they might and might not do for themselves and for each other, as if making these distinctions were the custom of their lives.|$|E

5000|$|With {{regard to}} the lack of {{connection}} between U.S. forces and the general public, Powers has said: [...] "But I also felt powerful resentment that it seemed like nobody cared that we had <b>gotten</b> into <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> without thinking what the consequences would be...In some ways, the dialogue itself is missing. It seems the public conversation has disappeared. There are still soldiers in Afghanistan right now. There might be a wounded soldier as we speak who is feeling his life slipping away from him.

6000|$|Fulkerson {{came back}} to March, who had turned toward Conrad Dryfoos, and said, [...] "If we don't <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> going pretty soon, it 'll be the death of me," [...] and just then Frescobaldi's butler came in and {{announced}} to Dryfoos that dinner was served. The old man looked toward Fulkerson with a troubled glance, {{as if he did}} not know what to do; he made a gesture to touch Lindau's elbow. Fulkerson called out, [...] "Here's Colonel Woodburn, Mr. Dryfoos," [...] as if Dryfoos were looking for him; and he set the example of what he was to do by taking Lindau's arm himself. [...] "Mr. Lindau is going to sit at my end of the table, alongside of March. Stand not upon the order of your going, gentlemen, but fall in at once." [...] He contrived to get Dryfoos and the colonel before him, and he let March follow with Kendricks. Conrad came last with Beaton, who had been turning over the music at the piano, and chafing inwardly at the whole affair. At the table Colonel Woodburn was placed on Dryfoos's right, and March on his left. March sat on Fulkerson's right, with Lindau next him; and the young men occupied the other seats.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{hitherto}} carefully restricted myself, {{in speaking}} of exchange, {{to the use}} of the term [...] "advantage;" [...] but that term includes two ideas: the advantage, namely, of getting what we need, and that of getting what we wish for. Three-fourths of the demands existing in the world are romantic; founded on visions, idealisms, hopes, and affections; and the regulation of the purse is, in its essence, regulation of the imagination and the heart. Hence, the right discussion of the nature of price is a very high metaphysical and psychical problem; sometimes to be solved only in a passionate manner, as by David in his counting the price of the water of the well by the gate of Bethlehem; but its first conditions are the following:--The price of anything is the quantity of labour given by the person desiring it, in order to obtain possession of it. This price depends on four variable quantities. A. The quantity of wish the purchaser has for the thing; opposed to [Greek: a], the quantity of wish the seller has to keep it. B. The quantity of labour the purchaser can afford, to obtain the thing; opposed to [Greek: b], the quantity of labour the seller can afford, to keep it. These quantities are operative only in excess; i.e., the quantity of wish (A) means the quantity of wish for this thing, above wish for other things; and the quantity of work (B) means the quantity which can be spared to <b>get</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> from the quantity needed to get other things.|$|E

Anyone {{else would have}} pulled in his horns and gone slow for a spell, but he's one of those fellows whose horse {{is always going to}} win the next race. The big killing is always just round the corner with him. Funny how you can see what a chump a man is and yet love him to death... I {{remember}} saying something like that to you before... He thought he could get it all back by staging this fight of his that came off in Jersey City last night. And if everything had gone right he might have got afloat again. But it seems as if he can't touch anything without it turning to mud. On the very day before the fight was to come off, the poor mutt who was going against the champion goes and lets a sparring-partner of his own knock him down and fool around with him. With all the newspaper men there too! You probably saw about it in the papers. It made a great story for them. Well, that killed the whole thing. The public had never been any too sure that this fellow Bugs Butler had a chance of putting up a scrap with the champion that would be worth paying to see; and, when they read that he couldn't even stop his sparring-partners slamming him all around the place they simply decided to stay away. Poor old Fill! It was a finisher for him. The house wasn't a quarter full, and after he'd paid these two pluguglies their guarantees, which they insisted on having before they'd so much as go into the ring, he was just about cleaned out. So there you are!" ...|$|E
