In preparation for the Philippines Campaign, General MacArthur moved the advanced element of GHQ to Hollandia in Dutch West Papua, where it opened in late August 1944. To maintain contact with GHQ, Blamey formed a new headquarters, Forward Echelon LHQ, which opened at Hollandia on 7 September under Berryman, who became Blamey's personal representative at GHQ. Forward Echelon LHQ subsequently moved with GHQ to Leyte in February 1945, and Manila in April 1945. Berryman's role was to [...] "safeguard Australian interests" [...] at GHQ, but he also defended GHQ against criticism from the Australian Army. As well as liaising with GHQ, Forward Echelon LHQ became responsible for planning operations involving Australian troops. It worked on plans for operations on Luzon and Mindanao before it was finally decided that Borneo would be the Australian Army's next objective. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Berrymen kept {{in close contact with}} Blamey, and the two were Australian Army representatives at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay in September 1945.

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- on an A+ to F scale.

[...] However, McGee continued, [...] "Much less successful was anything involving Chuck's bachelor party and Big Mike/Jeffster's subsequent desire to save their manly weekend." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that [...] "the best element <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was the introduction of Volkoff, or make that Hartley Winterbottom's, mother and the bonding that occurred between her and John Casey." [...] HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode [...] "was kind of a [...] It's a transitional episode setting up the end game with Volkoff that the season's final two episodes will focus on, but it also felt like an hour [...] two or three different ideas that nobody could quite flesh out to fill up an entire episode, and so were compressed together."

500|$|About this time, {{the amount}} of trade handled by the Port of Lancaster was declining, largely owing to silting up of the River Lune. [...] In May 1842 Sharpe had been elected a Port Commissioner, and later {{proposed}} what became the Morecambe Bay Harbour Project. [...] This planned {{to build a new}} port at Poulton-le-Sands (soon to become part of Morecambe), and link it to Lancaster by means of a ship canal. [...] After prolonged discussion this proved to be too expensive, and it was agreed to link Lancaster and Morecambe by railway rather than by canal. [...] An Act for the creation of the Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company (MH) received Royal assent in July 1846, the revised plan being to link this line to the [...] "L"NWR at Green Ayre, {{in the northern part of}} Lancaster next to the River Lune. [...] A clause in the Act allowed the MH to be sold to the [...] "L"NWR, which took place in October. The parts played by Sharpe <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> financial manoeuvring were conflicting and complex: he was simultaneously a Port Commissioner, a Town Councillor, a member of the board of the Morecambe Bay Harbour Company, and Secretary to the [...] "L"NWR. In 1847, near the Morecambe terminus of the railway, Sharpe laid the first stone of the North Western Hotel (later the Midland), which he (or more probably Paley) had designed. In April that year Sharpe had resigned as Secretary to the [...] "L"NWR to enable him to tender for building the line from Morecambe to Wennington, a village north-east of Lancaster near to the Yorkshire border. His tender of £100,000 (equivalent to £ as of [...] ) for the line (excluding the bridge over the River Lune at Green Ayre) was accepted. [...] He also gained the contract for building the harbour. In June 1848 the section of line from Lancaster to Morecambe was opened, and by October 1849 the ten-mile section from Lancaster to Wennington was completed. In September Sharpe had also resigned as a director of the [...] "L"NWR to become its traffic manager, and was then contracted to manufacture and supply rolling stock for the railway, something for which he had neither expertise nor previous experience. [...] By February 1851 the line was experiencing difficulties, its traffic being less than expected and its costs rising; and in December Sharpe was given notice that his contract with the company would be curtailed the following month.|$|E

2500|$|Both Akiva and the [...] "Ishmaelic Akher" [...] traded {{upon the}} [...] "two-thrones"/"two-powers"-in-Heaven motif in their {{respective}} Merkabah-oriented undertakings. Akiva's version is memorialized in the Babylonian Gemara to tractate Hagigah at 14a-ii wherein Akiva puts forth the pairing of God and [...] "David" [...] in a messianic version of that mystical motif. Immediately after this Akivian [...] "solution" [...] to the puzzle of thrones referred to in Song of Songs and the two thrones spoken of in Daniel, Chapter , the text presents Akiva as being pressured—and then acquiescing to—a domesticated version of this twoness theme for the single Jewish God which would be acceptable to Rabbinic officialdom. The text offers Justice [...] and Charity [...] as the middot of God which are enthroned in Heaven. [...] Akher's non-Messianic and Metatron-oriented version of this [...] "two-thrones"/"two-powers"-in-Heaven motif is discussed at length in the entry [...] "Paradigmatia" [...] of the above-mentioned study. The generic point <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is {{that by the time}} of the final editing of the Mishna this whole motif (along with other dimensions of Merkabah-oriented study and practice) came to be severely discouraged by Rabbinic officialdom. Those who still pursued these kinds of things were marginalized by the Rabbinic Movement over the next several centuries becoming, in effect, a separate grouping responsible for the Hekhalot literature.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inference}} <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is {{that the}} area where the samples came from was the [...] "telegraphic plateau" [...] as called by Maury who had sent out ships to sound those depths at two hundred mile intervals from Newfoundland to Ireland. Maury had charted the underwater mountain ridge. The microscopic organisms left the sea floor on this [...] "telegraphic plateau" [...] were deep and soft so that the area was that of a long mountain chain with the top of those underwater mountains having a firm and soft coating of these dead organisms. This meant that the area was deep enough that no ship's anchor nor any fisherman's net would drag the area. The fact that there was no abrasion on these minute organisms meant that there were no strong currents in that area at that depth. Soon after publishing this, Cyrus West Field wrote to Maury of the USNO on the feasibility of laying a transatlantic cable and was given a positive reply and later details explanation face to face. Cyrus Field also contacted Samuel Morse regarding the feasibility of transmitting an electric current a distance of [...] underwater. Again, Field was given an affirmative and soon visited Morse. Cyrus Field continued contacting these two men, Maury and Morse, gathering all possible information and offered them shares in his great adventure that would become a reality in 1858 when the Queen of the United Kingdom communicated with President Buchanan in Morse code through the transatlantic cable.|$|E

2500|$|García Moreno {{came to the}} {{presidency}} of a country with an empty treasury and an enormous debt. To overcome this, he placed the government on stringent economy and abolished many positions, as well as cutting out the corruption which siphoned off tax money. As a result, {{he was able to}} provide Ecuadoreans with more for less. [...] This improved the financial status of the country and attracted foreign investment. The army was reformed, with officers being sent to Prussia to study, and illiterate recruits taught basic skills. Houses of prostitution were closed, and hospitals opened in all the major towns. Railroads and national highways were built, the telegraph extended, and the postal and water systems improved. City streets were paved and local bandits suppressed. These public works projects were accomplished in part through the use of revenues obtained from the trabajo subsidario tax, a tax initially created to aid the funding of local works projects. The trabajo subsidario tax in many ways mirrored the colonial mita labor requirements demanded of Indians by Spaniards. [...] The voluntary contributions law and trabajo subsidario tax, revived in 1854, required that every citizen contribute four days of unpaid work to the state yearly or its monetary equivalent to promote the nation's public works projects. Like its mita precursor, the trabajo subsidario obligation fell most heavily on Ecuador's indigenous populations since these groups were unable to pay to avoid labor. [...] Estate-bound peons were able to find protection from these laws through the help of hacendado or essential paternal landlords. [...] In 1862, in a somewhat contentious move, García Moreno demanded control of these revenues of this tax in order to direct funds towards his ambitions for major infrastructural reform. This created a great deal of local discontent, as this meant diverting funds from more locally based public works projects. [...] Using these funds, García Moreno began his famous highway system project, contracting workers from the trabajo subsidario requirement to build these roads. [...] Although the ultimate results of the project are often praised, García Moreno has been criticized for his use of [...] "forced" [...] labor to build these highways and the overall discriminatory and abusive treatment of indigenous workers during the process of construction. [...] In his chronicle, Four years among the Ecuadorians, Friedrich Hassaurek describes witnessing the building of the road from Quito to Guayaquil. [...] He describes the [...] "lamentable sight" [...] of Indians laboring to build the roads without sufficient tools. [...] Hassurek writes, [...] " [...] does not work voluntarily, not even when paid for his labor, but is pressed into the service of the government for a length of time, at the expiration of which he is discharged and another forced into his place. [...] He works unwillingly, is kept to his task by the whip of the overseer. [...] It is evident that but little progress could be made under these circumstances." [...] Along with a variety of notable public works programs, García Moreno reformed the universities, established two polytechnic and agricultural colleges and a military school, and increased the number of primary schools from 200 to 500. The number of primary students grew from 8000 to 32,000. To staff the enormously expanded health-care and educational facilities, foreign religious were brought <b>in.</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was done while expanding the franchise and guaranteeing equal rights under the law to every Ecuadorean.|$|E
