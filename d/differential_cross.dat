40|$|We categorify {{the notion}} of an infinitesimal {{braiding}} in a linear strict symmetric monoidal category, leading to {{the notion of}} a (strict) infinitesimal 2 -braiding in a linear symmetric strict monoidal 2 -category. We describe the associated categorification of the 4 -term relation, leading to six categorified relations. We prove that any infinitesimal 2 -braiding gives rise to a flat and fake flat 2 -connection in the configuration space of $n$ particles in the complex plane, hence to a categorification of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov connection. We discuss infinitesimal 2 -braidings in a 2 -category naturally assigned to every <b>differential</b> <b>crossed</b> module, leading to the notion of a quasi-invariant tensor in a <b>differential</b> <b>crossed</b> module.

Practically {{the first one is}} valid for small particles whereas the second one works for large particles. Klett and Sutherland (Klett JD, Sutherland RA. App. Opt. 1992; 31 : 373) proved that the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin or WKB approximation leads to accurate values of the <b>differential</b> scattering <b>cross</b> section of sphere and cylinder over a wide range of size. In this paper we extend the work of Klett and Sutherland by proposing a method allowing a fast calculation of the <b>differential</b> scattering <b>cross</b> section for any shape of particle with a given orientation and illuminated by unpolarized light. Our method is based on a geometrical approximation of the particle by replacing each geometrical cross section by an ellipse and then by exactly evaluating the <b>differential</b> scattering <b>cross</b> section of the newly generated body.

This suggests that the superconformal field theory is closely related to higher gauge theory, describing the parallel transport of extended objects. In-deed we find that, under certain restrictions, the field content and gauge trans-formations reduce to those of higher gauge theory.
