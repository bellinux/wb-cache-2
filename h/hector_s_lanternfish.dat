40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{challenges}} of providing load balancing and fault-tolerant external links between ad-hoc multicast mesh networks. The work is the gateway component of a research platform called FluidVoice, a wireless audio communication system. This system consists of nodes forming a broadcast mesh based on 802. 11. Some of these nodes called Stargates {{have the capability to}} communicate to the external world. The problem is that these gateways can fail or lose capacity unexpectedly. In this work we explore the ways to provide communications to the external world under unexpected gateway node failures, and variance of load. We propose and evaluate a distributed algorithm designed to form this robust and balanced interconnection. The algorithm is designed with robustness in mind, and takes into account failures in the outbound links as well as between the gateways, and it is focused to support real-time applications running over it. In this thesis we show that by adopting this algorithm, we can provide a reliable connection to the end-user even as gateways presence or capacity varies. The prototype version has about 20 ms of additional transmission time in average, with an overhead of about 5 % to 35 % depending on the packet size, and a recovery time of 1 to 3 seconds. The redundant traffic generated in intermediate steps of the optimization problem can grow up proportionally to the number of participating gateway nodes, and reduces quickly to only the required amount of traffic. by <b>Hector</b> Yuen.

40|$|Surveillance for {{lyme disease}} [...] United States, 1992 - 1998 : "PROBLEM/CONDITION: Lyme disease {{is caused by}} {{infection}} with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States. Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes scapularis and I. pacificus ticks. Lyme disease is typically evidenced in its early stage by a characteristic rash (erythema migrans), accompanied by nonspecific symptoms (e. g., fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia). Lyme disease can usually be treated successfully with standard antibiotic regimens. REPORTING PERIOD: 1992 - 1998. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Lyme disease surveillance data are reported to CDC through the National Electronic Telecommunication System for Surveillance, a computerized public health database for nationally notifiable diseases. During 1992 - 1998, data regarding reported cases of Lyme disease included county and state of residence, age, sex, and date of onset. Descriptive analyses were performed, and cumulative incidence by state, county, age group, and sex were calculated. RESULTS: During 1992 - 1998, a total of 88, 967 cases of Lyme disease was reported to CDC by 49 states and the District of Columbia, {{with the number of}} cases increasing from 9, 896 in 1992 to 16, 802 in 1998. A total of 92 % of cases was reported from eight northeastern and mid-Atlantic states and two north-central states. Children aged 5 - 9 years and adults aged 45 - 54 years had the highest mean annual incidence. INTERPRETATION: Lyme disease is a highly focal disease, with the majority of reported cases occurring in the northeastern and north-central United States. The number of reported cases of Lyme disease increased during 1992 - 1998. Geographic and seasonal patterns of disease correlate with the distribution and feeding habits of the vector ticks, I. scapularis and I. pacificus. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: The results presented in this report will help clinicians evaluate the prior probability of Lyme disease and provide the framework for targeting human Lyme disease vaccine use and other prevention and treatment interventions. " - p. 1 Surveillance for influenza [...] United States, 1994 - 95, 1995 - 96, and 1996 - 97 seasons: "PROBLEM/CONDITION: Influenza epidemics occur nearly every year during the winter months and are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in the United States, including an average of approximately 114, 000 hospitalizations and 20, 000 deaths per year. REPORTING PERIOD: This report summarizes U. S. influenza surveillance data from October 1994 through May 1997, from both active and passive surveillance systems. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: During the period covered, CDC received weekly reports from October through May from a) state and territorial epidemiologists on estimates of local influenza activity, b) approximately 140 sentinel physicians on their total number of patient visits and the number of cases of influenza-like illness (ILI), and c) approximately 70 World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating laboratories in the United States on weekly influenza virus isolations. WHO collaborating laboratories also submitted influenza isolates to CDC for antigenic analysis. Throughout the year, vital statistics offices in 121 cities reported deaths related to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) weekly, providing a measure of the impact of influenza on mortality. RESULTS: During the 1994 - 95 influenza season, 25 state epidemiologists reported regional or widespread activity {{at the peak of the}} season. Cases of ILI reported by sentinel physicians exceeded baseline levels for 4 weeks, peaking at 5 %. Influenza A(H 3 N 2) was the most frequently isolated influenza virus type/subtype. The longest period of sustained excess mortality was 5 consecutive weeks, when the percentage of deaths attributed to P&I exceeded the epidemic threshold, peaking at 7. 6 %. During the 1995 - 96 season, 33 state epidemiologists reported regional or widespread activity at the peak of the season. ILI cases exceeded baseline levels for 5 weeks, peaking at 7 %. Influenza A(H 1 N 1) viruses predominated, although influenza A(H 3 N 2) and influenza B viruses also were identified throughout the United States. P&I mortality exceeded the epidemic threshold for 6 consecutive weeks, peaking at 8. 2 %. The 1996 - 97 season was the most severe of the three seasons summarized in this report. Thirty-nine state epidemiologists reported regional or widespread activity at the peak of the season. ILI reports exceeded baseline levels for 5 consecutive weeks, peaking at 7 %. The proportion of respiratory specimens positive for influenza peaked at 34 %, with influenza A(H 3 N 2) viruses predominating. Influenza B viruses were identified throughout the United States, but only one influenza A(H 1 N 1) virus isolate was reported overall. The proportion of deaths attributed to P&I exceeded the epidemic threshold for 10 consecutive weeks, peaking at 9. 1 %. INTERPRETATION: Influenza A(H 1 N 1), A(H 3 N 2), and B viruses circulated during 1994 - 1997. Local surveillance data are important because of geographic and temporal differences in the circulation of influenza types/subtypes. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: CDC conducts active national surveillance annually from October through May for influenza to detect the emergence and spread of influenza virus variants and monitor the impact of influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Surveillance data are provided weekly throughout the influenza season to public health officials, WHO, and health-care providers and can be used to guide prevention and control activities, vaccine strain selection, and patient care.

40|$|The {{birth of}} the detective genre {{in the early nineteenth}} century was propitiated by the modern discourses of classification, {{empiricism}} and order; the new sciences of sociology, psychology and forensic medicine; and industrial capitalism. The defining element of the Hispanic detective genre, especially in the post- 1968 neopoliciaco, is its concern with the failure of the liberal project embodied in these Enlightenment paradigms. Doubly marginalied, Latin American detective fiction is a response to problems of Latin American modernity, modernism, and postmodernity. Detective writers Leonardo Padura Fuentes and Paco Ignacio Taibo II take up the problem on both ideological and aesthetic terms: Padura as a way of confronting the apparently irreconcilable aspects of premodernity and postmodernity in the Cuban predicament, and Taibo in an attempt to redefine the terms of nationalism by subverting the cultural, political and economic discourses of modernity that have ravaged Mexican society. In the aesthetic realm, Taibo and Padura reach beyond the boundaries of genre and nation, using a variety of techniques [...] intertextuality, parody, pastiche [...] to interrogate their modernity. ^ The autochthonous detective novel appeared in Mexico and Cuba at approximately the same chronological moment, but under quite different political circumstances. The socialist crime novel was introduced by the Cuban government in 1971 for propaganda purposes. Chapter 3, focusing on works by Padura, Luis Rogelio Nogueras, Justo Vasco and Rodolfo Perez Valero, analyzes the role of gender in the construction of revolutionary metaphors. Recent events have contributed to a reevaluation of the genre and its transformation into a more critical form of expression. In contrast with Cuba, 1969 marked a moment of severe disillusinment with the ideals of the Revolution in Mexico, following the massacre at the Plaza de Tres Culturas. Chapter 4 examines the roles of violence and nationalism in the Mexican detective novel, focusing on Rafael Bernal 2 ̆ 7 s El Complot Mongol (the first example of the 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 crime novel), Jorge Ibarguengoitia 2 ̆ 7 s Las muertas, and Taibo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Hector</b> Belascoaran Shayne novels. ...|$|R
40|$|Surveillance {{for chronic}} fatigue {{syndrome}} : four U. S. cities, September 1989 through August 1993 : PROBLEM/CONDITION: Although {{chronic fatigue syndrome}} (CFS) has been recognized {{as a cause of}} morbidity in the United States, the etiology of CFS is unknown. In addition, information is incomplete concerning the clinical spectrum and prevalence of CFS in the United States. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes CFS surveillance data collected in four U. S. cities from September 1989 through August 1993. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: A physician-based surveillance system for CFS was established in four U. S. metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Georgia; Wichita, Kansas; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Reno, Nevada. The objectives of this surveillance system were to collect descriptive epidemiologic information from patients who had unexplained chronic fatigue, estimate the prevalence and incidence of CFS in defined populations, and describe the clinical course of CFS. Patients aged > or = 18 years who had had unexplained, debilitating fatigue or chronic unwellness for at least 6 months were referred by their physicians to a designated health professional(s) in their area. Those patients who participated in the surveillance system a) were interviewed by the health professional(s); b) completed a self-administered questionnaire that included their demographic information, medical history, and responses to the Beck Depression Inventory, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, and the Sickness Impact Profile; c) submitted blood and urine samples for laboratory testing; and d) agreed to a review of their medical records. On the basis of this information, patients were assigned to one of four groups: those whose illnesses met the criteria of the 1988 CFS case definition (Group I); those whose fatigue or symptoms did not meet the criteria for CFS (Group II); those who had had an identifiable psychological disorder before onset of fatigue (Group III); and those who had evidence of other medical conditions that could have caused fatigue (Group IV). Patients assigned to Group III were further evaluated to determine the group to which they would have been assigned had psychological illness not been present, the epidemiologic characteristics of the illness and the frequency of symptoms among patients were evaluated, and the prevalence and incidence of CFS were estimated for each of the areas. RESULTS: Of the 648 patients referred to the CFS surveillance system, 565 (87 %) agreed to participate. Of these, 130 (23 %) were assigned to Group I; 99 (18 %), Group II; 235 (42 %), Group III; and 101 (18 %), Group IV. Of the 130 CFS patients, 125 (96 %) were white and 111 (85 %) were women. The mean age of CFS patients at the onset of illness was 30 years, and the mean duration of illness {{at the time of the}} interview was 6. 7 years. Most (96 %) CFS patients had completed high school, and 38 % had graduated from college. The median annual household income/for CFS patients was $ 40, 000. In the four cities, the age-, sex-, and race-adjusted prevalences of CFS for the 4 -year surveillance period ranged from 4. 0 to 8. 7 per 100, 000 population. The age-adjusted 4 -year prevalences of CFS among white women ranged from 8. 8 to 19. 5 per 100, 000 population. INTERPRETATION: The results of this surveillance system were similar to those in previously published reports of CFS. Additional studies should be directed toward determining whether the data collected in this surveillance system were subject to selection bias (e. g., education and income levels might have influenced usage of the health-care system, and the populations of these four surveillance sites might not be representative of the U. S. population). ACTIONS TAKEN: In February 1997, CDC began a large-scale, cross-sectional study at one surveillance site (Wichita) to describe more completely the magnitude and epidemiology of unexplained chronic fatigue and CFS. Malaria surveillance : United States, 1993 : PROBLEM/CONDITION: Malaria is caused by infection with one of four species of Plasmodium (P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae), which are transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles sp. mosquito. Most malaria cases in the United States occur among persons who have traveled to areas (i. e., other countries) in which disease transmission is ongoing. However, cases are transmitted occasionally through exposure to infected blood products, by congenital transmission, or by local mosquito-borne transmission. Malaria surveillance is conducted to identify episodes of local transmission and to guide prevention recommendations. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: Cases with onset of illness during 1993. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Malaria cases confirmed by blood smear are reported to local and/or state health departments by health-care providers and/or laboratories. Case investigations are conducted by local and/or state health departments, and the reports are transmitted to CDC. RESULTS: CDC received reports of 1, 275 cases of malaria in persons in the United States and its territories who had onset of symptoms during 1993; this number represented a 40 % increase over the 910 malaria cases reported for 1992. P. vivax, P. falciparum, P. ovale, and P. malariae were identified in 52 %, 36 %, 4 %, and 3 % of cases, respectively. The species was not determined in the remaining 5 % of cases. The 278 malaria cases in U. S. military personnel represented the largest number of such cases since 1972; 234 of these cases were diagnosed in persons returning from deployment in Somalia during Operation Restore Hope. In New York City, the number of reported cases increased from one in 1992 to 130 in 1993. The number of malaria cases acquired in Africa by U. S. civilians increased by 45 % from 1992; of these, 34 % had been acquired in Nigeria. The 45 % increase primarily reflected cases reported by New York City. Of U. S. civilians who acquired malaria during travel, 75 % had not used a chemoprophylactic regimen recommended by CDC for the area in which they had traveled. Eleven cases of malaria had been acquired in the United States: of these cases, five were congenital; three were induced; and three were cryptic, including two cases that were probably locally acquired mosquito-borne infections. Eight deaths were associated with malarial infection. INTERPRETATION: The increase in the reported number of malaria cases was attributed to a) the number of infections acquired during military deployment in Somalia and b) complete reporting for the first time of cases from New York City. ACTIONS TAKEN: Investigations were conducted to collect detailed information concerning the eight fatal cases and the 11 cases acquired in the United States. Malaria prevention guidelines were updated and disseminated to health-care providers. Persons who have a fever or influenza-like illness after returning from a malarious area should seek medical care, regardless of whether they took antimalarial chemoprophylaxis during their stay. The medical evaluation should include a blood smear examination for malaria. Malaria can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated rapidly. Recommendations concerning prevention and treatment of malaria can be obtained from CDC. Tetanus surveillance : United States, 1991 - 1994 : PROBLEM/CONDITION: Despite the widespread availability of a safe and effective vaccine against tetanus, 201 cases of the disease were reported during 1991 - 1994. Of patients with known illness outcome, the case-fatality rate was 25 %. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 1991 - 1994. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Physician-diagnosed cases of tetanus are reported to local and state health departments, the latter of which reports these cases on a weekly basis to CDC's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Since 1965, state health departments also have submitted supplemental clinical and epidemiologic information to CDC's National Immunization Program. RESULTS: During 1991 - 1994, 201 cases of tetanus were reported from 40 states, for an average annual incidence of 0. 02 cases per 100, 000 population. Of the 188 patients for whom age was known, 101 (54 %) were aged > or = 60 years and 10 (5 %) were aged or = 80 years was more than 10 times greater than the risk for persons aged 20 - 29 years. All deaths occurred among persons aged > or = 30 years. The case-fatality rate (overall: 25 %) increased with age, from 11 % in persons aged 30 - 49 years to 54 % in persons aged > or = 80 years. Only 12 % of all patients were reported to have received a primary series of tetanus toxoid before onset of illness. For 77 % of patients, tetanus occurred after an acute injury was sustained. Of patients who obtained medical care for their injury, only 43 % received tetanus toxoid as part of wound prophylaxis. INTERPRETATION: The epidemiology of reported tetanus in the United States during 1991 - 1994 was similar to that during the 1980 s. Tetanus continued to be a severe disease primarily of older adults who were unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated. Most tetanus cases occurred after an acute injury was sustained, emphasizing the need for appropriate wound management. ACTIONS TAKEN: In addition to decennial booster doses of tetanus-diphtheria toxoid during adult life, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccination visits for adolescents at age 11 - 12 years and for adults at age 50 years to enable health-care providers to review vaccination histories and administer any needed vaccine. Full implementation of the ACIP recommendations should virtually eliminate the remaining tetanus burden in the United States. Surveillance for chronic fatigue syndrome : four U.
