40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} dynamic {{supplier}} alliances in a decentralized assembly system. We examine {{a supply chain}} in which n suppliers sell complementary components to a downstream assembler, who faces a price-sensitive deterministic demand. We analyze alliance/coalition for-mation between suppliers, using a two stage approach. In Stage 1, suppliers form coalitions that each agree to sell a <b>kit</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> to the assembler. In Stage 2, coalitions make wholesale price decisions, while the assembler buys the components (kits) from the coalitions and sets the selling price of the product. Stage 2 is modeled as a competitive game, in which the primary competition is vertical (i. e., supplier coalitions compete against the downstream assembler), and the secondary competition is horizontal, in that coalitions compete against each other. Here, we consider three modes of competition – Supplier Stackelberg, Vertical Nash, and Assembler Stackelberg models – which correspond to different power structures in the market. In Stage 1, we analyze the stability of coalition structures. We assume that suppliers are farsighted, that is, each coalition considers the possibility that once it acts, another coalition may react, and a third coalition might in turn react, and so on. Using this framework, we predict the structure of possible supplier alliances, {{as a function of}} the power structure in the market, the number of suppliers, and the structure of the demand. 1...|$|E
50|$|Early {{examples}} include the Altair 8800 from the United States and the later British Newbear 77-68 and Nascom designs from the late 70's and early 80's. Some were made from <b>kits</b> <b>of</b> <b>components,</b> or simply distributed as board designs like the Ferguson Big Board. The Altair 8800 pioneered the S-100 bus which somewhat simplified the process. Ultimately, the development of home computers, the IBM PC (and its derivatives and clones), and the industry <b>of</b> specialized <b>component</b> suppliers that grew up around this market in the mid 80's have made building computers much easier. Computer building is no longer limited to specialists. Computers based on Apple Macintosh and Amiga computer platforms often can not be built in general by users legally because of patents and licenses for their hardware, firmware, and software.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Copying code from {{existing}} designs {{does not work}} well as a strategy for reuse. Gluing components that were never designed to work together produces clumsy and inflexible designs. Real flexibility is achieved with coherent <b>kits</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> from which families of products can be constructed. What are the design methods we should use to choose components? What constitutes a "coherent kit", {{and how do we}} define one? How do we cope with the reality of existing assets? How do we work out how to couple components developed to different standards? This chapter outlines how to define component kits using the Catalysis techniques [1]. Catalysis is an approach to component-based development that is gaining increasing use among industrial developers <b>of</b> <b>component</b> and high-integrity software. 4. 2 What is a <b>Component?</b> The idea <b>of</b> component-based development (CBD) is that we assemble software endproducts from reusable components [6].

40|$|One of the {{significant}} challenges in operating a mix-model assembly system is the feeding of parts to the productive units. In order to avoid production loss, assembly systems require uninterrupted availability <b>of</b> <b>components</b> to feed workstations. On the other hand, the feeding <b>of</b> assembly <b>components</b> has to be performed {{in a way that}} minimises the related costs. In the past, the feeding system most widely used was so-called 'line storage' in which the components were stored along the assembly stations in large quantities and were periodically refilled by the central warehouse. Following just-in-time principles, nowadays, assembly system feeding is undertaken by supermarkets, as in decentralised storage areas close to the assembly lines. From such kinds of warehousing, a growing number of manufacturers are adopting two other feeding strategies: the kanban system, which continuously refills the assembly stations through the pull kanban system, or the kitting system, in which <b>kits</b> <b>of</b> <b>components</b> are prepared and delivered following the product through the assembly stations. This paper aims to quantitatively analyse and compare these two recent feeding strategies, considering the production mix variation and the assembled models variety influence. Moreover, kanban-kitting feeding policy and the related optimization issues are considered as hybrid. The findings from an industrial case study and a simulation analysis are also reported. Finally, a decision-making tool that defines a series of 'convenience areas' for the different feeding policies is provide...|$|R

40|$|The paper aims {{to address}} the {{question}} whether the dynamic of autoworker unionism in South Korea and Malaysia was conditioned by, and eventually also influenced the globalization processes in the local auto industry? The conclusion is a contextualized "yes", and the core argument is the following: The financial crisis in 1997 was the dramatic peak of financial globalization in East Asia in the 1990 s, and it did accelerate the existing trend in Korea towards centralized unionism in the auto industry, while it suspended the trend in the Malaysian auto industry towards decentralized unionism. Although the Korean and Malaysian unions were affected by the financial crisis from different structural and strategic positions, and were exposed to different national policies and corporate strategies of crisis management, the Korean unions and Malaysian unions generally followed, respectively, a more radical and militant and a more pragmatic and moderate strategy. In the global-local perspective we face two paradoxes. The first paradox is that in spite of the difference in union ideology, the outcome in terms of industrial relations (IR) institutions was rather similar {{in the sense that the}} auto industry contained a mixture of industrial and enterprise unions and formal or informal federations of these unions, and that collective bargaining was by and large undertaken bilaterally at the enterprise level. This situation was generated by a dynamic, which took the Malaysian system down from a centralized IR system within the low technology assembly industry (the globally subordinated local OEMs) to a rather decentralized IR system within the SOE-MNC controlled industry. The Korean system became more centralized through the confrontations between radical enterprise unions and authoritarian employers and authorities within an auto industry, which over time become much more indigenized, technologically advanced, export-oriented and diversified into multiple auto manufacturers and an under-wood <b>of</b> <b>component</b> suppliers. Yet, in both auto industries the large enterprise unions resisted organizational centralization, which could impede their autonomy. Due to the strength of unions of the market leading firms a breakthrough did happen neither in Korea nor in Malaysia, although the Koreans were a step ahead of the Malaysians having established a federation of metalworkers unions, including the important autoworkers unions. The second paradox is that the radicalism of the Korean autoworker unions was maintained during 1990 s globalization of the auto industry, while radicalism was abandoned by the Malaysian autoworker unions in favor of union pragmatism, when the indigenization of the Malaysian auto industry unfolded since the early 1980 s and a local auto supplier industry had been formed. This cross-country difference is partly explained by the different position held by the Korean and Malaysian auto companies in the global and local auto value chain. The radicalism and effectiveness of Korean autoworker unions sustained the development of dynamic efficiency among Korean auto manufacturing firms. In the same way, the intra-industry differences in wages and working conditions among auto manufacturing firms and components supplier firms were also related to the stratification of the domestic auto value chain, and this uneven distribution of benefits created obstacles of centralized unionization and collective bargaining. The centralized IR system in Malaysia evolved in an auto industry composed primarily of firms assembling imported CKD <b>kits</b> <b>of</b> <b>components.</b> The inequality <b>of</b> employment conditions between auto manufacturers and component suppliers was a driver of the strategy of centralized unionism and collective bargaining in Korea, while the inequality was not perceived as that significant by the Malaysian industrial union, since they had been dealing with these problems by the early 1990 s.
