Upon the announcement of Nickelodeon signing the new show The Mighty B! on December 12, 2006, it renewed SpongeBob SquarePants for a sixth season with 26 episodes in order, surpassing the 100-episode mark. Cyma Zarghami, president of Nickelodeon, said [...] "One of the <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> animation is that you can play it over and over again, and kids will still watch it [...] With live action they won't." [...] On March 3, 2008, the season premiered with the episode [...] "Krabby Road". It was written by Luke Brookshier, Nate Cash and Eric Shaw, while Alan Smart served as animation director.|$|E

Carlock said that Frank, Toofer, and Lutz are [...] "always a fun foil" [...] against Jane Krakowski's Jenna [...] "which we use a lot with the two of them [...] Jenna against those guys kind of squaring off a lot of times." [...] In addition, Carlock noted that it is always [...] "fun" [...] when the writers and Jenna [...] "are scheming off each other" [...] as featured in this episode.|$|E

500|$|... "Dance Hall" [...] is styled in {{the genre}} of the same name, and also {{incorporates}} funk. The segue track [...] "Times Squares 2:30 A.M." [...] was recorded by the group {{on the street with}} a tape recorder. [...] "Fun" [...] has a hip hop groove, jazz fusion tone, and irreverent, party theme similar to [...] "Dance Hall". [...] "Anniversary" [...] is about mature, lasting love. Elysa Gardner of Vibe calls it [...] "a grandly romantic, nine-minute bolero that lavishes its female subject with such warmth and respect that the cheeky misogyny of [...] seems instantly forgiveable." [...] "Castleers" [...] is a short vocal track and tribute to Raphael and D'wayne's Castlemont High School chorus group, Castleers Choir, in which they sang as students. Raphael said of its inspiration, [...] "The high school choir was all about that classic R & B harmony, so I named the song after the choir. One of the <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> that experience at school was that it got us ready {{to go out in the}} professional world with our music." ...|$|E
500|$|Bernthal was {{extremely}} comfortable with his character on set. [...] "The second {{he opened his}} mouth and started reading the scene, I knew it was him," [...] he said. [...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One of the <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E
500|$|SFX {{reviewer}} Ian Berriman gave [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] {{three and}} a half out of five stars. He commented that the ethical debate made it [...] "a surprisingly mature story", but otherwise the Western tropes made it [...] "occasionally feel a little over-familiar". He also felt it was missing [...] "another twist or two", as most of the episode was dedicated to figuring {{out what to do with}} Jex rather than discovering more about him. Berriman also had two [...] "nitpicks" [...] that arose with the plot; the Gunslinger could just walk into the town and take Jex away, or the Doctor could take Jex away in the TARDIS. Dave Golder of the magazine labelled [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] as a [...] "disappointing" [...] science fiction Western episode, writing, [...] "There are some <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> this episode ... But in a show that usually has a lot of fun reinventing TV tropes, too much of [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] feels a bit been-there, done that." [...] Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more critical, writing that he did not [...] "believe" [...] or [...] "feel" [...] it. He felt that Westerns and Doctor Who were two things that [...] "never quite gelled" [...] and also criticised the [...] "languorous pace" [...] the fact that Rory had little to do. However, he did praise the [...] "gorgeous" [...] set and the [...] "cleverly constructed a morality play".|$|E

50|$|Although Latin dance {{has been}} evolved and {{modified}} over the centuries, its Native Latin, European, and African roots will always {{remain in the}} movements and rhythms of the genre.

2500|$|Clinton {{continued}} to poll high, with a September 2011 Bloomberg News poll finding {{her with a}} 64percent favorable rating, the highest of any political figure in the nation.

In a March 2010 interview, lead singer Raine Maida noted that after having gone back to re-learn songs from Spiritual Machines and Clumsy in preparation for their tour, he was [...] "brought back to the <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> this band".

The first single released from the EP was the cover of Rush’s [...] "Anthem", which garnered positive reaction from music critics. Graham Hartmann from Loudwire called the cover version [...] "unique, as Anthrax throw their trademark thrash spin on the prog classic". The second song released from the record was [...] "Smokin'" [...] from Boston, which prominently features session keyboardist Fred Mandel. Drummer Charlie Benante explained {{the selection of the}} Boston song by saying: [...] "One of the <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Smokin’" [...] is that there’s a really cool section that has a real [...] "Anthrax-y" [...] feel to it, the guitars and drums and playing the same type of rhythm, the kick drums are going with the guitars – I immediately heard in my head what we could do with it." ...|$|E
