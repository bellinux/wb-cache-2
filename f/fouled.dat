5|$|After a one-minute {{break between}} periods, the third {{overtime}} began with another jump ball that was won by Chamberlain. After King missed the opening {{shot of the}} period, Carolina's Kearns made a right handed layup to bring the score to 50–48. Kansas failed to score again, and this time Kearns missed his shot after being <b>fouled,</b> but then made both free throws. Off of a pass from Loneski, Chamberlain made a shot, was <b>fouled,</b> and made the ensuing free throw to complete the three-point play and bring the Jayhawks within one point. Cunningham was <b>fouled</b> after being trapped in a double team and then missed the first shot of the one-and-one. The Jayhawks' Loneski missed a contested, close layup, but King got the offensive rebound and was <b>fouled</b> on a put back shot. King made one of the free throws and tied the score at 5252.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May, Juventus hosted reigning champions Real Madrid at Juventus Stadium. Morata {{opened the}} scoring against his former team, and Cristiano Ronaldo {{equalised}} before half time. Tevez scored the winning goal from the penalty spot {{after he was}} <b>fouled</b> by Dani Carvajal. Eight days later, the two teams drew at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium: Ronaldo scored a penalty after Giorgio Chiellini <b>fouled</b> James Rodríguez, but {{in the second half}} Morata equalised. Juventus advanced to the final 3–2 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|Anthony Taylor was {{the referee}} for the final. It {{was his first}} match {{involving}} Chelsea since December 2014, when he erroneously booked Cesc Fàbregas for diving {{when he had been}} <b>fouled</b> by Southampton's Matt Targett; Taylor apologised to Chelsea for that decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} of the match came with ten minutes left. After a period of fluent {{football}} by the Arsenal forwards which saw Smith hit the woodwork and Hayes, Thomas and Rocastle all had shots saved by Dibble, Arsenal were awarded a penalty after Rocastle was <b>fouled</b> in the box. Dibble saved Winterburn's spot-kick by turning the ball round the post. A newly inspired Luton equalised with seven minutes remaining when Caesar mis-kicked a clearance {{on the edge of}} his penalty area, enabling Luton's Wilson to head the ball into the Arsenal goal from a Mark Stein cross. With less than a minute to go, Adams <b>fouled</b> Mark Stein, and from the resulting free kick, Brian Stein scored his second goal of the match to put the game beyond the reach of the defending champions.|$|E
50|$|FIBA {{basketball}} {{rules have}} a similar <b>foul</b> called an unsportsmanlike <b>foul,</b> which is roughly equivalent to a flagrant type 1, with the addition that an unsportsmanlike <b>foul</b> can be called if a player <b>fouls</b> with no intention to play the ball (including excessive holding, shirt grabbing), as well as if a player <b>fouls</b> another player on a fast break from behind him. If a player commits a <b>foul</b> warranting immediate ejection from the game, the <b>foul</b> would be called as a disqualifying <b>foul</b> - similar to a flagrant 2. Two unsportsmanlike <b>fouls</b> lead to automatic ejection, similar to the NBA.|$|R
5000|$|Falling <b>fouling.</b> Under this scenario, the <b>fouling</b> rate {{decreases}} with time, {{but never}} drops to zero. The deposit thickness does not achieve a constant value. The progress of <b>fouling</b> can be often described by two numbers: the initial <b>fouling</b> rate (a tangent to the <b>fouling</b> curve at zero deposit loading or zero time) and the <b>fouling</b> rate {{after a long}} period of time (an oblique asymptote to the <b>fouling</b> curve).|$|R
50|$|Any of {{the above}} types of balls might be fair balls or <b>foul</b> balls. Umpires will also signal first signal fair or <b>foul</b> on fly outs near the <b>foul</b> line, but {{the result of a}} <b>foul</b> fly out (or <b>foul</b> out) is no {{different}} from a fair fly out; it is not a <b>foul</b> ball.|$|R
5|$|There were {{numerous}} instances {{of death from}} drinking poisoned or <b>fouled</b> water (there were still many unburied, decomposing corpses inside the ruins). In one instance, desperate Robinsons were driven to drink their own urine and subsequently died.|$|E
5|$|A {{technical}} foul {{requires that the}} defenceman who <b>fouled</b> a player on the opposing team {{be placed in the}} penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January, Barcelona {{hosted the}} first leg of the quarter-finals, and {{defeated}} Atlético Madrid 10. Sergio Busquets was <b>fouled,</b> giving Barcelona a late penalty. Messi took it and it was saved by Atlético goalkeeper Jan Oblak, but Messi scored the rebound. A week later at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, the hosts made the aggregate score level in the first minute through Fernando Torres; in the ninth minute, Neymar put Barcelona back into the lead. When Javier Mascherano <b>fouled</b> Juanfran, Raúl García's penalty gave the advantage back to Atlético, but Barcelona scored two more goals in the first half from a Miranda own goal and Neymar to win 42 on aggregate. Atlético captain Gabi was sent off at half time for arguing with the referee, and his midfield partner Mario Suárez was also dismissed later on.|$|E
50|$|All other <b>fouls</b> {{during the}} game result in a one-point deduction, {{including}} <b>fouling</b> on an intragame rack. However, a third <b>foul</b> in a row {{at any time in}} a straight pool game results in a loss of 15 points (for purposes of this rule, a <b>foul</b> on the initial break, though it is a loss of two points, is not counted as two <b>fouls).</b> The 15-point deduction is in addition to the one-point loss for each <b>foul.</b> Thus, the first two <b>fouls</b> are a loss of one point each, and the third <b>foul</b> in a row is a loss of 16 points; 1 point for the <b>foul,</b> and 15 points for it being the third consecutive <b>foul.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Tar Heels' {{began to}} strain Kansas' defense with several players making {{perimeter}} shots, and {{when combined with}} Kansas' inability to convert from the field, this allowed the Tar Heels to jump out to a 114 lead. This led to Harp changing Kansas' defensive formation to a 23 zone, with Chamberlain under the basket. Rosenbluth — who was now relatively unguarded when compared to Kansas' previous formation — made a contested seventeen foot jumper. Kansas retaliated by giving the ball to Chamberlain who was subsequently <b>fouled</b> as he went up for a shot. He went to the free throw line and made one of two. As Kansas went up the floor coach Harp ordered his squad to revert to their original boxandone. Carolina's Kearns made a jumper from the floor after pump faking to lose a defender, which brought the score to 157 in favor of Carolina. Kansas came up the floor and missed their shot, but Chamberlain grabbed the rebound and was then <b>fouled</b> in air. He went to the line for a one–and–one and missed the first shot, while Rosenbluth caught the rebound.|$|E
5|$|Across the battlefield, as {{the first}} line of Persian ships was pushed back by the Greeks, they became <b>fouled</b> in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E

He scored two in the round of 16, helping a ten-man Italy defeat Nigeria 2–1 at Foxboro Stadium in Boston, after trailing {{for most of the}} match. He scored his first goal of the match with two minutes left on the clock, after receiving ball {{at the edge of the}} area from Roberto Mussi. He then went on to score the winning goal from a penalty in extra time after setting up Antonio Benarrivo with a lobbed pass, who was then <b>fouled</b> in the penalty area.|$|E
50|$|In basketball, such {{misconduct}} is penalized by {{a technical}} <b>foul</b> {{as opposed to}} a personal <b>foul.</b> The technical <b>foul</b> is akin to a caution in that two such <b>fouls</b> warrant an expulsion, although egregious conduct will be immediately assessed two consecutive technical <b>fouls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This type of {{technical}} <b>foul</b> serves in effect as a [...] "player <b>foul</b> penalty" [...] of a bonus free throw, {{similar to the}} team <b>foul</b> penalty. However, this bonus free throw is awarded regardless of the <b>foul</b> being an offensive or defensive <b>foul.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Fouling</b> can {{be divided}} into {{reversible}} and irreversible <b>fouling</b> based on the attachment strength of particles to the membrane surface. Reversible <b>fouling</b> can be removed by a strong shear force or backwashing. Formation of a strong matrix of <b>fouling</b> layer with the solute during a continuous filtration process will result in reversible <b>fouling</b> being transformed into an irreversible <b>fouling</b> layer. Irreversible <b>fouling</b> is the strong attachment of particles which cannot be removed by physical cleaning.|$|R
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after the start of}} the second-half Hearts were awarded a penalty kick. Kujabi <b>fouled</b> Suso by pulling his jersey and catching his heel, but television replays showed that the foul had taken place outside the penalty area. Hibs were also reduced to ten men as Kujabi received his second yellow card, resulting in a red. Danny Grainger converted the penalty, which was also his first goal for Hearts. Soon afterwards, Ryan McGowan scored with a header after Hibs keeper Brown had initially saved from Stephen Elliott. Skácel finished the scoring with another shot from just outside the box to make it 5-1 for Hearts.|$|E
5|$|Costa scored {{his first}} goal for Spain {{with the third}} in a 4–0 UEFA Euro 2016 {{qualifying}} win away to Luxembourg on 12 October 2014. He did not feature again for Spain until 5 September 2015, when he was <b>fouled</b> by Slovakia goalkeeper Matúš Kozáčik for a penalty, which Andrés Iniesta converted for a 2–0 qualifying win at the Estadio Carlos Tartiere in Oviedo. He was booed when he was substituted for Paco Alcácer later in the match. Del Bosque defended Costa from criticism, saying that he performed well against the Slovak defence. However, he {{was not included in}} the final squad for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Fiorentina had {{chances to}} equalise {{in the second}} half, with a long shot from {{substitute}} Matías Fernández tipped over the crossbar by Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina, and Iličić missing a one-on-one. The team also brought on Rossi in place of Joaquín after 72 minutes, his first action since his injury in January. Despite being reduced to ten men {{for the last ten}} minutes after a second booking for Gökhan Inler after he <b>fouled</b> Iličić, Napoli extended their lead in injury time when substitute Mertens scored a third after being set up by Callejón.|$|E

40|$|The {{combined}} {{influence of}} natural organic matter (NOM) and colloidal particles on the <b>fouling</b> of thin-film composite nanofiltration (NF) membranes is systematically investigated. Combined <b>fouling</b> {{is compared to}} the individual <b>fouling</b> behaviors (i. e., colloid or NOM alone) with respect to <b>fouling</b> mechanisms {{and the effect of}} concentration factor (or recovery). Results demonstrate that (1) "cake-enhanced osmotic pressure" (CEOP) is a key <b>fouling</b> mechanism for individual colloidal <b>fouling,</b> (2) NOM-calcium complexation is the dominant factor governing individual NOM <b>fouling,</b> and (3) combined <b>fouling</b> is affected by both CEOP and NOM-calcium complexation. The extent of flux decline for combined <b>fouling,</b> however, is less than what inferred from additivity of the individual contributions of colloidal and NOM <b>fouling</b> to flux decline. This observation implies that the contributions of the <b>fouling</b> mechanisms appear to be relatively less significant for combined <b>fouling</b> compared to their separate influences on individual colloidal and NOM <b>fouling.</b> An increase in colloidal stability in presence of NOM and the competition between colloids and NOM for calcium are likely explanations for this behavior. It is further shown that NF membrane salt rejection increases noticeably in case of combined <b>fouling</b> compared to individual colloidal <b>fouling</b> due to the formation of an active rejecting layer by the accumulated NOM on the membrane surface. Results from combined <b>fouling</b> runs involving EDTA treatment confirm that both CEOP and NOM-calcium complexation take place simultaneously. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
