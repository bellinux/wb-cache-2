40|$|The {{purpose of}} this test {{procedure}} is to safely operate the Fuel Retrieval System (FRS) and Integrated Water Treatment System (IWTS) with specific <b>fuel</b> <b>canisters,</b> and show that <b>canisters</b> containing <b>fuel</b> can be retrieved from the canister queue, decapped in the Canister Decapper, and loaded into the Primary Clean Machine (PCM) for fuel cleaning; and that fuel can be sorted on the Process Table, then loaded back into <b>fuel</b> <b>canisters</b> and relocated in basin storage. An option is included to load selected elements into multi-canister overpack (MCO) Fuel Baskets. Additional Data are collected during this test, beyond that collected during production operations. These data support qualifying the cleaning performance of the PCM, assessing the quantity of scrap generated during the cleaning, and evaluating the impact of fuel retrieval operations on the Basin water quality. The additional data collected primarily consist of weighing fuel and scrap at selected points in the operation, as well as photographing fuel and scrap as it is processed. The time to perform operations is also monitored for comparison with design predictions. Water quality data are collected to establish a baseline to predict the effectiveness of equipment design for control of contamination and visibility during production operation. The scope of this test procedure is to validate the operation of FRS and IWTS components as a complete system. <b>Fuel</b> <b>canisters</b> shall be processed in accordance with this test procedure such that fuel inspection results are clearly attributed to {{a particular set of}} PCM operating parameters. The Phase 3 test sequence processes a minimum of six canisters. Twenty-four contingency canisters have been identified, and will be processed if additional performance data are required. The Phase 4 test sequence processes a minimum of 29 specific canisters. Twenty-nine contingency canisters have been identified for Phase 4 activities and will be processed to complete process validation, if necessary. The <b>fuel</b> <b>canisters</b> to be processed shall be listed in the Fuel Campaign Letter and are identified in HNF- 4898, ''Phased Startup Initiative Phases 3 and 4 Test Plan and Test Specifications (OCRWM) ''...|$|R

40|$|Characterization of N Reactor metal {{spent fuel}} and {{associated}} sludge {{stored in the}} two Hanford K Basins has entered a more mature stage.

More recent work has included lifting fuel elements from both Basins to ascertain bottom end and circumferential cracks. Sludge collection has now been performed for material residing inside of spent <b>fuel</b> <b>canisters</b> in both Basins. Finally the number of gas and liquid samples from sealed canisters has been greatly expanded leading to a maximum observed cesium- 137 content ten times higher than previous reports.

40|$|Stochastic image {{reconstruction}} {{has been}} applied to a dual-particle imaging system used for nuclear safeguards applications. The dual-particle imager (DPI) is a combined Compton-scatter and neutron-scatter camera capable of producing separate neutron and photon images. The stochastic origin ensembles (SOE) method has been chosen for fast image reconstruction times compared to list-mode maximum-likelihood estimation-maximization and because no estimation of system response parameters is required. This work contains SOE image reconstructions for a 252 Cf point source, two mixed-oxide (MOX) <b>fuel</b> <b>canisters</b> representing point sources, and the MOX <b>fuel</b> <b>canisters</b> representing a distributed source. Simulation of the DPI using MCNPX-PoliMi is validated by comparison of simulated and measured results.

5000|$|Dometic {{seeks to}} address the {{developing}} world market because alcohol fuel technologies are particularly appropriate for it. [...] The CleanCook contains a non-pressurized, no-spill fuel tank that can hold methanol or ethanol. The CleanCook stove was designed with several specific safety measures. The CleanCook stove’s <b>fuel</b> <b>canister</b> holds an absorbent mineral fiber covered by a protective metal mesh, preventing fuel from spilling from the canister even when the stove is inverted. The design of this fuel tank eliminates risk of explosion, flare-up, or leakage, and other safety features built into the stove make the CleanCook less likely to cause burns than other cooking methods. [...] Meanwhile, the CleanCook is a high-performing stove, equivalent in power (1.5 to 2kW) and temperature to an LPG stove.|$|E
