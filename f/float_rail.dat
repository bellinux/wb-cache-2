50|$|In May 2013, the University of Colorado {{requested}} that the light rail station be moved off of its campus due to concerns that vibrations and electromagnetic interference generated by trains would interfere with research equipment. The proposed $20 million in mitigation would have included construction of a <b>floating</b> <b>rail</b> bed and replacement of new equipment in the research labs. On June 25, 2013, the RTD Board of Directors approved the realignment of the light rail line onto Fitzsimons Boulevard, with a new station north of the campus connected via a shuttle bus. The relocated station required the acquisition of land from Sand Creek Park, which underwent $3 million in renovations alongside light rail construction in 2015.|$|R

25|$|The Final Tier I Draft Environmental Impact Statement {{recommends}} {{further study}} of two alternatives: enhanced <b>rail</b> <b>float</b> operations {{and the most}} basic rail tunnel among the tunnel alternatives. While the <b>rail</b> <b>float</b> alternative is expected to produce less freight tonnage diversion than the tunnel (2.8 million tons per year vs 9.6), its costs are dramatically less, $175 million vs. $7.2 billion. The EIS recommends a phased approach, starting by building enhanced float service for carload freight, adding capacity for intermodal traffic, developing needed intermodal facilities on Long Island and finally planning and building the rail freight tunnel.|$|R
50|$|A {{railroad}} car <b>float</b> or <b>rail</b> barge is an unpowered barge with {{rail tracks}} mounted on its deck. It {{is used to}} move railroad cars across water obstacles, or to locations they could not otherwise go, and is towed by a tugboat or pushed by a towboat. As such, the car float is a specialised form of the lighter, {{as opposed to a}} train ferry, which is self-powered.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified Dickson converter to achieve wide input range capacitive DC-DC converters. Several implementations are carefully studied and compared, {{which shows that}} the folding Dickson converter is the best choice, {{not only for its}} reduced dynamic losses, but also for its very regular structure and operation. Folding is achieved by merging the terminals of two or more flying capacitors, creating one equivalent flying capacitor. In this design, a four stage folding Dickson converter is implemented to achieve four different voltage conversion ratios. A Bootstrapped Gate Boost Converter (BGBC) is proposed which uses a bootstrapping technique to generate a <b>floating</b> <b>rail</b> for the flying switches, whose terminal voltages vary by large amounts depending on input voltage and VCR. The inherent operation of the Dickson topology is used by copying the voltage of the flying capacitors on a grounded capacitor in one phase, which can then be used to generate a floating 1. 2 V in the second phase. The converter has been implemented in a 90 nm technology, achieving a maximum output power of 50 mW, peak efficiency of 76. 6 % in the 2 : 1 conversion mode, and an average efficiency above 60 % over the entire Vin and Pout range. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused major {{damage to}} the Greenville facility, {{undermining}} the float bridge gantries and sinking one of the car floats. The 81-year-old gantry structures were in such bad condition {{that they had to}} be demolished. The working float bridge at Bush Terminal was transferred by barge to Greenville to restore <b>rail</b> <b>float</b> service. Previously plans called for the gantries to be demolished in phases and replaced by two new float bridges and a barge transfer station.|$|R

In addition to the high-performance control systems needed, switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors, which to date has restricted their operations to high-speed point to point services.|$|R

50|$|The only {{alternative}} to the Selkirk Hurdle is for rail cars to be floated across Upper New York Bay, an operation run until 2006 by the New York Cross Harbor Railroad, and currently by New York New Jersey Rail, LLC, now owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Port Authority is investing in improvements to its decayed infrastructure, much of which was washed away by Hurricane Sandy. As trucking has become more prevalent, <b>rail</b> <b>float</b> operations across the bay have dwindled over the decades from 600,000 cars per year to 1,600 cars per year. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey hopes some day to transport as many as 25,000 cars annually.|$|R

5000|$|Located {{just south}} of Yankee Stadium under the Major Deegan Expressway, on a wide road named Exterior Street, Bronx Terminal Market was {{conceived}} in 1917 by New York City mayor John F. Hylan. Construction on the market started, but wasn't completed until mayor Fiorello La Guardia took office, in which he enacted a program constructing various markets to provide {{a home for the}} city's numerous pushcart vendors. Between October 1, 1934, and May 1, 1935, the city built a new complex {{just south of}} the existing unfinished structure. Bronx Terminal Market consisted of small two-story concrete buildings of simple design. Designed by Samuel A. Oxhandler with John D. Churchill and Albert W. Lewis, the buildings were originally painted light yellow. In 1936, the market's flagship structure went up, a small, cubist-style polygon at 149th Street with [...] "Bronx Terminal Market" [...] in large relief in the concrete. This building was designed to serve as a bank and, upstairs, a hotel for farmers. A car <b>float</b> brought in <b>rail</b> cars by barge to the market.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the approach {{used in a}} field investigation on the vibration impact of a new underground metro line, focusing on population annoyance. The metro consists of a double barrel tunnel equipped with a slab track system: rails are fastened to elastically supported sleeper blocks embedded in a floating concrete slab, cast on a resilient mat. Vibrations were measured over four weeks inside the metro tunnel (on the <b>rail,</b> <b>floating</b> slab and tunnel ring wall) and inside a selected sample of buildings. Transits were monitored with video recordings. Approximately 30000 vibration recordings were collected. A systematic approach was applied to identify the {{cases in which the}} vibrations detected inside the buildings could be attributed to metro transits {{with a high degree of}} confidence. This task is critical due to the highly variable soil properties and building structures, and to the presence of diverse vibration sources such as surface transportation and building technical systems. The dispersion of the results due to the different characteristics of the rolling stock was also investigated. The results of the study provided a basis for implementing mitigation measures at the sites in which the vibration levels exceeded the limits prescribed by applicable standards...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic Levitation (maglev) is {{the process}} cast an object to a {{reference}} without using any aid other than magnetic fields. It {{has been a lot}} of tools in industry and transport that apply theory to the magnetic levitation. In the world of transportation, for example, the principle of magnetic levitation is the embryo of controlling high-speed magnetic train that has a coefficient of friction is very small. With magnetic levitation systems, frictionless train with train tracks can be minimized since no direct contact with the rail or can be said to <b>float</b> between the <b>rails</b> and magnets. In this final project, "Design of Single Axis Magnetic Suspension Model" aims to demonstrate illustration of magnetic control to cast a steel ball with one degree of freedom that is the vertical direction. Control in this design is controlled in a very unstable situation. The force of gravity acting on the ball causes the control to do the maximum and sustained so as not to give room for the ball to slide following the direction of gravity forces and also for the steel ball is attached to a solenoid (electromagnet). Based on experiments conducted, the result is a single-axis magnetic suspension model is able to lift the steel ball at a height of 3 mm from the tip of a solenoid with current 1. 50 A. Steel ball can be posted but can not be stable. ...|$|R
