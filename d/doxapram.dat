50|$|<b>Doxapram</b> is an {{intravenous}} CNS {{and respiratory}} stimulant that is typically {{used to treat}} respiratory depression caused anesthesia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. <b>Doxapram</b> {{can also be used}} as a treatment for neonatal apnea, but it can be dangerous, so caution must be taken. <b>Doxapram</b> has been used to treat respiratory depression in drug overdoses; however, there are many drugs which this is not effective. The side effects of <b>Doxapram</b> are rare, however, with overdose, hypertension, tachycardia, tremors, spasticity, and hyperactive reflexes have been seen to occur.|$|E
50|$|<b>Doxapram</b> {{has begun}} to fade into obscurity in humans {{even though it is}} an {{effective}} CNS and respiratory stimulant. The use has declined primarily because of shorter lasting anesthetic agents becoming more abundant, but also because some research has shown potential side effects in infants. Some studies on preterm infants found that <b>doxapram</b> causes decreased cerebral blood flow and increased cerebral oxygen requirement. This resulted in these infants having higher chances of developing mental delays than infants not treated with the drug. Thus, <b>doxapram</b> has been eliminated from many treatments for humans because of its potential dangers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Doxapram</b> stimulates chemoreceptors in the carotid {{bodies of}} the carotid arteries, which in turn, stimulates the {{respiratory}} centre in the brain stem.|$|E
50|$|Analeptics {{can be used}} to {{increase}} the speed of recovery from propofol, remifentanil, and sevoflurane.

50|$|Treatment of the {{underlying}} cause is required. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are required in cases of severe respiratory failure (PaO2 less than 50 mmHg). Respiratory stimulants such as <b>doxapram</b> are rarely used, and if the respiratory failure resulted from an overdose of sedative drugs such as opioids or benzodiazepines, then the appropriate antidote (naloxone or flumazenil, respectively) will be given.|$|E

It was considered particularly useful as it could counteract the sedation and respiratory depression produced by morphine but with less effect on analgesia. It is still rarely used in medicine in some countries, although it has largely been replaced by more effective respiratory stimulants such as <b>doxapram</b> and specific opioid antagonists such as naloxone.|$|E

50|$|Two common {{potassium}} channel blockers are <b>Doxapram</b> and GAL-021. Both act on {{potassium channel}}s in Carotid Bodies. These cells {{are responsible for}} sensing low concentrations of oxygen and transmitting information to {{the central nervous system}} ultimately leading to an increase in respiration. Blocking the potassium channels on the membranes of these cells effectively depolarizes the membrane potential, which in turn leads to opening of voltage gated calcium channels and neurotransmitter release. This begins the process of relaying the signal to the central nervous system. <b>Doxapram</b> blocks leak potassium channels in the Tandom pore domain family of potassium channels while GAL-021 blocks BK channels, or big potassium channels, which are activated by a change in membrane electron potential or by an increase in internal calcium.Ampakines are the second common form of analeptics which elicit a different mechanism for an analeptic response. They bind to AMPA receptors, or amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, within the pre-Bötzinger complex. The pre-Bötzinger complex is part of the ventral respiratory group and the induction of long term potentials in the postsynaptic membrane of these neurons leads to an increased respiratory rate. The endogenous AMPA receptor ligand is glutamate and ampakines mirror glutamate's interaction with the receptors. Ligand binding causes AMPA receptors to open and allow for sodium ions to flow into the cell, leading to depolarization and signal transduction. At this time, CX717 is the most successful ampakine in human trials and has very few side effects.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{drugs have}} been used as {{supportive}} therapeutic intervention such as lidocaine, naloxone, thiamine, lorazepam, vecuronium, etomidate, propofol, tolazoline, yohimbine, atropine, naloxone, orciprenaline, metoclopramide, ranitidine, metoprolol, enoxaparin, flucloxacillin, insulin, and irrigation of both eyes with saline. Effects of xylazine are also reversed by the analeptics 4-aminopyridine, <b>doxapram,</b> and caffeine, which are physiological antagonists to central nervous system depressants. Combining yohimbine and 4-aminopyridine in an effort to antagonize xylazine is superior as compared to the administration of either of these drugs individually due to reduction of recovery time. Research initiatives may be necessary in order to standardize treatment and determine effective measures for identifying chronic xylazine usage and intoxication.|$|E
50|$|An {{analeptic}}, in medicine, is {{a central}} nervous system stimulant. The term analeptic typically refers to respiratory analeptics (for example, <b>doxapram).</b> Analeptics are central nervous system stimulants that include {{a wide variety of}} medications used to treat depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and respiratory depression. Analeptics can also be used as convulsants, with low doses causing patients to experience heightened awareness, restlessness and rapid breathing.The primary medical use of these drugs is as an anesthetic recovery tool or to treat emergency respiratory depression.Other drugs of this category are prethcamide, pentylenetetrazole, and nikethamide. Nikethamide is now withdrawn due to risk of convulsions. Analeptics have recently been used to better understand the treatment of a barbiturate overdose. Through the use of agents researchers were able to treat obtundation and respiratory depression. Various analeptics contain epononymous names. E.g. Etamivan has the tradname of Analepticon & synephrine is called Analeptin.|$|E
50|$|Emergence is {{the return}} to {{baseline}} physiologic function of all organ systems after the cessation of general anaesthetics. This stage may be accompanied by temporary neurologic phenomena, such as agitated emergence (acute mental confusion), aphasia (impaired production or comprehension of speech), or focal impairment in sensory or motor function. Shivering is also fairly common and can be clinically significant because it causes an increase in oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, cardiac output, heart rate, and systemic blood pressure. The proposed mechanism {{is based on the}} observation that the spinal cord recovers at a faster rate than the brain. This results in uninhibited spinal reflexes manifested as clonic activity (shivering). This theory is supported by the fact that <b>doxapram,</b> a CNS stimulant, is somewhat effective in abolishing postoperative shivering. Cardiovascular events such as increased or decreased blood pressure, rapid heart rate, or other cardiac dysrhythmias are also common during emergence from general anaesthesia, as are respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea.|$|E
40|$|Apnoea of {{prematurity}} {{is treated}} with noninvasive respiratory therapy and methylxanthines. For therapy unresponsive apnoea <b>doxapram</b> is often prescibed in preterm neonates. The duration, dosage and {{route of administration}} of <b>doxapram</b> together with its efficacy was evaluated in two Dutch neonatal intensive care. Outcome concerning short-term safety and neonatal morbidity were evaluated. During 5 years, 122 of 1, 501 admitted newborns < 32 weeks of gestational age received <b>doxapram.</b> 64. 8 % of patients did not need intubation after <b>doxapram.</b> 25 % of treated neonates were < 27 weeks of gestation. A positive response to <b>doxapram</b> therapy on apnoea was associated with longer duration of <b>doxapram</b> usage (P< 0. 001), lower mean doses (P< 0. 003), and less days of intensive care (median 33 versus 42 days; P< 0. 002). No patients died during <b>doxapram</b> therapy. Incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, persistent ductus arteriosus, or worsening of pulmonary condition did not increase during <b>doxapram</b> therapy. <b>Doxapram</b> is frequently used for apnoea of prematurity, {{despite a lack of}} data on short-term efficacy and long-term safety.

40|$|AIM: Using <b>doxapram</b> {{to treat}} {{neonates}} with apnoea of prematurity might avoid {{the need for}} endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. We studied whether <b>doxapram</b> prevented the need for intubation and identified the predictors of the success. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of preterm infants born from January 2006 to August 2014 who received oral or intravenous <b>doxapram.</b> Success was defined as no need for endotracheal intubation, due to apnoea, during <b>doxapram</b> therapy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses identified predictors of success during the first 48 hours of <b>doxapram</b> therapy. RESULTS: Data on 203 patients with a median gestational age of 26. 1 (interquartile range 25. 1 - 27. 4) weeks were analysed. During the first 48 hours of <b>doxapram</b> therapy, 157 (77 %) patients did not need endotracheal intubation and 127 (63 %) patients were successfully treated over the entire treatment course. The median postnatal age {{at the start of}} <b>doxapram</b> therapy was 20 days (interquartile range 12 - 30).

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: We {{observed}} two preterm {{infants who}} developed severe hypokalaemia following <b>doxapram.</b> We therefore wished {{to review the}} possible association between <b>doxapram</b> and severe hypokalaemia. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestation and hospitalised in our intensive care unit in 2004. For each infant, treatment with <b>doxapram</b> or with any drug known to interfere with potassium metabolism, potassium intakes and episodes of hypokalaemia have been recorded. RESULTS: Out of 105 infants, 54 received <b>doxapram.</b> Doxapram-treated infants were significantly younger and had a lower birth weight. <b>Doxapram</b> treated infants {{were more likely to}} receive caffeine, furosemide, insulin and mechanical ventilation. There was no {{difference between the two groups}} for the other parameters. Hypokalaemia was frequently encountered in our population since it occurred in 76 % of enrolled patients and severe hypokalaemia (potassium plasma level below 3 mmol/l) was found in 41 %. Bivariate analysis underlined several risk factors for severe hypokalaemia: use of <b>doxapram,</b> gestational age below 28 weeks, use of mechanical ventilation, furosemide, ibuprofen, insulin and postnatal corticosteroids. Cox model's multivariate analysis showed that administration of furosemide and <b>doxapram</b> significantly increased the occurrence of severe hypokalaemia with relative risks of 4. 9 (95 % CI 1. 9 to 12. 5) and 8. 2 (95 % CI 3. 1 to 21. 7), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study underlines the high incidence of severe hypokalaemia in very preterm infants and an increased risk of severe hypokalaemia during <b>doxapram</b> treatment.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in both mice and rats that the LD 50 value for <b>doxapram</b> is reduced in rodents treated with {{narcotic}} analgesics. In both species the site of the toxic interaction appears to be the cardiovascular system. <b>Doxapram</b> alone, in sub-lethal doses, appears to cause conduction defects in the heart and this action of <b>doxapram</b> is increased in rodents treated with morphine. The enhancement of the toxicity of <b>doxapram</b> by morphine appears to involve an action in the central nervous system probably not related to respiratory depression. <b>Doxapram</b> is a respiratory stimulant with a wider margin of safety than other compounds used to stimulate ventilation in both man (Rockwell and Greene, 1963) and animals (Luscombe and Nicholls, 1971). One of its many indications is to permit the use of effective doses of narcotic analgesics without the associated problems of respiratory depression. In a recent study (Gregoretti and Pleuvry, 1977) it was shown that the lethal dose of <b>doxapram</b> was considerably reduced in mice treated with morphine. This effect depended upon the dose of morphine given. The importance of this finding is that, at least in mice, the margin of safety for <b>doxapram</b> is con-siderably reduced by concurrent administration of morphine. Preliminary studies indicated that <b>doxapram</b> did not potentiate markedly the acute effects of morphine such as depression of respiratory frequency, analgesia and depression of body temperature. Furthermore, mice sacrificed after a potentially lethal combination of <b>doxapram</b> and morphine exhibited organ blanching and blood pooling suggestive of cardiovascular abnormalities. Thus the mechanism of the enhanced toxicity of <b>doxapram</b> in mice treated with morphine has been examined with particular reference to the cardio-vascular system. The study has been extended to determine whether similar toxicity problems occurred in another species, the rat. METHOD...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Postanaesthetic {{shivering}} is {{a common}} condition after surgery which needs proper management with pharmacologic agents {{so as to make}} postoperative period comfortable to the patient and prevent from the untoward complications that can arise from it. This study was done to compare the effectiveness of Pethidine and <b>Doxapram</b> in the treatment of postanaesthetic shivering. Methods: Patients were randomly divided into three groups, ten in each. All received volume of 3 ml as Group I (<b>Doxapram</b> 1. 5 mg/kg), Group II (Pethidine 0. 35 mg/kg) and Group III (Normal Saline). All patients were observed for 30 minutes after reversal of muscle relaxant and occurrence of shivering within this period was observed, scored and treated. All treated patients were observed for 10 minutes after the test drug was given for control of shivering and any untoward effects. Results: Pethidine was found more effective than <b>Doxapram</b> in treating postanaesthetic shivering as it was effective in 80 % followed by <b>Doxapram</b> in 60 % and Normal saline in 20 %. Statistically the results between Normal saline and Pethidine was signifi cant as P< 0. 05. As statistical significance between <b>Doxapram</b> and Normal Saline was p= 0. 16; and between Pethidine and <b>Doxapram</b> was p= 0. 62, the difference is statistically not significant.

The effect of <b>doxapram</b> and theophylline on respiratory, cardiovascular, and acid-base variables was investigated in 10 healthy neonatal calves (Bos Taurus). A venous, a peripheral arterial, and a pulmonary arterial catheter were placed, and central venous, pulmonary, and systemic blood pressures and cardiac output were measured using thermodilution technique. <b>Doxapram,</b> but not theophylline, led to an immediate increase in respiratory rate (P </= 0. 01). The arterial pCO(2) decreased to 27. 1 +/- 4. 7 mm Hg within 30 sec after <b>doxapram</b> administration and to 46. 3 +/- 5. 8 mm Hg within 120 min after theophylline administration (P< 0. 0001).

40|$|<b>Doxapram</b> is a {{respiratory}} stimulant {{that appears}} to be a potent and specific panicogenic agent. It also elicits an abnormal ventilatory response in patients with panic. A replication study confirmed these findings and demonstrated that behavioral and ventilatory responses to <b>doxapram</b> were significantly modified by a psychological intervention designed to cognitively block panic. The replication study provided an opportunity to simultaneously investigate the neuroendocrine effects of the illness, the drug, the drug-induced panic attacks, and the cognitive intervention. Epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NE), growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and cortisol were studied in patients with panic and control subjects given placebo and <b>doxapram</b> injections after receiving either standard instructions or a brief cognitive intervention. Patients with panic had elevated levels of EPI, ACTH, and cortisol throughout the study. <b>Doxapram</b> had little or no detectable effects on plasma NE, GH, ACTH, and cortisol. Doxapram-induced panic attacks were not associated with elevations in NE, GH, ACTH, or cortisol. <b>Doxapram</b> led to a rapid and very brief rise in plasma EPI, which was small in subjects who did not panic and pronounced in patients who did panic.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of the {{ventilatory}} stimulant <b>doxapram</b> to test the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia increases the translation of carotid body afferent input into ventilatory motor efferent output by the central nervous system. Chronic hypoxia (inspired Po 2 = 70 Torr, 2 days) significantly increased the ventilatory response to an intravenous infusion of a high dose of <b>doxapram</b> in conscious, unrestrained rats breathing normoxic or hypoxic gas. The in vitro carotid body response to hypoxia increased with chronic hypoxia, but the response was not increased with a high dose of <b>doxapram.</b> Similarly, the phrenic nerve response to <b>doxapram</b> in anesthetized rats with carotid bodies denervated did not change with 7 days of chronic hypoxia. The results support the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia causes plasticity in the central component of the carotid chemoreceptor ventilatory reflex, which increases the hypoxic ventilatory response.

The effects of NIPPV were compared with those of the respiratory stimulant <b>doxapram</b> on gas exchange in patients with COPD and acute ventilatory failure. METHODS: Patients admitted with acute exacerbations of COPD and type 2 respiratory failure (Pao 2 6. 7 kPa) who did not improve with conventional treatment were randomised to receive either NIPPV or intravenous <b>doxapram.</b> Blood gas tensions were monitored for four hours. RESULTS: In nine patients who received NIPPV the arterial PaO 2 improved from a mean (SE) of 5. 9 (0. 4) kPa to a maximum of 8. 1 (0. 6) kPa which was maintained at four hours. Eight patients who received <b>doxapram</b> had a similar baseline Pao 2 of 5. 6 (0. 4) kPa which rose to a maximum of 7. 3 (0. 5) kPa but this was not maintained at four hours.

To identify and appraise all existing evidence regarding efficacy and safety of <b>doxapram</b> use for AOP in infants born before 34 weeks of gestational age. All studies reporting on <b>doxapram</b> use for AOP were identified by searching electronic databases, references from relevant studies, and abstracts from the Societies for Pediatric Research. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and quality, and extracted data on study design, patient characteristics, efficacy and safety outcomes.

When FIO 2 was further decreased to 8 %, Ppa decreased to 32 mm Hg (p < 0. 01). This stimulus-response curve was unaffected by saline, but displaced in a non-PO 2 -dependent manner to higher Ppa by <b>doxapram</b> and by aspirin. CONCLUSIONS: The pulmonary vascular response to inspiratory hypoxia in intact anaesthetised piglets is biphasic, with a maximum at an FIO 2 of 12 %. Neither aspirin nor <b>doxapram</b> affect the shape of this stimulus-response curve, and in particular do not prevent low FIO 2 associated inhibition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Almitrine and <b>doxapram,</b> two {{structurally}} unrelated peripheral chemoreceptor agonists, {{have been}} shown to enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction in anesthetized dogs. We hypothesized that these drugs would increase pulmonary vascular tone and improve gas exchange in canine lung injury caused by oleic acid (OA). Pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange were investigated in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs before and after intravenously administered OA 0. 09 ml/kg and again after placebo (n = 6), almitrine 2 micrograms/kg/min (n = 6), or <b>doxapram</b> 20 micrograms/kg/min (n = 6) in a randomized order. Cardiac output (Q) was manipulated using a femoral arteriovenous bypass and an inferior vena cava balloon catheter to construct mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) -Q plots in order to discriminate active from passive changes in Ppa. Gas exchange was assessed by measuring arterial PO 2 and intrapulmonary shunt, determined using a sulfur hexafluoride infusion. OA increased Ppa over the range of Q studied, and it deteriorated gas exchange by an increase in intrapulmonary shunt. After OA, placebo had no effect on Ppa, arterial PO 2, or intrapulmonary shunt. Both almitrine and <b>doxapram</b> further increased Ppa at all levels of Q studied, but they did not affect indices of gas exchange after OA. We conclude that in this experimental model of acute lung injury, almitrine and <b>doxapram</b> induce pulmonary vasoconstriction without, however, diverting blood flow toward better oxygenated lung regions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES : To {{determine}} whether CX 1942 reverses respiratory depression in etorphineimmobilized goats, and to compare its effects {{with those of}} <b>doxapram</b> hydrochloride. STUDY DESIGN : A prospective, crossover experimental trial conducted at 1753 m. a. s. l. ANIMALS : Eight adult female Boer goats (Capra hircus) with a mean ± standard deviationmass of 27. 1 ± 1. 6 kg. METHODS : Following immobilization with 0. 1 mg kg− 1 etorphine, goats received one of <b>doxapram,</b> CX 1942 or sterile water intravenously, in random order in three trials. Respiratory rate, ventilation and tidal volume were measured continuously. Arterial blood samples for the determination of PaO 2, PaCO 2, pH and SaO 2 were taken 2 minutes before and then at 5 minute intervals after drug administration for 25 minutes. RESULTS : <b>Doxapram</b> corrected etorphine-induced respiratory depression but also led to arousal and hyperventilation at 2 minutes after its administration, {{as indicated by the}} low PaCO 2 (27. 8 ± 4. 5 mmHg) and ventilation of 5. 32 ± 5. 24 L minute− 1 above pre-immobilization values. CX 1942 improved respiratory parameters and corrected etorphine's hypoxaemic effects more gradually than did <b>doxapram,</b> with a more sustained improvement in PaO 2 and SaO 2 in comparison with the control trial. CONCLUSIONS : CX 1942 attenuated opioid-induced respiratory depression and corrected the hypoxaemic effects of etorphine in immobilized goats. CLINICAL RELEVANCE : Ampakines potentially offer advantages over <b>doxapram,</b> a conventional treatment, in reversing etorphine-induced respiratory depression without causing unwanted side effects, particularly arousal, in immobilized animals.

30|$|The use of {{caffeine}} and <b>doxapram</b> may have aided in the stimulation of regular respiratory effort in our CPAP model. Both are effective {{for this purpose}} in the premature lamb [22] and may have a synergistic effect when used together [18]. <b>Doxapram</b> is used in veterinary medicine {{as a treatment for}} apnoea in preterm and asphyxiated animals, with a relatively wide gap between therapeutic and toxic windows [23]. Nevertheless, some unwanted neurological effects, in particular myoclonic activity, were seen after bolus doses in some animals, emphasising the need for judicious use of this medication in this setting.|$|E
