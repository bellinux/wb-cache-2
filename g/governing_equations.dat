5|$|Tropical cyclone {{forecasting}} also {{relies on}} {{data provided by}} numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist: Statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that {{is not based on}} the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the <b>governing</b> <b>equations</b> of fluid flow in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.|$|E

We perform a thorough symmetry analysis of the general equation in one, two and three spatial dimensions. We identify all special forms of the two arbitrary functions which admit special symmetry properties and for these cases, attempt to reduce the <b>governing</b> <b>equation</b> to an differential equation. We show that reduction of the <b>governing</b> <b>equation</b> an ordinary differential equation is possible in many cases.

As a result, we construct an infinite family of time-dependent solutions satisfying nonsingular initial conditions for special cases of the <b>governing</b> <b>equation</b> in both and three dimensions.

An ensemble {{version of the}} <b>governing</b> <b>equations</b> is solved, which introduces new apparent stresses known as Reynolds stresses. This adds a second order tensor of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations {{do not apply to}} flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are 'time-averaged'. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid only as long as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time scales of the turbulent motion containing most of the energy.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} {{numerical}} weather prediction began in the 1920s {{through the efforts of}} Lewis Fry Richardson, who used procedures originally developed by Vilhelm Bjerknes to produce by hand a six-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. [...] It was not until the advent of the computer and computer simulations that computation time was reduced to less than the forecast period itself. The ENIAC was used to create the first weather forecasts via computer in 1950, based on a highly simplified approximation to the atmospheric <b>governing</b> <b>equations.</b> In 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby's group at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute used the same model to produce the first operational forecast (i.e., a routine prediction for practical use). Operational {{numerical weather prediction}} in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau. [...] In 1956, Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere; this became the first successful climate model. Following Phillips' work, several groups began working to create general circulation models. [...] The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.|$|E
