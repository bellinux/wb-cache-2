40|$|Abstract-Encouraging {{cooperation}} in self-organizing ad hoc networks {{has been an}} important task in the last few years. <b>The</b> main focus <b>of</b> previous work is on providing protocols which encourage packet forwarding in multi-hop networks in absence ofamanaged infrastructure.

Instead, <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communication entities as well as the route including <b>the</b> <b>identities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intermediate nodes are revealed.

5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filaments {{preserved in the}} first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that the structures preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, {{who had not yet}} examined the specimen, wrote in Audubon Magazine that the structures of Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were stiffening structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating the structures with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of the team members disagreeing over the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structures.|$|E
