Phil Trinity Term 2000 This thesis is about the statutes of Acton Burnell (1283) and Merchants (1285) which provided for the voluntary registration of debts before specially established registries, and sophisticated measures of execution against the defaulting debtor's person, goods, and lands. The introduction describes the sources for this thesis; the London Recognisance rolls; the certificates of statute merchant into the Chancery; the Plea Rolls of the Royal courts and of local - principally, borough - courts. Chapter 1 describes the background to the statutes, in particular the recoverability of debts before Royal, local, and mercantile courts before 1283. Chapter 2 explores the immediate legal and political contexts of Acton Burnell. A draft of the statute is discussed and compared with the statute. The need for reform in 1285 is assessed, setting Merchants alongside Westminster II n c. 39. The provisions under both statutory schemes for recognition and enrolment of the debt, and the initiation of execution are described. Chapter 4 examines <b>execution</b> against the <b>debtor's</b> movable property. The statutory appraisal, sale and delivery of the debtor's goods are examined and compared both with the draft provisions and common law modes of execution. Appraisers' liability under the statutes is examined. Competing execution against the same debtor is investigated. Chapter 5 examines the debtor's arrest and detention, gaolers' statutory liability, statutory costs and damages. It investigates {{the operation of the}} statutes once the debt had been satisfied, the mechanisms for obtaining the debtor's release, and challenges to unlawful imprisonment via the writ audita querela. Chapter 6 examines <b>execution</b> against the <b>debtor's</b> immovable property. The chapter discusses the 'extent' by which the debtor's lands were to be delivered to the creditor under Merchants, {{and the nature of the}} creditor's holding of his debtor's immovables (the tenancy 'by statute merchant').

It can be {{traditionally}} {{argued that}} since Roman times guaranteeing in Europe {{has been a}} widely used way of securing obligations, which is also applied in Lithuania, however the increased number of persons unable to meet their obligations during the financial crisis has affected {{the interests of the}} creditors and state. In addition, during the financial crisis and after it the guaranteeing institute applied in practice has faced with new challenges when the Lithuanian courts, which deal with civil cases concerning failure to fulfill the guaranteeing obligations, could not immediately properly form the case law when explaining if the guaranteeing is fixed-term when the agreement of the guarantor with the creditor provides that the guarantor is responsible for the debtor to the creditor till the full implementation of the debtor's obligations to the creditor. In order to draw a proper conclusion as to whether the courts properly form the case law when solving if the guaranteeing is fixed-term when the agreement of the guarantor with the creditor provides that the guarantor is responsible for the debtor to the creditor till the full implementation of the debtor's obligations to the creditor, the Master thesis, in particular, has revealed not the concept of guaranteeing as a way to ensure the obligations in the Lithuanian law, but has looked at the concept in the civil law, the sources, the subject matter and methods, the judge’s situation in the civil law and morality. After that one part of the thesis has been devoted to the analysis of the individual issues related to the guaranteeing, including the main issue relating {{to the role of the}} award of a contract. The thesis has taken into account the problems and the fundamentals of the end of the guaranteeing established in the law in dealing with the issues related to the end of the guaranteeing. The thesis has also looked at the customs established in the Civil Code as the measure for regulation of civil relations. Guarantees are one marketed Collateral measures in favor of both natural and legal persons civilian circulation to take place. Guarantees especially important financially strong enough, but good personal and business reputation with natural or legal persons. In order to bail as a measure to ensure the fulfillment of obligations to be implemented, it is sufficient to persuade the debtor to the creditor the surety of personal reliability and agree on a warranty guarantor. Surety sufficient to realize a simple written form of bailouts for their solidarity is attractive to the creditor, the creditor the surety liable with all its assets. Guarantees by their nature, due to the fact that between the guarantor and the borrower usually there are more than formal relationship, so this fact implies greater and more effective protection of the creditor is marketed. For this reason, the guarantee is one of the most civil circulation occurring in the discharge of obligations of collateral. It should be noted that most often encountered in the civil circulation, gratuitous bail because, as already mentioned, the debtor and surety commonly linked persons. Surety, by agreeing to answer a debtor gratuitously for the borrower is not met or incorrectly executed obligations to creditors, basically assume all the negative consequences that arise or may arise from the debtor to the creditor are not fulfilled or improperly fulfilled the obligation, but for it does not receive any bonuses. Thus, the guarantor, assuming the obligation to answer the debtor to the creditor, is highly responsible to assess the extent of the guarantee and the deadline. Especially important guarantor is a clear need and knowledge on a warranty period. Research object. The object of research - the essence of CK and norms that define the essence of a surety, fixed-term and indefinite surety end. Research methods. Theoretical study. Applicable logical, systematic analysis, comparative, linguistic methods. Presentation of the study and interpretation will be analyzed in Lithuanian case law development, the courts dealing with the question of whether bail is fixed, if the surety agreement with the creditor provides that the guarantor is responsible for the debtor to the creditor until the full <b>execution</b> <b>debtor's</b> obligations to the creditor, and the case-law consequences. The aim. Taking into account the case law, the surety, which the surety contract agreed with the condition that the guarantee is valid until the full obligations under the main contract execution, the possibility to discuss the warranty expiry, if the debtor sued if it terminated the contract because of his fault, is quite difficult. It can be concluded that the prevailing case law trends are completely useless guarantor, protected only the creditor's rights. The goal - a detailed examination of the surety institute legal regulation, the interpretation and application of the case law, to identify and analyze the surety of legal relations regulation and application and interpretation problems: the guarantee of legal relationship between the identification, separation from other securing obligations institutes and the application together with other institutes issues, guarantor rights of insufficient consolidation and defense issues, as well as the Civil Code, which enshrines the guarantee institution, governing rules and case law interpreting, but also in developing new rules for the guarantee in legal relations, relationship problems surety legal relations in the development and application of the process - to determine whether bail is term, if the surety agreement with the creditor provides that the guarantor is responsible for the debtor to the creditor until the full <b>execution</b> <b>debtor's</b> obligations to the creditor?

40|$|The {{home of a}} debtor {{has never}} enjoyed {{specific}} statutory protection against forced sale in the individual debt enforcement and insolvency procedures in South Africa. In Jaftha v Schoeman and Others; Van Rooyen v Stoltz and Others (2005 (2) SA 140 (CC)) and Gundwana v Steko Development CC and Others (2011 (3) SA 608 (CC)), the Constitutional Court recognised that in the individual debt enforcement process <b>execution</b> against a <b>debtor's</b> home, even {{where it has been}} mortgaged in favour of a creditor, may constitute an unjustifiable infringement of the right to have access to adequate housing, provided by section 26 of the Constitution. The effect of these decisions is that, in every case in which a creditor seeks to execute against a person's home, a court must consider "all the relevant circumstances" to determine whether execution is justifiable, in terms of section 36 of the Constitution. The absence of a properly constructed framework, incorporating clear substantive and procedural requirements, within which these recently established principles must be applied, has led to divergent approaches in the courts and a lack of clarity regarding circumstances in which <b>execution</b> against a <b>debtor's</b> home will be permitted. Further, courts have not considered the impact of section 26 and other rights on the position where a debtor's home is realised by the trustee of an insolvent estate in terms of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936. This has given rise to a number of unanswered questions as well as to a lack of predictability that potentially hold adverse consequences for bond finance, commerce, and the economy generally. The need to balance the competing interests emphasises the necessity for a coherent contextual framework within which forced sale of a debtor's home may occur. This thesis examines issues surrounding forced sale of a debtor's home in South Africa. It compares the position in other legal systems and suggests mechanisms and an appropriate method, or process, for inclusion in statutory provisions to regulate the forced sale of a debtor's home in both the individual debt enforcement and insolvency procedures in South Africa.

The {{arrest of}} ship implicates a series of legal relations, often in different jurisdictions, that are of great significance for successful effectuating of this temporary measure. Lawyers, who are engaged in the {{arrest of ship}}s, {{have to know how}} to establish the subjectivity of parties according to rules of strict process legitimacy in right jurisdiction, in order to arrest the right ship at the right time. The effectuation of arrest presupposes finding out the way through different jurisdictions, which contain certain distinctions. They show themselves through the nature of maritime claim, court jurisdiction, relation between debtor, i. e. defendant, the ship intended for the arrest, and the claimant i. e. applicant, security and the countersecurity for the eventual damages caused by wrongful arrest as a consequence of improper proceeding, or through the inequalities of legislative solutions. The arrest of ship, as a temporary measure, is the subject of regulation of international law as well, while the national legislation regulates some other temporary measures. However, execution and the security on maritime ships, concerning the specificity of relations, make certain exceptions from the general rules on execution and security. Although the ships are movables, the legal regime that is appropriate to real estate is applied to them in many ways, and the regime of execution as well. By proceedings of execution on ships are often imperilled the third person 2 ̆ 7 s interests, as of the cargo proxy, lien and mortgage claimants, crew and passengers; in the course of that is strived, to a greatest extent, to protect the interests of those parties. Also, the lengthy of proceedings of execution on ships concerning the security procedure would come to an expressive opposition with necessities of navigation. Therefore, the rules of proceedings in relation to execution must especially be inspired by tendency for fast, economical and efficient proceeding, which will, if possible, ensure as undisturbed as possible, exploitation of ship, even during the execution proceedings. On the other hand, the subject of execution is very mobile, and it demands special measures which scope is the insurance of an efficient seizure of the subject of execution. Concerning the emphasized foreign element in the maritime traffic, the foreign persons may appear as applicants for <b>execution</b> or the <b>debtors</b> in <b>execution</b> proceedings, as representatives of other real-estate relations, of as the competitors in procedure of forced sale of ships. This imposes the necessity of inclination towards solutions established by international conventions, which should be or have been receipted in internal legislature, or Serbia and Montenegro has joined these enactments of international law; while it still does not exist the accepted, uniform international legal system of execution on ships.
