The concern is on how new entrants of the Bank pass through the <b>induction</b> and socialization <b>training</b> program. The paper provides a review of current practice and offers suggestions for future investigation. An Extensive review of the literature related to standard <b>induction</b> and socialization <b>training</b> programs across various sector {{to assess the}} current practice of the Bank. The study was conducted on new employees who had actively participated {{the first round of the}} 2013 / 14 <b>induction</b> and socialization <b>training</b> program which was held from September 15 to October 10 / 2014. Descriptive research method was applied for describing the existing practice of the Bank’s on induction and socialization programs and to evaluate its contribution on the performance as well as perception of the new employees. The mixed method which includes both quantitative and qualitative approaches is utilized to maximize the completion of the research. A questionnaire was designed using structured questions to collect primary data from participants of the <b>induction</b> and socialization <b>training</b> program. One hundred and five questionnaires were distributed and collected from the induction participants. Personal interview were held with HRDD management staff of the Bank. The study used cross sectional survey method. Data was collected through census. The results indicated that most of the new entrants were of the view that the <b>induction</b> and socialization <b>training</b> program is essential for both to the new entrants and the Bank’s success. The findings also revealed that Problem has been encountered on performance because of the delay of the <b>induction</b> and socialization <b>training</b> program. And it was recommended that HRDD should undertake <b>induction</b> and socialization <b>training</b> programs in due concern as early as possible by being systematic on the schedule, by segregating the target groups considering the essentials of induction trainings and the employment period. The study concluded that for a better <b>induction</b> and socialization <b>training</b> programs, possible changes should be made in the future. This will have a benefit both for new entrants and the Bank. Key words: <b>Induction,</b> Socialization, <b>training,</b> development, orientation...|$|R
