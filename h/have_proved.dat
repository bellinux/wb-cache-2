5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters the lake {{in the form of}} non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors could also be used to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the coins (e.g. {{providing}} kings' names), they <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 percent of the city of Aksum remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who happen to be the most famous kings: Ezana and Kaleb, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Dunne's {{bartender}} came to wider {{attention with}} the wartime columns, and the Dooley pieces were soon in newspapers nationwide. Both the columns {{and the books}} collecting them gained national acclaim. Beginning around 1905, Dunne had increasing trouble finding time and inspiration for new columns, and they ended in 1915, except for a brief resurrection in the mid-1920s. Even in Dunne's own time (he died in 1936), his work was becoming obscure {{due in part to}} his use of dialect, and the unusual spellings that it used <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> a lasting barrier for potential readers.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} animals <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> {{to be able}} to acquire forms of {{communication}} through social learning: for instance a bonobo named Kanzi learned to express itself using a set of symbolic lexigrams. Similarly, many species of birds and whales learn their songs by imitating other members of their species. However, while some animals may acquire large numbers of words and symbols, none have been able to learn as many different signs as are generally known by an average 4 year old human, nor have any acquired anything resembling the complex grammar of human language.|$|E
5|$|The Nefertiti bust {{has become}} a {{cultural}} symbol of Berlin as well as ancient Egypt. Nefertiti herself has become quite an icon. Nefertiti is widely known for her beauty and versatility. It has also {{been the subject of}} an intense argument between Egypt and Germany over Egyptian demands for its repatriation. It was dragged into controversy by the Body of Nefertiti art exhibition and also by doubts over its authenticity. However various testing and analysis of the bust <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> it to be authentic.|$|E

5|$|The armor {{scheme of}} the Gangut-class ships had some {{significant}} weaknesses. The rear transverse bulkhead was unprotected {{by any other}} armor but was the same thickness as the forward bulkhead which was defended by the upper belt armor. The thinness of the barbette armor was a serious defect which could <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> fatal in a battle. And {{the lack of a}} splinter bulkhead behind the armor of the turrets, barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations vulnerable to main gun hits. But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti-torpedo bulkhead, which made them highly vulnerable to mines or torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|The most {{conclusive}} aqueous chemistry {{studies of}} rutherfordium {{have been performed}} by the Japanese team at Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute using the isotope 261mRf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, hafnium, zirconium, {{as well as the}} pseudo-group 4 element thorium <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> a non-actinide behavior for rutherfordium. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, {{in a manner similar to}} hafnium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|While {{the revolt}} was {{unfolding}} in London, John Wrawe led his force into Suffolk. Wrawe had considerable {{influence over the}} development of the revolt across eastern England, where there may have been almost as many rebels as in the London revolt. The authorities put up very little resistance to the revolt: the major nobles failed to organise defences, key fortifications fell easily to the rebels and the local militias were not mobilised. As in London and the south-east, this was in part due to the absence of key military leaders and the nature of English law, but any locally recruited men might also <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> unreliable {{in the face of a}} popular uprising.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{endured a}} poor {{start to the}} 1971–72 season, {{and as a result}} Mee {{purchased}} Alan Ball, Jr. from Everton for £220,000. They went on to go 14 games unbeaten over the winter, closing the gap on leaders Manchester City to four points. They were knocked out of the European Cup at the quarter-final stage by eventual winners Ajax. They ended the season in fifth place, and gifted Derby County the league title by denying Liverpool what would <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> to be a decisive victory on the penultimate day of the season. Arsenal returned to Wembley to defend the FA Cup, but lost 1–0 to Leeds United; Kennedy had lost his first team place late in the season after fatigue began to affect his form, and was only named as a substitute for the final before he came on for Radford after 73 minutes. Kennedy scored 19 goals in 55 appearances to finish as the club's top goalscorer for the second successive season.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 20th century, New Zealand was {{involved}} in world affairs, fighting in the First and Second World Wars and suffering through the Great Depression. The depression led to {{the election of the}} First Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy. New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War and Māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work. A Māori protest movement developed, which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and of the Treaty of Waitangi. In 1975, a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985. The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi, although Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> controversial in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Following Wyatt's rebellion, Guildford Dudley was {{beheaded}} on 12 February 1554 {{shortly before}} his wife. Knowing the Queen's character, in June 1554 Jane Dudley pleaded with the authorities to allow her remaining sons to hear mass. During 1554 the Duchess and her son-in-law Henry Sidney worked hard pleading with the Spanish nobles around England's new king consort, Philip of Spain. Lord Paget may also <b>have</b> <b>proved</b> helpful, and Henry Sidney even travelled to Spain in their cause. In the autumn of 1554 the Dudley brothers were released from the Tower, though the eldest, John, died immediately afterwards at Sidney's house Penshurst in Kent. At the same location Philip Sidney was born on 30 November 1554. His godmother was his grandmother Jane Dudley, while his godfather was Philip of Spain.|$|E
