5|$|Further combat was averted on 12 November {{when the}} Erdut Agreement {{was signed by}} the RSK acting defense {{minister}} Milan Milanović, on instructions received from Slobodan Milošević and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia officials. The agreement stated that the remaining occupied area was {{to be returned to}} Croatia, with a two-year transitional period. The new UN mission was established as the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1037 of 15 January 1996. The agreement guarantees also right of establishment of <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> of Municipalities for local Serbian community.|$|E
5|$|The mission did {{fail and}} the {{internal}} settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional <b>joint</b> <b>Council</b> of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and the guerrilla war continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978 after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.|$|E
25|$|But by mid-July 1927, the AFL's {{claims were}} {{proven to be}} false. The <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> lost most of its support, and the Gold-led Joint Board {{received}} recognition by companies employing a majority of workers in the fur district. Most employers no longer compelled their workers to join the <b>Joint</b> <b>Council,</b> and the Joint Board's 1926 contract was re-established and enforced.|$|E

5000|$|In 1937, Beck {{formed the}} Western Conference of Teamsters {{as a means}} of counteracting the {{conservative}} leadership of <b>Joint</b> <b>Councils</b> in San Francisco. Beck persuaded Teamsters president Daniel J. Tobin that the Western Conference of Teamsters was no threat to the power and authority of the international union. Harry Bridges, leader of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), had led a successful four-day strike in 1934. Bridges was now leading [...] "the march inland"—an attempt to organize warehouse workers away from shipping ports. Beck was alarmed by Bridges' radical politics and worried that the ILA would encroach on Teamster jurisdictions. But Teamster <b>joint</b> <b>councils</b> in Los Angeles and other California ports seemed unconcerned. As an end run around the complacent <b>joint</b> <b>councils,</b> Beck formed a large regional organization. Beck engaged in fierce organizing battles and membership raids against the ILA, effectively stifling the [...] "march inland." [...] The Western Conference of Teamsters, and Beck, emerged significantly stronger from these battles.|$|R

25|$|These {{efforts to}} {{undercut}} Gold and the Joint Board also failed. Several IFWU locals outside New York City passed resolutions criticizing the International Union's actions, and worker {{support for the}} <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> dwindled even further. On July 6, 1928, the AFL notified the <b>Joint</b> <b>Council</b> that it was withdrawing all staff and monetary support for the rump union. When the news leaked to the leaders of other needle trade unions, President Green was forced to publicly reiterate the AFL's support for the non-communist union. But the new flow of funds and staff did nothing to resuscitate the <b>Joint</b> <b>Council.</b> Worse, from the AFL's perspective, the Joint Board then called several strikes in July 1928 and won major wage increases from the employers.|$|E

To forestall any peace talks, AFL President Green launched a major initiative to drive communists and communist sympathizers out of all AFL-affiliated local, national and international unions.
