5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse {{in the value of the}} currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency.|$|E
5|$|Austria and Switzerland {{are both}} {{members of the}} Partnership for Peace, and border NATO member states. Malta {{is also a member}} of the Partnership for Peace and the European Union.

5|$|In chapter 3, King Völsung {{is holding}} a {{marriage}} feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung's hall. At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running {{the length of the}} hall, while {{in the middle of the}} hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize.</b> The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it into the trunk of the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} loanwords for food dishes and their {{ingredients}} are Hokkien in origin, {{and are used}} throughout the Indonesian language and vernacular speech of large cities. Because they have {{become an integral part}} of the local language, many Indonesians and ethnic Chinese <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> their Hokkien origins. Some popular Indonesian dishes such as nasi goreng, lumpia, and bakpia can trace their origin to Chinese influence. Some food and ingredients are part of the daily diet of both the indigenous and ethnic Chinese populations as side dishes to accompany rice, the staple food of most of the country. Among ethnic Chinese families, both peranakan and totok, pork is generally preferred as meat; this is in contrast with traditional Indonesian cuisine, which in majority-Muslim areas avoids the meat. The consumption of pork has, however, decreased in recent years owing to a recognition of its contribution to health hazards such as high cholesterol levels and heart disease.|$|E

5|$|After {{cutting and}} dyeing her hair, Sil takes an {{attraction}} to Preston, having dreamt of him the previous night. After the team celebrates their apparent victory, she stalks {{them in their}} hotel, and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> her. Arden, who is upset at being single, walks into his room to find Sil waiting there. She has intercourse with Arden, then kills him when he realizes who she is. Dan senses that Sil is in the hotel and he alerts Preston, Laura, {{and the rest of}} the team. She morphs again and escapes and they follow her into the sewers where Fitch is subsequently killed. Sil gives birth and Dan finds her offspring in a cavern behind the sewers. The child attacks him and he incinerates it. Sil, angered, attacks the trio in an attempt to kill Preston and Dan. Preston uses a shotgun on her head, decapitating and killing her. The trio leaves the area. The last scene shows a rat chewing on one of Sil's severed tentacles; it starts to mutate into a vicious beast and attacks another rat.|$|E
5|$|In American football, passing, {{along with}} running (also {{referred}} to as rushing), {{is one of the}} two main methods of advancing the ball down the field. Passes are typically attempted by the quarterback, but any offensive player can attempt a pass provided they are behind the line of scrimmage. To qualify as a passing play, the ball must have initially moved forward after leaving the hands of the passer; if the ball initially moved laterally or backwards, the play would instead be considered a running play. A player who catches a forward pass is a receiver, and the number of receiving yards each player has recorded in each season is a recorded stat in football games. In addition to the overall National Football League (NFL) receiving champion, league record books recognize statistics from the American Football League (AFL), which operated from 1960 to 1969 before being absorbed into the NFL in 1970, Although league record books <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> stats from the All-America Football Conference, another league that merged with the NFL, these statistics are recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|P. (c.) tristis, the Siberian chiffchaff, breeds in Siberia {{east of the}} Pechora River and {{winters in}} the lower Himalayas. It is also {{regularly}} recorded in western Europe in winter, {{and it is likely}} that the numbers involved have been underestimated due to uncertainties over identification criteria, lack of good data and recording policies (Sweden and Finland only accept trapped birds). It is a dull subspecies, grey or brownish above and whitish below, with little yellow in the plumage, and the buff-white supercilium is often longer than in the western subspecies. It has a higher pitched suitsistsuisit song and a short high-pitched cheet call. It is sometimes considered to be a full species due to its distinctive plumage and vocalisations, being similar to P. s. sindianus in these respects. Nominate P. c. collybita and P. c. tristis <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> each other's songs. Pending resolution of the status of P. (c.) fulvescens, which is found where the ranges of P. c. abietinus and P. c. tristis connect and may or may not be a hybrid between these, tristis is maintained in P. collybita.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1898. Peck collected the type specimen in Port Jefferson, New York. In 1945, Rolf Singer proposed the variety Boletus auripes var. aureissimus {{as a new}} combination of the name Ceriomyces aureissimus described by William Alphonso Murrill in 1938; this taxon is now regarded as a distinct species under the name Boletus aureissimus. In 1936, Wally Snell reported finding a specimen of Boletus crassipes, another species described by Peck from Mount Gretna, Pennsylvania. Snell suggested that although B.crassipes might be a valid species distinguished from B.auripes by a deeper brown cap color, yellow flesh that does not fade to white, and a stem with a more orange-yellow color and more extensive reticulation, he conceded {{that it was not}} clear that the morphological characteristics between the two did not overlap, and that further collections would be needed to clarify any differences between them. A couple of years later, he was more convinced of his stance and considered the two conspecific. The taxonomic authorities Index Fungorum and MycoBank, however, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> this putative synonymy.|$|E
5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and {{described it as a}} separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to transfer it to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>recognize</b> this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography to show {{that it was not a}} hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum forma shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly dissected to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E
