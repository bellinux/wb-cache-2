5|$|In early October 1944, Landis {{checked into}} St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, {{where his wife}} Winifred had been hospitalized, with a severe cold. While in the hospital, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack, causing him to miss the World Series {{for the first time}} in his commissionership. He {{remained}} fully alert, and as usual signed the World Series share checks to players. His contract was due to expire in January 1946; on November 17, 1944, baseball's owners voted him another seven-year term. However, on November 25, he died surrounded by family, five days after his 78thbirthday. His longtime assistant, Leslie O'Connor, wept as he read the announcement for the press. Landis is buried at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The ballad Master McGrath {{concerns}} a greyhound {{of that name}} from Lurgan which became an Irish sporting hero. The dog was bought in Lurgan by the Brownlow family, and the song also mentions his owner Charles Brownlow, {{referred to in the}} lyrics as Lord Lurgan. Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup hare coursing competition three times in 1868, 1870 and 1871 at a time when this was a high-profile sport. A post mortem found that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> twice the size of what is normal for a dog of his size. He is remembered all over the town, including in its coat of arms. The dog was named McGrath after the kennel boy responsible for its care. A statue of him was unveiled at Craigavon Civic Centre in 1993, over 120 years after his last glory in 1871. The statue was relocated to Lurgan town centre in 2013. A festival is also held yearly in his honour. A Lurgan pub was also named after Master McGrath, although it has been renamed in recent years.|$|E

25|$|A {{combination}} of this largesse and government intervention eventually put Louis in severe financial straits. His entrusting of his finances to former manager Mike Jacobs haunted him. After the $500,000 IRS tax bill was assessed, with interest accumulating every year, {{the need for}} cash precipitated Louis's post-retirement comeback. Even though his comeback earned him significant purses, the incremental tax rate {{in place at the}} time (90%) meant that these boxing proceeds did not even keep pace with interest on Louis's tax debt. As a result, {{by the end of the}} 1950s, he owed over $1 million in taxes and interest. In 1953, when Louis's mother died, the IRS appropriated the $667 she had willed to Louis. To bring in money, Louis engaged in numerous activities outside the ring. He appeared on various quiz shows, and an old Army buddy, Ash Resnick, gave Louis a job greeting tourists to the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas, where Resnick was an executive. For income, Louis even became a professional wrestler. He made his professional wrestling debut on March 16, 1956 in Washington, D.C., defeating Cowboy Rocky Lee. After defeating Lee in a few matches, Louis discovered <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> ailment and retired from wrestling competition. However, he continued as a wrestling referee until 1972.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 1959, Hammond {{was offered}} {{a job as a}} sports {{administrator}} at University of Natal with the aim of developing its sports facilities. In February 1960, he was involved in a serious car crash. It was uncertain whether he would survive, but he pulled through. Three months after the accident, he returned to work and became involved with coaching. [...] In 1962, Hammond visited England as part of a drive to recruit new members for Gloucestershire. He showed some interest in taking over a pub, but nothing came of it. On the M.C.C. tour of South Africa in 1964–65, he joined the England dressing room, becoming popular with the players. On 1 July 1965, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack and died after a few hours' illness.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} half of 1923, Harding did two acts that were later said to {{indicate}} foreknowledge of death: he sold the Star (though undertaking to remain as a contributing editor for ten years after his presidency), and made a new will. Harding had long suffered occasional health problems, but when he was not experiencing symptoms he tended to eat, drink, and smoke too much. By 1919, he was aware <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> condition. Stress caused by the presidency and by Florence Harding's ill-health (she had a chronic kidney condition) debilitated him, and he never really recovered from an episode of influenza in January 1923. After that, Harding, an avid golfer, had difficulty completing a round. In June 1923, Ohio Senator Willis met with Harding, but brought to the president's attention only two of the five items he intended to discuss. When asked why, Willis responded, [...] "Warren seemed so tired".|$|E
500|$|Flanagan {{returned}} {{to working with}} Fitzgerald in 1968. In addition to being her pianist, mostly {{as part of a}} trio, he was her musical director. Her popularity meant that a lot of touring was required: 40–45 weeks a year, including at least one tour of Europe a year (29 cities there in 1970, for example). During these concerts, Flanagan often played [...] a set as part of his trio, without the singer. Beginning in 1974, he again began to perform and record as a leader: his 1975 trio release, The Tommy Flanagan Tokyo Recital, was his first as leader since 1960. Prior to these performances, he had felt that his technique was inadequate for a soloist, but he enjoyed the extra exposure of being a leader, so decided to continue. Flanagan ended his role with Fitzgerald in 1978, after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> attack and had become tired of extensive touring. After the heart attack, he stopped smoking, reduced the amount that he drank, and exercised by walking more than he had previously.|$|E

500|$|Following Aston's death, former {{colleague}} Francis Pryor noted that Aston was a [...] "remarkable archaeologist who could really dig", being a [...] "warm, loving, nice man." [...] Another colleague, Phil Harding, commented on Aston's [...] "incredible knowledge" [...] and [...] "effortless {{way of making}} archaeology accessible to people." [...] Tony Robinson wrote of him: [...] "Mick was a real child of the '60s {{and a bit of}} a rebel, but he was also a series of contradictions. He {{was one of the best}} academic archaeologists in the country, yet his real love was teaching ordinary people. He was the grumpiest old Black Country curmudgeon you could imagine, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> of absolute gold." [...] He also noted that [...] "archaeology is now a subject that tens of thousands of people enjoy and value, and this is almost solely down to him." [...] Ralph Lee, head of Channel 4's factual programming, described Aston as a [...] "brilliant communicator" [...] who helped make archaeology [...] "so popular" [...] in the UK.|$|E
500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Cherepanov's death, there were many conflicting reports and accusations. [...] Early reports indicated that Cherepanov suffered from chronic myocardial ischemia, and many reports questioned Avangard Omsk's medical staff and why they were unaware of his heart condition. Other reports claimed that Cherepanov's autopsy showed evidence of myocarditis. Outside doctors, particularly in North America were skeptical of this early explanation, believing it unlikely that a young, elite athlete would suffer from an undiagnosed form of ischemia, particularly when considering the medical testing he underwent prior to the NHL draft. [...] Further reports out of Russia suggested a hypertrophic heart, which would be more in line with other cases of sudden death in athletes. [...] In addition to issues with {{the immediate}} cause of death for Cherepanov, Russian officials immediately launched an investigation into the emergency response by the team, facilities and paramedics on site. Initial concerns were raised as to why Cherepanov had been allowed to play, if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> condition that should have been picked up by routine medical tests that he was believed to have undergone. [...] The ambulance that is required to be on duty at all KHL games had already left, as there were only five minutes left in the game, and the defibrillator in the arena was non-functional.|$|E

He was more freakish than Ted Flemming, and that's saying something. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> as big as a grandstand and stood up to heavy punishment as well as risking a broken neck in his phenomenal leaps for the ball.

2500|$|Three {{individuals}} were involved: the one running the experiment, {{the subject of}} the experiment (a volunteer), and a [...] pretending to be a volunteer.

The subject and the actor both drew slips of paper to determine their roles, but unknown to the subject, both slips said [...] "teacher". The actor would always claim to have drawn the slip that read [...] "learner", thus guaranteeing that the subject would always be the [...] "teacher". Next, the [...] "teacher" [...] and [...] "learner" [...] were taken into an adjacent room where the [...] "learner" [...] was strapped into what appeared to be an electric chair.
