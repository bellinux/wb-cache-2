5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of <b>hair</b> <b>brushes,</b> pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E

6000|$|Frau Ebermann {{reflected}} {{that in an}} hour or so the aspirin would begin to work, and all would be well. To-morrow--no, the day after--she would take up life with something to talk over with her friends at coffee. It was rare--every one knew it--that she should be overcome by any ailment. Yet in all her distresses she had not allowed the minutest deviation from daily routine and ritual. She would tell her friends--she ran over their names one by one--exactly what measures she had taken against the lace cover on the radiator-top and in regard to her two tortoise-shell <b>hair</b> <b>brushes</b> and the comb at right angles. How she had set everything in order--everything in order. She roved further afield as she wriggled her toes luxuriously on the hot-water bottle. If it pleased our dear God to take her to Himself, and she was not so young as she had been--there was that plate of the four lower ones in the blue tooth-glass, for instance--He should find all her belongings fit to meet His eye. 'Swept and garnished' were the words that shaped themselves in her intent brain. 'Swept and garnished for--' ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Maddison--to drop at {{this point}} the name under which he had chosen to become the tenant of Falcon's Nest--was a member of a {{well-known}} London club, chiefly affected by literary men, and after his acceptance of Lady Thurwell's invitation, he hastened there at once and went to his room to dress. As a rule a man does not indulge in any very profound meditation during the somewhat tedious process of changing his morning clothes for the monotonous garb of Western civilization. His attention is generally fully claimed by the satisfactory adjusting of his tie and the precaution he has to use to avoid anything so lamentable as a crease in his shirt, and if his thoughts stray at all, it is seldom beyond the immediate matter of his toilet, or at most a little anticipation with regard to the forthcoming evening. If {{on the right side of}} thirty, a pair of bright eyes may sometimes make him pause for a moment, even with the <b>hair</b> <b>brushes</b> in his hands, to wonder if she will be there to-night, and if by any fortunate chance he will be able to take her in to dinner. And if the reign of the forties has commenced, it is just possible that a little mild speculation as to the entrées may be admitted. But, as a rule, a man's thoughts do not on such an occasion strike deep beneath the surface, and there is no record of an author having laid the plan of his next work, or a soldier having marked out a campaign, while struggling with a refractory tie, or obstinate parting. Even if such had ever happened to be the case, we should not have cared to hear about it. We prefer to think of a Napoleon planning great conquests in the serene stillness of night among a sleeping camp and beneath a starlit sky, or of a Wordsworth writing his poetry in his cottage home among the mountains.|$|E

50|$|Boar's <b>hair</b> <b>brushes</b> are {{relatively}} inexpensive, {{but can be}} of very high quality. A well-made boar brush will break in with use; the bristles begin to split at their tips, resulting in a brush that is very soft but has considerable backbone. Unlike badger hair and synthetic fibers, boar bristles absorb water, so the brush should be soaked before use.|$|E

50|$|Taklon brushes {{are more}} {{hygienic}} than real <b>hair</b> <b>brushes.</b> Natural hair has an irregular surface which traps powders, dead skin cells, bacteria and chemicals. Cleaning {{may not necessarily}} remove these particles. Because of this, regular cleaning with disinfectants is required to prevent skin irritation. Taklon lacks these surface irregularities, {{making it easier to}} clean properly. This decreases irritation. Because Taklon is synthetic, animal cruelty is not an issue.|$|E

40|$|The Simply Straight <b>Hair</b> <b>Brush</b> was {{designed}} and built. The aim of the Simply Straight <b>Hair</b> <b>Brush</b> was to straighten hair faster and better than any product currently on the market. The current products were studied and {{the idea for a}} <b>hair</b> <b>brush</b> with heated bristles was developed. A product and patent search revealed that no idea similar to this existed. An experiment was performed to determine the relationship between tension, heat, and straightness. A design was formulated. Several heat transfer analyses were performed on this design. A prototype was built and tested for safety. The brush was then tested on several subjects resulting in significantly straighter hair. However, there was still room for improvement. The second iteration should have an optimized bristle configuration. It should also use a plastic with a higher maximum operating temperature so that the brush can be hotter. A third improvement would be putting in a temperature switch instead of relying on equilibrium for temperature control. by Melissa B. Read. Thesis (S. B.)
