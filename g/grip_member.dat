40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} {{is a global}} health security threat that requires concerted cross-sectional action by governments and society as a whole,' {{according to a report}} published by the WHO in April 2014 ([1]). On 24 - 25 June 2014, the Global Respiratory Infection Partnership (GRIP) met in London, UK, together with delegates from 18 different countries to discuss practical steps that can be taken at a local level to address this global problem in an aligned approach. This was the second annual summit of GRIP. The group, formed in 2012, includes primary care and hospital physicians, microbiologists, researchers, and pharmacists from nine core countries. GRIP aims to unite healthcare professionals (HCPs) around the world to take action against inappropriate antibiotic use, focussing {{on one of the most}} prevalent therapy areas where antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed - upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). Chaired by <b>GRIP</b> <b>member,</b> Professor John Oxford (UK), the 2014 summit included engaging presentations by guest speakers examining the latest science regarding the impact of inappropriate antibiotic use...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Xenopus {{germ line}} {{is derived from}} a {{specialized}} region in the vegetal hemisphere of the oocyte, the germ plasm. Several maternal transcripts harboured in this region have been connected {{to the process of}} germ cell specification. We identified and functionally characterized a novel vegetally localizing mRNA encoding a glutamate receptor interacting protein (<b>GRIP)</b> family <b>member</b> in Xenopus, termed XGRIP 2. 1. XGRIP 2. 1 is specifically associated with the germ plasm and PGCs throughout Xenopus embryogenesis. Morpholino-mediated knockdown and overexpression of a putative dominant negative XGRIP 2. 1 protein fragment reduced average PGC numbers and interfered with the proper anteroposterior positioning of PGCs at tailbud stages. Thus, our results suggest that XGRIP 2. 1 is required for normal PGC development and migration in Xenopus...|$|R

40|$|At mid- to high-latitude marine sites, ice-rafted debris (IRD) is {{commonly}} recognized as anomalously coarse-grained terrigenous material contained within a fine-grained hemipelagic or pelagic matrix (e. g., Conolly and Ewing, 1970; Ruddiman, 1977, doi: 10. 1130 / 0016 - 7606 (1977) 88 2. 0. CO; 2; Krissek, 1989, doi: 10. 2973 /odp. proc. sr. 104. 114. 1989; Jansen et al., 1990; Bond et al., doi: 10. 1038 / 360245 a 0, 1992; Krissek, 1995, doi: 10. 2973 /odp. proc. sr. 145. 118. 1995). The presence of such ice-rafted material {{is a valuable}} indicator {{of the presence of}} glacial ice at sea level on an adjacent continent, whereas the composition of the IRD can often be used to identify the location of the source area (e. g., Goldschmidt, 1995, doi: 10. 1016 / 0025 - 3227 (95) 00098 -J). Because the amount of core recovered during Leg 163 was very limited, this shore-based, postcruise study focuses on materials recovered at a nearby site during Leg 152. In particular, this study examines sediments recovered at Site 919; these sediments were described as containing a significant ice-rafted component in the Leg 152 Initial Reports volume (Larsen, Saunders, Clift, et al., 1994, doi: 10. 2973 /odp. proc. ir. 152. 1994). In this study, the sedimentary section from Site 919 has been examined with the goal of providing a detailed history of glaciations on Greenland and other landmasses adjacent to the Norwegian-Greenland Sea; this history ultimately will be calibrated using an oxygen isotope stratigraphy (Flower, 1998, doi: 10. 2973 /odp. proc. sr. 152. 219. 1998), although that calibration has not been completed at this time. Because ice-core studies of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) have shown that the GIS changed dramatically, and in some cases extremely rapidly, during at least the last interglacial stage (<b>GRIP</b> <b>Members,</b> 1993, doi: 10. 1038 / 364203 a 0), a detailed IRD record from the Southeast Greenland margin should provide insight into the longer term behavior of this sensitive component of the Northern Hemisphere climate system...|$|R

40|$|The four {{mammalian}} golgins, p 230 /golgin- 245, golgin- 97, GCC 88 and GCC 185 {{are targeted}} to trans-Golgi network ITGN) membranes by their C-terminal GRIP domain in a G-protein-dependent process. The Arf-like GTPase, Arl 1, {{has been shown}} to mediate TGN recruitment of p 230 /golgin 245 and golgin- 97 by interaction with their GRIP domains; however, it is not known whether all the TGN golgins bind to Arl 1 and whether they are all recruited to the same or different TGN domains. Here we demonstrate differences in membrane binding properties and TGN domain recruitment of the mammalian GRIP domain proteins. Overexpression of full-length GCC 185 resulted in the appearance of small punctate structures dispersed in the cytoplasm of transfected cells that were identified as membrane tubular structures by immunoelectron microscopy. The cytoplasmic GCC 185 -labelled structures were enriched for membrane binding determinants of GCC 185 GRIP, whereas the three other mammalian <b>GRIP</b> family <b>members</b> did not colocalize with the GCC 185 -labelled structures. These GCC 185 -labelled structures included the TGN resident protein alpha 2, 6 sialyltransferase and excluded the recycling TGN protein, TGN 46. The Golgi stack was unaffected by overexpression of GCC 185. Overexpression of both full-length GCC 185 and GCC 88 showed distinct and nonoverlapping structures. We also show that the GRIP domains of GCC 185 and GCC 88 differ in membrane binding properties from each other and, in contrast to p 230 /golgin 245 and golgin- 97, do not interact with Arl 1 in vivo. Collectively these results show that GCC 88, GCC 185 and p 230 /golgin 245 are recruited to functionally distinct domains of the TGN and are likely to be important for the maintenance of TGN subdomain structure, a critical feature for mediating protein sorting and membrane transport...|$|R

With their support units, they are believed to account for over 40 percent of the country's ground forces. According to The Military Balance, published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the army has eight brigades: one armored, two infantry, one motorized infantry, one airborne, three military police (the 1st and 2nd, plus the 4th MP Brigade, raised 2015), and the Presidential Guard Brigade - the latter includes a reaction group, (grupo de reaccion inmediata y potente, <b>G.R.I.P.),</b> whose <b>members</b> are trained in martial arts such as karate, aikijutsu, tae kwon do, kick boxing, kung fu, judo, and silat; furthermore, they are trained in techniques and tactics in order to protect high-ranking officials and civil servants, such as the President. The Third military police brigade was transferred to the Federal Preventive Police in 2008. The armored brigade is one of two new brigades formed since 1990 as part of a reorganization made possible by an increase in overall strength of about 25,000 troops. The brigade consists of three armored regiments and one of mechanized infantry. Each of the two infantry brigades consists of three infantry battalions and an artillery battalion. The motorized infantry brigade is composed of three motorized infantry regiments. The airborne brigade consists of two army battalions, one air force battalion and one Naval Infantry battalion. The elite Presidential Guard Brigade reports directly to the Office of the President and is responsible for providing military security for the president and for visiting dignitaries. The Presidential Guard consists of three infantry battalions, one special forces battalion, and one artillery battalion.|$|R
