For example, the late medieval English jurist Sir John Fortescue, {{in his work}} In Praise of the Laws of England (Chapter VI), takes for granted the notion of tabula rasa, stressing it {{as the basis of}} the need for the education of the young in general, and of young princes specifically. [...] "Therefore, Prince, whilst you are young and your mind is as it were a clean slate, impress on it these things, lest in future it be impressed more pleasurably with images of lesser worth."

50|$|Celestine V, {{founder of}} the Order of Celestines, widely esteemed and venerated for his holiness, {{was elected to the}} papacy on July 7, 1294, as a {{compromise}} choice after an over two-years long sede vacante. It quickly became clear that this saintly eremite was wholly incompetent and unsuited for a job as pope. Admitting his own incompetence soon after his election, Celestine expressed the wish to abdicate and return to his solitary cave in the Abruzzi Mountains. However, before doing so he issued two bulls. The first bull established the regulations concerning the abdication of a pope. The second bull (Quia <b>in</b> <b>futurum,</b> September 28, 1294) restored the constitution Ubi periculum, which established the papal conclave; the constitution had been suspended by Pope Adrian V in July 1276. During his short papacy, he also created 13 new cardinals. Eventually, on December 13, 1294, Celestine V abdicated the papacy at Naples, three days after confirming the restoration of the institution of the papal conclave.|$|R
5000|$|His {{early works}} exhibit the {{influence}} of composers from the preceding generation, including Debussy, Scriabin, and Richard Strauss. Later, during his Dadaist phase, Schulhoff composed a number of pieces with absurdist elements. <b>In</b> <b>futurum,</b> part of his Fünf Pittoresken for piano, is a silent piece composed entirely of rests that anticipates John Cage's 4′33″ by over thirty years. Schulhoff's composition is notated in great rhythmic detail, employing bizarre time signatures and intricate rhythmic patterns. A 1923 report of a Bochum performance puts Schulhoff {{in the context of}} his contemporaries: The patience of the town of Bochum was sorely tried by four composers of the most modern tendency in one concert. Six Orchestral Pieces by A. von Webern...were received with strong distrust; the warmer blooded Bela Bartok could not restore confidence with his orchestral pieces. But when the most extreme modern Erwin Schulhoff presented his [...] "thirty-two absurd variations upon a no less eccentric theme," [...] opposition began to make itself felt and heard. The theme, according to the program, was played twice, and the weather began to look threatening. At the end of the helpless variations strong men who were provided with instruments for the purpose made a noise described in German as [...] "höllenlärm", which was answered by equally noisy applause. The composer made a speedy escape.|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} several {{particular}} aspects {{related to the}} even-odd <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> prompt emission in fission synthesized as follows: 1) The even-odd <b>effects</b> <b>in</b> prompt emission {{are the result of}} two contributions, a dominant one due to the even-odd nuclear character of fission fragments reflected in their properties and consequently in the emitted prompt neutrons and gammas, and a weaker contribution brought by the even-odd <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> the fragment distribution (over which the prompt emission matrices are averaged). Oscillations with a periodicity of about 5 mass units are present in different prompt emission quantities corresponding to even-Z and odd-Z fragmentations independent {{of the size of the}} even-odd <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> the charge yield Y(Z). 2) The oscillation periodicity ΔA≈ 5 in the charge polarization ΔZ(A) and rms(A) of the isobaric charge distribution as well as in the fragment mass yields Y(A) of even-Z and odd-Z fragmentations is also due to the periodicity of nuclear properties being independent of the size of the even-odd <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> Y(Z). Only the magnitude of the oscillation amplitudes of ΔZ(A), rms(A) and Y(A) of even-Z and odd-Z fragmentations reflects in different ways the size of the even-odd <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> Y(Z). 3) Not only the basic features of the global even-odd <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> fragment yields and prompt mission are the same but also the local even-odd <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> prompt emission [...] reported for the first time in this paper [...] exhibits the same behaviour as the experimental data of the local even-odd <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> Y(Z). 4) A correlation between the even-odd <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> Y(Z) and prompt emission quantities (e. g., ν(Z) exists. This interrelation is through the nuclear properties of the fission fragments. The presence of oscillations with a period ΔA≈ 5 in both Y(A) and prompt emission quantities corresponding to even-Z and odd-Z fragmentations cannot be directly linked to the size of the even-odd <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> Y(Z).
