2500|$|Historically, {{the bulk}} of UPS' {{competition}} came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations, a program that allows UPS to pick up mail & packages separately from the main <b>Ground</b> <b>network</b> and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU), for final distribution. This process {{is also known as}} zone skipping, long used by Parcel Consolidators. UPS also has a separate product called [...] "SurePost" [...] which uses the UPS <b>Ground</b> <b>network</b> to deliver packages to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for [...] "final mile" [...] delivery.|$|E

The main {{objective of this}} master thesis is to map the different parameters that will influence {{the performance of the}} grounding system, and to what extent the performance will be affected. Samnanger substation and the electrical network connected to it are used as a basis for the simulations conducted in CDEGS &# 150; AutoGrid Pro. Two different networks were used in the simulations; Network 1 with a specified two layer soil model, and Network 2 with a specified <b>grounding</b> <b>network</b> resistance to earth of 2 &# 8486;. Network 1 was used where the simulation objective was to investigate how the resistance to earth changed with varying parameters, while Network 2 was used for all other simulations. Thirteen different simulations were conducted: Initial modeling, Insulating surface layer modeling, Varying fault duration, Varying soil conditions at Samnanger substation, Varying RE at adjacent substations, Varying Rt for overhead line towers, Varying mesh density, Varying cross sectional value of earth electrodes, Meshed network including vertical rods, Meshed network including vertical rods embedded in conductive additives, Disconnection of overhead line earth conductors, Increased single-phase-to-earth short circuit current, and Three phase short circuit current. The simulations showed that:&# 149;	UT UTp. Using a 3000 &# 8486;m- 10 cm insulating surface layer and tfault = 0. 06 second eliminates all dangerous UT for an Ik 1 fault.

40|$|One key {{challenge}} in statistical relational learning (SRL) is scalable inference. Unfortunately, most real-world problems in SRL have expressive models that translate into large <b>grounded</b> <b>networks,</b> representing a bottleneck for any inference method and weakening its scalability. In this paper we introduce Preference Re-laxation (PR), a two-stage strategy {{that uses the}} de-terminism present in the underlying model to improve the scalability of relational inference. The basic idea of PR {{is that if the}} underlying model involves manda-tory (i. e. hard) constraints as well as preferences (i. e. soft constraints) then it is potentially wasteful to allo-cate memory for all constraints in advance when per-forming inference. To avoid this, PR starts by relax-ing preferences and performing inference with hard constraints only. It then removes variables that violate hard constraints, thereby avoiding irrelevant computa-tions involving preferences. In addition it uses the re-moved variables to enlarge the evidence database. This reduces the effective size of the <b>grounded</b> <b>network.</b> Our approach is general and can be applied to various inference methods in relational domains. Experiments on real-world applications show how PR substantially scales relational inference with a minor impact on accu-racy...|$|R
