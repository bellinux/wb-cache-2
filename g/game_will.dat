5|$|With the {{announcement}} {{and development of}} the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, speculation spread that an enhanced remake of the original Final Fantasy VII would be released for the PlayStation 3. This conjecture was sparked at the 2005 E3 convention by the release of a video featuring the opening sequence of Final Fantasy VII recreated using the PlayStation 3's graphical capabilities. Throughout the lifespan of the PS3, SquareEnix stated that such a game was not in development. A high definition remake was eventually announced at E3 2015 for the PlayStation 4. The <b>game</b> <b>will</b> be more than a high definition remaster, with director Tetsuya Nomura stating that the <b>game</b> <b>will</b> have changes made to its story and combat system.|$|E
5|$|A fourth {{game in the}} series, Metroid Prime 4, was {{announced}} at Nintendo's E3 2017 Spotlight livestream, and is currently under development for the Nintendo Switch.

The fourth installment is scheduled for release sometime in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Beat 'em ups {{are related}} to—but {{distinct}} from—fighting games, {{which are based}} around one-on-one matches rather than scrolling levels and multiple enemies. Such terminology is loosely applied, however, as some commentators prefer to conflate the two terms. At times, both one-on-one fighting games and scrolling beat 'em ups have influenced each other in terms of graphics and style and can appeal to fans of either genre. Occasionally, a <b>game</b> <b>will</b> feature both kinds of gameplay.|$|E

5|$|In this {{variation}} White {{tries to}} avoid the move a2–a3 {{in order to gain}} a tempo over the 7.a3 variation. After the standard moves 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.Be2 followed by 10.0-0 it is Black's last chance to exchange the Bb4 for the Nd2. The <b>game</b> <b>will</b> take an entirely different structure depending on whether Black gives up the bishop pair or tries to keep it.|$|E
5|$|Interaction with non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) {{was a large}} design focus. When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the <b>game</b> <b>will</b> enter a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced}} that the game was transitioning to become a free-to-play game under the title Evolve: Stage 2 due to the game downloadable content controversy and mixed critical reception. The new version introduces new changes, including longer respawn time, non-ranked queue for casual players, and changes to hunters' abilities. Turtle Rock also promised that patches would be released more frequently and that most items featured in the game would be unlocked through simply playing the game. The alpha version of Stage 2 would begin on July 7, 2016, for PC, and {{will be followed by}} a beta in August in the same year.

Turtle Rock also revealed that it was 2K's decision to end the game's support.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} held at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina on December 4, 2010. Charlotte was chosen after poor {{attendance}} at the game's previous locations (Tampa, Florida and Jacksonville, Florida) led conference officials to seek a location closer to the conference's geographic center. The 2010 championship {{was the first to}} be played in Charlotte, and the <b>game</b> <b>will</b> return to the city in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The next installment, also titled God of War, {{was officially}} {{announced}} at Sony's 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference with a gameplay trailer. The trailer showed a fully bearded Kratos, {{who now has}} a son, and Kratos is teaching the boy how to hunt. The end of the trailer showed the title God of War and confirmed it is in development for the PlayStation 4. Gameplay in the trailer showed elements similar to role playing games (RPG), such as archery knowledge points, {{as well as a}} Spartan Rage timed-ability during battle. The <b>game</b> <b>will</b> take place many years after the events of God of War III and will be set in the world of Norse mythology; a concept originally considered by David Jaffe after Kratos eliminated the Greek gods. Although further games have not been officially announced, Cory Barlog confirmed that this new installment would not be Kratos' last game.

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the <b>game</b> <b>will</b> be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}}, Square Enix {{did not pay}} Grin {{over several}} months, and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style.

Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even a tech demo surfaced.
