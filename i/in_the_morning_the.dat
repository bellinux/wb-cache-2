5|$|During {{the early}} morning hours, a cold front with several {{embedded}} low pressure areas extended from east Texas northeastward into the Ohio River Valley. An upper-level disturbance that had moved across the frontal boundary the previous evening sparked an area of thunderstorms that morphed into a squall line. This line of severe thunderstorms {{would be responsible for}} tornado actitvity from late on April 26 into the late morning of April 27. Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> squall line, packing straight-line winds and numerous embedded tornadoes, moved through Louisiana and Mississippi, then proceeded to affect North and Central Alabama and parts of Middle and East Tennessee. The line strengthened as it moved through Alabama, due in part to a high amount of low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and increasing wind shear.|$|E

The reliquary is then placed in front of the church, to be kissed by the believers. The priests give them pieces of cotton that have been kept inside the reliquary since the previous feast. There are numerous stories about people, both Christians and Muslims, who were healed after they prayed before the saint's relics.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} afternoon, an eye feature began to form; subsequently, Hernan was nearing {{hurricane}} status. However, by the nighttime hours, a microwave satellite {{found that the}} center of Hernan was located to the west-southwest of the eye feature, and the intensification ceased {{for the rest of}} the day and into the morning of August 8. Later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> center of Hernan was determined to be located underneath the eye and was determined to have become a hurricane, the fifth of the season, during the afternoon of August 8. Throughout the day, the eye became better defined, indicating that moderate northeasterly wind shear had already begun to diminish. Despite a cloud-filled eye, meteorologists showed Hernan peaking as a category 2 hurricane overnight.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Baltic region of Livonia, people {{designated}} as werewolves went underground {{in the shape}} of dogs to fight against sorcerers who stole the shoots of the grain. If the werewolves failed to wrest the shoots, there would be famine. In Romania, strigoi were people born with a caul, which they donned upon reaching adulthood; this made them invisible. They then travelled in animal form to the meadow {{at the end of the}} world. There they fought each other all night, becoming reconciled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>The</b> reason for the fight is not specified.

Three troops from C Squadron finally crossed the river by the afternoon of 29 November; one was ordered to advance to Elici and a second was to make contact with the 8th Indian Infantry Division at La Defenza. The routes were mined and the troops spent the night at 23rd Battalion headquarters. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> mines were cleared and the second troop contacted the Indians and advanced east of Elici; the first troop was held up by shelling south of Elici.|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with {{standard}} gauge. So the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be converted {{in time for the}} opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>the</b> trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>the</b> yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{wait for}} {{replacement}} equipment, Barnette purchased {{the press of}} a newly arrived editor, William Fentress Thompson, who had intended to set up his own newspaper. As part of the purchasing deal in August 1906, Thompson was allowed to publish an evening paper—the Tanana Daily Miner—while the Fairbanks Daily News was published <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>The</b> deal lasted only through September, as Thompson and Barnette conflicted on a personal level. The Tanana Miner {{was reduced to a}} weekly newspaper, then Thompson was deposed as editor of the Fairbanks News in June 1907 and took the Tanana Miner to the settlement of Chena, outside Fairbanks. Barnette, meanwhile, became embroiled in a series of legal troubles. He faced opposition from the owner of the Fairbanks Times, A.L. Anderson, who had fought Barnette about several gold claims near Fairbanks and purchased the Times to compete against Barnette.|$|E
