500|$|The ICAO {{released}} {{their report}} December 2, 1983, which {{concluded that the}} violation of Soviet airspace was accidental: One of two explanations for the aircraft's deviation was that the autopilot had remained in <b>HEADING</b> <b>hold</b> instead of INS mode after departing Anchorage. They postulated that this inflight navigational error was caused by either the crew's failure to select INS mode, or the inertial navigation's not activating when selected, because the aircraft was already too far off track. It was determined that the crew did not notice this error or subsequently perform navigational checks, that would have revealed that the aircraft was diverging further and further from its assigned route. This was later deemed {{to be caused by}} a [...] "lack of situational awareness and flight deck coordination".|$|E

40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis, a nonlinear {{mathematical model}} simulation and linear controller {{design for the}} U 1 -H 1 helicopter was achieved. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part, the nonlinear dynamic model is developed using the Matrix Laboratory Software and Heli-Dyn R Software, which is a modeling and simulation tool for rotorcraft developed by Dr. Ilkay Yavrucuk at Middle East Technical University. The non-linear model consists in a contribution of main rotor, tail rotor, fuselage, gravitational model, horizontal and vertical tail rotor. The U 1 -H 1 main rotor non-linear mathematical model was build by use of blade element momentum theory, inflow dynamics and flapping dynamics. The total forces and moments are used in 6 degrees of freedom equations of motion model and helicopter states are obtained for hover conditions and forward flight. Trim and linearization process was done by Heli-Dyn R Software. The second part consists in a stability augmentation systems (SAS) followed by a set of automatic flight control systems (AFCS) designed by use of PID controllers. The AFCS main objective is to ease the pilot by decreasing the workload. The stability augmentation systems was designed by use of optimal control, especially Linear Quadratic Tracking Controller (LQT) and Linear Quadratic Regulator Controller (LQR). The automatic flight control systems implemented are <b>heading</b> <b>hold,</b> attitude, hold altitude acquire and hold mode for hover condition and <b>heading</b> <b>hold,</b> attitude hold, altitude acquire and hold mode and airspeed hold for forward flight condition. Furthermore, in order to check the robustness of the controllers and directory modes, disturbances were added to the model. The nonlinear model in trim mode simulations shown that the U 1 -H 1 has achieved hovering conditions and forward flight successfully. Furthermore, the controllers and directory modes shown a successful dynamic behavior towards perturbations...|$|E

40|$|Neural network {{augmented}} model inversion {{control is}} used to provide a civilian tiltrotor aircraft with consistent response characteristics throughout its operating envelope, including conversion flight. The implemented response type is Attitude Command Attitude Hold in the longitudinal channel.

Conventional methods require extensive gain scheduling with tiltrotor nacelle angle and speed. A control architecture is developed that can alleviate this requirement and thus has the potential to reduce development time, facilitate the implementation of handling qualities, and compensate for partial failures. One of the key aspects of the controller architecture is the accommodation of modeling error. It includes an online, i. e. learningwhile -controlling, neural network with guaranteed stability.

40|$|The {{helicopter}} {{flight control}} system described in this report is designed {{with the objective of}} improving the handling qualities and to meet the fault tolerance requirements of a fully operational system. The emphasis in the design was put on minimising the effort in sensor redundancy required to perform the various control tasks. With respect to these objectives the most adequate design is a feed forward command system utilising the feedback of rate gyros. This controller design improves helicopter response dynamics and additionally gives sufficient (adequate) system stability. It is the basic fully redundant control mode. The higher control modes as <b>heading</b> <b>hold,</b> attitude hold, altitude hold and speed hold are designed as superimposed control modes requiring only simplex sensor signals. The control structure and its various modes were investigated initially in a ground simulation. In subsequent flight trials with the Bo 105 -S 3 the control parameters were optimised and finally evaluated. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the Black Widow Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) over the past 4 years. An MAV has generally been defined as having a span of less than 6 inches, and a mass of less than 100 grams. The Black Widow is a 6 -inch span, fixed-wing aircraft with a color video camera that downlinks live video to the pilot. It flies at 30 mph, with an endurance of 30 minutes, and a maximum communications range of 2 km. The vehicle has an autopilot, which features altitude hold, airspeed hold, <b>heading</b> <b>hold,</b> and yaw damping. The electronic subsystems are among the smallest and lightest in the world, including a 2 gram camera, a 2 -gram video downlink transmitter, and a 5 -gram fully proportional radio control system with 0. 5 -gram actuators. A Multidisciplinary Design Optimization methodology with a genetic algorithm was used to integrate the MAV subsystems and optimize the vehicle for maximum endurance. Some of the potential missions for MAVs are visual reconnaissance, situational awareness, damage assessment, surveillance, biological or chemical agent sensing, and communications relay. In addition to these military missions, there are several commercial applications, such as search and rescue, border patrol, air sampling, police surveillance, and field research...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of fuzzy logic {{to a wide}} range of control problems has been gaining momentum internationally, fueled by a concentrated Japanese effort. Advanced Research & Development within the Engineering Department at Sikorsky Aircraft undertook a fuzzy logic research effort designed to evaluate how effective fuzzy logic control might be in relation to helicopter operations. The mode switching module in the advanced flight control portion of Sikorsky's motion based simulator was identified as a good candidate problem because it was simple to understand and contained imprecise (fuzzy) decision criteria. The purpose of the switching module is to aid a helicopter pilot in entering and leaving coordinated turns while in flight. The criteria that determine the transitions between modes are imprecise and depend on the varied ranges of three flight conditions (i. e., simulated parameters) : Commanded Rate, Duration, and Roll Attitude. The parameters were given fuzzy ranges and used as input variables to a fuzzy rulebase containing the knowledge of mode switching. The fuzzy control program was integrated into a real time interactive helicopter simulation tool. Optimization of the <b>heading</b> <b>hold</b> and turn coordination was accomplished by interactive pilot simulation testing of the handling quality performance of the helicopter dynamic model. The fuzzy logic code satisfied all the requirements of this candidate control problem...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for an {{efficient}} control of the aircraft landing and attitude through Dynamic Matrix Control. The idea of MPC structures used in aircraft control has been well established {{during the last few}} years, but some aspects require further investigation. With this in mind, the paper proposes structures for aircraft landing and aircraft attitude control by using single DMC controllers for landing and respectively one DMC controller for each of the attitude axis (pitch attitude hold, bank angle hold and <b>heading</b> <b>hold).</b> The model used for analysis of the aircraft landing structure is based on the last phase of landing. Also, the model used to illustrate the attitude control is that of a pitch attitude hold system of a N 250 - 100 aircraft. Simulations are performed for a variety of control and prediction horizons, taking into account the possibility of adding a weighting factor for the control actions. Apart from separate studies on step reference variations, for some use cases, a generic reference trajectory is provided as a control purpose of the system. Results show a better performance of the proposed method in terms of control surface transition and protection of the actuators involved and a better time response in stabilizing the aircraft attitude. Overall, the aspects shown ensure an improved aircraft attitude control and landing stabilization...|$|E

40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. There {{has always}} been a cool factor when a remote {{controlled}} camera rig takes to the sky. About five years ago, when the boom of smart phones hit, the electronics world became flooded with miniature accelerometers and gyros. A flux of younger RC pilots started to build high tech camera rigs, utilizing the computer programming they had previously learned. Older pilots were not familiar with this new technology, yet they sought out a simple design that they could maintain with the electronics they had grown accustomed to. This project focused on the aspects of cost, manufacturing options, electronics and materials that pilots were familiar with to produce a gyroscopic stabilized camera rig with universal mounting options between different helicopter brands and models. Two preliminary designs were constructed; one based on current market designs and the other utilizing extruded beams. Using SolidWorks, a computer aided drafting (CAD) model of both designs was constructed and analyzed using Working Model 2 D, COSMOS and Excel. It was determined, per the design requirements, that the utilization of a beam structure would be the most practical design for pilots to build in their garage as well as maintain. The deployment of three manufactured gearboxes from ServoCity. com, three RC servos, three <b>heading</b> <b>hold</b> gyros and an RC radio system would accomplish a camera platform capable of 360 -degree rotation.

40|$|R&D on {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) {{systems for}} the disaster monitoring has been conducted at JAXA since 2005. The Lighter than Air (LTA) type UAV {{is expected to be}} the essential part of such disaster monitoring UAV system. This paper reports the development and the flight test of LTA type UAV with much emphasis on its flight control and guidance system. In the course of conceptual design, an experimental vehicle or an LTA flying test bed was manufactured to prove key technologies. The test bed was a 14. 0 m long unmanned non-rigid airship. It is controlled by commands from an R/C (radio control) transmitter (R/C mode) or the control signal from the onboard flight control computer FCC (autonomous mode). The FCC computes commands to effectors based primarily on attitude and position data from an onboard GPS/INS navigation system and airspeed data from a three-axis onboard ultrasonic anemometer. The onboard control system is developed basically similar to that in the 60 m class unmanned airship that JAXA developed for the Stratospheric Platforms project., speed control, altitude control, and guidance in the horizontal plane are included. In addition to it, the hovering mode control that enables station keeping flight, automatic takeoff and landing is introduced. 3 flight tests were conducted in 2007 and 2008. The flight and guidance control worked well for the most part as: 1) Flight control functionalities of speed hold, altitude hold, and <b>heading</b> <b>hold</b> were verified; 2) Flight control and guidance functionality to trace way points was verified; 3) The capability of automatic landing as well as autonomous hovering was demonstrated...|$|E
