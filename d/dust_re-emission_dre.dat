40|$|Abstract. We present model {{calculations}} for {{the scattered}} flux and polarization of nuclear radiation {{having in mind}} the AGN unification scheme. It is our aim to survey the influence of several model parameters, especially, {{the influence of the}} torus. Additionally, we considerably improved present models, for instance by including multiple instead of single scattering. For these purposes, we developed a Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code for both electron and dust scattering (Thomson and Rayleigh/Mie scattering). Irradiation from a point-like source can be treated as well as extended anisotropic radiation sources and <b>dust</b> <b>re-emission.</b> We found that the observed wavelength dependence of the linear polarization of some AGNi can be explained by dust scattering in optically thin cones, whereby the additional presence of electrons increases the absolute amount of polarization. The torus geometry and density profile as well as the thermal dust reemission also influence the polarization degree. Multiple scattering in the cones was found to be important for optical depths above ≈ 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present results}} of a self-consistent model of the {{spectral}} energy distribution (SED) of starburst galaxies. Two parameters control the IR SED, the mean pressure in the ISM and the destruction timescale of molecular clouds. Adding a simplified AGN spectrum provides mixing lines on IRAS color: color diagrams. This reproduces the observed colors of both AGNs and starbursts. 1. SED Modelling Our model, which will be described in detail elsewhere (Dopita et al.

These SEDs extend from the Lyman Limit to beyond 21 cm. We find that two ISM parameters control {{the form of}} the SED; the pressure in the diffuse phase of the ISM (or, equivalently, its density), and the molecular cloud dissipation timescale.

We introduce a compactness parameter, C, which characterizes the specific intensity of the radiation field at ionization fronts in Hii regions, and which controls {{the shape of the}} far-IR <b>dust</b> <b>re-emission,</b> often referred to loosely as the dust “temperature”. We also investigate the effect of metallicity on the overall SED and in particular, on the strength of the PAH features. We provide templates for the mean emission produced by the young compact Hii regions, the older (10 − 100 Myr) stars and for the wavelength-dependent attenuation produced by a foreground screen of the dust used in our model. We demonstrate that these components may be combined to produce a excellent fit to the observed SEDs of star formation dominated galaxies which are often used as templates (Arp 220 and NGC 6240). This fit extends from the Lyman Limit to wavelengths of about one mm.

Subject headings: radiative transfer 1. introduction Dust radiative transfer models are crucial to interpreting many astronomical observations ranging from reflection nebulae with a single star to galaxies comprised of stars, gas, and dust arranged in complex geometries. Almost all observations are affected by the presence of dust intrinsic to the system under study or present in the foreground. For dust present in the foreground as is the case for observations of single stars, the effects of dust can be accurately taken into account using a screen geometry. In this geometry, the effects are well characterized by an extinction curve which is determined by the amount and intrinsic properties (e. g., sizes and materials) of the dust (Clayton et al. 2000). However, when the dust is near or mixed with the system being studied, its effects become dependent not only on the intrinsic properties of the dust grains, but on the geometry of the stars and dust in th...|$|R
40|$|The dust {{emission}} spectrum and the brightness profile of passively heated condensed cores is analyzed {{in relation to}} their astrophysical environment. The cores are modeled as critically stable self-gravitating spheres embedded at the center of self-gravitating filaments that are assumed to be either spherical or cylindrical in shape. The filaments are heated by an isotropic interstellar radiation field (ISRF). The calculations are based on a physical dust model of stochastically heated grains of diffuse interstellar dust. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the cores is calculated using a ray-tracing technique where the effects of scattered emission and re-heating by dust grains are accurately taken into account. To compare with observational studies, the <b>dust</b> <b>re-emission</b> spectrum is approximated by a modified black-body function and the brightness profile with a Gaussian source. A simplified single-zone model for cores is presented that incorporates {{on the basis of the}} derived emissivities a first order approximation of their SED. Colder dust temperatures are, independent of the core mass, related to a higher pressure both inside and around the filament. The pressure-temperature relation for given external pressure is found to be largely independent of the true shape of the filament. The calculations show that the radiative transfer leads to a lower emission coefficient at 250 micron and to a flatter emissivity law of typically beta< 1. 8 in the far-infrared sub-millimeter regime. These effects cause the core mass to be underestimated by more than a factor of 2 based on the typical assumptions used in observational programs. A larger uncertainty is expected for high pressure regions. Comment: 24 pages, 20 figure...|$|R

These SEDs extend from the Lyman limit to beyond 21 cm. We find that two ISM parameters control {{the form of}} the SED: the pressure in the diffuse phase of the ISM (or, equivalently, its density), and the molecular cloud dissipation timescale.

In the case of objects of composite excitation, such diagrams potentially provide a means of estimating the fraction of the FIR emission that is contributed by an active nucleus. We present detailed SED fits to Arp 220 and NGC 6240, and we give the predicted colors for starburst galaxies derived from our models for the IRAS and the Spitzer Space Telescope MIPS and IRAC instruments. Our models reproduce the spread in observed colors of starburst galaxies. From both the SED fits and the color : color diagrams, we infer the presence of a population of compact and ultracompact H II regions around single OB stars or small OB clusters. Finally, we present absolute calibrations to convert observed fluxes into star formation rates in the UV (GALEX), at optical wavelengths (H), and in the IR (IRAS or Spitzer).

40|$|Abstract. Airborne 137 Cs {{level in}} France is not {{decreasing}} significantly anymore (mean yearly value around 0, 25 Bq. m− 3) contrarily {{to what was}} noticed in the past decades. This observation points out the role of processes that delay the atmospheric cleaning and participate to the persistence of radionuclide {{in the air at}} ground-level after a deposit, in the frame of medium as well as long-dated post-accidental contexts. The current background level also yields to consider 137 Cs in the atmosphere as a tracer of atmospheric processes like resuspension and re-emission from biomass burnings. This allows us to explain 2 / 3 of the peaks observed over the last six years. The remaining 1 / 3 is mainly noticed in winter when spreading of pollutants in the atmosphere is often weak due to temperature gradient inversion. On average, continental air masses are responsible for increases by a factor of 3 while oceanic air masses are characterised by levels 3 times lower, compared to the mean value. Feeding of 137 Cs in air at ground-level is the result of both local resuspension that signs 137 Cs activity levels in soils to which is added a remote contribution from time to time (resuspension of Saharan <b>dust</b> or <b>re-emission</b> from fires occurring in eastern territories with high 137 Cs deposition level). Finally, 137 Cs activity levels in air masses crossing over France can be described on average by a longitudinal gradient. 1...|$|R

We assume that star formation proceeds either in a “quiescent ” mode, e. g. as in disks, or in a “burst” mode with ten times shorter time scales. In order to reproduce the current data on the evolution of the comoving cosmic SFR and gas densities, we need to introduce a mass fraction involved in the “burst ” mode strongly increasing with redshift, probably reflecting the increase of interaction and merging activity.

40|$|By {{means of}} the updated PARSEC {{database}} of evolutionary tracks of massive stars, we compute the integrated stellar light, the ionizing photon budget and the supernova rates of young simple stellar populations (SSPs), for different metallicities and IMF upper mass limits. Using CLOUDY we compute and include in the SSP spectra the neb- ular emission contribution. We also revisit the thermal and non-thermal radio emission contribution from young stars. Using GRASIL we can thus predict the panchromatic spectrum and the main recombination lines of any type of star-forming galaxy, including the effects of <b>dust</b> absorption and <b>re-emission.</b> We check the new models against the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of selected well-observed nearby galaxies. From the best-fit models we obtain a consistent set of star formation rate (SFR) calibrations at wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to radio. We also provide analytical calibrations that {{take into account the}} dependence on metallcity and IMF upper mass limit of the SSPs. We show that the latter limit can be well constrained by combining information from the observed far infrared, 24 μm, 33 GHz and Hα luminosities. Another interesting property derived from the fits is that, while in a normal galaxy the attenuation in the lines is significantly higher than that in the nearby continuum, in individual star bursting regions they are similar, supporting the notion that this effect is due to an age selective extinction. Since in these conditions the Balmer decrement method may not be accurate, we provide relations to estimate the attenuation from the observed 24 μm or 33 GHz fluxes. These relations can be useful for the analysis of young high redshift galaxies. Comment: 25 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
