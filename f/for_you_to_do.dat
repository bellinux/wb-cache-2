500|$|The American public, {{the church}} {{organizations}} that have been helping—Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know {{you for what you}} are—an evil beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. King, there is only one thing left <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significant [...] ). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.|$|E

There {{is still}} work <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> on earth, {{and the sooner}} ye set about doing it the better, for methinks the King will wonder what has become of his berserkers, and will send out men in search of them ere long. Canst mount thy horse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{extraordinary}} statement!" [...] Jernyngham remarked with ironical incredulity. [...] "May one {{ask if he}} gave any reasons <b>for</b> wishing <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was better}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, Arnaud {{has written for}} me at night. You will send it, Amy, and another to my poor uncle.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hall," [...] she said, [...] "thou art an Icelander, and I {{have known}} of thee from a child, and {{therefore}} I wish <b>to</b> serve <b>thee</b> in thy strait, though thou deservest it little. See now, Atli the Earl has a farm {{on the mainland}} not two hours' ride from the sea. Thither thou shalt go, if thou art wise, and thou shalt sit there this winter and be hidden from Eric and Skallagrim. Nay, thank me not, but listen: it may chance that I shall have a service <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before spring is come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By no means," [...] said Cyaxares, [...] "your {{grandfather}} {{would be}} very much displeased <b>to</b> know what <b>you</b> had done. He would not only condemn <b>you</b> <b>for</b> acting thus, but he would reprove us too, severely, <b>for</b> allowing <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hauskuld, I have a {{business}} <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> which requires {{the heart of a}} brave fellow. There is a man near Horlingdal who has not only refused to submit to my will, but has gathered a band of seventy men or more about him, and threatens to raise the country against me. It does not suit me to go forth to punish this dog just now, for my preparations are not yet complete. Nevertheless it is important that he should be crushed, as he dwells in the heart of a disaffected district. It is therefore my purpose <b>to</b> send <b>thee</b> with a small body of picked men <b>to</b> <b>do</b> thy worst by him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ippegoo, I {{have work}} of more {{importance}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than spearing birds--work {{that requires the}} wisdom of a young angekok." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Consequently," [...] said Asaph, {{deliberately}} {{filling his}} pipe, [...] "it {{stands to reason}} that there ain't nothin' <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> but marry money." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE JUDGE. Didn't it {{occur to}} you that the only thing <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to confess to your employers, and restore the money? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, Maurice. Horses are perverted to bad {{purposes}} by thoughtless men, and {{you must}} keep aloof from such. <b>You</b> were not <b>to</b> blame, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what <b>you</b> knew <b>to</b> be wrong, {{and did not know}} it was an improper place for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord," [...] Skallagrim said again, [...] "of all men {{who ever}} were, thou art the mightiest. Five other men had not stood before {{me in my}} rage, but, scorning thy weapon, thou didst {{overcome}} me in the noblest fashion, and by thy naked strength alone. Now hearken. Thou hast given me my life, and it is thine from this hour to the end. Here I swear fealty <b>to</b> <b>thee.</b> Slay me if thou wilt, or use me if thou wilt, but I {{think it will be}} better <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this rather than that, for there is but one who has mastered me, and thou art he, and it is borne in upon my mind that thou wilt have need of my strength, and that shortly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} loss of {{time and}} money <b>for</b> <b>you</b> Frenchmen <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that," [...] came quickly from James Morris. [...] "I tell you that the English are in control, and they mean to keep control. In the end you will lose all you possess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grizel," [...] he said impulsively, [...] "there's {{just one}} thing <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> You have money, and you maun run away afore he comes!" ...|$|E
60|$|CONFUCIUS. I forgot. There is {{something}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this morning. You {{have to go}} to the Record Office to receive the American barbarian.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right. Take your gripsack and get along. The thing <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{is to go}} {{home and}} work the weather, John W. Merlin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Twere indeed better <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> have <b>done</b> so, good fellow, if thou canst {{say nothing}} better than that," [...] replied Hamet angrily, for he was a stupid {{as well as an}} ambitious man. [...] "Let's have {{something}} better from thee, else the bastinado shall drive sense from thy heels into thy head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Negook," [...] Edith said, [...] "there {{is to be}} {{no trouble}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and your people. Only is it <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> sit and <b>do</b> nothing but listen and understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Geoff, {{take it down}} <b>for</b> us. <b>You</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it out of {{gratitude}} <b>for</b> my cheering <b>you</b> up so nicely," [...] said Min, leading the way.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{unreasonable}} man! Is {{there no}} way in this whole world <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> your duty as a clergyman, but hearing Northwold boys the Latin grammar?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] she {{answered}} coldly, [...] "if you realise how much I have suffered, sitting tight, {{as you call}} it, and waiting <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my boy," [...] resumed the old man, [...] "I have a {{piece of}} work <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> You have heard of the arrival of the Englishmen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{is silly}} again,' said Frau Ebermann. 'It {{is no good}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> wait here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know what this place is? <b>You</b> have been <b>to</b> school? It is Berlin, the capital of Germany.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have obeyed your {{wishes to}} the letter," [...] he said, [...] "and I {{think that you}} are right. Up here we are entirely alone, and, as you see, they have had the sense to place the tables a long way apart. Am I to blame, I wonder, <b>for</b> asking <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so {{unconventional}} a thing as to lunch here again alone with me?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "O Allah's Apostle! We get female captives as {{our share}} of booty, and we are {{interested}} in their prices, what is your opinion about coitus interruptus?" [...] The Prophet said, [...] "Do you really do that? It is better <b>for</b> <b>you</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. No soul that which Allah has destined to exist, but will surely come into existence." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} much <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at present," [...] Champagny said. [...] "The troops {{are all in}} their places, and we are ready when they deliver the assault." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll do, I think, {{though it}} remains to be seen," [...] he said enigmatically. [...] "It will show the stuff that's in you, besides, {{and it will be a}} better claim upon the Intelligencer people than all the lines from all the {{senators}} and magnates in the world. The thing <b>for</b> <b>you</b> is <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Amateur Night at the Loops." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some dialects are {{objected to}} - For one, the IRISH brogue is: And then, <b>for</b> all <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> One pound a week they offer you, And find {{yourself}} in Bogies! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} indulge in morbid fancies, {{and you have}} very little cause for gratitude. We were {{sincerely}} sorry <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> and tried <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we could," [...] I said.|$|R
