5000|$|President Ronald Reagan in 1985 said [...] "the <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us", {{referring}} to the United States, to create the Strategic Defense Initiative. The Gospel According to Star Wars asserts that {{his use of the}} phrase was actually perverting Star Wars's [...] "self-dispossessing" [...] (or other-focused) ethos. The blessing [...] "May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you" [...] is the expression of a hope for others ("May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you"), not for ourselves as with Reagan ("The <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us"). Moreover, the Star Wars blessing is precisely a request for hope for others ("May the <b>Force</b> <b>be</b> with you"), whereas Reagan's claim sounds like a possessive assertion ("The <b>Force</b> <b>is</b> with us").|$|R

50|$|<b>Force</b> <b>is</b> {{the action}} of one body on another. A <b>force</b> <b>is</b> either a push or a pull. A force tends to move a body in the {{direction}} of its action. The action of a <b>force</b> <b>is</b> characterized by its magnitude, by the direction of its action, and by its point of application. Thus, <b>force</b> <b>is</b> a vector quantity, because its effect depends on the direction {{as well as on the}} magnitude of the action.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army; to bolster its defence, the country doubled its police personnel to about 20,000.

In May the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde, or ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Pacific War the {{strategic}} port town of Rabaul in New Britain was defended by 'Lark Force', which comprised the 2/22nd Infantry Battalion reinforced with coastal artillery and a poorly equipped RAAF bomber squadron. While Lark <b>Force</b> <b>was</b> regarded as inadequate by the Australian military, {{it was not possible to}} reinforce it before the Japanese South Seas Force landed at Rabaul on 23 January 1942. The outnumbered Australian <b>force</b> <b>was</b> swiftly defeated and most of the survivors surrendered in the weeks after the battle. Few members of Lark Force survived the war, as at least 130 were murdered by the Japanese on 4 February and 1,057Australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from Rabaul were killed when the ship carrying them to Japan (Montevideo Maru) was sunk by a US submarine on 1 July 1942.|$|E

50|$|A contact <b>force</b> <b>is</b> any <b>force</b> that {{requires}} contact to <b>be</b> enforced. Contact <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> also direct <b>forces.</b> Contact <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> ubiquitous (present, appearing, or found everywhere) and {{are responsible for}} most visible interactions between macroscopic (visible to the naked eye; not microscopic) collections of matter. Pushing a car up a hill or kicking a ball or pushing a desk across a room {{are some of the}} everyday examples where contact <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> at work. In the first case the <b>force</b> <b>is</b> continuously applied by the person on the car, while in the second case the <b>force</b> <b>is</b> delivered in a short impulse. Certain contact forces describe specific phenomena and are important enough to have been given unique names. The most common instances of this include friction, normal force and shear force. A contact <b>force</b> may also <b>be</b> described as the push experienced when two objects are pressed together.|$|R

50|$|A third {{relevant}} {{factor is}} the balance between the two <b>forces.</b> The <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> out of balance by definition; if the two <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> equally strong, the situation is not interesting from a force-dynamic point of view. One <b>force</b> <b>is</b> therefore stronger or weaker than the other. A stronger <b>force</b> <b>is</b> marked with a plus sign, a weaker force with a minus sign (c, figure 1). In the example, the Antagonist is stronger, since it actually holds back the door.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forces</b> <b>are</b> {{classified}} as either contact or body forces. A contact <b>force</b> <b>is</b> produced by direct physical contact; an example <b>is</b> the <b>force</b> exerted on a body by a supporting surface. A body <b>force</b> <b>is</b> generated {{by virtue of}} the position of a body within a force field such as a gravitational, electric, or magnetic field and is independent of contact with any other body. An example of a body <b>force</b> <b>is</b> the weight of a body in the Earth's gravitational field.|$|R

5|$|By August the {{division}} was {{still waiting to}} be deployed, but now plans envisioned using {{them as part of}} a larger force. Operation Transfigure involved {{the division}}, the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, the US 101st Airborne Division, and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade landing at Rambouillet St Arnoult, to close the gap between Orléans and Paris. Operation Axehead, using the same <b>force,</b> <b>was</b> to seize the bridges over the River Seine in support of 21st Army Group. Operation Boxer, with the same <b>force,</b> <b>was</b> to seize Boulogne and assault V1 flying bomb sites. Near the end of the month, Operation Linnet, with the same units as before, was formulated to seize crossings over the Escaut. Operation Infatuate, drawn up in early September, involved the entire I Airborne Corps landing in Belgium to trap the retreating German armies in the Scheldt estuary, as well as aiming to threaten Antwerp.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, in {{the absence}} of a {{magnetic}} field, the <b>force</b> <b>is</b> in the direction of the electric field, and the magnitude of the <b>force</b> <b>is</b> dependent on the value of the charge and the intensity of the electric field.

If both electric and magnetic fields are present, the Lorentz <b>force</b> <b>is</b> the sum of both of these vectors.|$|R
