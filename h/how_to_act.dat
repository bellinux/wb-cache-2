After their rescue, Stewie helps prepare Chris for a date by dressing him up, and instructing him on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> through a prolonged musical number. During the date, Ellen turns out to be pushy and demanding, and the relationship quickly falls apart. Chris admits that he had bought into a stereotype of people with Down syndrome being different, and she breaks up with him. Stewie consoles Chris by congratulating him for demonstrating courage, in asking her out on a date, as he had promised to do.|$|E

50|$|A {{descriptive}} {{theory is}} one that tells how things are, while a normative theory tells <b>how</b> things ought <b>to</b> be. Expressed in practical terms, a normative theory, more properly called a policy, tells agents <b>how</b> they ought <b>to</b> <b>act.</b> A policy can be an absolute imperative, telling agents <b>how</b> they ought <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in any case, {{or it can be}} a contingent directive, telling agents <b>how</b> they ought <b>to</b> <b>act</b> if they want to achieve a particular goal. A policy is frequently stated {{in the form of a}} piece of advice called a heuristic, a maxim, a norm, a rule, a slogan, and so on. Other names for a policy are a recommendation and a regulative principle.|$|R

25|$|The {{fourth and}} last meeting {{took place in}} March 1940 in Krakow. According to some historians, {{it was part of}} the Zakopane Conference. This event was {{described}} by General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, commander of Armia Krajowa in his book “Armia Podziemna” (“The Secret Army”). In it, he describes how a special delegation of NKVD came to Krakow, which was going to discuss with Gestapo <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> against the Polish resistance. The talks lasted for several weeks.|$|E
25|$|Stephen R. L. Clark, Mary Midgley, and Bernard Rollin also discuss {{animal rights}} {{in terms of}} animals being {{permitted}} to lead a life appropriate for their kind. Egalitarianism favors an equal distribution of happiness among all individuals, which makes {{the interests of the}} worse off more important than those of the better off. Another approach, virtue ethics, holds that in considering <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> we should consider the character of the actor, and what kind of moral agents we should be. Rosalind Hursthouse has suggested an approach to animal rights based on virtue ethics. Mark Rowlands has proposed a contractarian approach.|$|E

25|$|The 'Man on the throne' in {{the vision}} of Ezekiel descriptively {{represents}} God, who is controlling everything {{that goes on in}} the world, and how all of the archetypes He set up should interact. The 'Man on the throne', however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed to us by us looking at all four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when one looks at the way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able to work together and coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that there is really a higher power (God) telling these elements <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{partners}} supplied {{their own}} tools; and {{were responsible for}} their upkeep. Many important responsibilities lay with the partners; thus, for instance, only two overseers were needed to manage more than 200 Leadhills’ miners. In {{the absence of an}} overseer’s constant and immediate personal supervision, the partners were totally responsible for their collective work practices and occupational safety; thus, the partners, rather than overseers, would decide <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> against threats posed by subterranean water, loose ground, earth tremors, etc. However, with no overseer, there was also no oversight; and, often, hastily constructed passages/shafts were misaligned with those of other teams, affecting the structure of the entire mine — also, the disposal of waste and rubbish from one team’s work area often impeded the progress of another team (or teams).|$|E

25|$|When public administrators perform {{emotional}} labor, {{many scholars}} argue administrators {{are dealing with}} significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The {{reason for this is}} because they are {{on the front lines of}} the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.|$|E
25|$|So, Kant argues, we are {{committed}} to two incompatible positions. From the perspective of practical reason, which is involved when we consider <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>act,</b> we have to take ourselves as free. But from the perspective of speculative reason, which is concerned with investigating the nature of the world of appearance, freedom is impossible. So we {{are committed}} to freedom on the one hand, and yet on the other hand we are also committed to a world of appearances that is run by laws of nature and has no room for freedom. We cannot give up on either. We cannot avoid taking ourselves as free when we act, and we cannot give up our picture of the world as determined by laws of nature. As Kant puts it, there is a contradiction between freedom and natural necessity. He calls this a dialectic of reason.|$|E
25|$|Clara Barton {{became an}} {{educator}} in 1838 for 12 years in schools in Canada and West Georgia. Barton fared {{well as a}} teacher and knew how to handle rambunctious children, particularly the boys, since as a child she enjoyed her male cousins' and brothers' company. She learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> like them, making it easier for her to relate to and control the boys in her classroom since they respected her. After her mother's death in 1851, the family home closed down. Barton decided to further her education by pursuing writing and languages at the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York. In this college town, she developed many friendships that broadened her point of view on many issues concurring at the time. The principal of the institute recognized her tremendous abilities and admired her work. This friendship lasted for many years, eventually turning into a romance. As a writer, her terminology was pristine and easy to understand. Her writings and bodies of work could instruct the local statesmen. No one could exceed her outstanding service to humanity in war and in peace.|$|E

25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>act.</b> These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E
25|$|As {{human beings}} (Dasein) {{navigate}} their world around them, {{they look for}} tools and ways to accomplish {{what they need to}} do: food and water for survival, instruments to complete tasks, shelter for protection etc. Heidegger theorized that Dasein’s “quest” to exist, so to speak, can only be completed via his relationship with others and his world around him. This is what Slife termed radical relationality: human beings are fundamentally and inescapably relational beings. That human beings exist in-the-world as radically relational beings ultimately means that Dasein must seek out his existence through opportunities that present themselves in his world and through his relationships with others. In other words, what ontological hermeneutics is saying about what nature is that human beings cannot be thought of as merely “self-certain actants” capable of distancing themselves above and against their world effortly to determine rational courses of action, nor as little more than computers that have been programmed to react to stimuli. Instead, all understanding of how to exist comes from being-in-the-world and understanding one’s relation to, or place in, that world. Put another way, human beings conduct themselves within the context of their life-world (the world in which their lives take place) which provides Dasein with possibilities of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>act.</b> It is this understanding of himself in that life-world that informs his choice.|$|E
