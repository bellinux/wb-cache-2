500|$|According to biographer, William S. McFeely, Grant {{and many}} in the north {{believed}} the American Civil War extended democracy to the African American freedmen. Grant worked to ensure ratification of the pending constitutional amendment approved by Congress {{and sent to the}} states during {{the last days of the}} Johnson administration, that would prohibit the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's [...] "race, color, or previous condition of servitude". On February 3, 1870 the amendment reached requisite number of state ratifications (then 27), and was certified as the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Grant hailed it's ratification as [...] "a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the <b>foundation</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> free government to the present day". Many in the south, however, were determined that the African American males' right to vote would be unenforceable.|$|E
500|$|Nevada was {{the first}} state to ratify the amendment, on March 1, 1869. The New England states and most Midwest states also {{ratified}} the amendment soon after its proposal. Southern states still controlled by Radical reconstruction governments, such as North Carolina, also swiftly ratified. Newly elected President Ulysses S. Grant strongly endorsed the amendment, calling it [...] "a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the <b>foundation</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> free government to the present day." [...] He privately asked Nebraska's governor to call a special legislative session to speed the process, securing the state's ratification. In April and December 1869, Congress passed Reconstruction bills mandating that Virginia, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia ratify the amendment as a precondition to regaining congressional representation; all four states did so. The struggle for ratification was particularly close in Indiana and Ohio, which voted to ratify in May 1869 and January 1870, respectively. New York, which had ratified on April 14, 1869, tried to revoke its ratification on January 5, 1870. However, in February 1870, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas ratified the amendment, bringing the total ratifying states to twenty-nine—one more than the required twenty-eight ratifications from the thirty-seven states, and forestalling any court challenge to New York's resolution to withdraw its consent.|$|E

2500|$|Schopenhauer's {{identification}} of the Kantian noumenon (i.e., the actually existing entity) with what he termed [...] "will" [...] deserves some explanation. The noumenon was what Kant called the Ding an sich (the Thing in Itself), the reality that is the <b>foundation</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> sensory and mental representations of an external world. In Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena. Schopenhauer departed from Kant in {{his description of the}} relationship between the phenomenon and the noumenon. According to Kant, things-in-themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds; Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed that phenomena and noumena are two different sides of the same coin. Noumena do not cause phenomena, but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena, according to the principle of sufficient reason. This is explained more fully in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (1813).|$|E
