5|$|Antibodies are glycoproteins {{belonging}} to the immunoglobulin superfamily. They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may {{be attached to the}} antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor (except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR), thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region. The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. For example, IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release. IgE's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen, for example house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.|$|E

30|$|Allergic {{diseases}} such as bronchial asthma, perennial rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis caused by the house <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae, which are dominant species in homes, have recently become serious health problems. Reducing the number of and exposure to mites and mite allergens {{are the most important}} factors in preventing allergic diseases. Recently, the effects of essential oils of plants on house <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> have received much attention with a view to producing natural mite-killing agents. Essential oils and their components of wood and their leaves have also received much attention. In this article, we summarize the biology of house <b>dust</b> <b>mites,</b> mite allergens, and their concentration in homes, and discuss the control of house <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> by using plant and wood extractives, especially in relation to the influence of essential oils and volatiles from wood on house <b>dust</b> <b>mites.</b>|$|R

2500|$|House dust mites {{are present}} indoors {{wherever}} humans live. Positive tests for <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> allergies are extremely common {{among people with}} asthma. Dust mites are microscopic arachnids whose primary food is dead human skin cells, {{but they do not}} live on living people. They and their feces and other allergens they produce are major constituents of house dust, but because they are so heavy they are not suspended for long in the air.

These chemicals cause many of the symptoms we associate with allergy, such as airway constriction in asthma, local inflammation in eczema, increased mucus secretion in allergic rhinitis, and increased vascular permeability, it is presumed, to allow other immune cells {{to gain access to}} tissues, but which can lead to a potentially fatal drop in blood pressure as in anaphylaxis.|$|E

She was previously diagnosed with OA caused by inhalation of cefteram powder. Consequently, she left her job and had been well for 9 subsequent years.
