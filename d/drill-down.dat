40|$|Abstract [...] Optimal and {{effective}} {{operation of a}} large power system requires analysis of {{a huge amount of}} information by the system operators. In a large power system, it is a challenge to present the vast amount of data in a way, which assists the operators in assessing the state of the system and responding expeditiously. Restructuring of the power sector worldwide, the advent of new market mechanisms and the need to analyze various parameters and available security margins has made this challenge all the more formidable. These challenges are a prime mover for the continuous improvement and evolution of new visualization techniques. Effective visualization methods, techniques and tools are key to empowering the system operator and facilitating quick operator response under critical conditions. Internet and the development of new IT tools have added a new dimension for the power system operator. Analysis in real time and <b>drill-downs</b> into the data are required by the operator for a detailed investigation. Effective power system visualization capability is a strong motivating factor for the operator for improving his response and productivity. This paper describes the visualization methods, tools and techniques implemented and used by the Indian power system operator. Classical displays including single line diagrams, tabular displays, load curves, bar charts, pie charts, tie line interconnection diagrams, etc. have been discussed. New methods used more recently like multi-layered displays, macro visualization of a parameter over longer duration using zooming and panning, 3 -D presentations, contours, data leveling, animation etc. and future methods such as GIS Maps are discussed. The human aspects and the ability of operators to comprehend and respond to the information presented to them in various formats are also discussed...|$|R

These allowed to model the risk of cancer including age, race, sex and survival chances among others, to spot most dangerous and incident cancers, revealed how little survival chances and treatment efficiency increased over last 30 years and how little early diagnosis was improved, presented trends and changes in them and changes in cancer risk related to place of residence and {{emphasized the importance of}} risk mitigation by screening and healthy lifestyle. These methods also turned out to be easy, requiring less computer science related knowledge as one could expect. With little support from IT staff, oncology domain professionals can easily benefit from vast data sets and analytical power applied to it. Data mining algorithms evaluated over melanoma of the skin data managed to extract what's already known in the domain. Therefore, when used by oncology professionals over less generic data one can expect data mining to have the potential of extending experts' knowledge. Neural networks, decision trees and clusters showed higher prediction accuracy than Naive Bayes classifiers and association rules but it is advised to merge results from many algorithms. Findings by particular algorithms are often disjoint and when combined, allow to reveal more despite varying predictive performance. Analysis of caCORE system and systemic integration experiment proved that building a large-scale oncological data system integrating distributed data is extremely complex. Integrating with it requires a lot of effort to understand its structures, prepare data mappings and implement integration procedures. Strict cooperation of IT and oncology professionals is mandatory. Suggestions were made to simplify the generic caCORE data model (ontology) or split it into smaller parts and expose as much integration functionality as web interfaces or encapsulated classes to decrease the complexity of the process. Tweaked like that, caCORE would be fully feasible and could be considered as the future of application of data warehousing and data mining techniques in oncology, providing distributed and common-model compliant dataset and leveraging the power of research community. The thesis evaluates: application of data warehousing and mining analysis to SEERStat surveillance and epidemiology oncological database and aspects of future development of integrated and extensible data systems for oncology domain basing on integration experiment with caCORE project. In the thesis following is presented: results of the analysis of cancer diseases data with conclusions and advice, potential of this specific analytical application and conclusions as well as guidelines about how future, more powerful oncological analytical systems could be built. dominiksm@o 2. p...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} new tool for exploratory text analysis {{that attempts to}} improve the experience of navigating and exploring text and its metadata. The design of the tool was motivated by the unmet need for text analysis tools in the humanities and social sciences. In these fields, {{it is common for}} scholars to have hundreds or thousands of text-based source documents of interest from which they extract evidence for complex arguments about society and culture. These collections are difficult to make sense of and navigate. Unlike numerical data, text cannot be condensed, overviewed, and summarized in an automated fashion without losing significant information. And the metadata that accompanies the documents [...] often from library records [...] does not capture the varied content of the text within. Furthermore, adoption of computational tools remains low among these scholars despite such tools having existed for decades. A recent study found that the main culprits were poor user interfaces and lack of communication between tool builders and tool users. We therefore took an iterative, user-centered approach {{to the development of the}} tool. From reports of classroom usage, and interviews with scholars, we developed a descriptive model of the text analysis process, and extracted design guidelines for text analysis systems. These guidelines recommend showing overviews of both the content and metadata of a collection, allowing users to separate and compare subsets of data according to combinations of searches and metadata filters, allowing users to collect phrases, sentences, and documents into custom groups for analysis, making the usage context of words easy to see without interrupting the current activity, and making it easy to switch between different visualizations of the same data. WordSeer, the system we implemented, supports highly flexible slicing and dicing, as well as easier transitions than in other tool between visual analyses, <b>drill-downs,</b> lateral explorations and overviews of slices in a text collection. The tool uses techniques from computational linguistics, information retrieval and data visualization. The contributions of this dissertation are the following. First, the design and source code of WordSeer Version 3, an exploratory text analysis system. Unlike other current systems for this audience, WordSeer 3 supports collecting evidence, isolating and analyzing sub-sets of a collection, making comparisons based on collected items, and exploring a new idea without interrupting the current task. Second, we give a descriptive model of how humanities and social science scholars undertake exploratory text analysis during the course of their work. We also identify pain points in their current workflows and give suggestions on how systems can address these problems. Third, we describe a set of design principles for text analysis systems aimed at addressing these pain points. For validation, we contribute a set of three real-world examples of scholars using WordSeer 3, which was designed according to those principles. As a measure of success, we show how the scholars were able to conduct analyses yielding otherwise inaccessible results useful to their research...|$|R

Slicing and dicing is a feature whereby users can take out (slicing) a specific set of data of the OLAP cube and view (dicing) the slices from different viewpoints.
