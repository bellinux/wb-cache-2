2500|$|The {{supercritical}} water reactor (SCWR) is {{a reduced}} moderation water reactor concept that, {{due to the}} average speed of the neutrons that would cause the fission events within the fuel being faster than thermal neutrons, it is more accurately termed an epithermal reactor than a thermal reactor. It uses supercritical water as the working fluid. [...] SCWRs are basically light water reactors (LWR) operating at higher pressure and temperatures with a direct, once-through heat exchange cycle. As most commonly envisioned, it would operate on a <b>direct</b> <b>cycle,</b> much like a boiling water reactor (BWR), but since it uses supercritical water (not {{to be confused with}} critical mass) as the working fluid, it would have only one water phase present, which makes the supercritical heat exchange method more similar to a pressurized water reactor (PWR). [...] It could operate at much higher temperatures than both current PWRs and BWRs.|$|E

40|$|A <b>directed</b> <b>cycle</b> double {{cover of}} a graph G is a family of cycles of G, each {{provided}} with an orientation, such that every edge of G is covered by exactly two oppositely <b>directed</b> <b>cycles.</b> Explicit obstacles {{to the existence of}} a <b>directed</b> <b>cycle</b> double cover in a graph are bridges. Jaeger conjectured that bridges are actually the only obstacles. One of the difficulties in proving the Jaeger's conjecture lies in discovering and avoiding obstructions to partial strategies that, if successful, create <b>directed</b> <b>cycle</b> double covers. In this work, we suggest a way to circumvent this difficulty. We formulate a conjecture on graph connections, whose validity follows by the successful avoidance of one cut-type obstruction that we call cut-obstacles.

50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>cycle</b> nuclear engines would {{resemble}} a conventional jet engine, except {{that there would}} be no combustion chambers. The air gained from the compressor section would be sent to a plenum that directs the air into the nuclear reactor core. An exchange takes place where the reactor is cooled, but it then heats up the same air and sends it to another plenum. The second plenum directs the air into a turbine, which sends it out the exhaust. The end result is that instead of using jet fuel, an aircraft could rely on nuclear reactions for power.|$|E
