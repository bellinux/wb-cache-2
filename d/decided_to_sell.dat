5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> the Theatre.

Hearts <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> tickets using their loyalty points system, while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during the sales process. Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E
