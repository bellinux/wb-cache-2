25|$|The UUP's youth wing is the Young Unionists, first {{formed in}} 2004 as a rebrand of the Ulster Young Unionist Council, which formed in 1946. Many {{of its members}} <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> the party, such as the present leader of the UUP. Others have left to start other Unionist parties. Having disbanded twice, in 1974 and 2004, the Council was re-constituted by young activists in March 2004. This {{resulted}} in the Young Unionists (YU) becoming a representative body of the UUP and subject to its revamp of their Constitution.|$|E
25|$|Age can be {{determined}} by counting growth rings in fish scales, otoliths, cross-sections of fin spines for species with thick spines such as triggerfish, or teeth for a few species. Each method has its merits and drawbacks. Fish scales are easiest to obtain, but may be unreliable if scales have fallen off of the fish and new ones grown in their places. Fin spines may be unreliable for the same reason, and most fish do not have spines of sufficient thickness for clear rings to be visible. Otoliths will <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> the fish throughout its life history, but obtaining them requires killing the fish. Also, otoliths often require more preparation before ageing can occur.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Republican voters control {{most of the}} state, {{especially}} in the more rural and suburban areas outside of the cities; Democratic strength is mostly confined to the urban cores {{of the four major}} cities, and is particularly strong in the cities of Nashville and Memphis. The latter area includes a large African-American population. Historically, Republicans had their greatest strength in East Tennessee before the 1960s. Tennessee's 1st and 2nd congressional districts, based in the Tri-Cities and Knoxville, respectively, are among the few historically Republican districts in the South. Those districts' residents supported the Union over the Confederacy during the Civil War; they identified with the GOP after the war and <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> that party ever since. The first has been in Republican hands continuously since 1881, and Republicans (or their antecedents) have held it for all but four years since 1859. The second has been held continuously by Republicans or their antecedents since 1859.|$|E

500|$|Although first {{documented}} in 1104, {{the book is}} presumed to have been buried with Cuthbert at Lindisfarne, and to <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> the body during the wanderings forced by the Viking invasions two centuries later. [...] Bede's Life recounts that Cuthbert was initially buried in a stone sarcophagus {{to the right of}} the altar in the church at Lindisfarne; he had wanted to be buried at the hermitage on Inner Farne Island where he died, but before his death was persuaded to allow his burial at the main monastery. [...] His burial was first disturbed eleven years after his death, when his remains were moved to behind the altar to reflect his recognition, in the days before a formal process of canonisation, as a saint. [...] The sarcophagus was opened and his body was said to have been found perfectly preserved or incorrupt. [...] This apparent miracle led to the steady growth of Cuthbert's posthumous cult, to the point where he became the most popular saint of Northern England.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Greenwood High School, Miller became {{a student at}} Memphis State University in 1973, {{attending}} with a band scholarship. He played euphonium, but, during his two years at the university, Miller met pianists Donald Brown and James Williams, who {{introduced him to the}} music of well-known players such as Wynton Kelly, Bud Powell, and McCoy Tyner. Still at Memphis State, Miller attended a jazz workshop, where one of the tutors was his future bandleader, Woody Shaw, who stated that they would meet again in two years. They did meet again two years later, and Shaw remembered the young pianist. After leaving university in 1975, Miller took lessons privately in Boston with Madame Margaret Chaloff, who had taught many of the pianists that Miller admired. He later commented that, [...] "I should <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> her longer, [...] but at that time I was so restless, constantly on the move." [...] Miller played with saxophonists Ricky Ford and Bill Pierce in Boston. That winter, Miller was invited to Los Angeles by a school friend and decided to go, to escape the northern cold. He stayed on the West Coast for a year, playing locally in clubs and a church.|$|E

[...] In an interview, Shepherd reveals that Presley kissed her all over her naked body – but refused to have oral sex with her. His slow tender kisses ended at her bellybutton. Elvis explained to her, [...] "Me and the guys talk and, well, we don't eat pussy." [...] She always knew their relationship was doomed and they wouldn't last as a couple.

2500|$|The hosting of Serbian {{children}} did not end in the 1990s and is still ongoing in the 2000s. [...] In 2002, Greek families hosted Serbian orphans from 20 December 2002 to 6 January 2003. [...] Greek families again hosted orphan Serbian children {{in the summer of}} 2003, from 10 July to 10 August. [...] The hospitality program, like many others, was held with the cooperation of the Greek Red Cross and the Yugoslav Red Cross. In 2006, a total of 216 children of refugees, children who lost a parent in the war, and children from poor families spent Christmas in Greece {{within the framework of the}} hospitality programme for Serb children held by the Serbian and the Greek Red Cross.

[...] Since the Greek and Serbian Red Cross launched the hosting of children from Serbia in 1993, an estimated 16,000 children <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>with</b> Greek families. [...] As a result, very close friendship ties have been forged and, in most cases, contact between the children and the host families continues.|$|E
