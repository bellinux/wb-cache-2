40|$|Background: Increased {{incidence}} of fungal infection {{has been reported}} globally in the recent years. Fungal infection of {{the central nervous system}} {{remains one of the most}} difficult diseases to treat and requires multi-modality intensive therapeutic strategies. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of case records of patients with confirmed skull base fungal granuloma treated at a tertiary hospital between 1988 - 2008. An attempt was made to stage the extent of skull base fungal granuloma based on neuroimaging, operative findings and course of the disease on serial follow-up. Results: Thirty-three patients with skull base fungal granuloma were treated surgically during the study period. The mean age at presentation was 33. 2 years and diabetes was a major predisposing factor. Eight patients expired in the first two months following surgical intervention due to flare-up of the disease. Eighteen patients who underwent grossly total excision had a mean progression-free survival (PFS) of 43 months and seven patients with subtotal excision had a mean PFS of 23 months. Better survival probability was noted in those patients who underwent total excision at surgery and received complete course of amphotericin. Conclusion: Total surgical excision with complete course of antimycotic drug therapy increases PFS. A better antimycotic drug with less toxicity and high efficacy with <b>fungicidal</b> <b>property</b> can make a difference in the outcomes of the disease...|$|E
30|$|Various methods {{including}} {{chemical and}} physical means, chemical reduction, sol–gel, solvothermal or hydrothermal, and electrochemical reduction techniques are widely employed for {{the synthesis of}} the nanomaterials [12, 13]. Their available synthetic processes include either oxidation of Mn(II) in basic solution or oxidation by oxygen, potassium persulfate, and hydrogen peroxide, or by reduction of permanganate using different routes [14, 15]. Eventually, synthesize of nanoscales {{has been done by}} bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms [12, 16, 17]. The menace of growing contamination causes a great request for green chemistry and biological processes for preparation, recycling, and degrading chemical materials [18]. The synthesis of nanomaterials using plants extracts can be preferable than other biological methods like microbial procedure [18, 19]. Antioxidant activity of the plant’s extracts is responsible for synthesizing of metallic nanomaterials. The usage of the extract of Parthenium [20], Euphorbia hirta, Polyalthia longifolia [21], Coriandrum sativum, Dittrichia graveolens (L.) [10, 22] Azadirachta indica, Jatropha curcas [23], Ocimum sanctum, and several other plants supply the principles of green chemistry that is environmentally friendly. This reaction is safe, quick, and easily done at the ambient temperature and pressure, and can be scaled-up easily [21]. Early researchers of Yucca gloriosa bark yielded two Yucca species of tropical or subtropical plants with a tree-like habit, which grow mainly in the arid or semi-arid regions. They contain large quantities of steroidal glycosides. They thus have potential in biological, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications and several steroidal glycosides exhibit fungistatic or <b>fungicidal</b> <b>property</b> [24]. In addition, they contain several very uncommon phenolic constituents named gloriosaols A, B, C, D, and E [25]. The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay confirmed the remarkable antioxidant activity of the Y. gloriosa extract [25], which have made it useful for the synthesis of the nanoparticles [14].|$|E
