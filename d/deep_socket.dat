50|$|The {{defining}} characteristics {{include a}} thickening of the maxilla visible on its internal surface, above the large front (caniniform) teeth; and the premaxillary teeth being set in <b>deep</b> <b>sockets.</b> All other (sister group and more primitive) synapsid clades have teeth that {{are set in}} shallow sockets.|$|R
5000|$|Sockets are {{available}} in various depths or lengths, often divided by most manufacturers into two categories of [...] "standard" [...] and [...] "deep" [...] according to the ANSI or DIN standard they are made to and the tolerances allowed by those specifications for each length of socket. Because the standards allow for some flexibility in tolerances, {{it is common to}} see two manufacturers make <b>deep</b> <b>sockets</b> of the same size but with slightly different depths even though both meet the same specification. Standard length, otherwise known as [...] "shallow" [...] sockets, have a lower profile and allow a user to access nuts in narrow spaces. <b>Deep</b> <b>sockets</b> are useful for turning nuts onto bolts when the bolt extends upwards into the socket (as in the case of many bolted joints), a very typical example being exhaust clamp bolts on a car.|$|R
5000|$|Although most {{manufacturers}} {{offer only}} those sizes and depths described within the common ANSI or DIN specifications, some exceptions do exist. Specialty manufacturers such as IMPERIAL-Newton Corp offer an expanded range of [...] "extra deep" [...] sockets for special industrial applications; and popular brands like Snap-on or Mac Tools offer {{what are called}} [...] "semi-deep" [...] or [...] "mid-length" [...] sockets, which provide much of a <b>deep</b> <b>socket's</b> depth, while fitting in tighter locations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of long-span bridge engineering and increase of load on construction, the piles which socketed in rock more than 5 diameters {{have been used in}} some bridge engineering. Based on the technique of Anchored piles method, the static load tests of large diameter and <b>deep</b> <b>socketed</b> piles had been carried out in Qingdao Gulf Bridge. The bearing characteristics of large diameter pile were analyzed, including the load displacement curves of test pile; the axial force; the relationship between side friction and displacement and the sharing ratio of side resistance and end resistance. Finally, the test results were compared with specifications, The results showed that the bearing characteristic of <b>deep</b> <b>socketed</b> piles was as same as the friction piles in this area; from the results of test the side friction of pile could be estimated lower in strongly weathering breccia area while the friction in strong- weakly weathered breccia was relatively close to the value of exploration reports. At the bottom of the pile, because the relatively displacement of pile-rock was small, the pile side resistance is relatively small. It could be seen that the estimate of bearing capacity was less than the test result, and the pile foundation was safety enough...|$|R

5000|$|In {{reptiles}} and in birds, the acetabula are <b>deep</b> <b>sockets.</b> Organisms in the dinosauria clade {{are defined}} by a perforate acetabulum, which {{can be thought of}} as a [...] "hip-socket". The perforate acetabulum is a cup-shaped opening on each side of the pelvic girdle formed where the ischium, ilium, and pubis all meet, and into which the head of the femur inserts. The orientation and position of the acetabulum is one of the main morphological traits that caused dinosaurs to walk in an upright posture with their legs directly underneath their bodies. In a relatively small number of dinosaurs, particularly ankylosaurians (e.g. Texasetes pleurohalio), an imperforate acetabulum is present, which is not an opening, but instead resembles a shallow concave depression on each side of the pelvic girdle.|$|R

A main attraction for the screw was that conventional slotted screwdrivers could also be used on them, which was not possible with the Robertson Screw.|$|E
50|$|Entering {{and leaving}} the pipe was described:The {{continuous}} pipe is divided into suitable sections (according to the respective distance of the fixed steam engines) by separating valves, which are opened by the train as it goes along: these valves are so constructed that no stoppage or diminution of speed is necessary in passing from one section to another. The exit separating valve, or {{that at the end}} of the section nearest to its steam engine, is opened by the compression of air in front of the piston, which necessarily takes place after it has passed the branch which communicates with the air-pump; the entrance separating valve, (that near the commencement of the next section of pipe,) is an equilibrium or balance valve, and opens immediately the piston has entered the pipe. The main pipe is put together with <b>deep</b> <b>socket</b> joints, in each of which an annular space is left about the middle of the packing, and filled with a semi-fluid: thus any possible leakage of air into the pipe is prevented.|$|E

50|$|The American Bobtail is hearty, short-tailed cat. Its body is {{moderately}} long, {{with substantial}} boning, and stocky. The stance is noticeably rectangular. The chest is full and broad. The hips are substantial, almost {{as wide as}} chest, and hind legs longer than fore legs with large round feet which may have toe tufts. The head is a broad wedge without flat planes, size proportionate to body. There is a concave curve from nose to brow, or rise to prominent brow, a broad unpinched muzzle, prominent whisker pads, a gently sloped wide nose and full, strong jaws. The ears are medium-sized, wide-based, and equally mounted on top and the side of head with rounded tips. The eyes are almost almond shape,with size proportionate to head. The aperture is angled to base of ear, and with medium wide spacing and <b>deep</b> <b>sockets.</b> Eye color varies with coat color. The end of the tail is visible above the back, but not beyond the hock while the animal is in repose. The tail is straight or curved, slightly knotted or may have bumps.|$|R
5000|$|Some sockets are {{designed}} {{to have the same}} outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a [...] "special" [...] ratchet that fits {{on the outside of the}} socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a <b>deep</b> <b>socket</b> in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for 1/4", 3/8" [...] and 1/2" [...] sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional ratchet handle with interchangeable 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets. They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names. Craftsman Tools call theirs--Max Axess, and also sells GearWrench's Pass-Thru brands. Lowes calls their socket system Xtreme Access, etc.. Ratcheting box end wrenches can often be employed in the same application but will nearly always be significantly wider.|$|E

40|$|The {{description}} of a partial but well preserved head of the sclerorhynchid batoid Sclerorhynchus atavus Woodward 1889 gave the first clear indication {{of the presence of}} a puzzling group of extinct rostrum-bearing rays that resembled both the Pristidae (rays) and the Pristophoridae (sharks). Despite recognizing similarities and differences to these extant groups, Woodward (1889, 1892) suggested that Sclerorhynchus be assigned to the Pristidae, although the rostra are very different. Woodward did note similarities of Sclerorhynchus rostrum saw-teeth to those of the Pristiophoridae, including the location of these along the margin of the rostrum, rather than in <b>deep</b> <b>sockets,</b> as seen along the pristid rostrum. In addition, the type specimen of Sclerorhynchus has very distinct saw-tooth denticles not only along the rostrum, but modified denticles along the sides of the head, as in the Pristiophoridae. The enlarged rostral denticles of Sclerorhynchus also appear to rotate into position, another feature seen in the pristiophorids but not in the pristids, and in other sclerorhynchids such as Libanopristis. Although individual fossil rostral tooth-like denticles had been earlier described, Woodward’s {{description of}} a rostrum and associated rostral tooth-like denticles meant {{that for the first time}} a fossil rostrum could be compared to living forms, highlighting the extreme variation in rostrum saw-tooth morphology among sharks and rays...|$|R

5000|$|Asperoris {{belongs to}} a clade or {{evolutionary}} grouping of reptiles called Archosauriformes, which includes Archosauria (the clade including living crocodilians and birds) and their extinct, mostly Triassic, relatives. It has several features that place it outside Archosauria with non-archosaurian archosauriforms, including {{the lack of an}} antorbital fossa and the possible presence of a postparietal bone {{at the back of the}} skull, which is not found in archosaurs. However, it also has features that place it among the closest relatives of archosaurs, including the presence of an antorbital fenestra and the lack of a hole called the parietal foramen on the skull roof. Asperoris shares with a group of archosauriforms called erythrosuchids the presence of slot in the lower part of the nasal bone that fits into a projection of the premaxilla beneath it. It also has a thecodont dentition, meaning that its teeth fit into <b>deep</b> <b>sockets</b> in the jaw. A thecodont dentition is seen in all non-archosaurian archosauriforms except proterosuchids, and is characteristic of the clade. Because of the poor preservation of NHMUK PV R36615 and the phylogenetic analysis used in the study (which focuses on relationships of Triassic archosaurs), the phylogenetic relationships of Asperoris are uncertain. Nesbitt, Butler and Gower's 2013 phylogenetic analysis resulted in a strict consensus tree with Asperoris in a polytomy or unresolved phylogenetic relationship with Erythrosuchus africanus, an erythrosuchid, Vancleavea campi, an aquatic archosauriform, the proterosuchid clade, and the clade including Euparkeria capensis, phytosaurs, and Archosauria. Other phylogenetic trees produced in the analysis placed Asperoris as the sister taxon (closest relative) of either Erythrosuchus africanus or Euparkeria capensis. A sister-taxon relationship with Erythrosuchus is more likely because it is based on a derived feature, the slot in the nasal, while the relationship with Euparkeria is less likely because it is based only on characteristics inherited from archosauriform ancestors (plesiomorphies).|$|R
50|$|Most of the readily visible {{signs are}} {{associated}} with the skeletal system. Many individuals with Marfan syndrome grow to above-average height, and some have disproportionately long, slender limbs with thin, weak wrists and long fingers and toes. Besides affecting height and limb proportions, people with Marfan syndrome may have abnormal lateral curvature of the spine (scoliosis), thoracic lordosis, abnormal indentation (pectus excavatum) or protrusion (pectus carinatum) of the sternum, abnormal joint flexibility, a high-arched palate with crowded teeth and an overbite, flat feet, hammer toes, stooped shoulders, and unexplained stretch marks on the skin. It can also cause pain in the joints, bones and muscles. Some people with Marfan have speech disorders resulting from symptomatic high palates and small jaws. Early osteoarthritis may occur. Other signs include limited range of motion in the hips due to the femoral head protruding into abnormally <b>deep</b> hip <b>sockets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When M. G. Mehl first named Poposaurus in 1915, he {{described}} it as [...] "a well-muscled creature light in weight, possibly bipedal in gait occasionally, and most assuredly swift in movement." [...] Mehl based this description on its long limb bones and <b>deep</b> hip <b>socket,</b> two features which link it with bipedal dinosaurs. Since the 1970s however, Poposaurus has been considered a pseudosuchian archosaur {{more closely related to}} crocodilians than dinosaurs. Most of its close relatives (such as the large-bodied rauisuchids and ctenosauriscids) were obligate quadrupeds that could not walk on two legs. Although the entire skeleton was unknown, Poposaurus was expected to be similar in appearance to its relatives. In 2011, the nearly complete specimen YPM VP 057100 was described. The specimen confirmed Mehl's description, revealing that Poposaurus was indeed bipedal. The skeleton preserves both the fore and hind limbs, showing that Poposaurus had much shorter arms than legs.|$|R

25|$|In 1979, Sergio Rapu Haoa {{and a team}} of archaeologists {{discovered}} that the hemispherical or <b>deep</b> elliptical eye <b>sockets</b> were designed to hold coral eyes with either black obsidian or red scoria pupils. The discovery was made by collecting and reassembling broken fragments of white coral that were found at the various sites. Subsequently, previously uncategorized finds in the Easter Island museum were re-examined and recategorized as eye fragments. It is thought that the moai with carved eye sockets were probably allocated to the ahu and ceremonial sites, suggesting that a selective Rapa Nui hierarchy was attributed to the moai design until its demise {{with the advent of the}} Birdman religion, Tangata Manu.|$|R
50|$|The first {{remains of}} Poposaurus {{were found in}} 1904 near Lander, Wyoming. In 1907, {{paleontologist}} J. H. Lees described this fossil, an ilium (part of the hip) from the Popo Agie Formation, and identified it {{as that of the}} phytosaur Paleorhinus bransoni. In 1915, paleontologist M. G. Mehl named Poposaurus based on more complete material from the Popo Agie Formation, including vertebrae, hips, and limb bones. He cited the holotype as Museum 602, but in fact the holotype is UR 357. Mehl concluded that the ilium described by Lees, UR 358, also belonged to Poposaurus. He did not classify Poposaurus as a phytosaur because the shape of its ilium was different and it had more sacral vertebrae fused to the hip. Mehl made comparisons between Poposaurus and the earlier named Dolichobrachium, also from the Triassic of Wyoming. Dolichobrachium was only known from some teeth, a humerus, and part of the pectoral girdle, so Mehl suggested that the Poposaurus and Dolichobrachium material could belong to the same animal. Mehl noted similarities between Poposaurus and theropod dinosaurs, including its hollow leg bones and <b>deep</b> hip <b>socket,</b> but did not consider it a dinosaur because each sacral vertebra supported only one rib (theropods usually have multiple ribs projecting from each sacral vertebra).|$|R

As a result, they are often used in blues music. The Moonshine and Mudslide slides are glazed on the outside but porous on the inside so that finger moisture is absorbed, preventing slippage. Metals such as stainless steel, chrome and aluminium cause a bright penetrating sound and are mostly used with electric guitars, among others for rock music.
