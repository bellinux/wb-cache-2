5|$|By {{the end of}} January 2004, Arsenal {{were still}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> all four trophies, but {{suffered}} setbacks {{in each of the}} cup competitions; they were unable to retain the FA Cup, losing out to eventual winners Manchester United in the semi-finals and days later were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League by Chelsea in the quarter-finals. They exited the League Cup after a defeat to Middlesbrough in early February.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> a {{new head}} coach, the Bears {{requested}} interviews with Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase, Arizona Cardinals defensive coordinator Todd Bowles, Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Dan Quinn, and Detroit Lions defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. The team also showed interest in Ravens' offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak and former Buffalo Bills head coach Doug Marrone. However, Kubiak announced on January 11 {{that he will}} stay with Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, 1683, the Captain of the frigate HMS Falcon was sailing from England to the West Indies and beckoned {{the other}} {{officers}} {{to be present}} as he broke open his secret instructions. He learned that his mission was to aid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> a large treasure near Hispaniola. A sloop in convoy, HMS Bonetta (sometimes Bonito), was designated to {{do most of the}} searching, but the Falcon would act as aid and protection. These instructions were from Sir John Narborough, a rear admiral and commissioner of the Royal Navy, who also had the ear of King Charles II.|$|E

5|$|Triumph participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> the East Asia Squadron {{and in the}} {{campaign}} against the German colony at Tsingtao, China until November when she began a refit at Hong Kong.

5|$|During the Ottoman rule of Greece, impalement {{became an}} {{important}} tool of psychological warfare, intended to put terror into the peasant population. By the 18th century, Greek bandits turned guerrilla insurgents (known as klephts) became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government. Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them in to the authorities. The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in 1805 and 1806, {{and were able to}} enlist Greek villagers, eager to avoid the stake, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> their outlaw countrymen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1988, he {{was put on the}} {{transfer}} list and came close to joining American club Portland Timbers, before injury put negotiations on hold. A £1million price tag also deterred a great deal of potential interest. In view of Whiteside's medical reports, Ferguson rejected bids of £500,000 from Osasuna of Spain and from Ron Atkinson's new club Sheffield Wednesday, before accepting a bid of £600,000 (with £150,000 to follow if Whiteside reached 50 games) from Everton in July 1989. This was to the dismay of some of the club's supporters, who felt that there was still hope that he had a future at Old Trafford. Ferguson intended to build his own team having signed midfield duo Neil Webb and Mike Phelan, and also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> other players including Paul Ince, Gary Pallister and Danny Wallace.|$|E

Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy are trapped by several Valentine mobsters; they learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum. Cliff proceeds to the South Seas Club, where he tells Jenny about his new alter ego. The Valentine gang arrives, and Jenny is kidnapped by Sinclair in the ensuing melée.|$|E
5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} {{as head coach}} involved replacing Phil Simms as the starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler, who had led the Giants to a win in the Super Bowl, was named as the team's Opening Day starting quarterback. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the San Francisco 49ers 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to a record of 7-5 after a dramatic 21-14 win at Tampa Bay in week 13 and were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> a post-season spot, the Giants lost their next three behind Phil Simms who reclaimed his starting position when Hostetler went down with a broken back. Hostetler threw five touchdowns in his 12 starts, while Simms threw eight in his four starts. The excitement that had surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge during the year was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059yards, while also catching 43 passes. The season was also marked by the decline of Lawrence Taylor. Although Taylor still finished with a respectable 7 sacks, 1991 {{marked the first time}} in his career he was not elected to the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Pregame {{media and}} fan {{interest}} surrounding the game focused largely on Louisville's top-ranked offense and Virginia Tech's first-ranked scoring defense. Other major points of media coverage included the two teams' quarterbacks: Louisville's Hunter Cantwell, who replaced starter Brian Brohm after Brohm suffered a season-ending knee injury; and Virginia Tech's Marcus Vick, brother of National Football League star Michael Vick. Also {{a concern for}} Louisville was the health of star running back Michael Bush, who missed two games in November due to an injury. On a wider note, there was also interest in the conference-level showdown between a new Big East team (Louisville) and a team that left the Big East for the ACC after the 2003 season (Virginia Tech). For Virginia Tech, {{there was also the}} hope of overcoming the disappointment of a season that saw the Hokies ranked third in the country and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hunt</b> <b>for</b> the national championship before failing to even win the Atlantic Coast Conference and missing a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game.|$|E
