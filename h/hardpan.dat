They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low-lying areas. When the lakes dry up, they leave a crust or <b>hardpan</b> behind. This area of deposited clay, silt or sand {{is known as a}} playa. The deserts of North America have more than one hundred playas, many of them relics of Lake Bonneville which covered parts of Utah, Nevada and Idaho during the last ice age when the climate was colder and wetter.

5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive <b>hardpan.</b> Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E
25|$|Ploughing leaves {{very little}} crop residue on the surface, which {{otherwise}} could reduce both {{wind and water}} erosion. Over-ploughing {{can lead to the}} formation of <b>hardpan.</b> Typically farmers break up <b>hardpan</b> up with a subsoiler, which acts as a long, sharp knife to slice through the hardened layer of soil deep below the surface. Soil erosion due to improper land and plough utilisation is possible. Contour ploughing mitigates soil erosion by ploughing across a slope, along elevation lines. Alternatives to ploughing, such as the no till method, have the potential to actually build soil levels and humus. These may be suitable to smaller, more intensively cultivated plots, and to farming on poor, shallow or degraded soils that ploughing would further degrade.|$|E

40|$|Anomalous {{concentrations}} of silica in ground {{water of the}} eastern San Joaquin Valley originate from several diverse sources and are subsequently modified by recharge or diagenesis. Statistics, geochemical models, and column studies identified potential sources of silica in ground water and those parameters most important in influencing its distribution. Principal components analysis indicated inverse time and potassium as the parameters which best relate to silica. Inverse time relates to ground-water recharge while potassium relates to either the rhyolitic Friant Pumice, the <b>hardpans</b> of the eastern San Joaquin Valley, or diagenetic losses. A lumped parameter model suggests that recharge {{is responsible for the}} drop in silica concentrations beneath Fresno since 1971. The Madera County model indicates higher silica concentrations associated with the Friant Pumice, older geologic units with <b>hardpans,</b> finer grained sediments, and areas of ground-water discharge. Lower silica concentrations are associated with unweathered sediments, areas receiving recharge, and areas underlain by the Corcoran Clay. Column leaching studies produced silica concentrations from the Friant Pumice of up to 90 mg/ 1, Turlock Lake and Riverbank Formation <b>hardpans</b> from 40 - 50 mg/ 1, and younger Modesto Formation sediments from 10 - 40 mg/l. Spatially, volcanogenic sediments impart the highest silica concentrations to the ground water, 70 - 95 mg/ 1, and occur along the eastern margin of the valley, north of the San Joaquin River, or in San Joaquin River fluvial deposits. Iron-silica <b>hardpans,</b> found at various depths along {{the east side of the}} valley, are associated with silica {{concentrations of}} 40 - 70 mg/l. The typical arkosic sediments of the eastern valley have silica concentrations of 20 - 40 mg/l. Silica concentrations in ground water are modified by recharge and diagenetic processes. Either natural or artificial recharge having 4 - 16 mg/ 1 silica may lower ambient silica concentrations in ground water. Recharge occurs beneath some rivers and in transmissive paleochannel deposits; artificial sources include agricultural overirrigation and basin recharge. The down-gradient loss of silica to the sedimentary column, more prevalent at depth, apparently is by the sorption of silica on clays, the formation of clays, or deposition of amorphous silica...|$|R

40|$|The south Uralian {{foreland}} basin forms {{part of the}} giant, yet sparsely documented, PreCaspian salt tectonic province. The basin {{can potentially}} add much {{to the understanding of}} fluviolacustrine sedimentation within salt-walled minibasins, where the literature has been highly reliant on only a few examples (such as the Paradox Basin of Utah). This paper describes the Late Permian terrestrial fill of the Kul’chumovo salt minibasin near Orenburg in the south Urals in which sediments were deposited in a range of channel, overbank and lacustrine environments. Palaeomagnetic stratigraphy shows that, during the Late Permian, the basin had a relatively slow and uniform subsidence pattern with widespread pedogenesis and calcrete development. Angular unconformities or halokinetic sequence boundaries cannot be recognized within the relatively fine-grained fill, and stratigraphic and spatial variations in facies are therefore critical to understanding the subsidence history of the salt minibasin. Coarse-grained channel belts show evidence for lateral relocation within the minibasin while the development of a thick stack of calcrete <b>hardpans</b> indicates that opposing parts of the minibasin became largely inactive for prolonged periods (possibly in the order of one million years). The regular vertical stacking of calcrete <b>hardpans</b> within floodplain mudstones provides further evidence that halokinetic minibasin growth is inherently episodic and cyclical. ...|$|R

Since the 1980 s, the uncapped tailings have developed laterally discontinuous Fe-rich <b>hardpans,</b> which {{are located in the}} higher parts of gently sloping tailings masses and at the top (< 50 cm) of the tailings piles. Hardpan-cemented tailings comprise thin layers (typically ∼ 0. 2 – 2 mm thick) of HFO (hydrous ferric oxides) and sulfate efflorescences cementing tailings grains. In comparison to the tailings, the hardpan-cemented tailings contain significantly higher median As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, In, Mn, Mo, Stotal, Th, U, Y and Zn values. Partial leaching studies of tailings and pond water analyses indicate that wetting and acidification of Fe-cemented tailings removes significant proportions of trace elements into pore and surface waters. Tin shows no mobility due to the presence of weathering-resistant cassiterite (SnO 2) and, As and Pb display limited mobility possibly due to their coprecipitation with jarosite-type phases and HFO materials {{at the top of the}} tailings profile. By contrast, the trace elements Cd, Ce, Cu, La, Ni, Pb, U and Zn display the greatest mobility, possibly due to their incorporation in soluble sulfate efflorescences and sorption onto mineral and HFO surfaces.

Two watersheds (Anjeni and Debre Mewi) were selected in the humid Ethiopian highlands. For both watersheds, 0 - 45 [*]cm soil penetration resistance (SPR, n[*]=[*] 180) and soil physical properties (particle size, SOM, pH, base ions, CEC, silica content, bulk density and moisture content) were determined at 15 [*]cm depth increments for three land uses: cultivated, pasture and forest.

Dense layers with a critical SPR threshold of[*]≥[*] 2000 kPa were observed in the cultivated and pasture lands starting at a depth of 15 - 30 [*]cm but did not occur in the undisturbed forest land. Compared with the original forest soils, agricultural fields were: lower in organic matter, CEC, and exchangeable base cations; more acidic; had a higher bulk density and more fine particles (clay and silt); and contained less soluble silica. Overall, our findings suggest that soil physical and chemical properties in agricultural lands deteriorated, causing disintegration of soil aggregates resulting in greater sediment concentration in infiltration water that clogged up macro-pores, thereby disconnecting deep flow paths found in original forest soils. <br/...|$|R

30|$|Basal {{segments}} of nodal roots from all four cultivars were thinner {{when exposed to}} drought, an effect that has been observed in other studies (Kadam et al. 2015; Kadam et al. 2017). The basal {{segments of}} large lateral roots were also thinner under drought, but these roots became thicker as they elongated into medium that had increasing moisture with depth (Additional file 7 : Figure S 6). Thinner roots may be beneficial for soil exploration because they have less nutrient and carbon cost per unit length, increasing resources available for root elongation into new soil domains (Lynch 2013), and they can explore small pores and crevices in the soil (Bengough et al. 2011). On the other hand, thicker roots {{have been associated with}} better soil penetration ability, which is important for root growth into hardened soils or through <b>hardpans</b> under drought conditions (Clark et al. 2008; Gowda et al. 2011; Lynch et al., 2014).

The rocks thus keep gross characteristics of the primary deposit but are overprinted with the in situ, secondary features derived from completely different environmental conditions. Besides, elucidating timescales at the outcrop scale is not always feasible and is frequently overlooked in less resolved regional studies. Ultimately, this has surely contributed to biases in the interpretation of the evolution of the biosphere. In this regard, the study of pedogenetic (e.g., development of horizons, <b>hardpans</b> or duricrusts, peds, and clay compositional and mechanical—e.g., slickensides—features, etc.) and microbial processes in spring and stream microbialites (e.g., travertines, tufas, sinters) and exposed sedimentary and rock surface habitats (endolithic habitats and cryptogamic covers), is of particular importance for the more comprehensive understanding of past life because these represent terrestrial habitats expected on ancient continental surfaces.|$|R

[...] Field operations of the United States Soil Survey, now known as the National Cooperative Soil Survey, began in 1899.

[...] All were considered to have agricultural importance. [...] Since then, three of these series have either been dropped from the official listings or have been combined with other soil series recognized at a later date. [...] Thus, the San Joaquin soil is the oldest, continuously recognized soil series within the state. [...] (More than 1,500 soil series are currently recognized in California.) [...] Nearly one-half million acres (2,000km²) of this soil have now been identified and mapped in many counties in California. [...] With proper management, this soil has produced many billions of dollars of food wealth for the state's economy. [...] Knowledge of the San Joaquin soil's properties and characteristics has become increasingly important in suburban and urban development. [...] As the science of soil has advanced during this century, the concept of the San Joaquin soil has evolved, but has retained, as distinctive soil characteristics, its reddish soil color and its strongly cemented subsoil <b>hardpan</b> that limits root and water penetration. [...] Aside from the texture and structure of the surface soil, the early descriptions of the San Joaquin soil paid little attention to the physical character of the subsoil above the <b>hardpan.</b> [...] The <b>hardpan</b> was expected to be encountered within a depth of 6 feet. [...] The modern concept recognizes mainly a sandy loam surface soil overlying a finer textured subsoil that has a significant clay increase, at its upper boundary or within some part of the subsoil. [...] The subsoil rests abruptly on a mainly silica-cemented <b>hardpan</b> at depths ranging from 20 to 40inches. [...] With these features, plus defined ranges of other surface and subsoil properties such as color, soil texture, structure, consistence, pH, organic matter content, and inherent temperature and moisture characteristics, USDA soil taxonomy now places the San Joaquin series in a fine, mixed, thermic family of Abruptic Durixeralfs.
