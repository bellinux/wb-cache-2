50|$|In 1914, {{prospecting}} in {{the vicinity}} of Moira Sound amounted to little more than the annual assessment work required by law. Between the head of Moira North Arm and Mineral Lake the copper mines, once active, were idle throughout the year and {{the only person in the}} region was a man who looked after the various properties and as opportunity offered did a little prospecting. Efforts were made to prospect further the Navaho claim, formerly called the Hope claim, which lies between Cannery Cove and North Arm. No productive work was done <b>during</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> on any of the properties adjacent to Niblack. Only one person now lives in this region, and although part of his time is spent in prospecting little new work has been accomplished. The strongly faulted and deformed structures in this region increased the difficulty and expense of mining. A small prospect lies in the small bight north of Black Point, at the entrance of Niblack Anchorage. The lead had been opened by means of a vertical shaft, and by a short adit. The country rock is an agglomeratic or pyroclastic igneous rock trending east and dipping south. Not far away, an infaulted mass of black shales and slates are exposed.|$|E
5000|$|Following independence, Tjeknavorian {{served on}} the {{committee}} to reinstate the pre-communist Armenian flag and the national coat-of-arms. He was especially influential in {{the adoption of the}} national anthem, [...] "Mer Hayrenik" [...] (Our Fatherland), for which he rewrote the words for the first stanza. Tjeknavorian also renamed the two major avenues of Yerevan <b>during</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of the Soviet period, from Lenin and Red Army to Mesrop Mashtots (creator of the Armenian alphabet in 451) and Gregory the Illuminator (founder of the Armenian church in 301 AD) respectively. The renaming reflected his philosophy of [...] "Faith and Culture" [...] as the twin foundations upon which the Armenian nation must be re-built. During the crippling energy blockade between 1992 and 1995 - a result of the Karabakh war - the capital was gripped by shortages of food, water, heat and electricity. Faithful to his vow that [...] "the doors of culture must never be closed", Tjeknavorian maintained weekly concerts at this time, including a regular series of spiritual music concerts every Saturday in anticipation of the 1700th anniversary of Christianity in Armenia. Organizing transportation for the musicians and securing their daily needs, installing power generators and electric heaters and ensuring constant power supply in the building, Tjeknavorian turned the Aram Khachaturian Hall into a sanctuary of culture and faith, and was instrumental in lifting the spirits of the thousands who packed the hall each week. This phenomenon was memorialized by numerous eyewitnesses of the time, including former Russian Ambassador Vladimir Stupishin, who wrote at length about Tjeknavorian's activities in his memoirs.|$|E
