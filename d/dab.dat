5|$|<b>DAB</b> radio {{stations}} in the United Kingdom are broadcast {{on a number of}} frequency blocks on VHF Band III. The original plan devised in Wiesbaden for the framework of <b>DAB</b> in Europe was to allocate frequency blocks 11B to 12D for UK <b>DAB</b> broadcasting. However, as part of its Review of Radio, Ofcom has expanded the frequency allocations for <b>DAB</b> and has advertised local and a national ensemble licence on blocks outside the original Wiesbaden plan on 10B to 10D and 11A. Block 5A has also been reserved for the launch of local ensembles. In 2015, additional blocks were opened up for small scale <b>DAB</b> trials for an initial period of nine months. Ofcom reitreated the use of a number of frequency blocks between 7D and 9C for any future roll-out of small scale <b>DAB</b> multiplexes in its final report regarding the small scale <b>DAB</b> multiplexes published in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|<b>DAB</b> {{technically}} provides low {{audio quality}} in the UK due to 98% of stereo stations using a bit rate level of 128 kbit/s. with the MP2 audio codec, which provides poorer sound quality than FM-quality (assuming good reception on both <b>DAB</b> and FM). In addition, DAB+ stations broadcast in the UK use a bitrate between 24 and 48kbit/s. A bit rate of 256 kbit/s has been judged to provide a high quality stereo broadcast signal. Also, a large and growing number of music stations are only transmitting in mono. Indeed, the bit rates used by the radio stations on other digital platforms, such as cable, terrestrial and satellite are usually higher than on <b>DAB,</b> so the audio quality is also higher. For example, all of the BBC stations use higher bit rates on the digital TV platforms than on <b>DAB</b> apart from the BBC World Service on Freeview. On the other hand, an Ofcom survey, which was undertaken due to many consultation responses citing poor <b>DAB</b> quality, found that 94% of <b>DAB</b> listeners thought <b>DAB</b> was at least as good as FM.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2009, Ofcom allowed {{electrical}} {{retailers to}} be granted a licence to rebroadcast <b>DAB</b> signals within their stores to demonstrate <b>DAB</b> radio sets within their stores. The United Kingdom consumer charity, Which? warned that consumers who could not get an adequate <b>DAB</b> signal could be misled by the in-store sets. The Digital Radio Development Bureau replied to the Which? report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a faraday cage effect where <b>DAB</b> signals are blocked out. The DRDB recommended that consumers should check <b>DAB</b> coverage online with their postcode before purchasing a <b>DAB</b> radio to avoid disappointment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dabbing</b> {{has made}} its {{appearance}} in politics, as well. In January 2016, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton <b>dabbed</b> on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. In October, Representative Loretta Sanchez <b>dabbed</b> {{at the end of}} a Senate debate. On January 3, 2017, Cal Marshall, 17-year-old son of Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan), <b>dabbed</b> at his father's swearing in as a Congressman, confusing House Speaker Paul Ryan. On February 22, 2017, Deputy Labour Leader Tom Watson <b>dabbed</b> in the UK's House of Commons. French presidential candidates Emmanuel Macron, Benoît Hamon and François Fillon <b>dabbed</b> on TV in March 2017.|$|R

5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to <b>DAB,</b> widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with <b>DAB</b> so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations. There are no plans {{in the foreseeable future}} {{for the vast majority of}} BBC and commercial stations to transition from <b>DAB</b> to DAB+. Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, 48.8% of all radio {{listening}} {{hours by}} {{the third quarter of}} 2017 were through digital platforms, with <b>DAB</b> making up for the majority of digital radio listening (73.6%), and 61.1% of UK households claim to have access to a <b>DAB</b> radio set.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the uptake of <b>DAB</b> has {{increased}} since {{the launch of}} the BBC national <b>DAB</b> ensemble in 1995. Lower prices, new radio stations and marketing have increased the uptake of <b>DAB</b> radio in the UK. Digital radios were first sold as car radios in 1997, priced around £800, with hi-fi tuners costing up to £2,000 being released two years later. In 2001, Digital One invested in Frontier Silicon to produce a new processing chip which would allow cheaper portable radios to be produced. Roberts Radio, Goodmans and in 2002, Pure Digital's award winning Evoke series of radios broke the £100 price barrier, and <b>DAB</b> take up {{has increased}} since.|$|E

40|$|While ice massage (IM) is a {{rapid cooling}} {{technique}} used to facilitate therapeutic {{movements in the}} rehabilitation process, evidence of its efficacy over alternative therapeutic protocols is scarce. We determined whether <b>dabbing</b> the skin surface dry during a standard IM treatment would lead to greater rate of skin temperature reduction in comparison to without dabbing; and whether <b>dabbing</b> the skin would lead to an acute change in flexibility. Sixteen healthy volunteers received a “dabbing” and “non-dabbing” 7 -minute IM treatment {{over the surface of}} each triceps surae muscle. Minute-by-minute temperature change in skin surface was evaluated using an infrared thermometer. Active (AROM) and passive (PROM) range of motion were evaluated via hand-held goniometer and passive stretch force was evaluated with an algometer. Dependent variables (reported as Mean ± SD) were tested with two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. Skin temperature (2 ̆ 6 #;C) was reduced to with <b>dabbing</b> (5. 8 ± 1. 1) in comparison to without <b>dabbing</b> (6. 8 ± 1. 4), evoking significantly greater cooling at 1 -min of ice massage (group X time interaction, p 3 ̆c 0. 01). However, after two minutes of IM, each method of application evoked similar surface temperatures. There {{was no significant difference in}} AROM, with <b>dabbing</b> (- 0. 63 ± 2. 552 ̆ 6 #;) in comparison to without <b>dabbing</b> (1. 18 ± 2. 902 ̆ 6 #;), and no significant difference in passive-length tension relations (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) for either IM group. The <b>dabbing</b> protocol resulted in more rapid rate of temperature drop at 1 -minute, however, both IM techniques are sufficient in cooling surface temperature after 2 -minutes of IM. Further study is warranted to determine the clinical significance of the <b>dabbing</b> procedure...|$|R
5|$|On Digital Terrestrial Television and <b>DAB,</b> {{broadcasters}} {{also need}} to contact the ensemble or multiplex operator of a local or national <b>DAB</b> ensemble or digital terrestrial multiplex to broadcast within a region.|$|E
5|$|The BBC {{and other}} <b>DAB</b> {{broadcasters}} have been encouraging <b>DAB</b> take up by promoting {{a number of}} features which are either new or improve upon former technology in their sales literature. The benefit of <b>DAB</b> is that due {{to the use of}} multiplexing technology and encoding technology, broadcasters including the BBC and EMAP have been able to launch exclusive digital radio stations alongside their existing analogue radio stations. Broadcasters also state that <b>DAB</b> offers better reception, without the problems of interference that are more noticeable through analogue radio. <b>DAB</b> radios also come with features such as station lists, so listeners do not need to retune their receivers, as well as scrolling text, providing information such as breaking news, travel information or the latest track information.|$|E
5|$|The BBC's {{national}} <b>DAB</b> ensemble broadcasts on {{frequency block}} 12B (225.648 MHz) across the United Kingdom, with coverage currently at 96.4%. The multiplex is {{owned and operated}} by the BBC and is transmitted from a number of transmitter sites across the country. The BBC's national multiplex carries only BBC national radio stations. Local BBC radio stations are carried on the relevant local <b>DAB</b> ensemble where commercial <b>DAB</b> licences are operating.|$|E
50|$|Jay {{makes it}} clear that the others must not see Sam's face when the murder happens. <b>Dabs</b> tells Henry about the plan. Not willing to kill a man, Henry tells <b>Dabs</b> not to go through with it. A scuffle happens and <b>Dabs</b> hits Henry over the head with a brick. Later, <b>Dabs</b> and Blammy meet Omen and tell him about the job. Omen agrees after <b>Dabs</b> lies and says that the target was the one who hurt Henry. Sam and Lexi meet and Sam learns that she was gang raped years ago, which led her into drug {{addiction}} because as they are having sex she pushes him away. As he gets up she sees various scars on his back and it is revealed they were given to him by Trife's uncle as revenge and when Lexi touches them he leaves in anger. Jay meets with Mooney and his girlfriend in a café and tells Robert that he could have prevented Trife's death, convincing him to help Jay track down Sam. But shortly afterwards, Robert tells Jay that he needs to move on.|$|R

5|$|A future {{roll-out}} {{of small}} scale <b>DAB</b> multiplexes would be performed {{with a number}} of <b>DAB</b> frequency blocks, subject to business users migrating away from those frequencies and also subject to Parliamentary approval through the Broadcasting (Radio Multiplex Services) Bill 2016-17 which gained royal assent on April 27, 2017. This should allow at least one multiplex {{in most parts of the}} UK.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Digital Economy Act 2010 which gained Royal Assent {{and became}} law on 8 April. 2010, some <b>DAB</b> {{ensembles}} will be reorganised and merged. As a result, local ensembles waited for both the act to commence on 12 June 2010 and {{a report on the}} planning of <b>DAB</b> coverage and frequencies across the UK, with the final publication made to Government on 1 May 2012 before going ahead with announcements on the launch of additional local ensembles.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, GMG Radio {{requested}} that Ofcom remove the 45-hour jazz commitment for its London and Manchester stations. The company planned to relaunch Jazz FM from the jazzfm.com service which broadcast on <b>DAB</b> in Glasgow, online {{and on a}} <b>DAB</b> multiplex in London. In a meeting on 22 April 2008, Ofcom declined the request. GMG relaunched Jazz FM despite having to retain the jazz commitment.|$|E

5|$|From 2010 to 2014, Smooth Radio was an independent, commercial, {{national}} {{radio station in}} the United Kingdom. Owned by Real and Smootha company formerly known as GMG Radiothe station was aimed at the over-40 demographic, and competed for its audience with BBC Radio 2. It was broadcast on the <b>DAB</b> Digital Radio Digital 1 national multiplex, Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media, online and on regional FM and <b>DAB</b> frequencies in the North West, London, North East, West Midlands, Scotland and East Midlands. Nationally the station attracted a weekly average audience of 3 million.|$|E

5|$|After John Myers' {{recommendations}} of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio were published, and the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and to broadcast on national <b>DAB</b> was passed, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi-national station, and local news feeds were produced from GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. GMG Radio announced on 29 June 2010 that {{it wanted to}} compete with BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital One multiplex on <b>DAB</b> to the whole of England and Wales, and Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media and online. Regional content would be kept; split news, travel and weather bulletins would be broadcast on the FM and regional <b>DAB</b> stations in the North East, North West, West Midlands and East Midlands. Listeners in London and those tuning to the national output would hear national information. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland would keep its local breakfast and drivetime programmes because of the rules governing its broadcast licence, but networked content would be broadcast {{the rest of the}} time. The jazz commitments for London and the North West were also ended. The new Smooth Radio was launched on 4 October 2010 with most of the output originating from Salford Quays, and other programming coming from London.|$|E
