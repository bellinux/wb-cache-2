5|$|After the I-40 bridge disaster, {{parts of}} State Highway 9 in eastern Oklahoma {{served as an}} {{emergency}} detour for <b>eastbound</b> I-40 traffic. All <b>eastbound</b> traffic was routed along the section of SH-9 between SH-2 in Whitefield and US-59. In addition, the section of SH-9 between US-59 and the Arkansas state line were used for <b>eastbound</b> traffic for commercial trucks.|$|E
5|$|Highway403 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with Highway401 {{on the outskirts}} of Woodstock. The <b>eastbound</b> lanes split from <b>eastbound</b> Highway401, whereas the westbound lanes merge into westbound Highway401.|$|E
5|$|<b>Eastbound</b> :A30 East Street— To Yeovil and Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|<b>Eastbound,</b> {{the train}} {{departed}} Washington at 3:45p.m. as train #28, arriving at Jersey City 7:40p.m.|$|E
5|$|Kitsap Fast Ferries {{charges a}} $2 <b>eastbound</b> fare and $10 {{westbound}} fare, offering monthly passes and PugetPasses for frequent passengers; reduced fare passengers are charged a $1 <b>eastbound</b> fare and $5 westbound fare. The regional ORCA card is accepted to pay one-way fares, along with exact cash and tokens.|$|E
5|$|Most weekend SLE trains {{also run}} local {{westbound}} in the morning, then express in the afternoon, stopping only at Guilford and Westbrook between Old Saybrook and State Street. <b>Eastbound</b> service is reversed. This is because Branford, Madison, and Clinton only have platforms on the <b>eastbound</b> track, and thus switching {{is needed to}} platform a westbound train.|$|E
5|$|Route 495 officially {{begins at}} the exit 16E off-ramp from the {{northbound}} lanes of the New Jersey Turnpike near the boundary of Secaucus and North Bergen. The main roadway heads east through North Bergen as a freeway with three lanes in the <b>eastbound</b> and westbound directions, maintained by the NJTA. The route has an interchange with Route 3, with access to <b>eastbound</b> Route 3 and U.S. Route 1/9 (US1/9) for traffic in the <b>eastbound</b> direction and to westbound Route 3 in the westbound direction. Past this interchange, Route 495 becomes a six-lane freeway maintained by NJDOT that intersects US1/9 at a partial interchange, with a westbound exit and <b>eastbound</b> entrance. Past US1/9, the freeway has an interchange with County Route 501 (CR501, John F. Kennedy Boulevard), which uses 30th Street and 31st Street as collector–distributor roads. East of this junction, Route 495 enters Union City and heads through developed residential areas, passing under numerous streets. There is an <b>eastbound</b> exit and westbound entrance for Park Avenue, which provides access to Weehawken and Hoboken, where Route 495 becomes maintained by the PANYNJ. It enters Weehawken and comes to a westbound exit and <b>eastbound</b> entrance for Park Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The bridges along {{westbound}} I-270 over Washington Street {{were replaced}} and {{finished in the}} late 1990s, costing $12million. By the end of 1998, the bridges over Clear Creek near the I-76 interchange were completed. In February 2000, a connection between westbound I-270 and westbound US36 was completed, as was access between I-76 westbound and I-270 westbound. The <b>eastbound</b> section between US36 and I-76, including new bridges over Washington Street and Clear Creek, was completed in March 2002 and totaled $8.5million. Three years later, a flyover ramp was constructed connecting I-25 southbound to I-270 <b>eastbound.</b> However, access between I-270 <b>eastbound</b> and I-76 westbound still does not exist.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>eastbound</b> Pony Express trip left San Francisco, California, on April 3, 1860 {{and arrived}} at its {{destination}} ten days later in St. Joseph, Missouri. From St. Joseph, letters {{were placed in the}} U.S. mails for delivery to eastern destinations. There are only two letters known to exist from the inaugural <b>eastbound</b> trip from San Francisco to St. Joseph.|$|E
5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with left-hand entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been completed, with the ramp from northbound I-95 to <b>eastbound</b> I-695 completed in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from <b>eastbound</b> I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and <b>eastbound</b> I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from <b>eastbound</b> I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will also add four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|E
5|$|By 1994, {{the final}} {{at-grade}} intersections—one at Morning Star Drive, and another as {{a left turn}} to the southbound lanes with <b>eastbound</b> Highway409—were replaced, making Highway427 a fully controlled-access freeway for its entire length.|$|E
5|$|East of Middletown, US40Alternate {{passes through}} a {{suburban}} area then begins to ascend Braddock Mountain. The highway gains a climbing lane <b>eastbound</b> {{to the top of}} the mountain, which contains the community of Braddock Heights. On the descent of Braddock Mountain, US40Alternate expands to a four-lane road, with one lane <b>eastbound,</b> two lanes westbound, and a center turn lane. At the base of the mountain, the alternate route temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway through its half-diamond interchange with I-70, which has ramps to and from the direction of Frederick. East of I-70, US40Alternate reduces to two lanes and passes the Highland Lodge. The alternate route reaches its eastern terminus at a partial intersection with US40 (Patrick Street) at the western edge of Frederick and the Frederick Golden Mile, a heavily commercialized area east to US15 (Frederick Freeway). There is no direct access from <b>eastbound</b> US40Alternate to westbound US40 or from <b>eastbound</b> US40 to the westbound alternate route; those movements are made by using Old Camp Road.|$|E
5|$|East of Washington Street and Saginaw Road, {{the highway}} {{transitions}} from one-way streets to a freeway; the transition between the <b>eastbound</b> freeway and Patrick Road {{passes through a}} roundabout in the Saginaw Road interchange. As the freeway continues eastward, there is a partial interchange for Waldo Road, and then the highway crosses into the section of Midland that is located in Bay County. Immediately east of the county line, Bus. US10 and M-20 jointly terminate at a directional interchange with US10; traffic on the <b>eastbound</b> business loop defaults onto <b>eastbound</b> US10, and traffic on the westbound business loop originates on westbound US10. According to the Michigan Department of Transportation, the agency which maintains the roadway, between 7,317 and 23,733vehicles per day used the business loop on average daily in 2013. The section of Bus. US10 that runs concurrently with M-20 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Howell Road {{was never}} given access from Route 33 <b>eastbound</b> {{and thus the}} ramp still remains barricaded off, slowly decaying.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, {{a single}} morning rush-hour round trip branded SLExpress was {{extended}} to Stamford, with a stop at Bridgeport plus eastbound-only stops at Stratford and Milford. An evening <b>eastbound</b> trip was also extended to Stamford with only the Bridgeport intermediate stop. This trip was intended to allow commuters to reach employment centers in Bridgeport and Stamford without having to make a transfer at New Haven. On June 24, 2002, additional Stamford trains were added, {{for a total of}} two westbound and three <b>eastbound</b> trains. When West Haven opened in August 2013, it was added to these trips as well.|$|E
5|$|In May 1905, {{after two}} years of negotiations, American-Hawaiian signed a {{contract}} with the Tehuantepec National Railway of Mexico, abandoning the Straits of Magellan route in favor of the Tehuantepec Route. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for <b>eastbound</b> cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico's narrowest point, on the railroad. <b>Eastbound</b> shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a marked {{increase}} in passengers travelling to and from Parson Street. In the 2002/03 financial year, less than 4,000 passengers used the station; and in 2005, only six <b>eastbound</b> and eight westbound trains called at Parson Street each day, with 14,293 passengers using the station during the 2005/06 financial year. Since then, service levels have increased to 21 westbound trains and 18 <b>eastbound</b> per weekday, and passenger levels have more than quadrupled, to 102,654 in 2013/14.|$|E
5|$|MD7J is the {{unsigned}} designation for Industrial Park Road, {{a highway}} that connects MD7 with an exit ramp from <b>eastbound</b> MD43 in White Marsh.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were made}} to improve Route 3 near the Meadowlands Sports Complex with the {{construction}} of American Dream Meadowlands. An overpass between <b>eastbound</b> Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in May 2009 at a cost of $38.1 million, a flyover from southbound Route 120 to <b>eastbound</b> Route 3 was completed in early 2010 at a cost of $13 million, and improvements to the New Jersey Turnpike interchange was completed in the later part of 2010 at a cost of $49 million.|$|E
5|$|Route62 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with the off-ramp from U.S. Route 46 <b>eastbound</b> and Passaic County Route 646 {{in the community}} of Totowa. The highway heads northward along Union Boulevard, intersecting with the on-ramp from Route 62 to U.S. Route 46 <b>eastbound.</b> The route heads across a long bridge over the <b>eastbound</b> and westbound divided lanes of Route 46. After crossing the bridge, Route 62 heads into a small industrial part of Totowa, where it intersects with the off-ramp from the westbound lanes of Route 46. The highway continues northward, interchanging with Furler Street and Lackawanna Avenue on a partial cloverleaf. Route 62 continues along Union Boulevard, becoming a divided highway. The highway crosses over Interstate 80 at interchange 55A, where the route's designation terminates. The route continues into Paterson as County Route 646.|$|E
5|$|SR-202 {{serves as}} the <b>eastbound</b> ramp from SR-201 onto Interstate I-80, because at its {{intersection}} with I-80, the SR-201 (which is the southern terminus of SR-202) traffic only has the option to continue on I-80 westbound, and {{does not have an}} offramp to <b>eastbound</b> I-80. Traffic on SR-202 has increased 12% between 2002 and 2007, with a daily average of 735cars per day using SR-202 in 2007, compared to 475cars per day in 2002. Half of the traffic on SR-202 consists of buses and trucks.|$|E
5|$|Since 2014, <b>eastbound</b> tolls {{have been}} waived at the Egg Harbor toll plaza between 5:00 and 6:00 pm on the Friday before Memorial Day {{in order to}} promote the {{unofficial}} beginning of the summer tourist season at the Jersey Shore. Chickie's & Pete's, a local sports bar chain, pays for the tolls normally collected during this hour. In October 2014, <b>eastbound</b> tolls were waived at the Egg Harbor and Pleasantville toll plazas on Tuesdays between 12:00 pm and 12:00 am in order to encourage midweek tourism to Atlantic City.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvanian is the {{replacement}} of the former Keystone service between New York and Pittsburgh. Prior to Amtrak, the route was known as the Duquesne, named after Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh, and operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Duquesne had a long history, finally becoming a daily New YorkPittsburgh train on October 25, 1959, numbered 16 <b>eastbound</b> and 25 westbound. With the start of Amtrak operations on May 1, 1971, the Duquesne was renamed the Keystone and renumbered 42 westbound and 43 <b>eastbound</b> with the first Amtrak timetable on November 14, 1971. The Keystone was discontinued on April 30, 1972.|$|E
5|$|The commute from Zoloti Vorota to the line's {{terminus}} at Syrets takes approximately 9 {{minutes and}} 5 seconds, while it takes 30 minutes and 55 seconds to commute to the Chervony Khutir terminus. The train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 2–13 minutes in either direction. The morning's first <b>eastbound</b> train departs {{from the station}} at 05:48, while the westbound train departs at 06:01. The evening's last <b>eastbound</b> departs at 00:15, while the westbound train departs at 00:30.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of the Creek Turnpike {{has been recognized}} {{as important to the}} country's economy, defense, and mobility by its inclusion in the National Highway System. In 2011, the highest average annual daily traffic (AADT) count was 26,900 vehicles <b>eastbound</b> and 26,476 vehicles westbound between the Yale Avenue and Memorial Drive interchanges. The lowest AADT counts, 4,426 vehicles <b>eastbound</b> and 4,463 vehicles westbound, were recorded between the 11th Street interchange and the northeastern terminus. Law enforcement along the Creek Turnpike is provided by Oklahoma Highway Patrol Troop XE, a special troop assigned to the turnpike.|$|E

5|$|When Kentuckian began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for <b>eastbound</b> cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for {{westbound}} cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. <b>Eastbound</b> shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. Kentuckian sailed in this service {{but it is}} not clear from sources whether on the east or west side of North America.|$|E
5|$|When Montanan began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa.

5|$|With the {{construction}} of American Dream Meadowlands, several improvements are taking place to Route 120. The interchange with Route 3 is being reconstructed with an overpass between <b>eastbound</b> Route 3 and northbound Route 120 that was completed in May 2009 {{at a cost of}} $38.1 million. Also, a flyover from southbound Route 120 to <b>eastbound</b> Route 3 was completed in early 2010 at a cost of $13 million.|$|E
5|$|A month later, an {{environmental}} {{study was conducted}} {{that focused on the}} possibilities of rerouting the proposed freeway. In April 1972, the majority of voters supported a referendum that halted plans to build the SR78 freeway through the city of Escondido. The city then turned its focus to widening Lincoln Avenue and Ash Street instead, and also requested that the routing of SR78 be moved to Broadway, Washington Avenue, and Ash Street from Grand Avenue to improve traffic flow. Five years later, signs were installed on <b>eastbound</b> SR78, directing traffic headed for the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to use I-15 south to Via Rancho Parkway instead of continuing <b>eastbound,</b> to bypass the Escondido traffic.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} Matchette Road, where ramps {{provide access}} {{to and from the}} <b>eastbound</b> and westbound lanes of the expressway, respectively, the opposing lanes of the expressway split to the south of Malden Park. The <b>eastbound</b> lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway, sandwiching it between the E. C Row Expressway. Ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area.|$|E
5|$|At Bruceton Mills, WV73 {{ended at}} WV26, which from there runs {{northeast}} into Pennsylvania, becoming Pennsylvania Route281 {{at the state}} line and meeting US40 north of the border. From there <b>eastbound</b> traffic would follow US40 into Maryland. I-68 now parallels US40 through western Maryland.|$|E
5|$|At the intersections with Oak Street (<b>eastbound)</b> and Griswold Street (<b>eastbound),</b> BL I-69 merges in {{from those}} two one-way streets. BL I-69/BL I-94 {{continues}} northward along Military Street through downtown Port Huron. The business loop crosses the Black River near its mouth. North of the river. the business loop follows Huron Avenue through the northern side of downtown Port Huron. At the intersection with Glenwood Avenue, BL I-69/BL I-94 turns northwesterly onto Pine Grove Avenue through a residential {{area on the}} northern side of the city. The street has five lanes (two in each direction plus a center turn lane). The business loop passes under I-94/I-69 at the toll and customs plazas for the Blue Water Bridge. There is a partial interchange to connect the business loop {{to and from the}} <b>eastbound</b> direction of the freeway and the toll plaza. North of the freeway crossing, the business loop intersects the southern end of M-25 and turns westward onto Hancock Street for two blocks. Then it turns southward along a connector freeway to terminate at an interchange with westbound I-94/I-69.|$|E
