40|$|The {{multistage}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separator</b> for purifying {{cells and}} magnetic particles (MAGSEP) is a laboratory apparatus for separating and/or purifying particles (especially biological cells) {{on the basis}} of their magnetic susceptibility and magnetophoretic mobility. Whereas a typical prior apparatus based on similar principles offers only a single stage of separation, the MAGSEP, as its full name indicates, offers multiple stages of separation; this makes it possible to refine a sample population of particles to a higher level of purity or to categorize multiple portions of the sample {{on the basis of}} magnetic susceptibility and/or magnetophoretic mobility. The MAGSEP includes a processing unit and an electronic unit coupled to a personal computer. The processing unit includes upper and lower plates, a plate-rotation system, an electromagnet, an electromagnet-translation system, and a capture-magnet assembly. The plates are bolted together through a roller bearing that allows the plates to rotate with respect to each other. An interface between the plates acts as a seal for separating fluids. A lower cuvette can be aligned with as many as 15 upper cuvette stations for fraction collection during processing. A two-phase stepping motor drives the rotation system, causing the upper plate to rotate for the collection of each fraction of the sample material. The electromagnet generates a magnetic field across the lower cuvette, while the translation system translates the electromagnet upward along the lower cuvette. The current supplied to the electromagnet, and thus the magnetic flux density at the pole face of the electromagnet, can be set at a programmed value between 0 and 1, 400 gauss (0. 14 T). The rate of translation can be programmed between 5 and 2, 000 m/s so as to align all sample particles in the same position in the cuvette. The capture magnet can be a permanent magnet. It is mounted on an arm connected to a stepping motor. The stepping motor rotates the arm to position the capture magnet above the upper cuvette into which a fraction of the sample is collected. The electronic unit includes a power switch, power-supply circuitry that accepts 110 -Vac input power, an RS- 232 interface, and status lights. The personal computer runs the MAGSEP software and controls the operation of the MAGSEP through the RS- 232 interface.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to design and build an {{equipment}} which can detect ferrous and non-ferrous objects in conveyed commodities, discriminate between them and locate the object along the belt and on {{the width of the}} belt. The magnetic induction mechanism was used as a means of achieving the objectives of this research. In order to choose the appropriate geometry and size of the induction field source, the field distributions of different source geometries and sizes were studied in detail. From these investigations it was found the square loop geometry is the most appropriate as a field generating source {{for the purpose of this}} project. The phenomena of field distribution in the conductors was also investigated. An equipment was designed and built at the preliminary stages of thework based on a flux-gate magnetometer with the ability to detect only ferrous objects. The instrument was designed such that it could be used to detect ferrous objects in the coal conveyors of power stations.

40|$|Laser Isotope Enrichment for Medical and Industrial Applications by Jeff Eerkens (University of Missouri), Jay Kunze (Idaho State University), and Leonard Bond (Idaho National Laboratory) The {{principal}} isotope enrichment {{business in}} the world is the enrichment of uranium for commercial power reactor fuels. However, {{there are a number of}} other needs for separated isotopes. Some examples are: 1) Pure isotopic targets for irradiation to produce medical radioisotopes. 2) Pure isotopes for semiconductors. 3) Low neutron capture isotopes for various uses in nuclear reactors. 4) Isotopes for industrial tracer/identification applications. Examples of interest to medicine are targets to produce radio-isotopes such as S- 33, Mo- 98, Mo- 100, W- 186, Sn- 112; while for MRI diagnostics, the non-radioactive Xe- 129 isotope is wanted. For super-semiconductor applications some desired industrial isotopes are Si- 28, Ga- 69, Ge- 74, Se- 80, Te- 128, etc. An example of a low cross section isotope for use in reactors is Zn- 68 as a corrosion inhibitor material in nuclear reactor primary systems. Neutron activation of Ar isotopes is of interest in industrial tracer and diagnostic applications (e. g. oil-logging).. In the past few years there has been a sufficient supply of isotopes in common demand, because of huge Russian stockpiles produced with old <b>electromagnetic</b> and centrifuge <b>separators</b> previously used for uranium enrichment. Production of specialized isotopes in the USA has been largely accomplished using old ”calutrons” (<b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separators)</b> at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. These methods of separating isotopes are rather energy inefficient. Use of lasers for isotope separation has been considered for many decades. None of the proposed methods have attained sufficient proof of principal status to be economically attractive to pursue commercially. Some of the authors have succeeded in separating sulfur isotopes using a rather new and different method, known as condensation repression. In this scheme a gas, of the selected isotopes for enrichment, is irradiated with a laser at a particular wavelength that would excite only one of the isotopes. The entire gas is subject to low temperatures sufficient to cause condensation on a cold surface. Those molecules in the gas that the laser excited are not as likely to condense as are the unexcited molecules. Hence the gas drawn out of the system will be enriched in the isotope that was excited by the laser. We have evaluated the relative energy required in this process if applied on a commercial scale. We estimate the energy required for laser isotope enrichment is about 20 % of that required in centrifuge separations, and 2 % of that required by use of &# 34;calutrons&# 34;...|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} element 114 to be {{described}} presently {{was based on a}} series of enrichments with the goal of improving upon the detection limit by several orders of magnitude relative to earlier efforts. The samples studied were taken from a lead ore with an age of about 1. 3 · 10 ^ 9 years and, {{on the basis of the}} physicochemical properties predicted for eka-lead, were selectively enriched through vaporization during the processing of the ore, coprecipitation and counter-current electrophoresis, resulting in an estimated chemical enrichment factor of from 2 to 3 · 10 ^ 8. In order to be able to detect the concentrations of 10 ^- 21 to 10 ^- 19 atoms of eka-lead per atom of lead expected from the assumption of halflives of a few times 10 ^ 7 to about 10 ^ 8 years for the isotopes which could conceivably have survived in nature, a further physical enrichment was undertaken with the help of the Jülich high performance <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separator.</b> For this step, the positions of the individual mass lines on the mass separator targets were first determined by using PbSe (masses 278 and 280 to 290). Synthetic quartz glass was used as the target material. The separation efficiency was determined radiometrically in simulation experiments with ^ 197 Hg. The quartz plates used as targets for the separation of the lead samples were subsequently subjected to a thermal neutron flux of about 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2 i n a high-flux reactor and the resulting fission tracks counted under an optical microscope. The background due to fissionable impurities in the quartz (< 10 ^- 13 atoms per SiO_ 2 molecule) and that due to the use of the mass separator were studied in preliminary experiments. The possible escape of the presumably volatile element 114 from the fission track detectors during irradiation as a result of nuclear γ-heating was also investigated in simulation experiments. The diffusion behavior of carrier-free ^ 203 Hg implanted into quartz plates in the mass separator, as determined by a radiometric analysis, showed that the expected losses are negligible below 200 °C. The counting results from the fission track detectors gave a maximum value of 5. 1 · 10 ^- 22 barns for the product of the fission cross section σ_f and the number of eka-lead atoms per lead carrier atom. In order to be able to make an estimate of the absolute concentration limits, the fission cross sections of eka-lead for thermal neutrons were approximated using an extrapolation method [104]. With the assumption of these approximated fission cross sections, the following upper limits were placed on the concentration: 295 _ 114 : 8 · 10 ^- 24 atoms per atom lead, assuming σ_f = 70 barns; 297 _ 114 : 3 · 10 ^- 22 atoms per atom lead, assuming σ_f = 2 barns; 298 _ 114 : 1 · 10 ^- 19 atoms per atom lead, assuming σ_f = 4 mbarns. Assuming that no fundamental errors were made in the prediction of the chemical properties and in the selection of the samples and the enrichment processes undertaken, the upper limit for the concentration has been lowered by means of the methods chosen in this work by 3. 3 to 8. 4 orders of magnitude,relative to the values determined in earlier work...|$|R
