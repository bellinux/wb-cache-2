40|$|Limited {{spacecraft}} communication links {{call for}} users {{to investigate the}} potential use of video compression and multimedia technologies to optimize bandwidth allocations. The objective {{was to determine the}} transmission characteristics of multimedia data - motion video, text or bitmap graphics, and files transmitted independently and simultaneously over an ethernet local area network. Commercial desktop video teleconferencing hardware and software and Intel's proprietary <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Interactive</b> (<b>DVI)</b> video compression algorithm were used, and typical task scenarios were selected. The transmission time, packet size, number of packets, and network utilization of the data were recorded. Each data type - compressed motion video, text and/or bitmapped graphics, and a compressed image file - was first transmitted independently and its characteristics recorded. The results showed that an average bandwidth of 7. 4 kilobits per second (kbps) was used to transmit graphics; an average bandwidth of 86. 8 kbps was used to transmit an 18. 9 -kilobyte (kB) image file; a bandwidth of 728. 9 kbps was used to transmit compressed motion video at 15 frames per second (fps); and a bandwidth of 75. 9 kbps was used to transmit compressed motion video at 1. 5 fps. Average packet sizes were 933 bytes for graphics, 498. 5 bytes for the image file, 345. 8 bytes for motion video at 15 fps, and 341. 9 bytes for motion video at 1. 5 fps. Simultaneous transmission of multimedia data types was also characterized. The multimedia packets used transmission bandwidths of 341. 4 kbps and 105. 8 kbps. Bandwidth utilization varied according to the frame rate (frames per second) setting for the transmission of motion video. Packet size did not vary significantly between the data types. When these characteristics are applied to Space Station Freedom (SSF), the packet sizes fall within the maximum specified by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). The uplink of imagery to SSF may be performed at minimal frame rates and/or within seconds of delay, depending on the user's allocated bandwidth. Further research to identify the acceptable delay interval and its impact on human performance is required. Additional studies in network performance using various video compression algorithms and integrated multimedia techniques are needed to determine the optimal design approach for utilizing SSF's data communications system...|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of the networks and multimedia has been a popular research subject in the recent year. This paper presents our approaches to developing a point-to-point video conference system, VICO, based on the personal computer environments. The compression techniques adopted in the VICO system {{is based on the}} Intel's <b>DVI</b> technology （ <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Interactive</b> ）. The network transmission is based on FDDI and Ethernet networks. A number of Windows programming techniques are adopted. In particular, Winsock API techniques are utilized for system development to increase the system portability. VICO system is designed to include a system kernel module and several other modules, each of which is developed for the corresponding functionality. The video and audio module and the network module are used to deliver the text, graphics, audio and video data. The file transfer module and the whiteboard module enables the copy-and-paste data to be transferred in between systems and application programs. A comprehensive user interface is provided by the user interface module allowing system menu to be operated through the push-down buttons, and network games can be played concurrently between the two ends. The performance of the VICO system is in a moderate level when using 30 frames per second with 256 × 240 resolutions for each frame in a FDDI network. The development of the VICO system has demonstrated that our approach is feasible to develop a point-to-point video conference system based on the personal computer environments. 網路多媒體應用中，視訊會議系統的發展是近年來普遍的研究主題。本篇論文主 要論述在個人電腦上發展一套點對點的視訊會議系統 VICO 所使用的方法與技術。 VICO 利 用 <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Interactive</b> 即時影像壓縮技術。 系統以模組化方式發展並採用 Winsock 網路應用程式介面。系統主要是由一個系統核心單元和五個子系統所組成。視訊音 訊子系統、網路子系統提供視訊、音訊資料之傳送與顯示。檔案傳送子系統與電子白板子系 統促使雙方使用者能同時在線上討論問題並交換訊息。此外系統內剪貼功能，更可和其他的 應用軟體交換圖形、文字資料，以提昇視訊會議之效能。人機介面子系統則提供適合的介面 來操作所有的系統功能。 VICO 系統經測試結果顯示，在 FDDI 網路和 Ethernet 網路上， 以每秒 30 張圖框，解析度為 256 × 240 大小之視窗來播放視訊與音訊時，系統之整體操 作反應略嫌遲鈍。經分析影響系統效能之因素有三項，分別為受限於網路頻寬之不足；受到 即時壓縮卡之硬體限制；程式尚未最佳化。 本文之結論為利用 DVI 壓縮技術和適切的技術 、技巧， 可以在以 PC 為基礎之 FDDI 與 Ethernet 網路發展一套點對點的視訊會議系統 。 VICO 系統發展過程中之經驗、技術與技巧可供爾後發展多人視訊會議系統之參酌...|$|R
