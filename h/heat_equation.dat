In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the <b>heat</b> <b>equation.</b> A discrete version of the Fourier series {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT {{is one of the key}} tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the micromorphic approach, {{previously}} {{developed in}} the mechanical context is applied to heat transfer and shown to deliver new generalized <b>heat</b> <b>equations</b> {{as well as the}} nonlocal effects. The latter are compared to existing formulations: the classical Fourier heat conduction, the hyperbolic type with relaxation time, the gradient of temperature or entropy theories, the double temperature model, the micro-temperature model or micro-entropy models. A new pair of thermodynamically-consistent micromorphic <b>heat</b> <b>equations</b> are derived from appropriate Helmholtz-free energy potentials depending on an additional micromorphic temperature and its first gradient. The additional micromorphic temperature associated with the classical local temperature is introduced as an independent degree of freedom, based on the generalized principle of virtual power. This leads to a new thermal balance equation taking into account the nonlocal thermal effects and involving an internal length scale which represents the characteristic size of the system. Several existing extended generalized <b>heat</b> <b>equations</b> could be retrieved from constrained micromorphic <b>heat</b> <b>equations</b> with suitable selections of the Helmholtz-free energy and heat flux expressions. As an example the propagation of plane thermal waves is investigated according to the various generalized <b>heat</b> <b>equations.</b> Possible applications to fast surface processes, nanostructured media and nanosystems are also discussed...|$|R
