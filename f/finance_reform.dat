The rivalry between Jones and Wilkinson had become so strong that Wilkinson's wife Martha was among Jones' challengers in the Democratic primary; she ended her candidacy 18days before the primary. Advocating campaign <b>finance</b> <b>reform,</b> Jones garnered 184,703 votes in the primary, enough to best a field including Scotty Baesler (149,352 votes), Dr. Floyd Poore (132,060 votes), and Gatewood Galbraith (25,834).|$|E

5|$|The scandal was {{followed}} by a number of attempts to adopt campaign finance reform—spearheaded by U.S. Sen. David Boren (D-OK)—but most attempts died in committee. A weakened reform was passed in 1993. Substantial campaign <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> was not passed until the adoption of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. Bennett would later write that the Keating Five investigation did make a difference, as members of Congress were afterward far less likely to intercede with federal investigations on behalf of contributors.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe Ethiopian {{health care}} system is under {{tremendous}} reform. One of the issues high on the agenda is health care financing. In an effort to protect citizens from catastrophic effects of the clearly high share of out-of-pocket expenditure, the government is currently working to introduce health insurance. ObjectiveThis article aims to highlight the components of the Ethiopian health care <b>financing</b> <b>reform</b> and discuss its implications on access to essential medicines. MethodsA desk review of government policy documents and proclamations was done. Moreover, a review of the scientific literature was done via PubMed and search of other local journals not indexed in PubMed. ResultsRevenue retention by health facilities, systematizing the fee waiver system, standardizing exemption services, outsourcing of nonclinical services, user fee setting and revision, initiation of compulsory health insurance (community-based health insurance and social health insurance), establishment of a private wing in public hospitals, and health facility autonomy were the main components of the health care <b>financing</b> <b>reform</b> in Ethiopia. Although limited, the evidence shows that there is increased health care utilization, access to medicines, and quality of services {{as a result of the}} reforms. ConclusionsEncouraging progress has been made in the implementation of health care <b>financing</b> <b>reforms</b> in Ethiopia. However, there is shortage of evidence on the effect of the health care <b>financing</b> <b>reforms</b> on access to essential medicines in the country. Thus, a clear need exists for well-organized research on the issue...|$|R
5|$|While {{generally}} {{adhering to}} American conservatism, McCain established {{a reputation as}} a political maverick for his willingness to defy Republican orthodoxy on several issues. In reaction to his Keating Five experience, he made campaign <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> one of his signature concerns. He was also a leader in normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam. His national visibility as a senator gave him the basis to begin a campaign for the 2000 Republican nomination for President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} {{of his term}} as lieutenant governor in 1995, Patton announced his candidacy for governor. The 1995 gubernatorial election was novel in several ways, following a 1992 constitutional amendment. It was the first election in Kentucky history in which the governor and lieutenant governor were elected as a ticket. Another new provision stated that if no candidate received at least 40percent {{of the vote in}} his or her party's primary, a runoff election would occur between the top two candidates. Most significantly, {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history the winners of each race would be allowed to succeed themselves in office and serve another term. Also, as a result of campaign <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> passed under Governor Jones, candidates would receive public campaign financing and would have their campaign spending capped, negating the advantage of wealthy candidates.|$|E
5|$|In November 1998, McCain won {{re-election}} {{to a third}} Senate term; he {{prevailed in}} a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger. In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} counts, saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office. In March 1999, McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction. Later in 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign <b>finance</b> <b>reform,</b> although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture.|$|E

5|$|In late April, Brown {{still held}} a 20 {{percentage}} point lead {{in public opinion}} polling. However, as Beshear began to slip in the polls, Wilkinson moved up. By Memorial Day weekend, he was polling second among the candidates. Brown largely ignored Wilkinson until {{a week before the}} election, when he began running ads questioning the amount of money Wilkinson claimed would be generated by a state lottery. Wilkinson won the primary, garnering 36 percent of the vote to 26 percent for Brown, 18 percent for Beshear, 12 percent for Stumbo, and 6 percent for Carroll. In total, Wilkinson spent a record $4 million during the primary campaign. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark opined that Wilkinson's lavish spending during the campaign prompted the legislature to adopt campaign <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> measures.|$|E
5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E
5|$|During an {{unsuccessful}} senatorial bid in 1914, Stanley assumed an anti-prohibition stance. This issue would dominate {{his political career}} {{for more than a}} decade and put him at odds with J. C. W. Beckham, the leader of the pro-temperance faction of the state's Democratic Party. In 1915, Stanley ran for governor, defeating his close friend Edwin P. Morrow by just over 400 votes. It was the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history. Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's administration the apex of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. Among the reforms adopted during his tenure were a state antitrust law, a campaign <b>finance</b> <b>reform</b> law, and a workman's compensation law. In 1918, Stanley was chosen as the Democratic nominee to succeed the recently deceased senator Ollie M. James. Stanley was elected, but did not resign as governor to take the seat until May 1919 and accomplished little in his single term. He lost his re-election bid to Frederic M. Sackett in the 1924 Republican landslide and never again held elected office. He died in Washington, D.C. on August 12, 1958.|$|E

40|$|<b>Financing</b> <b>reforms</b> of China's {{public health}} {{services}} are characterised by a reduction in government budgetary support {{and the introduction of}} charges. These reforms have changed the financing structure of public health institutions. Before the <b>financing</b> <b>reforms,</b> in 1980, government budgetary support covered the full costs of public health institutions, while after the reforms {{by the middle of the}} 1990 s, the government's contribution to the institutions' revenue had fallen to 30 - 50 %, barely covering the salaries of health workers, and the share of revenue generated from charges had increased to 50 - 70 %. These market-oriented <b>financing</b> <b>reforms</b> improved the productivity of public health institutions, but several unintended consequences became evident. The economic incentives that were built into the financing system led to over-provision of unnecessary services, and under-provision of socially desirable services. User fees reduced the take-up of preventive services with positive externalities. The lack of government funds resulted in under-provision of services with public goods' characteristics. The Chinese experience has generated important lessons for other nations. Firstly, a decline in the role of government in financing {{public health services}} is likely to result in decreased overall efficiency of the health sector. Secondly, levying charges for public health services can reduce demand for these services and increase the risk of disease transmission. Thirdly, market-oriented <b>financing</b> <b>reforms</b> of public health services should not be considered as a policy option. Once this step is made, the unintended consequences may outweigh the intended ones. Chinese experience strongly suggests that the government should take a very active role in financing public health services. User fees Government budget Public health services China...|$|R

40|$|Equality and {{efficiency}} are key issues in educational reform. Here the authors analyze {{the efficiency and}} equality consequences of various school <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> using a cost-indirect output distance function. This function readily models multiple-output production under conditions of budgetary constraint, and provides a natural measure of performance that {{is closely related to}} Farrell-type measures of efficiency. The analysis suggests that despite school district inefficiency, <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> can affect student achievement. However, any potential gains in output from redistribution are dwarfed by the potential gains from increased efficiency. More strikingly, the analysis demonstrates that budgetary reforms designed to equalize expenditures could actually increase the inequality of student achievement. © 1997 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

40|$|Many {{states are}} {{considering}} school <b>finance</b> <b>reforms</b> aimed at lessening inequality {{in the provision}} of public education across communities.

This paper constructs a dynamic general equilibrium model of public education provision, calibrates it using US data, and examines the quantitative effects of a major school <b>finance</b> <b>reforms.</b> The policy reform we analyze is one in which all funding is done at the federal level (instead of substantially at the local level as is now the case). We find that this policy increases average income, intergenerational income mobility, and total spending on education as a fraction of income. Moreover, there are large welfare gains associated with this policy: we find that steady-state welfare increases by 7 t of steady-state income. JEL #: 122,H 42 1...|$|R
