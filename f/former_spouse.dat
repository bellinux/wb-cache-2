5|$|In Edward's lifetime, the Church of England {{disapproved of}} {{divorced}} people remarrying in church while a <b>former</b> <b>spouse</b> was still living. The monarch {{was required to}} be in communion with the Church of England, and was its nominal head or Supreme Governor. If Edward married Wallis Simpson, a divorcee who would soon have two living ex-husbands, in a civil ceremony, it would directly conflict with Church teaching and {{his role as the}} Church's ex officio head.|$|E
5|$|Edward became king on his father's {{death in}} early 1936. However, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among {{politicians}} by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing marriage to Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced {{her first husband}} and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing that a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the Church of England, {{which at the time}} disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a <b>former</b> <b>spouse</b> was still alive. Edward knew that the British government, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would ruin his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch. When it became apparent that he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, Edward abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George VI. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history.|$|E

Exceptions include if the divorce occurred prior to an applicant's conversion or for [...] "scriptural causes" [...] {{such as a}} former spouse's marital unfaithfulness or the abandonment of a Christian by a non-Christian partner (see Pauline privilege). The Executive Presbytery has authority to issue ecclesiastical annulments in cases involving conditions that prevent [...] "the creation of a valid marriage union", such as fraud. Clergy are also barred from membership in secret societies.|$|E
500|$|The monarch of the United Kingdom is Supreme Governor of the Church of England—at {{the time}} of the {{proposed}} marriage, and until 2002, the Church of England disapproved of, and would not perform, the remarriage of divorced people if their <b>former</b> <b>spouse</b> was still alive. Constitutionally, the King was required to be in communion with the Church of England, but his proposed marriage conflicted with the Church's teachings. Additionally, at the time both the Church and English law only recognised adultery as a legitimate ground for divorce. [...] Since she had divorced her first husband on grounds of [...] "mutual incompatibility", there was a possibility that her second marriage, as well as her prospective marriage to Edward, would be considered bigamous if her first divorce had been challenged in court.|$|E
500|$|Initially Wihtred ruled {{alongside}} Swæfheard.

[...] It appears that by 694 Wihtred was the sole ruler of Kent, though {{it may also be}} that his son Æthelberht was a junior king in west Kent during Wihtred's reign. Wihtred is thought to have had three wives. His first was called Cynegyth, but a charter of 696 names Æthelburh as the royal consort and co-donor of an estate: the <b>former</b> <b>spouse</b> must have died or been dismissed after a short time.

500|$|The {{popularity}} of City Lights endured, with the film's re-release in 1950 again positively received by audiences and critics. In 1949, the critic James Agee wrote in Life magazine, {{that the final}} scene was the [...] "greatest single piece of acting ever committed to celluloid." [...] Richard Meryman called the final scene {{one of the greatest}} moments in film history. Charles Silver, Curator of Film at the Museum of Modern Art, stated that the film is so highly regarded because it brought forth a new level of lyrical romanticism that had not appeared in Chaplin's earlier works. He adds that like all romanticism, it is based in the denial of the real world around it. When the film premiered, Chaplin was much older, he {{was in the midst of}} another round of legal battles with <b>former</b> <b>spouse</b> Lita Grey, and the economic and political climate of the world had changed. Chaplin uses the Girl's blindness to remind the Tramp of the precarious nature of romanticism in the real world, as she unknowingly assaults him multiple times. Film.com critic Eric D. Snider said that by 1931, most Hollywood filmmakers either embraced talking pictures, resigned themselves to their inevitability, or just gave up making movies, yet Chaplin held firm with his vision in this project. He also noted that few in Hollywood had the clout to make a silent film at that late date, let alone do it well. One reason was that Chaplin knew the Tramp could not be adapted to talking movies and still work.|$|E

2500|$|Rule {{violations}} are events, actions, {{and behaviors}} that violate an implicit or explicit relationship norm or rule.

[...] Implicit rules tend to be those that are accepted as cultural standards for proper relationship conduct (e.g., monogamy and secrets kept private). [...] The focus on relational transgressions as rule violations presents an opportunity to examine {{a wide range of}} behaviors across a variety of relationship types.

6000|$|The {{next morning}} the terrified widower carried a {{statement}} of his perplexity to Mr. Matthew Reid, the clergyman. This reverend person, besides being an excellent divine in other respects, was {{at the same time}} a man of sagacity, who understood the human passions. He did not attempt to combat the reality of the vision which had thrown his parishioner into this tribulation, but he contended it could be only an illusion of the devil. He explained to the widower that no created being could have the right or power to imprison or detain the soul of a Christian--conjured him not to believe that his wife was otherwise disposed of than according to God's pleasure--assured him that Protestant doctrine utterly denies the existence of any middle state in the world to come--and explained to him that he, as a clergyman of the Church of Scotland, neither could nor dared authorize opening graves or using the intervention of prayer to sanction rites of a suspicious character. The poor man, confounded and perplexed by various feelings, asked his pastor what he should do. [...] "I will give you my best advice," [...] said the clergyman. [...] "Get your new bride's consent to be married to-morrow, or to-day, if you can; I will take it on me to dispense with the rest of the banns, or proclaim them three times in one day. You will have a new wife, and, if you think of the former, it will be only as of one from whom death has separated you, and for whom you may have thoughts of affection and sorrow, but as a saint in Heaven, and not as a prisoner in Elfland." [...] The advice was taken, and the perplexed widower had no more visitations from his <b>former</b> <b>spouse.</b>|$|E
