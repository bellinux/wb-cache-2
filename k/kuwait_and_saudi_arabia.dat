25|$|By the 16th century, {{ports in}} the Persian Gulf {{and part of}} the {{population}} that today form the coastal Iraq, <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia,</b> came under the direct influence of the Ottoman Empire. At the same time, the Portuguese, English and Dutch colonial forces also appeared in the Persian Gulf region, with the entire northern coast remaining under Persian rule throughout. By the 17th century, the Bani Yas confederation was the dominant force in most of the area now known as Abu Dhabi.

25|$|A UN-brokered ceasefire became {{active in}} July 1988, ending the Iran-Iraq war. Hussein had advised Saddam after 1988 to polish his {{image in the}} West by visiting other countries, and by {{appearing}} at the United Nations for a speech, but to no avail. The Iraqi-Jordanian relationship developed into the Arab Cooperation Council (ACC), which also included Egypt and Yemen, on 16February 1989, serving as a counter to the Gulf Cooperation Council. Saddam's invasion of Kuwait on 2August 1990 led six months later to international intervention to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait in {{what became known as}} the Gulf War. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait caught Hussein by surprise; he was the ACC chairman at that time, and a personal friend of Saddam's. After informing the then American president George H. W. Bush of his intention to travel to Baghdad to contain the situation, Hussein travelled to Baghdad on 3August for a meeting with Saddam; at the meeting, the latter announced his intention to withdraw Iraqi troops from Kuwait only if Arab governments refrained from issuing statements of condemnation, and no foreign troops were involved. On Hussein's way back from Baghdad, Egypt issued a condemnation of the Iraqi invasion. To Hussein's dismay, Egyptian president Husni Mubarak refused to reverse his position and called for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. An Arab League summit held in Cairo issued a condemnation of Iraq with a fourteen-vote majority, despite calls by Jordan's foreign minister Marwan Al-Kasim that this move would hinder Hussein's efforts to reach a peaceful resolution. Both <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> viewed Hussein with suspicionthey distrusted him and believed he was planning to obtain a share of Kuwait's wealth.|$|E

500|$|In 1949, Venezuela and Iran {{took the}} {{earliest}} {{steps in the}} direction of OPEC, by inviting Iraq, <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabia</b> to improve communication among petroleum-exporting nations as the world recovered from World WarII. At the time, some of the world's largest oil fields were just entering production in the Middle East. The United States had established the Interstate Oil Compact Commission to join the Texas Railroad Commission in limiting overproduction. The US was simultaneously the world's largest producer and consumer of oil; and the world market was dominated by a group of multinational companies known as the [...] "Seven Sisters", five of which were headquartered in the US following the breakup of John D.
