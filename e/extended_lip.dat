50|$|Peters' {{elephantnose fish}} {{is among the}} most {{commonly}} available Mormyrid in aquarium stores in the USA. In the aquarium it is timid, preferring a heavily planted environment with subdued lighting and thrives in a tank of more than 200 liters. Ideally, a pipe or hollow log should be provided and the optimum substrate is some soft sand that allows the fish to sift through it with its delicate <b>extended</b> <b>lip.</b> It feeds on small worms(bloodworms being the most common) and aquatic invertebrates such as mosquito larvae, but in the aquarium will accept frozen or flake food. How peaceful an elephantnose fish is can depend on the individual; some are quite aggressive with other species, while others are retiring. They may be kept in a community aquarium with peaceful species who share their water preferences. However, unless kept in an aquarium of over 400 liters, it is unwise to keep more than one elephantnose fish as they can be territorial. The elephantnose is suggested to be kept in the following conditions: pH of 6.8 to 7.2, water temperature 26C to 28C, and water of medium hardness.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted {{in order to develop}} a feeder grill that would allow broiler breeder males, but not females, to eat. Females are typically excluded from male feeders by increasing the height of the feeder. However, male feeder heights that exclude most females increase the time required for males to consume a given amount of feed 19 to 60 %. Typical male feeder height from floor to feeder pan lip in commercial practice is 55 cm, which is about the distance from floor {{to the head of the}} male in an erect posture. Females measure about 40 cm in an erect posture. Because the necks of males (8. 0 cm) are longer than those of females (6. 3 cm), the lip of male feeder pans was extended horizontally 12. 7 cm with a wire mesh on the assumption that females could not stretch their necks enough to reach the feed. However, the females learned quickly to perch on the <b>extended</b> <b>lip</b> and eat. Total exclusion of females from the male feeder, regardless of feeder height, was achieved by placing a horizontal upper mesh 5. 6 to 10. 2 cm above the <b>extended</b> <b>lip,</b> and connecting the upper mesh to the lower <b>extended</b> <b>lip</b> of the feeder with vertical bars spaced 5. 1 cm apart. The horizontal upper mesh prevented perching by females and the 5. 1 -cm spacing of the vertical bars allowed males but not females to reach the feed by inserting their heads and necks up to their shoulders. Male feed consumption time was decreased by this new grill by 18 to 50 % in comparison to an unmodified feeder, but female access was eliminated.

40|$|This paper covers {{far-field}} {{acoustic measurements}} {{of a family}} of rectangular nozzles with aspect ratio 8, in the high subsonic flow regime. Several variations of nozzle geometry, commonly found in embedded exhaust systems, are explored, including bevels, slants, single broad chevrons and notches, and internal septae. Far-field acoustic results, presented previously for the simple rectangular nozzle, showed that increasing aspect ratio increases the high frequency noise, especially directed in the plane containing the minor axis of the nozzle. Detailed changes to the nozzle geometry generally made little difference in the noise, and the differences were greatest at low speed. Having an <b>extended</b> <b>lip</b> on one broad side (bevel) did produce up to 3 decibels more noise in all directions, while extending the lip on the narrow side (slant) produced up to 2 decibels more noise, primarily on the side with the extension. Adding a single, non-intrusive chevron, made no significant change to the noise, while inverting the chevron (notch) produced up to 2 decibels increase in the noise. Having internal walls (septae) within the nozzle, such as would be required for structural support or when multiple fan ducts are aggregated, reduced the noise of the rectangular jet, but could produce a highly directional shedding tone from the septae trailing edges. Finally, a nozzle with both septae and a beveled nozzle, representative of the exhaust system envisioned for a distributed electric propulsion aircraft with a common rectangular duct, produced almost as much noise as the beveled nozzle, with the septae not contributing much reduction in noise...|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} {{model of a}} ten-strand billet caster tundish was established to {{study the effects of}} various flow control devices on the melt flow. Before and after the optimization of the melt flow, the inclusion removal in the tundish was evaluated by plant trials. The {{physical model}}ing results show that when combined with a baffle, the turbulence inhibitor, instead of the impact pad, can significantly improve the melt flow. A turbulence inhibitor with a longer length of inner cavity and without an <b>extending</b> <b>lip</b> {{at the top of the}} sidewall seems to be efficient in the improvement of the melt flow. Various types and designs of baffles all influence the flow characteristics significantly. The “V” type baffles are better than the straight baffles for flow control. The “V” type baffle with four inclined holes at the sidewall away from the stopper rods is better in melt flow control than the one with one inclined hole at each sidewall. The combination of a well-designed turbulence inhibitor and an appropriate baffle shows high efficiency on improving the melt flow and an optimal proposal was presented. Plant trials indicate that, compared with the original tundish configuration in prototype, the inclusions reduce by 42 % and the inclusion distribution of individual strands is more similar with the optimal one. The optimal tundish configuration effectively improves the melt flow in the ten-strand billet caster tundish...|$|R

40|$|TYPE SPECIMEN: TAXONOMIC UNIQUENESS: Twenty {{three species}} in genus Catostomus, all found in North America. Six species occur in Arizona. Two {{subspecies}} of C. discobolus have been discussed, C. d. discobolus and C. d. yarrowi, {{the latter being}} the Zuni population (Smith et al. 1983, Crabtree and Buth 1987). C. d. yarrowi origin is likely a hybrid between C. discobolus and C. plebius. DESCRIPTION: Generally slender fusiform body with a subterminal mouth. Most individuals do not exceed 200 mm (7. 87 in), but a few may attain 250 mm (Hanson, 1980, Propst and Hobbs, 1996). Mouth has fleshy lips and protuberances, particularly on the lower lips. The lips are notched laterally and the medial separation of the lower <b>lip</b> <b>extends</b> nearly to its anterior margin. The posterior margin of the lower <b>lip</b> <b>extends</b> back at an acute angle to the ventral longitudinal median. The lower jaw has a well-developed cartilaginous mandibular ridge that parallels the curvature of the lower lip (Sublette et al., 1990).
