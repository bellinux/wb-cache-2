5|$|Females in estrus are {{followed}} by males, with copulation initiated by the female. The female will <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> a branch and may vocalise. The male will hold the female and the branch and copulate with her. Urine-marking and vocalising are also used by the female to solicit mating. The male may create a mating plug following copulation.|$|E

5|$|Hydnellum peckii is an {{inedible}} (though not toxic) fungus, and {{a member}} of the genus Hydnellum of the family Bankeraceae. It is a hydnoid species, producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> the undersurface of the fruit bodies. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal species, and forms mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of coniferous trees, growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses.|$|E
5|$|Turkeys {{are large}} birds, their nearest {{relatives}} being the pheasant and the guineafowl. Males {{are larger than}} females and have spreading, fan-shaped tails and distinctive, fleshy wattles, called a snood, that <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> {{the top of the}} beak and are used in courtship display. Wild turkeys can fly, but seldom do so, preferring to run with a long, stratling gait. They roost in trees and forage on the ground, feeding on seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards, and small snakes.|$|E
5|$|The Nobu Restaurant {{features}} an Asian motif and is spaciously arranged with only round tables, granting larger aisles than square tables would. Large paper lamps in jellyfish images <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> the ceiling. Seating {{is available in}} the main dining area, the sushi bar, along a couple of high kitchen tables, or in a private dining area. There are also two teppanyaki grill tables, which serve as either a traditional grill or in combination with the menu and dishes from the main kitchen. In addition to chef Nobu Matsuhisa's signature dishes featuring black cod in miso sauce, rock shrimp tempura, and yellowtail sashimi the menu has variations on the dishes which are not available at other Nobu restaurants, as well as an exclusive list of sakes available nowhere else in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|The ovary and {{attached}} pistil protrude {{from the top}} of the floral tube near its opening, with the receptive stigma surface toward the front. Two 1 millimeter anthers <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> recurved, 2 millimeter filaments behind the pistil. Pollinators exiting after collecting nectar from the spur brush against the anther, transferring pollen to the stigma of the next flower they visit. The flowers can last up to 10 days but will wilt once they are pollinated. Pollinated ovaries ripen into 5millimeter (in.) dehiscent seed capsules containing numerous 1millimeter long seeds. The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.|$|E
5|$|There were {{numerous}} proposals {{at the time}} to build an electric aerial tramway, with one such line to go down the Avenida de Mayo. One proposal was the 1889 Le Tellier proposal, which envisioned multiple lines running along the city's wider avenues with the trams moved using cables and would <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> steel rails fixed to 6 metre high steel and iron posts positioned in 10–15 metre intervals. The lines would take 24 months to build and construction would commence 3 months after their approval by the Argentine National Congress, a decision which was ultimately not taken, favouring instead an underground tramway.|$|E
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, have a role in climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E

5|$|Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter with shoot 'em up and action-adventure elements, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the player character from a third-person perspective in a 3D environment. The game places strong emphasis on shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. Weapons have no magazines restrictions and range from grenades to a pistol, a machine gun, a sniper rifle, a flamethrower, and rocket launchers, among others. Although much {{of the game is}} spent in battle, the player has the ability to jump, <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> most ledges, swim and fly using jet packs when needed. In combat, the player is free to set on a manual aiming system with the targeting camera fixed behind the character's head. When using this technique, a crosshair appears on screen and the player character becomes translucent so that players can aim and shoot with finesse. By contrast, when walking around, the game plays similar to a 3D platformer.|$|E
5|$|The nesting and {{breeding}} biology of antbirds {{have not been}} well studied. Even in relatively well-known species the breeding behaviour can be poorly known; for example the nest of the ocellated antbird was first described in 2004. Nests are constructed by both parents, although the male undertakes more {{of the work in}} some species. Antbird nests are cups of vegetation such as twigs, dead leaves and plant fibre, and they follow two basic patterns: either suspended or supported. Suspended cups, which may <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> forks in branches, or between two branches, are the more common style of nest. Supported nests rest upon branches, amongst vines, in hollows, and sometimes on mounds of vegetation on the ground. Each species nests at the level where it forages, so a midstory species would build its nest in the midstory. Closely related species nest in the same ways. For example, antvireos in the genus Dysithamnus are all suspension nesters.|$|E
5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E

25|$|Most {{species of}} spiders <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> silk {{during the entire}} process, either {{dangling}} from a drop line, or fastening their claws into webbed fibres attached to a suitable base.
