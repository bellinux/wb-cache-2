40|$|The HRSC onboard Mars Express is a {{multi-line}} pushbroom scanner {{which provides}} image data from 5 panchromatic stereo channels and 4 spectral bands (Neukum et al, 2004). A completely automated ground <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> {{has been developed}} in the past years and is being applied on a routine base for each MEX orbit. It comprises {{the conversion of the}} original data stream transmitted to ground to de-compressed data (Level- 1 data), the radiometric correction of the image data based on calibration information (Level- 2 data) combined with orbit and pointing information for each image line, and a first rectification to standard scales of up to 12. 5 m/pixel (Level- 3 data) using a-priori topography information as defined by the MGS MOLA instrument. Level- 2 and Level- 3 data of HRSC's Super Resolution Channel (SRC) in scales of up to 2. 5 m/pixel complete the HRSC capabilities. Thus, Level- 2 and Level- 3 are ready for distribution to the HRSC Co-Investigator team within one day after data acquisition. A standard Level- 4 generation is started after completion of Level- 2 data in order to derive HRSC digital terrain models in a standard 200 m grid. These DTMs are finally used for the generation of orthoimages of all 4 spectral bands and the high-resolution nadir channel. This standardized processing provides 3 D and image data products within a few days after data acquisition for first science analyses. Based on nominal pointing and reconstructed orbit information the standard Level- 4 data products comprise a mean absolute accuracy of a few hundred meters for planimetry and of better than 100 m for height.

5000|$|With {{all this}} {{internal}} investment, Watson was, in essence, gambling on the future. It was IBM's first ‘Bet the Company’ gamble, but the risk paid off handsomely. Watson's factories, running full tilt {{for six years}} with no market to sell to, created a huge inventory of unused tabulating equipment, straining IBM's resources. To reduce the cash drain, the struggling Dayton Scale Division (the food services equipment business) was sold in 1933 to Hobart Manufacturing for stock. [...] When the Social Security Act of 1935 - labeled as [...] "the biggest accounting operation of all time" [...] - came up for bid, IBM was the only bidder that could quickly provide the necessary equipment. Watson's gamble brought the company a landmark government contract to maintain employment records for 26 million people. IBM's successful performance on the contract soon led to other government orders, {{and by the end}} of the decade IBM had not only safely negotiated the Depression, but risen to the forefront of the industry. Watson's Depression-era decision to invest heavily in technical development and sales capabilities, education to expand the breadth of those capabilities, and his commitment to the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> product <b>line</b> laid the foundation for 50 years of IBM growth and successes.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we tried}} to improve a given {{stochastic}} <b>processing</b> <b>line</b> which is perfectly balanced. By introducing flexibility to a stochastic <b>processing</b> <b>line,</b> we could achieve the benefit of resource pooling.

40|$|Moore's law {{was first}} {{postulated}} in 1968, and it loosely {{says that the}} cost of making calculations on a computer falls by 50 % each year. Securities markets are, in essence, a form of <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Consequently, Moore’s law has driven important changes in those markets over the past forty years. Faster <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> was essential for major changes in securities trading. Increased turnover of portfolios was a result of faster <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Consequently, the criticism of that turnover may be misplaced. The effectiveness of regulatory changes, such as the lowering of brokerage commissions and the reduction in bid ask spreads, depended on reduced <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> costs, that is on Moore's Law. Deregulation of brokerage commissions could not have reduced rates by as much as it did if we had not had decreasing costs of <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> The reduction in bid ask spreads which followed decimalization of securities quotes depended on improved <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Continued reductions in <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> costs will require a new regulatory approach.

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>processing</b> complexity, partitionability, {{locality}} and provenance play {{a crucial}} role in the effectiveness of distributed <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Dynamics in <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> necessitates effective modeling which allows the understanding and reasoning of the fluidity of <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> Through virtualization, resources have become scattered, heterogeneous, and dynamic in performance and networking. In this paper, we propose a new distributed <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> model based on automata where <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> is modeled as state transformations. This approach falls within a category of declarative concurrent paradigms which are fundamentally different than imperative approaches in that communication and function order are not explicitly modeled. This allows an abstraction of concurrency and thus suited for distributed systems. Automata give us a way to formally describe <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> independent from underlying processes while also providing routing information to route data based on its current state in a P 2 P fashion around networks of distributed processing nodes. Through an implementation, named Pumpkin, of the model we capture the automata schema and routing table into a <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> protocol and show how globally distributed resources can be brought together in a collaborative way to form a <b>processing</b> plane where <b>data</b> objects are self-routable on the plane...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the status of electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services and/or functions in the public schools of Indiana. To provide additional insight to the organizational structure of a <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center, four existing regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers serving a group of school districts in adjoining states through a centrally located computer facility were examined. The procedures used in collecting and analyzing the data for the study included the following: (1) appropriate data gathering instruments were designed, (2) a questionnaire accompanied by a cover letter explaining the {{purpose of the}} study was mailed to each superintendent of all school corporations in Indiana, (3) a personal interview was conducted with the administrative personnel directly responsible for the operation of each of the four selected regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers, (3) <b>data</b> obtained from the questionnaire and the personal interview were compiled, tabulated, analyzed, and presented, and (4) the findings, conclusions and recommendations for further study were presented. The superintendents were asked to respond to the question, "Do you presently utilize <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> (computer and punch card) equipment in any part of the operation and/or administration of your school district?" Those school administrators responding "YES" were then asked to indicate those services and functions which were accomplished in their school corporation, to indicate the method of obtaining <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services and to indicate methods. All of the superintendents were asked to indicate their future plans for the use of <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services in their local school corporation(s). The systematic analysis of the procedures necessary for implementing educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to a group of school districts in adjoining states included the following elements: (1) background information, (2) objectives, (3) historical development, (4) equipment, (5) personnel, (6) services and/or functions, (7) orientation procedures, (8) advantages of a central computer facility, (9) disadvantages of a central computer facility, and (10) future plans. The findings indicated the following major general conclusions to be appropriate the level of their satisfaction with both services. There has been only limited development toward the organization of educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> systems throughout the state of Indiana. This situation lends itself to collective exploration by interested school administrators toward cooperative arrangements of obtaining <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services, regardless of the size of the school district. Qualified and competent personnel must be responsible for the operation of the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center. The director of the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> center should be totally familiar with all facets of school administration so that he may use electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to facilitate the instructional program. A central computer facility organized to provide electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to a group of school districts is capable of supporting the more sophisticated computer equipment at a reduction in cost, provided the equipment is operating at a near capacity work load. It is possible for a group of school districts to benefit from the developmental experience of existing <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers. The amount of time once considered necessary to progress from feasibility of operation to full-scale implementation has been greatly reduced by administrators' capitalizing on the systematic developments of existing regional <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> centers. School districts involved in <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> can benefit from the efforts of an administrative officer whose function is to systematically analyze administrative operations. This individual is referred to as a systems analyst or operations analyst. Teleprocessing has great potential for providing electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to school districts regardless of size. Teleprocessing provides school administrators with direct access to sophisticated electronic <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> equipment and computer programs which have been successfully developed and implemented in other school districts. The Indiana Department of Education should assume the leadership in establishing regional service centers throughout Indiana to provide comprehensive educational <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> services to local school districts.
