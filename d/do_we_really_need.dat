[...] Denby criticized the dance numbers, calling them [...] "unimaginatively shot," [...] and he considered [...] "the idea of substituting John Travolta for Harvey Fierstein as Tracy’s hefty mother... a blandly earnest betrayal." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com found Hairspray [...] "reasonably entertaining. But <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> to be entertained reasonably?

Both cases involved the deliberate concealment of unauthorised building and both attempted to rely on section 171 B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the 1990 Act) claiming the Local Planning Authorities (“LPAs”) were time barred from taking action as {{more than four years}} had passed since the date of the breach. Section 124 gave LPAs the power to apply to the Magistrates Court to take planning enforcement action outside of the normal four and ten year time limits in situations where {{there may have been a}} breach of planning control involving concealment. LPAs may apply to the Magistrates Court for a planning enforcement order (“PEO”) within six months from the date of knowledge of evidence of the apparent breach providing they are able to satisfy the court, on the balance of probabilities, that the apparent breach has been deliberately concealed and that the making of an order is just to do so. Whilst the Government’s intentions may have been valid, was their response? Is section 124 really the answer in closing the loophole these cases exposed? Alternative solutions do exist, including better implementation of the 1990 Act, the use of other existing legislation and applying public policy arguments used in the Beesley case. All of which would safeguard the limitation period under the 1990 Act. This then raises the question <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> section 124 in the first place...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a framework, {{in which the}} main concepts of schema and data integration can be spec-ified both semantically and syntactically in an ab-stract data-model independent way. We first define what are schema matching and integration seman-tically, in terms of sets of instances and mappings between them. We also define a schema matching and integration syntactically, and introduce a pro-cedure (the how) for computing the integration of matched schema according to the syntactical defini-tion in fairly abstract terms. The main theorem of the paper states that the result of syntactical inte-gration satisfies the semantic definition and, hence, <b>does</b> produce what <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need.</b> <b>We</b> show how this framework unifies the approach taken in at least five other schema integration proposals and fills in some important gaps in these proposals. Viewed in a broader perspective, the framework developed in the paper integrates the syntactical and semantical sides of model management and, particularly, reveals a re-∗Supported by Bell Canada through the Bell University Labs, NSERC and Ontario Centres Of Excellence markable duality between them.

40|$|Today {{the story}} repeats itself. Genome wide {{genetics}} is becoming real. <b>We</b> can <b>do</b> Genome Wide Association Studies and soon we can sequence individual genomes {{in relation to}} food intake and phenotypic responses. And then what? How can we deal with that new avalanche of data? The oversampling problems will be a few orders of magnitude larger; after all there can be hundreds of SNPs in every gene. There will just be too many to understand which SNPs are important from the data alone. We will again have to relate them to the biological processes. But is that enough? I think not. We will only understand the outcome of those large scale genetics studies if we not only attribute the SNPs to genes and thereby to pathways. We {{will also have to}} consider the actual sequences and see what the functional effect is that the SNP causes. Is it likely to influence transcription factor binding, miRNA effects, or protein-protein interactions? This calls for new types of data integration, for which we already have the tools. And it calls for new creative ways to <b>do</b> that. What <b>we</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> is teams of creative minds. Some new initiatives seem to show that these are already being formed. |$|R
40|$|The {{raison d'etre}} of IR is to satisfy human {{information}} <b>need.</b> But, <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> understand information <b>need?</b> Despite {{advances in the}} past few decades in both the IR and relevant scientific communities, this question is largely unanswered. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not <b>really</b> understand how an information need emerges and how it is physically manifested. Information need refers to a complex concept: at the very initial state of the phenomenon (i. e. at a visceral level), even the searcher may not be aware of its existence. This renders the measuring of this concept (using traditional behaviour studies) nearly impossible. In this paper, we investigate the connection between an information need and brain activity. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we measured the brain activity of twenty four participants while they performed a Question Answering (Q/A) Task, where the questions were carefully selected and developed from TREC- 8 and TREC 2001 Q/A Track. The results of this experiment revealed a distributed network of brain regions commonly associated with activities related to information need and retrieval and differing brain activity in processing scenarios when participants knew the answer to a given question and when they did not and needed to search. We believe our study and conclusions constitute an important step in unravelling the nature of information need and therefore better satisfying it. © 2016 ACM...|$|R

40|$|It is only {{reasonable}} {{to become a}} zero waste society and for producers to immediately start redesigning products, and {{for us to make}} the transition in our mentality to stop buying products that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not <b>really</b> <b>need</b> or products that we could, in fact, borrow.

Thermal treatment should only be allowed to be used for waste that cannot be utilised or returned into the material flow in any way. In my master’s thesis I have presented an overview of municipal waste management: the history and current situation in both Slovenia and Europe. I carried out a study on Zero Waste and the standard of municipal waste services. I have presented the techniques of treating mixed municipal waste, a circular economy, material flows of certain types of waste, the 5 or 6 steps of waste management, as well as the Zero Waste movement and how to join this movement. The ‘Loči. me’ (‘separate me’) application was developed to promote the correct sorting of waste and encourage people to separate their waste. On the basis of the facts examined, I put forward some proposals on how to harmonise the operations of municipal companies, critically determine the current roles and perspectives of modern methods of waste thermal treatment and an initiative to adopt a circular economy as a systemic solution for the formation of a zero waste society...|$|R
