5|$|The Rocketeer's {{attack on}} the Nazi Zeppelin was filmed near Six Flags Magic Mountain {{amusement}} park in Valencia, California over four months through pick-ups. Remaining visual effects footage took place at ILM's headquarters in San Rafael and Hamilton Air Force Base. There, they constructed a 12ft scale model of the Zeppelin, which was photographed against matte paintings that resembled 1938 Los Angeles for <b>intercutting</b> purposes. The Zeppelin explosion special effect alone cost $400,000.|$|E
5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} with a tight focus on a small group (with {{everyone}} in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into separate stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached the turning point in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character <b>intercutting,</b> chronology, and suspense.|$|E
5|$|Photography was {{provided}} by Willy Hameister, {{who went on to}} work with Wiene on several other films. The camera does not play a large part in Caligari, and is used primarily to show the sets. The cinematography tends to alternate only between medium shots at straight-on angles and abrupt close-ups {{to create a sense of}} shock, but with few long shots or panning movement. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without <b>intercutting,</b> which gives Caligari a more theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by the distortions of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films.|$|E

5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, <b>intercutting,</b> juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs very differently, and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before {{the development of}} continuity editing, however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E

In 1975, he was awarded a Golden Turkey Award as Worst Director of All Time, {{renewing}} public interest in his work. Wood's career and camp approach has earned him and his films a cult following.|$|E
25|$|The {{insertion}} {{of a dream}} sequence of a unicorn running through a forest. The original sequence of the dream—showing Deckard intercut with the running unicorn—was not found in a print of sufficient quality. Arick was thus forced to use a different print that shows only the unicorn running, without any <b>intercutting</b> to Deckard. This unicorn scene suggests a completely different interpretation {{at the end of}} the film: Gaff's origami unicorn means that Deckard's dreams are known to him, implying that Deckard's memories are artificial and that therefore he is a replicant of the same generation as Rachael.|$|E
500|$|The {{first cut}} of the film was two-and-a-half hours long. Parker then cut the film down to two hours when he {{realized}} {{there was a way}} to further trim the film. [...] "There were a number of scenes that paced well when we intercut them rather than letting them play as written in a linear fashion. For instance, we wanted to let the mission briefing scene play normally—this is where the SEAL team is briefed on their target. That scene was followed by a scene of the target beheading a local. We realized that an actual briefing is very technical and rote, so <b>intercutting</b> these scenes helped keep the audience engaged." ...|$|E

The famous <b>intercutting</b> technique {{used in the}} sex scene was used to similar effect in a sex scene featuring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. [...] The film's imagery and stylistic techniques have served as an inspiration to films such as Schindler's List directed by Steven Spielberg, Memento by Christopher Nolan, The Dark by John Fawcett, Frozen by Juliet McKoen, Submarine by Richard Ayoade, and Snow White and the Huntsman by Rupert Sanders. David Cronenberg regards it as the most frightening film he has seen, and its influence has been detected on Cronenberg's The Brood.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} filming wrapped, Peckinpah had shot [...] of film with 1,288 camera setups. Lombardo and Peckinpah {{remained}} in Mexico {{for six months}} editing the picture. After initial cuts, the opening gunfight sequence ran 21 minutes. By cutting frames from specific scenes and <b>intercutting</b> others, {{they were able to}} fine-cut the opening robbery down to five minutes. The creative montage became the model {{for the rest of the}} film and would [...] "forever change the way movies would be made". Further editing was done to secure a favorable rating from the MPAA which was in the process of establishing a new set of codes. Peckinpah and his editors cut the film to satisfy the new, expansive R-rating parameters which, for the first time, designated a film as being unsuitable for children. Without this new system in place, the film could not have been released with its explicit images of bloodshed.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Los Angeles, California, which doubled for scenes set in a 1950s-era New York City. The Palladium Ballroom, a former New York City concert hall, was recreated {{to serve as a}} centrepiece in the film. [...] In {{describing}} the look of the film, production designer Stuart Wurtzel stated, [...] "There are lots of photographs and some film from that period. ... There's a film called Mambo Madness from 1955 with some footage of Tito Puente and Desi Arnaz we looked at, and we got pictures from the Cuban Society in New York and from libraries. The Cuban community has been enormously supportive of the film, so we've also been privy to the private archives of many people." [...] Ann Roth served as the film's costume designer, using vintage textiles to create the custom-made wardrobe. [...] The I Love Lucy segment of the film was filmed at Ren-Mar Studios, the former site of Desilu Productions. The set of the Ricardos' living room was re-created, with film editors <b>intercutting</b> footage with Banderas, Assante and Arnaz, Jr. with an actual episode featuring Lucille Ball." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the series}} shares a mockumentary style with The Office, Daniels and Schur sought to {{establish}} a slightly different tone in the camerawork of the pilot episode. The one-on-one interviews, for example, sometimes feature two separate camera angles on the same person; the footage is intercut to create {{the final version of}} the scene. This technique was inspired by The Five Obstructions, a 2003 experimental documentary directed by Lars Von Trier and Jørgen Leth, which Daniels watched at the suggestion of actor Paul Schneider. Parks and Recreation also makes frequent use of the jump cut technique. For instance, one scene in the pilot episode repeatedly jump cuts between brief clips in which Leslie seeks permission from Ron to pursue the pit project. Early in the season, editor Dean Holland developed a technique that would be used throughout the series. During a scene in [...] "The Reporter" [...] in which Leslie reacts to quotes read to her by the journalist, Poehler improvised a number of jokes, many of which were ultimately going to be cut from the episode. Holland thought they were all funny, so he created a brief montage <b>intercutting</b> several of the lines. The producers sought to lend authenticity to the fictional Pawnee setting by incorporating real-life Indiana elements. They contacted the Bloomington–based Upland Brewing Company and asked for empty beer bottles and labels to be used as background props.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dive" [...] was filmed in July 2012, {{directed}} by Chris Applebaum, and released to VEVO on August 25, 2012. In the video, Victoria's Secret Angel model Chanel Iman plays as Usher's love interest. Set on a luxury Yacht {{in the open}} sea, the video begins with Usher talking, before showing him singing the first verse. The video intercuts to Iman, and Usher inside a cabin with water gushing in. For the chorus, Usher and Iman are being intimate, with water further entering the singer's cabin. Usher and Iman are once again being intimate for the second verse, sat outside of the Yacht, with water now level with Usher's waist inside the cabin, entering the second chorus, where Usher and Iman make love. During the bridge, both are romancing within the cabin's bathroom, with the video <b>intercutting</b> to different romantic scenarios. Further scenarios are shown in the final chorus, with the water now fully submerging the cabin and Usher. The video closes with Usher swimming to safety, but before reaching the surface, he and Iman approach each other, embracing in the water. Opening the 2012 iTunes Festival, Usher performed [...] "Dive" [...] {{for the first time}} along with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop", [...] "Twisted" [...] and [...] "Numb" [...] and other songs.|$|E
500|$|Buckland {{describes}} the film's 14 minute opening sequence as the [...] "most abstract and complex of any Spielberg film." [...] The first scene is a distorted precog {{vision of a}} murder, presented out of context. The speed {{of the film is}} sped up, slowed, and even reversed, and the movie [...] "jumps about in time and space" [...] by <b>intercutting</b> the images in no discernible order. When it ends, it becomes clear that the scene was presented through Agatha's eyes, and that this is how previsions appear to her. Fellow scholar Nigel Morris called this scene a [...] "trailer", because it foreshadows the plot and establishes the type of [...] "tone, generic expectations, and enigmas" [...] that will be used in the film. The visions of the pre-cogs are presented in a fragmented series of clips using a [...] "squishy lens" [...] device, which distorts the images, blurring their edges and creating ripples across them. They were created by a two-man production team, hired by Spielberg, who chose the [...] "layered, dreamlike imagery" [...] based on some comments from cognitive psychologists the pair consulted. In the opening's next scene, Anderton is [...] "scrubbing the images", by standing like a composer (as Spielberg terms it), and manipulating them, while Jad assists him. Next the family involved in the murder in Agatha's vision is shown interacting, which establishes that the opening scene was a prevision. The picture then cuts back to Anderton and the precogs' images, before alternating between the three. The opening is self-contained, and according to Buckland acts merely as a setup for numerous elements of the story. It lasts 14 minutes, includes 171 shots, and has an average shot length of five seconds as opposed to the 6.5 second average for the entire film. The opening's five-second average is attained despite [...] "very fast cutting" [...] in the beginning and ending, because the middle has longer takes, which reach 20 seconds in some instances. Spielberg also continues his tradition of [...] "heavily diffused backlighting" [...] for much in the interior shots.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{similarities}} in the mockumentary style with The Office, Daniels and Schur sought to establish a slightly different tone in the camerawork of the pilot episode.

This technique was inspired by The Five Obstructions, a 2003 experimental documentary directed by Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth, which Daniels watched at the suggestion of actor Paul Schneider. Another distinction from The Office is that, while almost all footage from that show is filmed in a workplace setting, the documentary crew on Parks and Recreation regularly follows the characters into more intimate, non-work settings, such as on dates or at their homes. Parks and Recreation also makes frequent use of the jump cut technique. For instance, one scene in the pilot episode repeatedly jump cuts between brief clips in which Leslie seeks permission from Ron to pursue the pit project. Early in the season, editor Dean Holland developed a technique that would be used throughout the series.

2500|$|Craven {{chose to}} give Iliadis his freedom while filming the remake, {{partially}} because Craven {{was in the}} process of working on a new film for himself, but also because he likes to allow the directors the chance to make their own film. For the 2009 remake, Iliadis wanted to keep a consistency among the scenes of his film, as compared to the 1972 original. Iliadis stated that he felt the <b>intercutting</b> of comedic scenes with the rape scene in the 1972 film had the tendency to take one out of the moment. Iliadis wanted to [...] "cut those diversions out", as a way of [...] " [...] into this scene with no place to cut away to". For Iliadis, taking this approach helped to create more drama for the event. The producers brought in a medical technician to provide insight, based on his job experience witnessing the people's deaths, and lend realism to the actors' portrayals. Lindhome states that the technician would explain how someone would react given a particular event, like getting shot or stabbed. Iliadis also felt that his work on Hardcore helped to train him for this film. As the director points out, Hardcore contained [...] "very difficult scenes", like a sixteen-year-old girl having an [...] "existential breakdown during an orgy", and Iliadis sees those scenes as training for him to learn how to make sure the actors are still being respected, as well as making sure that the scene is focused on the characters instead of simply going for [...] "titillation".|$|E
2500|$|Post-production {{began in}} November 2002, with the {{completion}} of the 4½ hour assembly cut of the film that Annie Collins had been completing over 2001 and 2002, from 4-hour dailies. For example, Théoden leading the charge went from 150 minutes of takes to a finished 90 seconds. Jackson reunited with longtime collaborator Jamie Selkirk to edit the final film. Like The Two Towers, they would have to deal with multiple storylines, and Jackson paid attention to each storyline at a time before deciding where to intercut. Most importantly they spent three weeks working on the last 45 minutes of the film, for appropriate <b>intercutting</b> and leaving out scenes such as the Mouth of Sauron, and the fates of characters like Legolas, Gimli, Éowyn and Faramir. The film inherited scenes originally planned to go into the second film, including the reforging of Narsil, Gollum's backstory, and Saruman's exit. But the Saruman scene posed a structural problem: killing off the second film's villain when the plot has Sauron as the main villain. Despite pick-ups and dubs, the scene was cut, causing controversy with fans and Saruman actor Christopher Lee, as well as a petition to restore the scene. Lee nonetheless contributed to the DVDs and was at the Copenhagen premiere, although he said he would never understand the reason for the cut and his relationship with Jackson was chilly. They would, however, later reconcile upon Lee's casting in Jackson's Hobbit films. Jackson only had a lock on 5 out of 10 reels, and had to churn out 3 reels in 3 weeks to help finish the film. It was finally completed on 12 November 2003. Jackson {{never had a chance to}} view the film in full due to the hectic schedule, and only saw the film from beginning to end on 1 December at the Wellington premiere; according to Elijah Wood, his response was [...] "yup, it's good, pretty good".|$|E
