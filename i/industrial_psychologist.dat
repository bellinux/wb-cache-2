2500|$|Wyatt {{was born}} in Bristol. [...] His mother was Honor Wyatt, a {{journalist}} with the BBC, and his father, George Ellidge, was an <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologist.</b> Wyatt had two half-brothers from his parents' previous marriages, Honor Wyatt's son, actor Julian Glover, and George Ellidge's son, press photographer Mark Ellidge. His parents' friends were [...] "quite bohemian", and his upbringing was [...] "unconventional". Wyatt said [...] "It seemed perfectly normal to me. My father didn't join us until I was six, and he died ten years later, having retired early with multiple sclerosis, so I was brought up a lot by women." [...] Wyatt attended the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys, Canterbury and as a teenager lived with his parents in Lydden near Dover, where he was taught drums by visiting American jazz drummer George Neidorf. It was during this period that Wyatt [...] met and became friends with expatriate Australian musician Daevid Allen, who rented a room in Wyatt's family home.|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. Industrial {{psychology}} is an applied sub-discipline of psychology, and <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> {{are trained to}} be behavioural specialists in the workplace. As such, <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> approach workplace problems or enhance organisational functioning from a behavioural perspective. <b>Industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> also function as human resource management practitioners within organisations. An investigation was conducted to determine how behavioural science could ideally be applied by <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> in the human resource management domains. The importance of investigating this research question was to enable or enhance the practise of <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> when functioning in the human resource management domains. The {{aim of this study}} was to create a socially constructed futuristic framework that could inform <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> on how they could practically apply psychology in human resource management. A qualitative approach was utilised to explore the research question. <b>Industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> (21) that function in the realm of human resource management were involved as participants through personal semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus groups to provide an informed perspective on the behavioural scientific role of psychologists in the human resource management domains. The main contribution of this study is that <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> may be better able to position themselves in order to embed behavioural science in the human resource management domains.

40|$|M. Comm. Orientation: Professions {{are widely}} {{recognised}} {{on the basis}} of their expert knowledge and their adherence to an accepted code of behaviour. An accepted code of behaviour may be entrenched in a formal document referred to as a code of conduct or similar. Industrial psychology (as a fully recognised profession within the field of psychology) is typically also guided by professional rules, regulations and codes of conduct. These codes occasionally include specific reference to the ethical components of the <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologist’s</b> activities and behaviours. Research purpose: The study was based on the assumption that a recognised profession such as industrial psychology would broadly engage with the same professional rules, regulations, obligations, expectations and responsibilities across the globe. The question arose whether critical scrutiny of existing codes of conduct from other countries would have value in informing the development and improvement of a dedicated code of ethics within a specific context (South Africa, for example). Motivation for the study: In South Africa, the profession of industrial psychology is regulated by the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) who regulates and informs professional conduct, including aspects pertaining to professional ethics. All practicing <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> are by law required to register with the HPCSA. Alongside the legislated HPCSA, a professional association called the South African Society for Industrial and Organisational Psychology (SIOPSA) provides further guidelines and codes of practice to direct and inform the professional behaviours of <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists.</b> Membership of the latter is voluntary. The motivation for the study was an expressed need from SIOPSA to advance and improve these guidelines and codes to render <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> (in South Africa) fit for the future demands of their profession. This would include special attention to the ethical demands and challenges associated with the profession. The aim of the study was to explore the possibility of using a multinational comparison of codes of ethics as a means to inform the process, for South Africa specifically but for countries and regions generally. Research design: A qualitative exploratory research design was selected and data was collected in the format of 20 Codes of Ethics from different countries across the globe. The codes were systematically analysed to explore the following aspects: (1) do these codes differ in format and style and if so, how; (2) do these codes differ in tone and if so, how; (3) is the content of these codes specific to <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> or generically applicable to all psychologists; (4) do these codes provide for all (or most) of the professional activities and functions and activities of <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> and if not, where do possible gaps exist; and on the basis hereof (5) could a multinational comparison serve to inform the development and improvement of a dedicated code of ethics for the profession of industrial psychology in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|M. Phil. <b>Industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> conduct {{research}} {{in order to}} contribute to the understanding of human behaviour at work. Within the role of researcher, <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> are required to adhere to ethical considerations as stipulated in the Health Professions Council Code of Ethics as well as the ethical principles in research. Adherence to and the reporting of the ethical principles in research are essential to ensure that the integrity and social standing of the profession is upheld. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the extent to which the ethical considerations pertaining to research subjects (anonymity, confidentiality, informed consent and voluntary participation) are reported. The articles published between 2001 and 2010 in a single journal, targeting <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> in particular, namely the SA Journal of Industrial Psychology forms the basis of this study. A quantitative content analysis on all the articles involving research subjects was conducted to determine the extent of reporting on the ethical considerations and the number of times these considerations are reported as well as the extent to which there is a temporal change in the reporting. The results of the study showed that the reporting on ethical considerations in the period 2001 to 2010 is generally low. There is,however,anincreasing tendency amongst authors to report on ethical considerations, specifically on the issues of confidentiality, anonymity and voluntary participation.

This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{perceptions}} and experiences of <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> employed in South African organisations with regard to Organisation-Professional Conflict (OPC).

A cross-sectional quantitative research approach was utilised by means of designing, developing and administering a survey that measures respondents‟ experiences of OPC. Responses from professional <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> (n= 143) were captured and utilised for statistical analysis. Factor analysis yielded four antecedents, i. e. power tension, compromise of professionalism, professional autonomy and strategic alignment. Research in conjunction with the literature confirmed that OPC can be considered to be the incongruence that may be experienced between professionals‟ organisational roles and duties, and that of their role as professional and adhering to professional obligations. More specifically, professional autonomy and strategic alignment mitigated the occurrence of OPC, whereas power tension and compromise of professionalism seem to exacerbate the occurrence thereof.

40|$|Despite {{the wide}} spread use of {{psychological}} {{instruments in the}} forensic context, there is a dearth {{of research on the}} purposes for using it. A qualitative case study approach was adopted in this study to explore the purposes for which <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> use psychological instruments in loss of income claims. The research study comprised of two phases. Firstly, a literature review was used to provide some background on psychological assessment in the forensic context. The literature review described the historical development of forensic psychology, what psychological instruments are and how they are used in the forensic context. The forensic context, in which <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> operate, was also described. Furthermore, the initial conceptual framework to outline the context of the next phase of the research was illustrated. The second phase was an exploratory study that made use of a multiple-case study approach. The main research aim was to explore the purposes for using psychological instruments in loss of income claims by <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists.</b> Another aim was to explore the psychological instruments used. The final aim was to explore the kind of information that is needed in the forensic context, which is not currently available by means of existing psychological assessment. Case study data was collected by conducting semi-structured interviews with four <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists.</b> Each interview represented a case to be analysed. The multiple-case study data gathered were then analysed using coding, within-case analysis and across-case analysis. The findings indicate that psychological instruments are used for the following purposes: (1) to add value to the quantification of a loss of income claim; and (2) to provide information that is required on the specific situation and circumstances surrounding the claim. Furthermore, the research findings also revealed that the purpose of using a psychological instrument to add value is influenced by internal factors of the psychological instrument as well as situational characteristics of the legal matter at hand. Through the exploration of the purposes for using psychological instruments, specific instruments used could be identified. Another finding included the existence of a perception that the psychological instruments currently available in South Africa are inadequate to provide the information required in the forensic context. The findings also revealed the kind of information that is needed. Recommendations were made for future research and industry-related practices. Industrial and Organisational PsychologyM. Comm.

This was a qualitative study in which 11 <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> (2 male, 9 female) were interviewed to determine the reasons why personality assessment {{is or is not}} used for selection purposes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted which comprised of 11 questions related to the <b>industrial</b> <b>psychologists</b> context, understanding the place of personality assessment in personnel selection in organisational settings in South Africa and a view of common practice employed in organisational settings in South Africa. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse the data. The analysis resulted in five themes namely, person-environment fit; other purposes for which personality assessment are used; personality tests commonly employed; limitations of personality assessment; and ethical considerations with the use of personality assessment. Based on these themes it can be concluded that there is invaluable information gained from determining whether or not a person will fit into the organisation.
