5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E

5|$|After their arrest, law {{enforcement}} officials investigated whether Adolf, Gartrell and Johnson were linked to vandalism shootings that targeted at least two federal buildings in Denver two weeks prior to their arrest. Windows were shot at the U.S. Custom House and the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Station in Denver's downtown Federal District. Authorities were also studying whether a bullet recovered from a Hertz rental car shot on August 15 could have matched the guns seized <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E
5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated {{the presence of these}} women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take them away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> would probably lead to mutiny.|$|E
5|$|In August 1987, at {{the annual}} B.C. Open hosted at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton, New York, Balukas was slated for {{competition}} in both divisions.

The men's division, by contrast, had no similar dress code. Balukas took a stand that the women should not be treated differently <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> and accordingly refused to procure garments that would meet the unequal mandate.|$|E

40|$|Very few {{criminal}} cases involving {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) transmission have been described. We report on an HIV- 1 transmission case with a child being infected by an HIV- 1 -positive <b>man.</b> <b>The</b> objective was to determine through molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic analyses whether HIV- 1 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> HIV- 1 -positive <b>man</b> could be <b>the</b> source of infection in the HIV- 1 -positive child, as claimed by the authorities. We conducted genetic analysis of three {{different parts of the}} HIV- 1 genome (gag, pol, and env) by PCR, direct-sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses. We used maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and neigh-bor-joining methods for the phylogenetic analyses to investigate whether <b>the</b> sequences <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and <b>the</b> child were related. We found that <b>the</b> viral sequences <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and <b>the</b> child formed separate clusters in all of the phylogenetic analyses compared to the local controls. A unique amino acid deletion was identified in the C 2 -V 3 -C 3 region of the env gene in <b>the</b> virus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and <b>the</b> child. These results were used in the criminal court to elucidate whether <b>the</b> virus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> was related to <b>the</b> virus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> child. In summary, <b>the</b> results <b>from</b> <b>the</b> phylogenetic analyses, the sequence distances between <b>the</b> virus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and <b>the</b> virus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> child, and the identification of the unique molecular fingerprint in the env gene together indicated that <b>the</b> virus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and <b>the</b> virus <b>from</b> <b>the</b> child were epidemiologically linked.

5|$|Though women Friends {{had since}} the 1660s {{publicly}} preached, written and led, and traditional Quaker tenets held {{that men and}} women were equals, Quaker women met separately <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> to consider and decide a congregation's business. By the 1840s, some Hicksite Quakers determined to bring women and men together in their business meetings as an expression of their spiritual equality. In June 1848, approximately 200Hicksites, including the Hunts and the M'Clintocks, formed an even more radical Quaker group, known as the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends, or Progressive Friends. The Progressive Friends intended to further elevate the influence of women in affairs of the faith. They introduced joint business meetings of men and women, giving women an equal voice.|$|E
5|$|Following {{reports of}} {{disciplinary}} problems, VI Corps ordered an investigation, {{which took place}} over four days while elements of the battalion were still engaged at Rittershoffen. It recommended that the battalion be withdrawn and retrained before returning to combat under a new commander, while Major-General Edward H. Brooks, the corps commander, instead recommended that the battalion be entirely disbanded and its men distributed to other units. General Alexander Patch, commanding Seventh Army, agreed with Brooks, suggesting that a new tank destroyer battalion be formed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of service units, themselves replaced by {{the men of the}} 827th. This was contentious, however; the number and status of segregated combat units was a matter of intense political debate, and converting a black combat unit to a service one, in favor of white troops, was likely controversial.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only were}} the {{advisers}} in danger from the enemy, but also <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> they commanded or advised. On 20 July 1919, like {{a number of other}} advisers subsequently, Brown was murdered by his men when they mutinied and went over to the Bolsheviks. While Brown was the only Australian to be killed, there was at least one other major mutiny among the White forces during this period, and several other Australians had narrow escapes. With these incidents becoming increasingly common, and with the ineffectiveness of such a small force in influencing the outcome of the civil war, in March 1919 {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the force. As all faith had been lost in the reliability of locally raised units, this could only be safely completed with the provision of a covering force, and until this could be raised the NREF was condemned to endure the harsh Russian winter.|$|E

5|$|Police {{seized a}} rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three pistols <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> {{at the time}} of the arrest. They were {{detained}} in Bells, Tennessee for a few days before being moved to another facility. During interrogation, the men told authorities of their plan to kill Obama. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives handled the initial federal investigation of the case. The United States Secret Service became involved in the investigation once the assassination plot was discovered. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was also involved in the investigation. Both men were charged with illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun, conspiracy to rob a firearms dealer and making threats against a presidential candidate; a superseding indictment additionally charged the pair with civil rights conspiracy and conspiracy, and charged Cowart with destruction of religious property and a related firearms charge. Authorities have found no evidence that anyone besides the two men were involved in the plot, but as of October 2008 authorities were said to be investigating the possibility.|$|E
