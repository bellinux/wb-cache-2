In this paper, the process of establishing digital <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>map</b> spatial data base was discussed at length. Firstly, the model of database was constructed. Secondly, the vector basic data was inputted, the graphic elements (such as points, lines, and so on.) were edited, errors were corrected, and the layer file was established. In the end, the attributes were connected, the projection conversion was carried, and numeric format were converted in order to forming Arc/Info and Arcview format. So the digital <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>map</b> spatial database was established. The important basic data for spatial analysis and all-purpose development can be obtained from this database.

The work has analyzed the lithological features of the outcropping rocks and their attitude to be crossed by the meteoric waters. Geologic-structural analysis has allowed to identify elements that can constitute the hydraulic barriers and the hydrogeological complexes that can contain the aquifers. A detailed analysis of base flow was carried out through hydrogeological survey directly performed in the river. The hydrogeological survey has allowed us: 1) to appraise the river's base flow; 2) to identify the punctual and linear springs; 3) to quantify the water resource on average drained; and 4) to determine the discharge regime of springs and rivers. The Conceptual Hydrogeological Model for each individual aquifer have been derived from geologic-structural analysis and hydrogeological studies. The Conceptual Hydrogeological Models allowed us to calculate the Mean Effective Infiltration (Ieff) of every aquifer. The values of Ieff are gathered in classes.

40|$|This {{contribution}} shows, {{through some}} examples, {{that the current}} instability processes sometimes do not completely correspond (concerning presence, location, state of activity and/or extent) with those <b>mapped</b> by PTCP <b>Hydrogeological</b> Hazard <b>Maps,</b> which is the document used by the Province Administration for its territorial planning. The differences highlighted are due to different causes. One {{of them is the}} fact that the PTCP <b>Hydrogeological</b> Hazard <b>Maps</b> are practically derived from the Regional Geological maps in which superficial deposits have secondary importance, while bedrock and structural-tectonic aspects are given the highest relevance. Another cause is represented by the very active and intense geomorphological dynamics of the Apennines which may produce or reactivate instability conditions. An important aspect to underline is that the PTCP <b>Hydrogeological</b> Hazard <b>Maps</b> identify areas with planning constraints, which have effects at a municipal scale; it does so by starting from a cartographical basis whose primary aim is not the definition of instability processes and whose updating is not homogeneous. Taking into account this aspect, the PTCP <b>Hydrogeological</b> Hazard <b>Maps</b> should be updated not only on the base of traditional geological mapping, but also following the criteria of detailed geomorphological mapping which can precisely define the genesis, dynamics and morphometry of instability phenomena. An important consideration, in relation to territorial planning, is that the PTCP <b>Hydrogeological</b> Hazard <b>Maps</b> should be used just as a "base document", which requires more necessary detailed deepening at the municipal scale, accomplished through accurate geomorphological mapping, at least for the areas that are going to be urbanized.

Within the project area, east of Mbale, Gravity Fed water distribution Systems (GFS), fed by high altitude springs, are being developed as a cost effective, low maintenance method of supplying moderately large villages. Three typical GFS were visited on the lower slopes of Mount Elgon. Meetings were held at the GFS section of the Directorate of Water Development in Kampala on 11 th and 15 th September and at the RUWASA project offices in Mbale on 14 th September where topics discussed included:  Application of horizontal drilling to GFS.  Development of groundwater development potential maps.  Application of collector well systems in weathered granite and sand river environments.  Community self monitoring of groundwater resources.  Groundwater from low permeability rocks in sub-Saharan Africa. The conclusions of the field visits and meetings included: (1) Horizontal drilling cannot be undertaken to enhance the yields of GFS as presently designed due to access problems. However, {{there is a need}} to assess the potential for drilling horizontal drains into the lower slopes at accessible locations for provision of more sustainable supplies at higher discharge rates away from present spring systems. Such systems should not be greatly affected by seasonal rainfall/water level fluctuations and the effects of prolonged drought. BGS could assist RUWASA in the development of such schemes using procedures developed in St Helena, and within collector well systems constructed in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and Botswana. (2) RUWASA have compiled a comprehensive hydrogeological database that needs to be analysed and used to produce <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>maps</b> designed to meet the needs of district users as a pilot project. The systems and map production method developed could then be applied to other districts in Uganda and ultimately to the production of a series of national <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>maps.</b> BGS could advise RUWASA on the production of hydrogeological and groundwater development potential maps using technologies developed in the UK and Nigeria. (3) Hydrogeological survey data collection and storage systems in Uganda need to be upgraded along the lines of those developed for the KaR project in Tanzania and Ghana. These methods need to be applied with the full participation of communities who in turn should be encouraged to undertake self-monitoring of their own water supply systems in the long term.

40|$|Data and {{information}} required by hydrogeological studies are various and complex such as geology, topography, climate, hydrological and hydrogeological raw or pre-processed data. All these data {{need to be}} managed, and {{this can be done}} in a structured database. A (GIS-managed) hydrogeological database has been developed previously by the Hydrogeology Group of the University of Liège (Gogu et al., 2001) in order to capture, store, edit, query, update and display geographically referenced hydrogeological data. The development of this geo-relational database was constrained by a maximum storage of data with a minimum data redundancy, reduction of storage memory capacity and optimum ‘retrievability’ of information for further analysis. In recent years, the use of Geographical Information System (GIS) has grown rapidly in groundwater management and research. GIS is now widely used to create digital geographic databases, to manipulate and prepare data as input for various model parameters, and to display model output. Coupling GIS with this hydrogeological database provides a powerful tool. This GIS-managed hydrogeological database has been also developed for vulnerability-assessment techniques and numerical modelling for groundwater flow and contaminant transport studies. As well as linking between database and GIS, the design of coupling database with process-based numerical models was also performed. This methodology has been applied, in a semi-arid region: the "Oulmès plateau" located in the Mid-Atlas (Morocco).

40|$|Globalization and {{planetary}} environmental changes have stimulated {{the inventory of}} groundwater resources and biodiversity at continental and global scales {{but there has been}} no concurrent attempt to map the distribution of groundwater habitats even at continental scale. A vector version of the areal information contained in the international <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>map</b> of Europe (IHME) was produced, and thematic indicators for assessing its accuracy were established.

The habitat map was used to test for latitudinal variations in habitat diversity (HD) and whether these variations might in part account for the latitudinal gradient of regional species richness. The HD of river catchments decreased significantly with increasing latitude after correcting for the effect of catchment area. HD decreased by half the amount of deviance attributed to latitude in a regression model of regional species richness, although the explanatory power of HD was probably limited by the coarse resolution of biogeographical regions.

Conceptual and applied analyses bearing on engineering geologi-cal, <b>hydrogeological</b> <b>mapping,</b> and zoning of vulnerability to mass wasting were conducted for nearly a 16, 000 -km 2 area of the Jemma River basin, central Ethiopian highlands. Work was aimed at the specific modification of current methodology and its practical field testing, user-oriented information dissemination, and training of Ethiopian staff in geo-hazard assessment. Also, environmental protection studies and water resources management to improve food and sanitary security were provided. An alternative, conceptual energy-process and land unit-oriented and satellite images implementing method was developed to substitute for the inadequacy of information by regular field check and regular inventory of risky phenomena. It is necessary to implement a novel, complex systems paradigm to tackle vulnerability and risks in couplings of nature and human systems. This is discussed together with emphasis on user-oriented communication and building of geo-risk warning and management systems based on bottom-up, contextual approach...|$|R
