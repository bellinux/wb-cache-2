50|$|In animal {{models of}} disease and injury, CARP has been {{characterized}} to be a stress-inducible myofibrillar protein. CARP {{has been shown to}} play a role in skeletal muscle structure remodeling, and repair, being expressed in skeletal muscle near myotendinous junctions, and in vascular smooth muscle cells, as a downstream target of TGF-beta/Smad sigmaling in response to balloon injury and atherosclerotic plaques. Further studies have identified a role for CARP in initiation and regulation of arteriogenesis. Decreased expression of CARP in cardiac cells within the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> was detected in a rat model of ischemic injury, and was thought to be linked to the induction of GADD153, an apoptosis-related gene. In cardiomyocytes treated with doxorubicin, a model of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, CARP mRNA and protein levels were depleted, myofilament gene transcription was attenuated and sarcomeres showed significant disarray.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The delayed {{phase of}} {{ventricular}} arrhythmias during acute ischemia (phase- 1 b arrhythmia) {{is associated with}} depletion of catecholamines and cell-to-cell uncoupling between depressed depolarized intramural <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> and surviving cells in subepicardium and subendocardium. In the present study we determined the effects of uncoupling and catecholamines on development of proarrhythmic afterdepolarizations. METHODS: Depressed depolarized <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> was simulated by a passive electronic circuit with a potential of - 73, - 53, - 33 or - 13 mV. Using patch-clamp methodology, single sheep Purkinje and ventricular cells were coupled to the simulated <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> via a variable conductance. By varying coupling conductance, {{we were able to}} selectively study the effects of various degrees of uncoupling. RESULTS: At strong coupling, cells were inexcitable and depolarized to potentials near those of the simulated <b>ischemic</b> <b>region.</b> Excitability, action potential duration and resting potential increased with progressive uncoupling. In a critical range of uncoupling, ventricular and "high-plateau" Purkinje cells developed early afterdepolarizations when the potential of the simulated <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> was - 13 mV. Norepinephrine (1 microM) frequently induced early and delayed afterdepolarizations in both ventricular and Purkinje cells, but these afterdepolarizations were only present during uncoupling when the potential of the simulated <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> was - 33 mV or more positive. CONCLUSIONS: In a critical range of uncoupling, afterdepolarizations were present when the potential of the simulated <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> was - 33 or - 13 mV, suggesting that triggered activity plays a role in phase- 1 b arrhythmias when surviving layers uncouple from a highly depolarized intramural ischemic regio...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of the ischemic left ventricle during a complete cardiac cycle were simulated using a finite-element model accounting for the thick-walled ventricular geometry, the fibrous nature of the myocardial tissue, and the dependency of active muscle fiber stress on time, strain, and strain rate. Ischemia was modeled by disabling the generation of active stress in a region comprising approximately 12 % of total wall volume. In the model simulations, the approximately 12 % reduction {{in the amount of}} normally contracting tissue resulted in an approximately 25 % reduction in stroke work compared with the normal situation. The more-than-proportional loss of stroke work may partly be attributed to storage of elastic energy in the bulging <b>ischemic</b> <b>region.</b> Furthermore the mechanical performance in the nonischemic border zone deteriorated because of reduced systolic fiber stress (if fibers were in series with those in the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region)</b> or reduced fiber shortening (if fibers were parallel). The deformation pattern of the ventricle was asymmetric with respect to the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> because of the anisotropy of the myocardial tissue.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyze the effects of acute angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on myocardial blood flow (MBF) in control and <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions.</b> BACKGROUND: Although animal studies indicate an improvement of MBF to <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions</b> after ACE inhibition, this effect has not been conclusively demonstrated in patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS: Myocardial blood flow was analyzed in <b>ischemic</b> and nonischemic <b>regions</b> of 10 symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease using repetitive [15 O] water positron emission tomography at rest and during maximal dobutamine stress before and after ACE inhibition with quinaprilat 10 mg IV. To exclude the possibility that repetitive ischemia may cause an increase in MBF, eight patients underwent the same protocol without quinaprilat (placebo patients). RESULTS: Rate pressure product in control and quinaprilat patients was comparable. In placebo patients, repetitive dobutamine stress did not change MBF to <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions</b> (1. 41 ± 0. 17 during the first stress vs. 1. 39 ± 0. 19 ml/min/g during the second stress, p = 0. 93). In contrast, MBF in <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions</b> increased significantly after acute ACE inhibition with quinaprilat during repetitive dobutamine stress (1. 10 ± 0. 13 vs. 1. 69 ± 0. 17 ml/min/g, p < 0. 015). Dobutamine coronary reserve in <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions</b> remained unchanged in placebo patients (1. 07 ± 0. 11 vs. 1. 10 ± 0. 16, p = 0. 92), but increased significantly after quinaprilat (0. 97 ± 0. 10 vs. 1. 44 ± 0. 14, p < 0. 002). Total coronary resistance decreased after ACE inhibition (123 ± 19 vs. 71 ± 10 mm Hg · min · g/ml, p < 0. 02).

40|$|Brain {{temperature}} is elevated in acute ischemic stroke, {{especially in the}} ischemic penumbra (IP). We attempted to investigate the dynamic evolution of brain temperature in different <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions</b> in a monkey model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The brain temperature of different <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions</b> was measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H MRS), and the evolution processes of brain temperature were compared among different <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions.</b> We found that the normal (baseline) brain temperature of the monkey brain was 37. 16 °C. In the artery occlusion stage, the mean brain temperature of ischemic tissue was 1. 16 °C higher than the baseline; however, this increase was region dependent, with 1. 72 °C in the IP, 1. 08 °C in the infarct core, and 0. 62 °C in the oligemic region. After recanalization, the brain temperature of the infarct core showed a pattern of an initial decrease accompanied by a subsequent increase. However, the brain temperature of the IP and oligemic region showed a monotonously and slowly decreased pattern.

40|$|Introduction: Nitric oxide {{seems to}} play a dual role in ischemia/reperfusion injury. Few studies have {{investigated}} whether it exacerbates or improves brain edema. In the present study, we inhibited the activity of nitric oxide synthase by L-NAME and evaluated the cerebral infarct volume, tissue swelling and brain edema, alongside the measurement of blood flow of the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region.</b> Methods: Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 12 hours reperfusion in rat. Experiments were performed in three groups of rats (n= 12 each) Sham, control ischemic, and L-NAME pretreated (1 mg/kg IP). Laser Doppler flowmetry {{was used to measure}} the regional blood flow. After neurological deficit score (NDS) testing, the brains were prepared for TTC staining or brain water content technique to measure the infarct volume and brain edema. Results: Pretreatment with L-NAME significantly reduced NDS (3. 66 ± 0. 33 to 1. 5 ± 0. 34), infarct volume of cortex (374 ± 34 to 160 ± 41 mm 3) and striatum (158 ± 15 to 87 ± 16 mm 3), tissue swelling (7. 35 ± 1. 27 % to 4. 05 ± 0. 91 %) and brain edema (3. 5 ± 0. 48 % to 1. 6 ± 0. 6 %) without significant alteration of blood flow of the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region.</b> Conclusion: The findings {{of this study indicate that}} inhibition of nitric oxide synthase activity reduces infarct volume and brain edema of the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> induced during 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion.

Historically, this {{has proven to}} be a difficult task when using a general geometry, so our approach is to assume a priori that we can approximate the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> as a ball. The approximation has been viewed from both a theoretical stand as well as more practically with numerical simulations. First, the theoretical continuity properties of the system with the simplified geometry were explored, followed by several numerical simulations to illuminate the practical behavior with this geometry. We did find a theoretical stability, as well as promising numerical results. From a small compact domain of the heart, we have proved a continuous inverse. In addition, we found a necessary demand for uniqueness of the inverse solution throughout the entire heart – which then also guarantee continuity. Numerically, we were able to retrieve the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> without noise as well as with a proper amount of noise on our synthetic forward data. These findings are interesting to pursuit further. Since we worked on synthetic data in this thesis, it will be of great importance to further work with true patient data to see how well we can approximate the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> in a real case. Also, the key point of this thesis was to gain more stability. In theory we found this to be stable, but we do not know how stable it is when it comes to numerical simulations.

BackgroundWe recently have reported that G-CSF prevents cardiac remodeling and dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction in mice and swine. It remains unclear whether G-CSF has beneficial effects on chronic myocardial ischemia. MethodsAn ameroid constrictor was placed on left circumflex coronary artery of swine. The presence of myocardial ischemia was verified at four weeks after the operation, and the animals were randomly assigned into the following two groups: 1) administration of vehicle (control group, n = 10), and 2) administration of G-CSF (10 μg/kg/day) for seven days (G-CSF group, n = 10). ResultsEchocardiographic examination revealed that the G-CSF treatment prevented left ventricular dilation and dysfunction at eight weeks after the operation. Stress echocardiography revealed that G-CSF ameliorated the regional contractility of chronic myocardial ischemia. Morphological analysis revealed that the extent of myocardial fibrosis of the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> was less in the G-CSF group than in control group. There were more vessels and less apoptotic cells at the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> of the heart of the G-CSF group than control group. Moreover, Akt 1 was more strongly activated in the heart of the G-CSF group than control group.

However, how ischemic preconditioning(IP) affects the density of ryanodine receptors remains uncertain. To clarify the effect of IP on ryanodine receptors, the density of high-affinity 3 H-ryanodine binding sites and thedissociation constant for ryanodine of the myocardium were examined in anesthetized open chest dogs with or without IP. Group S(n= 6); 5 minute-inchemia was followed by 10 minute-reperfusion as IP. Group C(n= 5); 20 minute-inchemia was performed without IP. GroupP(n= 6); 20 minute-inchemia was perfomed following IP. Myocardium from risk and non-risk areas were obtained for the subsequent purification of sarcoplasmic reticulum misrosomal fraction. Hemodynamic parameters showed no significant differences between group C and group P after 20 -minute ischemia. However, density of ryanodine receptors in <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> was significantly reduced in group C compared to that in non-ischemic region (7. 3 ± 0. 7 versus 11. 3 ± 1. 4 pmol/mg protein; p < 0. 05).

The study focused on hemodynamic effects, myocardial blood flow in normal and <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions,</b> cerebral perfusion, and peripheral organ perfusion. METHODS: We placed a stenosis on the lateral branch of the coronary artery to reduce flow 50 % (sheep). Measurements included hemodynamic changes, myocardial blood flow, and organ flow (colored microspheres) at baseline, after stenosis, during IABP support, and during ICS support. RESULTS: Counterpulsation with the ICS led to a significantly higher peak diastolic aortic augmentation than with the IABP (IABP, 99 +/- 14 mm Hg; ICS, 140 +/- 29 mm Hg; p = 0. 003). There was no significant change in cerebral perfusion or peripheral organ perfusion. Myocardial blood perfusion was significantly increased by the IABP as well as the ICS. This effect was seen in <b>ischemic</b> and nonischemic <b>regions</b> (subendocardial and subepicardial).

In response to ischemia, the brain showed swelling due to traumatic injury to the brain. The optical image indicates the ischemic area (A, dotted red line).

40|$|SUMMARY. Under certain conditions, a {{progressive}} increase in vascular resistance occurs within ischemic myocardium {{during the first}} 3 hours after coronary artery stenosis. We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} increased resistance is due to local release of a vasoconstrictor substance in the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region.</b> Relative ischemia was produced in anesthetized dogs by a combination of acute coronary arterial stenosis and increased myocardial metabolism. A hydraulic occluder on the left anterior descending coronary artery was adjusted to maintain distal left anterior descending coronary artery pressure at 50 mm Hg during atrial pacing at 180 beats/min. Myocardial blood flows were measured with 15 fim microspheres after 30 and 180 minutes of relative ischemia. During this time, transmural left anterior descending coronary artery flow decreased by an average of 30 %. Infusion of adenosine into the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> after 180 minutes produced a 74 ± 17 % increase in flow, indicating the presence of substantial vasodilator reserve. Stimulation of metabolism in the ischemic area by norepinephrine infusion increased flow by 54 ± 17 %. Indomethacin treatment after 180 minutes of ischemia, however, caused left anterior descending coronary artery flow to decrease by 22 ± 8 %. a-Receptor blockade (phenoxybenzamine) in the left anterior descending coronary artery bed prior to ischemia prevented the flow decrease between 30 and 180 minutes. Phentolamine administration after 180 minutes also resulted in increased left anterior descending coronary artery flow. However, the addition of propranolol to phenoxybenzamine-treated hearts reversed the vasodilatory influence of phenoxybenzamine, resulting in a flow decrease within the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> similar to that seen without any pharmacological intervention. We conclude that during 3 hours of relative ischemia in this preparation, blood vessels in the ischemic area (1) are not maximally dilated, and (2) undergo {{a progressive}} vasoconstriction via an unknown mechanism. Phenoxybenzamine prevents the pro-gressive vasoconstriction, apparently by increasing norepinephrine release. (Circ Res 51 : 411 - 420...|$|E

The profile of ionic concentrations across the border zone {{play a significant role in}} determining cellular electrophysiology and conductivity, yet their spatial-temporal evolution and regulation are not well understood. To investigate the changes in ion concentrations that regulate cellular electrophysiology, a mathematical model of ion movement in the intra and extracellular space in the presence of ionic, potential and material property heterogeneities was developed. The model simulates the spatial and temporal evolution of concentrations of potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, hydrogen and bicarbonate ions and carbon dioxide across an ischemic border zone. Ischemia was simulated by sodium-potassium pump inhibition, potassium channel activation and respiratory and metabolic acidosis. The model predicted significant disparities in the width of the border zone for each ionic species, with intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium having discordant gradients, facilitating multiple gradients in cellular properties across the border zone. Extracellular potassium was found to have the largest border zone and this was attributed to the voltage dependence of the potassium channels.

Recent studies have demonstrated some neuroprotective roles of crocin in different models of experimental cerebral ischemia. Here, we investigated the probable neuroprotective effects of crocin on the brain infarction and histopathological changes after transient model of focal cerebral ischemia. Materials and Methods: Experiment was performed in four groups of rats (each group; n= 8), sham, control ischemia and ischemia treated rats. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 80 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 hr reperfusion. Crocin, at doses 50 and 80 mg/kg, was injected at the beginning of ischemia (IP injection). Neurologic outcome (Neurological Deficit Score, NDS scale), infarct volume (TTC staining) and histological studies were assessed 24 hr after termination of MCAO. Results: Treatment with crocin, at doses 50 and 80 mg/kg, significantly reduced the cortical infarct volume by 48 % and 60 %, and also decreased striatal infarct volume by 45 % and 75 %, respectively. Crocin at two different doses significantly improved the NDS of ischemic rats.

In this paper, we introduce a variational TV-prior and, when combined with the iteratively re-weighted least-square concept, a new algorithm to TV minimization that is computationally efficient and robust to the discretization resolution. In a large set of simulation studies as well as two initial real-data studies, we show that the use of the proposed TV prior outperforms L 2 -based penalties in reconstruct <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions,</b> and it shows higher robustness and efficiency compared to the commonly used discrete TV prior. We also investigate the performance of the proposed TV-prior in combination with a L 2 - versus L 1 -based data fidelity term. The proposed method can extend TV-minimization to a border range of applications that involves physical domains of complex shape and unstructured volumetric mesh. I...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} a completely developed reperfused myocardial infarction model on beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness, we induced a 90 -min regional ischemia followed by 72 h of reperfusion in dog hearts. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined after 60 min of ischemia using radioactive microspheres. beta-adrenoceptor density was reduced in the ischemic endocardium (95 +/- 16 fmol/mg) and epicardium (160 +/- 13 fmol/mg) compared to the nonischemic region (304 +/- 21 fmol/mg). beta-adrenoceptor density in the ischemic endocardium varied with the degree of collateral blood flow measured (r 2 = 0. 79, P< 0. 05); this relation was the opposite of that in the ischemic epicardium (r 2 = 0. 77, P< 0. 05). Higher levels of tissue catecholamines and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK 2) were observed in the ischemic epicardium as compared to nonischemic tissue. Forskolin-induced adenylyl cyclase activities were depressed in both <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions</b> as compared to nonischemic region, correlating with a reduction in regional myocardial blood flow. Using forskolin stimulation as covariate, no difference in isoproterenol-induced adenylyl cyclase activity was identified in the different regions. It is concluded that cAMP production induced by beta-adrenoceptor activation is dependent upon adenylyl cyclase enzyme activity rather than beta-adrenoceptor density in the ischemic myocardium. However, the density of the beta-adrenoceptor in the viable <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions</b> can be modified by the presence of GRK 2 and tissue catecholamines, an index of regional sympathetic efferent postganglionic nerve terminal activity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The inverse {{problem of}} {{electrocardiography}} (IPE) has been formulated {{in different ways}} in order to non invasively obtain valuable informations about the heart condition. Most of the formulations solve the IPE neglecting the dynamic behavior of the electrical wave prop-agation in the heart. In this work we take into account this dynamic behavior by constraining the cost function with the monodomain model. We use an iterative algorithm combined with a level set formulation {{and the use of}} a simple phenomenological model. This method has been pre-viously presented to localize ischemic regions in a 2 D cardiac tissue. In this work, we analyze the performance of this method in different 3 D geometries. The inverse procedure exploits the spatiotemporal correla-tions contained in the observed data, which is formulated as a parametric adjust of a mathematical model that minimizes the misfit between the simulated and the observed data. Numerical results over 3 D geometries show that the algorithm is capable of identifying the position {{and the size of the}} ischemic regions. For the experiments with a realistic anatomical geometry, we reconstruct the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> with roughly a 47 % of false-positive rate and a 13 % false-negative rate under 10 % of input noise. The correlation coefficient between the reconstructed <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> and the ground truth exceeds the value of 0. 70). ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Transplantation {{of human}} neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSPCs) is a {{promising}} method to regenerate tissue from damage and recover function in various neurological diseases including brain ischemia. Galectin- 1 (Gal 1) is a lectin that {{is expressed in}} damaged brain areas after ischemia. Here, we characterized the detailed Gal 1 expression pattern in an animal model of brain ischemia. After brain ischemia, Gal 1 was expressed in reactive astrocytes within and around the infarcted region, and its expression diminished over time. Previously, we showed that infusion of human Gal 1 protein (hGal 1) resulted in functional recovery after brain ischemia but failed to reduce {{the volume of the}} <b>ischemic</b> <b>region.</b> This prompted us to examine whether the combination of hNSPCs-transplantation and stable delivery of hGal 1 around the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> could reduce the ischemic volume and promote better functional recovery after brain ischemia. In this study, we transplanted hNSPCs that stably overexpressed hGal 1 (hGal 1 -hNSPCs) in a model of unilateral focal brain ischemia using Mongolian gerbils. Indeed, we found that transplantation of hGal 1 -hNSPCs both reduced the ischemic volume and improved deficits in motor function after brain ischemia {{to a greater extent than}} the transplantation of hNSPCs alone. This study provides evidence for a potential application of hGal 1 with hNSPCs-transplantation in the treatment of brain ischemia. </p...|$|E
40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to study morphological, functional, and {{metabolic}} changes induced by chronic ischemia in myocardium supplied by the stenotic vessel and in the remote area by MR techniques. A new technique of image fusion is proposed for analysis of coronary artery stenosis involving coronary MR angiography and spectroscopic imaging. Cine-MRI was performed 2 wk after induction of coronary stenosis. Global heart function and regional wall thickening were determined in 11 Wistar rats with stenosis and compared with 7 control rats. Two weeks after stenosis was induced, spin-labeling MRI for measurement of perfusion was performed in 14 isolated hearts. In eight isolated hearts with coronary stenosis, MR spectroscopy was performed, followed by angiography. 31 P metabolite maps were fused with three-dimensional coronary angiograms. Induction of stenosis led to reduced segmental wall thickening (control: 75 +/- 9 %, ischemic region: 9 +/- 3 %, P < 0. 05 vs. control) but also to impaired function of the remote region and lower cardiac output. Perfusion was reduced by 74. 9 +/- 4. 0 % within ischemic segments compared with a septal control region. The phosphocreatine (PCr) /ATP ratio as a marker of ischemia was reduced in the region associated with stenosis (1. 09 +/- 0. 09) compared with remote (1. 27 +/- 0. 08) and control hearts (1. 43 +/- 0. 08; P < 0. 05). The histological fraction of fibrosis within the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> (12. 8 +/- 1. 4 %) correlated to ATP signal reduction from remote to the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> (r = 0. 71, P < 0. 05), but not to reduced wall thickening. Coronary narrowing caused declining function accompanied by diminished PCr/ATP, indicating impaired energy metabolism. Neither decline of function nor PCr signal decline correlated to fraction of fibrosis in histology. In contrast, reduction of ATP correlated to fibrosis and therefore to loss of viability. Impaired function within the <b>ischemic</b> <b>region</b> is associated with decreased PCr. Function of the remote region was affected as well. The fusion of PCr metabolite maps and the coronary angiogram may help to assess coronary morphology and resulting metabolic changes simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Effect of TMPZ on nitrotyrosine {{expression}} in <b>ischemic</b> cerebral <b>regions</b> The formation of nitrotyrosine {{in the brain}} was detected as described previously [1] with some modifications. In brief, following brain reperfusion, each post-anesthetic rat was perfusion-fixed with a 4 % paraformaldehyde solution. Brains were removed and dehydrated with 30 % sucrose. Samples were coronally cut into serial 10 -µm-thick sections (0. 3 mm from the bregma) for immunohistofluorescent staining. Non-specific binding sites were blocked with 2 % BSA, then sections were incubated for 2 h with a primary anti-nitrotyrosine mAb (1 : 50; Cayman). Sections were then incubated for 1 h with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1 : 100; Amersham). Areas of the cortex of brain sections were captured using a digital color CCD camera (CoolSNAP-Pro cf) and Image-Pro Plus software 4. 5. (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The nitrotyrosine level was evaluated as a marker of peroxynitrite accumulation in the penumbra of brain <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions.</b> Peroxynitrite is generated {{by a combination of}} NO and superoxide in the ischemic penumbra [2].

25|$|Though {{nitric oxide}} (NO) is {{commonly}} used by the nervous system in inter-neuron communication and signaling, it can be active in mechanisms leading to ischemia in the cerebrum (Iadecola 1998). The neurotoxicity of NO is based on its importance in glutamate excitotoxicity, as NO is generated in a calcium-dependent manner in response to glutamate mediated NMDA activation, which occurs at an elevated rate in glutamate excitotoxicity. Though NO facilitates increased blood flow to potentially <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions</b> of the brain, it is also capable of increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage and apoptosis. Thus an increased presence of NO in an ischemic area of the CNS can produce significantly toxic effects.|$|R
30|$|In {{analogy to}} the {{intracranial}} hypertension syndrome, a sudden increase in fluid volume inside the renal parenchyma {{can result in}} a substantial intrarenal pressure and, as a consequence, a decrease in the renal perfusion pressure [3]. In effect, acutely injured kidneys where edema is present typically involve <b>ischemic</b> <b>regions</b> of the outer medulla due to a reduction in the vascular inflow [4],[5]. From a clinical perspective, the venous congestion due to an increase of the vascular permeability to proteins, as well as the decrease of the intrarenal perfusion pressure increase the risk of developing a new or persistent septic acute kidney injury (AKI) [6].|$|R
