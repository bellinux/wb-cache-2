40|$|Franchising is a {{business}} form where an organization, or franchisor, with a market-tested business model enters into a contractual relationship with franchisees, independent firms which operate under the franchisor’s trade name using this proven business model. Different types of franchises include service franchises, product <b>franchises,</b> and <b>distribution</b> <b>franchises.</b> Franchising is a replication strategy that allows the franchisor to grow and penetrate new markets with less investment of its own capital than would be required for other forms of expansion. It also reduces some of the risk associated with starting {{a business}} for the franchisee as it builds on a model {{that has already been}} tested. Franchising has been applied to social enterprises as well as private enterprises. Franchising can enhance social enterprises by helping them achieve economies of scale that contribute to their viability and profit and by enabling replication that increases their scale and social impact.

40|$|Most franchisors charge an {{advertising}} fee {{in addition to}} the better known royalty and franchise fee. We study the role of the advertising fee in improving channel coordination. We begin our analysis with a simple case of one franchisor dealing with two identical franchisees and find that the advertising fee allows the franchisor to commit to a specific level of advertising spending at the time of contract acceptance. We also find that the lump-sum advertising fee is better than the sales-based advertising fee. These results are intriguing because most franchisors use the sales-based advertising fee. We show that when franchisees' markets differ in how advertising affects sales, the franchisor may prefer the sales-based advertising fee. There are two reasons for the higher profitability of the sales-based advertising fee. First, the sales-based advertising fee conditions the franchisor's advertising decision on the franchisees' price and service decisions, and induces them to make better price and service decisions. The second reason is that with heterogeneous franchisees, using the sales-based advertising fee does not increase the total sales-based component in the fee structure. These results also hold when the franchisor pledges to contribute a matching fraction of the advertising fee to the advertising fund. channels of <b>distribution,</b> <b>franchising...</b>|$|R

In each concession award process a distribution geographical area is defined and minimum consumer coverage targets are established. Bidders present technical and financial proposals, including a market demand study. The winning proposal must be technically sound and offer the lowest average revenue for the first five-year period. Densely populated geographic areas pose a problem for exclusivity in distribution. If the concession is granted to a single firm, scale economies might be very attractive, but regulating a mega-monopoly would be difficult. If the distribution area is subdivided, economies of scale decrease while information for comparative regulation increases.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{explaining}} governance structure variety in franchising, we explore the impact of governance structure on the incentives to invest in specific assets for the franchisor {{as well as the}} distributors. Wholly-owned, wholly-franchised, and mixed (dual <b>distribution)</b> <b>franchise</b> systems are considered. Circumstances are identified when a dual distribution governance structure uniquely allocates efficient ownership over assets. Whether dual distribution benefits are realized in a franchise or a cooperative franchise depends on whether most value is added upstream or downstream. A disadvantage of a dual distribution system is the deterioration of the investment incentives of the party having no authority, i. e. either the company-owned outlet manager in a traditional franchise or the franchisor in a cooperative franchise. A wholly-franchised system may therefore be efficient even when unique dual distribution benefits are present. A necessary condition for the efficiency of a dual distribution governance structure is a positive systemic effect, not the value of the brand name or location (or other) differences between outlets.

40|$|Two sets of {{competing}} theories {{have been proposed}} to explain the existence offranchising; one set based on resource constraints and another on incentives issues. As individual franchise systems mature, these theories predict dryerent patterns {{in the evolution of}} the mix offranchisedand company-owned outlets.

The jindings generally support the incentives-based rationale for franchising, but they also support a modified resource constraint theory, one which recognizes the synergistic efSects of dual <b>distribution.</b> <b>franchise</b> systems, like other organizations, have life cycles that predict various aspects of their structure and processes. More specifically, they reasoned that the resource scarcity that drove expanding chain retailers to embrace franchising early in their system’s life cycle would lessen as the system became more established. The costs associated with managing franchisees gradually would outweigh the benefits associated with the resources that the franchisees provided, and the systems would move toward chains of company-owned, rather than franchised, outlets.
