40|$|The aim of {{this book}} is the {{investigation}} of the hyperplanes of thick <b>dual</b> <b>polar</b> spaces. We begin with a few definitions. A <b>dual</b> <b>polar</b> space ∆ of finite rank n is the dual geometry of a non-degenerate polar space Π of finite rank n. The points of ∆ are the maximal, i. e. the (n − 1) -dimensional, singular subspaces of Π, the lines of ∆ are the (n − 2) -dimensional singular subspaces of Π, and more generally for i = 0, [...] ., n − 1, the elements of type i of ∆ are the (n − 1 − i) -dimensional singular subspaces of Π. The lower residue of an element of ∆ of type t with 2 ≤ t < n is a <b>dual</b> <b>polar</b> space of rank t. The elements of type 0, 1, 2, 3 and n − 1 are called points, lines, quads, hexes, respectively maxes. A hyperplane of a geometry of points and lines is a proper subspace that meets every line. Every hyperplane of a <b>dual</b> <b>polar</b> space is a maximal subspace. If e: ∆ → PG(V) is a projective embedding of a <b>dual</b> <b>polar</b> space ∆ with point set P and if h is a hyperplane of PG(V), then H = {P ∈ P | e(P) ∈ h} is a hyperplane of ∆.

40|$|The {{results from}} studies on <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> ion heating due to kinetic ion beam instabilities {{and the effects}} of such ion heating on the outflow of O(+) in the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> are {{presented}} and discussed. First, the linear instabilities associated with an O(+) and H(+) <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> plasma in the presence of O(+) and H(+) beams for a range of O(+) /H(+) beam densities, T(sub e) /T(sub i), and ion beam speeds were examined. Then, nonlinear heating of the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> ions was studied, using numerical simulations. The O(+) and H(+) <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> ions were modeled by isotropic Maxwellian distributions, and the electrons, O(+) beams, and H(+) beams were modeled by drifting Maxwellian distributions. The effects of the kinetic ion heating on the outflow of the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> ions were examined from the ionosphere, using a time-dependent hydrodynamic model. A numerical code to solve the O(+) and H(+) continuity and momentum equations in a flux tube from ionospheric to magnetospheric altitudes were developed. The effects of ion heating were included by allowing for the altitudinal variation of the ion temperatures in the momentum equation. The ion temperature profiles were specified based on the ion heating characteristics found from previous kinetic simulations. It was assumed that heating occurred above 1500 km and increased to a saturated value of temperature that was obtained directly from the kinetic simulation study. The characteristics of the dynamical <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> without ion heating were studied, and a flux tube on closed field lines that suddenly became open at t = 0 was simulated. Then, the effects of ion heating were included. To gain some physical insight, two limiting cases were considered: preferential H(+) heating and preferential O(+) heating.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the kinetic ion heating of the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> on the dynamic {{expansion}} of the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> outflow is investigated by incorporating the kinetic ion heating effect into a time-dependent hydrodynamic <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> model in which the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> O(+) and H(+) continuity and momentum equations are solved in a flux tube from ionospheric to magnetospheric altitudes. Two limiting cases were considered: (1) preferential O(+) escape and (2) preferential H(+) heating. It was found that ion heating does not have much effect on the escape of H(+) ions because of the limiting nature of the H(+) escape fluxes. However, O(+) heating can substantially increase the upward O(+) pressure gradient in the heating region, indicating that O(+) heating is a viable explanation for the unexpectedly large O(+) fluxes frequently observed in the polar magnetosphere...|$|R

The <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> {{is found to be}} O(+) dominated for the full altitude range considered (up to 8 R(E)). Multiple solutions are obtained for various combinations of base altitude ion temperatures and electron temperatures, such that the densities fit the Persoon et al. (1983) profile. For example, good fits to measured density profile are found for low base ion temperatures (5000 K) and high electron temperatures (9000 K), and also for unheated H(+) and O(+) (3000 K) with electron temperatures of 11, 000 K. Below 2. 8 R(E) the theoretical <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> density deviates somewhat from the r exp - 3. 85 power law.

The experiments demonstrated positive impacts of the MODIS <b>polar</b> <b>winds</b> on short- and medium-range forecasts. Large improvements were found for the Northern Hemisphere in terms of geopotential height and wind fields. And improvements in typhoon track predictions were also found. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS <b>polar</b> <b>winds</b> in the Arctic have been operationally assimilated at JMA since 27 May 2004. In this paper, details of the results from the assimilation experiments are described. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{is used to}} investigate the steady-state behavior of a fully ionized plasma encompassing the geomagnetic field lines from 1500 km to 10 earth radii, and solutions of the 16 moment system of transport equations for the <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> are obtained. For the present cases studied, results of the 13 and 16 moment simulations {{are found to be}} similar, although the temperature anisotropy is quite high. <b>Polar</b> <b>wind</b> studies reveal an electron temperature anisotropy developing around 2500 km, with the collisions keeping the electron temperature isotropic below 2500 km. Good agreement is found between the present <b>polar</b> <b>wind</b> simulations and recent observations...|$|R
