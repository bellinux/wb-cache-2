5|$|In 2006, Parker {{played the}} male lead in Rome & Jewel, a hip-hop take on Romeo and Juliet that got mothballed and re-released in 2008. Parker's title character, who <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> modern day Romeo, was a Compton youth with both {{tenderness}} and toughness. Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The New York Times. In 2007, {{he had a}} small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency that was new to him but very familiar to the audience.|$|E
5|$|John Wilson (1847) {{writes that}} the tomb lies {{about two or three}} hundred yards to the north of Jacob's Well, across the valley. He {{describes}} it as 'a small solid erection {{in the form of a}} wagon roof, over what <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> patriarch’s grave, with a small pillar or altar at each of its extremities, sometimes called the tombs of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the middle of an enclosure without a covering. Many visitors names, in the Hebrew and Samaritan characters, are written on the walls of this enclosure.' One of the inscriptions is said to intimate the tomb's repair by a Jew from Egypt, Elijah son of Meir, around 1749. Wilson adds that 'The Jews of Nablus take upon themselves the duty of keeping the tomb in order. They applied to us for a subscription to aid in making some repairs and we complied with their request'. These Hebrew and Samaritan inscriptions were still visible on the white plastered walls as late as 1980, as were small lamps in an internal recess, probably donated by Jews during the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions {{to the rest of the}} family. In surveys and studies done, most males would not like to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.|$|E

25|$|Inconsistencies {{have been}} pointed out by critics and skeptics, {{presenting}} as difficulties the different numbers and names for the same feature and different sequences for what <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same event. Responses to these criticisms include the modern documentary hypothesis, two-source hypothesis (in various guises), and assertions that the Pastoral Epistles are pseudonymous. Contrasting with these critical stances are positions supported by traditionalists, considering the texts to be consistent, with the Torah written by a single source, but the Gospels by four independent witnesses, {{and all of the}} Pauline Epistles, except possibly the Hebrews, as having been written by Paul the Apostle.|$|E
25|$|On August 2, 2016, it's been {{revealed}} that the proposed project of constructing a combined expanded convention center attached to an arena and hotel has been revived and that a $1 million feasibility study for a combined arena, hotel and expanded convention center was requested by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake from the Maryland Stadium Authority and that the Maryland Stadium Authority has approved the study. Funding {{is coming from the}} Maryland Stadium Authority ($126,667), the State of Maryland (an additional $500,000 is available immediately to fund this study), the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore ($30,000), the Greater Baltimore Committee ($30,000), and the City of Baltimore ($313,333). The study will take approximately a year to complete and is expected to be completed and released in Fall 2017. The study will look at having either just a convention center expansion and having a combined expanded convention center attached to a new arena and hotel, the study will look at the environmental, community and traffic impacts of the two proposals and what types of events the new facility will be able to attract, this study will also determine exactly how large the expanded convention center <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>The</b> new complex will be bounded by Pratt, Charles and Conway Streets. This study will not include construction and budget plans as this is just phase 1, if the state and city elects to move forward after reviewing the results of this study, that second study will put together just partial plans to obtain a cost estimate.|$|E

500|$|Then Frasier brings Sam {{home for}} dinner and {{introduces}} him to his family: his father Martin (John Mahoney) who is an ex-cop and a baseball fan of Sam Malone, his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) {{who is also a}} psychiatrist, and his housekeeper Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves). During the family introduction, Sam explains that, as mentioned in Cheers, Frasier's father {{was supposed to be a}} dead scientist and that Frasier <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only child, much to dismay of Frasier's family. Frasier explains the inconsistency, indicating that he had an argument with Martin, which motivated him into making up the [...] "dead scientist father" [...] story.|$|E
500|$|Another {{element of}} the satire focuses on what William F. Bottiglia, author of many {{published}} works on Candide, calls the [...] "sentimental foibles of the age" [...] and Voltaire's attack on them. Flaws in European culture are highlighted as Candide parodies adventure and romance clichés, mimicking {{the style of a}} picaresque novel. A number of archetypal characters thus have recognisable manifestations in Voltaire's work: Candide <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> drifting rogue of low social class, Cunégonde the sex interest, Pangloss the knowledgeable mentor and Cacambo the skilful valet. As the plot unfolds, readers find that Candide is no rogue, Cunégonde becomes ugly and Pangloss is a stubborn fool. The characters of Candide are unrealistic, two-dimensional, mechanical, and even marionette-like; they are simplistic and stereotypical. As the initially naïve protagonist eventually comes to a mature conclusion—however noncommittal—the novella is a bildungsroman, if not a very serious one.|$|E

500|$|During this conflict, Cash {{discovers that}} the Director had his family killed despite {{his promise to}} let them go. After {{watching}} their deaths on a TV set up for him by the Director, Cash vows revenge as the Director coldly tells him [...] "I'm all the family you need, now". After again facing the Innocentz in a graveyard and abandoned factory, Cash is forced to face off, in what <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> final scene of the film, against a gang of schizophrenic, sociopaths called [...] "The Smileys" [...] who have taken over an insane asylum. Here, Cash unexpectedly survives, killing the Smileys (including their leader dressed in a rabbit costume) and escaping the asylum after killing several Cerberus. As such, the Director deploys the remaining Wardogs, led by the vicious Ramirez (Chris McKinney), to hunt Cash down and kill him; from this point on, the Director no longer communicates to Cash.|$|E
500|$|Alternatively, {{publications}} like GameSpot {{thought that}} while the Arbiter and Covenant side added [...] "newfound complexity to the story", it distracted the player from Earth's fate; a panel of Halo2 reviewers argued that though the decision to humanize the Covenant {{by the introduction of}} the Arbiter was welcome, the execution in-game was lacking. The missions where the player controls the Arbiter were described as [...] "anything but easy" [...] and occasionally [...] "boring", {{due to the lack of}} human weapons to balance the gameplay. A review performed by Computer and Video Games described the time that the player controls the character as [...] " [...] crap bits when you play as an alien Arbiter" [...] and listed this as one of Halo2s flaws. Reviewer Jarno Kokko said that while he did not personally dislike playing as the character, the idea of [...] "people disliking the concept of playing on the other side in a game that <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> 'Master Chief blows up some alien scum' show" [...] was a plausible complaint. Among some fans, the character was reviled.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma...You wouldn't {{get to the end of}} a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!'
