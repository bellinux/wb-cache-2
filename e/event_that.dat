This typology uncovers the several types of surprising <b>events</b> <b>that</b> organizations may face, and contributes to the literature by suggesting that different surprises require distinct approaches. ...|$|R
50|$|Environments are {{heritable}} because genotype {{influences the}} behaviours that evoke, select, and modify {{features of the}} environment. Thus, environments less amenable to behavioural modification {{tend to be less}} heritable. For example, negative life <b>events</b> <b>that</b> are beyond the control of the individual (e.g., the death of a loved one, losing one’s home in a natural disaster) have lower heritability than negative life <b>events</b> <b>that</b> may be dependent on an individual’s behaviour (e.g., getting a divorce, getting fired from a job). Similarly, personal life <b>events</b> (i.e., <b>events</b> <b>that</b> occur directly to an individual) are more highly heritable than network life <b>events</b> (i.e., <b>events</b> <b>that</b> occur to someone within an individual’s social network, thus affecting the individual indirectly).|$|R
40|$|AbstractRisk {{identification}} {{represents one}} of the components of the risk management program.

The focus in this paper is on how risk management components are related to entity performance indicators in order to identifying <b>events</b> <b>that</b> could influence the performance and business control effectiveness. The paper suggests general procedures for identifying <b>events</b> <b>that</b> affects business performance using holistic system thinking to develop framework for identification of <b>events</b> <b>that</b> could threat the organization's ability to achieve its performance objectives. The purpose is to understand the basic fundamentals in identifying, specifying, selecting and implementing quality indicators to create a powerful management reporting. We will seek to analyze relationships between risk, performance and control indicators, define and establish a standard specification for suitable metrics to measure, monitor and manage business processes, and create holistic system model to identify <b>events</b> <b>that</b> could threaten business performance...|$|R
