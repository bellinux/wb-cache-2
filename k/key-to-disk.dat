5000|$|The {{advantage}} of <b>key-to-disk</b> systems over card punches was {{the ability to}} see the entire content of an 80 byte card on a monitor to edit and correct mistakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{system was}} mainly used for <b>key-to-disk</b> {{operations}} {{to replace the}} previously popular IBM card punches and more advanced key-to-tape systems manufactured for example by Mohawk Data Sciences (MDS) or Singer. In addition to the basic <b>key-to-disk</b> function, the proprietary operating system, called XLOS, supported indexed file operations for on-line transaction processing even with data journaling. The system was programmed in two different ways. The data entry was either described in several tables that specified {{the format of the}} input record with optional automatic data validation procedures or the indexed file operations were programmed in a special COBOL dialect with IDX and SEQ file support.|$|E
50|$|<b>Key-to-disk</b> {{systems were}} systems that took data entered by users from keypunch-like {{keyboards}} {{and held the}} information on a hard disk. The information was then transferred from disk to 1/2 inch tape for processing on the user's mainframe equipment.|$|E
50|$|Model 74 (1974) Keybatch was a RJE {{terminal}} with <b>key-to-disk</b> capabilities. These direct {{data entry}} (DDE) devices {{consisted of a}} keyboard and a 256 characters display. Dial-up remote data entry terminal were available in 1975. In 1977 the Canadian branch developed support for Optical Mark Reader device OMR.|$|E
5000|$|Inforex Inc. {{corporation}} manufactured {{and sold}} <b>key-to-disk</b> {{systems in the}} 1970s and mid-1980s. The company was founded by ex-IBM engineers to develop direct data entry systems that allowed information to be entered on terminals and stored directly on disk drives, replacing punched cards and keypunch machines which had been the dominant tools for data entry {{since the turn of}} the twentieth century.|$|E
50|$|Pertec's {{primary line}} of {{computer}} products {{was aimed at}} the <b>key-to-disk</b> minicomputer systems that were used as front-end data processors for the IBM 360/370 and similar systems. This line was opened {{in the first half}} of the 1970s by the Pertec PCC-2100 data entry system, which was essentially different from the PCC-2000 mentioned above. The system was able to serve up to 16 coaxial terminals, two D3000 disk drives and one T1640 tape drive.|$|E
5000|$|One Operating System {{used in the}} <b>key-to-disk</b> system, {{was called}} FML-11 - which meant Field Modified Level 11. This OS was an {{interrupt}} driven, multitasking OS with individual device drivers for the peripheral hardware. The computer hardware did not support stacks, so subroutines were called by executing a [...] "return Jump" [...] RTJ assembler instruction. This instruction modified the code {{at the beginning of}} the call function and inserted the return address. Reentrancy was achieved by the use of a double linked list of buffers, which was maintained by the scheduler.|$|E
5000|$|Already {{established}} {{as a leader in}} the <b>key-to-disk</b> data entry system market by the 1300 series, in the early 1970s Inforex tried to expand by creating a new product category: turnkey file management systems. The impetus came on a request from Westinghouse, who were trying to keep track of 750,000 engineering drawings (known then as [...] "blueprints" [...] after the ink color used by the large-format printers) via a manual system. In that era, most business applications were written in COBOL, and could take up to two years to develop from the time a user department requested the application. The System 5000 anticipated by more than a decade early PC applications like PFS:File and dBASE II. The entire system was driven by simple two-letter commands entered on video terminals.|$|E
50|$|In many data {{processing}} applications, the punched cards were verified by keying {{exactly the same}} data a second time, {{checking to see if}} the second keying and the punched data were the same (known as two pass verification). There was a great demand for keypunch operators, usually women, who worked full-time on keypunch and verifier machines, often in large keypunch departments with dozens or hundreds of other operators, all performing data input. In the 1950s, Remington Rand introduced the UNITYPER, which enabled data entry directly to magnetic tape for UNIVAC systems. Mohawk Data Sciences subsequently produced an improved magnetic tape encoder in 1965, which was somewhat successfully marketed as a keypunch replacement. The rise of microprocessors and inexpensive computer terminals {{led to the development of}} additional key-to-tape and <b>key-to-disk</b> systems from smaller companies such as Inforex and Pertec.|$|E
40|$|The Stanley S. Lamm Institute for Developmental Disabilities of The Long Island College Hospital, in {{conjunction}} with Micro-Med Systems has developed a low cost micro-computer based information system (ADDOP TRS) which monitors quality of care in outpatient settings rendering services to the developmentally disabled population. The process of conversion from paper record keeping systems to direct <b>key-to-disk</b> data capture {{at the point of}} service delivery is described. Data elements of the information system including identifying patient information, coded and English-grammar entry procedures for tracking elements of service as well as their delivery status are described. Project evaluation criteria are defined including improved quality of care, improved productivity for clerical and professional staff and enhanced decision making capability. These criteria are achieved in a cost effective manner as a function of more efficient information flow. Administrative applications including staff/budgeting procedures, submissions for third party reimbursement and case reporting to utilization review committees are considered...|$|E
