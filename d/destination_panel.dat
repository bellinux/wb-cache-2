40|$|Abstract: China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy governs foreign leisure {{travel by}} {{citizens}} to ADS-designated countries. To model {{the effects of}} ADS on Chinese visitor arrivals, we specify a model of demand for a representative Chinese consumer who values trips to n differentiated foreign <b>destinations.</b> Using <b>panel</b> data for Chinese visitor arrivals for 61 countries from 1985 to 2005, we estimate fixed effects models accounting for selection effects and a semiparametric matched difference-in-differences (DID) model. The semiparametric matched DID estimates indicate that ADS increased Chinese visitor arrivals annually by 10. 5 to 15. 7 percent in the three-year period following ADS designation...|$|R
25|$|These are four- and six-car sets {{based at}} Makuhari Depot {{modified}} in 2009 from former Keihin-Tōhoku Line 209-0 series ten-car sets {{for use on}} Chiba area and Bōsō Peninsula local services from 1 October 2009. The first four-car set was outshopped from Nagano Works in June 2009. Modifications include new electrical equipment, the addition of transverse seating, LED <b>destination</b> indicator <b>panels,</b> and a toilet. The cars are numbered in the -2100 series, although some four-car sets have end cars numbered in the -2000 series. The -2000 series cars are converted from early batch 209-0 series units with air-operated doors rather than the electrically-operated doors of later batch units.|$|R
50|$|Some {{skyscraper}} {{buildings and}} other types of installation feature a <b>destination</b> operating <b>panel</b> where a passenger registers their floor calls before entering the car. The system lets them know which car to wait for, instead of everyone boarding the next car. In this way, travel time is reduced as the elevator makes fewer stops for individual passengers, and the computer distributes adjacent stops to different cars in the bank. Although travel time is reduced, passenger waiting times may be longer as they will not necessarily be allocated the next car to depart. During the down peak period the benefit of destination control will be limited as passengers have a common destination.|$|R

40|$|India’s {{economic}} reforms in 1991 permitted investors to freely choose their preferred investment locations across the various {{states in the}} Indian union, leading to competition between states to attract investment projects through a bettering of their investment climates. The performance of states over the past 17 years in terms of attracting investments has widely varied: two states, Maharashtra and Gujarat have together accounted for over 30 % of India’s investments projects while other states have been much less successful. Some states, {{after a period of}} considerable neglect, have seen steady upswings in investment inflows while some others have fallen from their past images as good investment <b>destinations.</b> Using <b>panel</b> data across 18 of India’s most economically active states and covering the period 1998 - 2006, this study attempts to determine the critical factors which drive investment inflows across Indian states. The empirical findings predict that political stability and fiscal reforms are the two most important factors determining investment inflows across states. Using a disaggregated analysis, the study predicts that states successful in maintaining political and fiscal stability stand to gain most from public investments in human capital formation in terms of increased investment inflows. The study concludes that investors select states as investment destinations predominantly {{on the basis of their}} contemporary socio-economic performance as opposed to their past images as investment destinations...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{enlargement}} of the European Union (EU) has enhanced interest in the causes and also the consequences of migration between Central and Eastern European (CEE) and Western European countries. This paper considers {{the possibility that some}} of these consequences make themselves felt in the trade flows between migrants' countries of origin and <b>destination.</b> Using a <b>panel</b> of data covering a number of CEE countries between 1996 and 2003, we employ an augmented gravity model {{to examine the effects of}} immigration from these transition countries on their bilateral trade flows with the UK. We pay attention to a number of issues that have been raised within the literature on gravity models. We find evidence that migration positively enhances the bilateral exports of the migrants' home country; however, there is less (but some) evidence that the imports from their destination country are also enhanced. trade, migration, gravity models,...|$|R
40|$|NASA has {{developed}} a set of 14 draft roadmaps to guide the development of space technologies {{under the leadership of}} the NASA Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT). Each of these roadmaps focuses on a particular technology area (TA). The roadmaps are intended to foster the development of advanced technologies and concepts that address NASA's needs and contribute to other aerospace and national needs. OCT requested that the National Research Council conduct a study to review the draft roadmaps, gather and assess relevant community input, and make recommendations and suggest priorities to inform NASA's decisions as it finalizes its roadmaps. The statement of task states that "based on the results of the community input and its own deliberations, the steering committee will prepare a brief interim report that addresses high-level issues associated with the roadmaps, such as the advisability of modifying the number or technical focus of the draft NASA roadmaps. " This interim report, which does not include formal recommendations, addresses that one element of the study charge. NASA requested this interim report so that it would have the opportunity to make an early start in modifying the draft roadmaps based on feedback from the panels and steering committee. The final report will address all other tasks in the statement of task. In particular, the final report will include a prioritization of technologies, will describe in detail the prioritization process and criteria, and will include specific recommendations on a variety of topics, including many of the topics mentioned in this interim report. In developing both this interim report and the final report to come, the steering committee draws on the work of six study panels organized by technical area, loosely following the organization of the 14 roadmaps, as follows: A Panel 1 : Propulsion and Power TA 01 Launch Propulsion Systems TA 02 In-Space Propulsion Technologies TA 03 Space Power and Energy Storage Systems TA 13 Ground and Launch Systems Processing B Panel 2 : Robotics, Communications, and Navigation TA 04 Robotics, TeleRobotics, and Autonomous Systems TA 05 Communication and Navigation Systems C Panel 3 : Instruments and Computing TA 08 Science Instruments, Observatories, and Sensor Systems TA 11 Modeling, Simulation, Information Technology, and Data Processing D Panel 4 : Human Health and Surface Exploration TA 06 Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems TA 07 Human Exploration <b>Destination</b> Systems E <b>Panel</b> 5 : Materials Panel TA 10 Nanotechnology TA 12 Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing TA 14 Thermal Management Systems F Panel 6 : Entry, Descent, and Landing Panel TA 09 Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems In addition to drawing on the expertise represented on the steering committee and panels, the committee obtained input from each of 14 public workshops held on each of the 14 roadmaps. At these 1 -day workshops, invited speakers, guests, and members of the public engaged in discussions on the different technology areas and their value to NASA. Broad community input was also solicited from a public website, where more than 240 public comments were received on the draft roadmaps in response to application of criteria (such as benefit, risk and reasonableness, and alignment with NASA and national goals) that the steering committee established. This interim report reflects the results of deliberations by the steering committee in light of these public inputs as well as additional inputs from the six panels. The steering committee's final report will be completed early in 2012. That report will prioritize the technologies that span the entire scope of the 14 roadmaps and provide additional guidance on crosscutting themes and other relevant topics...|$|R
