50|$|One {{main cause}} is {{excessive}} wear of the 3rd <b>gear</b> clutch <b>pack,</b> resulting in {{large amounts of}} debris blocking the flow of transmission fluid. Many owners reported problems with the replacement transmissions as well. Similar transmission-related issues exist in the Honda Accord, Acura MDX, Acura TL {{as well as the}} Honda Odyssey.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2001 for the 2002 model year, the TL got a minor makeover, with a {{refreshed}} front fascia, redesigned taillights, a 6 CD in-dash changer {{as well as}} a {{few other}} features. A Type-S model was also added, adding 35hp (26kW) as well as [...] wheels, firmer seats and suspension. A statistically large percentage of these vehicles exhibited problems with the 3rd <b>gear</b> clutch <b>pack</b> in the automatic transmission necessitating replacement. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to [...] or 7.75 years for all 99 to 02 models and 03 partial per VIN.

40|$|Bicycles {{today have}} too many gear {{combinations}} {{for them to be}} remembered by heart in their sequence from the hardest to the softest. This is an even higher challenge when owning multiple bicycles, each of which meant for different purposes. iBikeGear allows serious cyclists to input, for up to 3 bicycles, the front and rear <b>gear</b> <b>packs</b> chosen from the most diffused versions in the market (596 and 274 models, respectively). Also, individual teeth number can be manually input for custom packs. iBikeGear automatically calculates the gear ratio for all the possible combinations and ranks them from the softest to the hardest. Additionally, depending on the user settings, sub-optimal combinations due to excessive chain misalignment or to a disproportionally high number of teeth (for the same gear ratio) will be indicated in brackets and removed from the final list. The final, optimized list of front/rear gear setting is memorized for each bicycle, in order to be promptly recalled and visualized on the screen. Also, a window showing the 'hardness' match among the gear combinations of the 3 bicycles is provided, helping riders to train at the same effort independently of the chosen bike...|$|R

50|$|The 01M and its {{predecessor}} 096 {{are very similar}} to the other transmissions engineered and manufactured by STA: AR4, AD4 and AD8, which were deployed on Renault vehicles in the 1980s and 1990s. It is an electronically controlled transmission with a lockup torque converter, using planetary <b>gears,</b> clutch <b>packs,</b> and a gear-driven final drive with an open-differential. There is no chain inside this transmission. It does not have provision for a dipstick. It was determined that a dipstick and fill might invite owners to introduce incorrect or inferior fluid. More information on design and function can be found in VW's publications, mechanic's Self Study Programs SSP112 for early versions for the 92-94 096, or SSP172 for 01M from 95-06.|$|R

The first day is spent in a classroom introducing the course and schedule, providing in-depth information on the overall Leave No Trace program and the Center for Outdoor Ethics, reviewing <b>gear,</b> and <b>packing.</b> The remaining days are spent in the field on a short backcountry trip learning and practicing the principles of Leave No Trace. Each course is staffed with a minimum of two experienced outdoor professionals who are Master Educator Instructors.|$|R

50|$|The only {{difficulty}} {{was that}} the TF-1 Trader never in the past had foreseen its use in parachute deployment, modifications {{were made to the}} bombing bay chutes by mounting anchor-line cables to allow parachutists to hook up their static lines. After a thorough review of aerial and still photography, plus extra scrutiny of the aircraft, they attached dummies with the appropriate weight and gear and tested its use. Major Meyers, CWO Lew Vinson and two other NPU parachute engineers made the first live jumps from the TF-1 carrier aircraft on 9-13 July 1956. They began to test later jumps with the TF-1 by wearing additional combat <b>gear,</b> including weapons, <b>packs</b> and the AN/GRC9 radio.|$|R

40|$|This works {{regards the}} design of an {{electric}} motorcycle for the annual Isle of Man TT Zero Challenge. Optimal control theory was used to perform lap time simulation and design optimisation. A bespoked model was developed, featuring 3 D road topology, vehicle dynamics and electric power train, composed of a lithium battery pack, brushed DC motors and motor controller. The model runs simulations over the entire 60 km of the Snaefell Mountain Course. The work is validated using experimental data from the BX chassis of the Brunel Racing team, which ran during the 2009 to 2015 TT Zero races. Optimal control is used to improve drive train and power train configurations. Findings demonstrate computational efficiency, good lap time prediction and design optimisation potential, achieving a 2 minute reduction of the reference lap time through changes in final drive <b>gear</b> ratio, battery <b>pack</b> size and motor configuration...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the second}} year of production, the Acura TL was given {{slightly}} more features, including a 5-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. The added gear allowed for slightly better fuel economy and acceleration when compared to the previous 4-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. With this model, if the driver forgets the 1-2 shift the computer will take over when in sport mode and do the 1-2 up and down shifts, unlike the 4-speed 1999 model. In many vehicles, the 5-speed automatic transmission failed: as the third clutch pack wore, particles blocked off oil passages and prevented the transmission from shifting or holding gears normally. The transmission would slip, fail to shift, or suddenly downshift and make the car come to a screeching halt, even at freeway speeds. This problem was highlighted in the Los Angeles Times in September 2002. Consumer Reports took note and gave the TL and CL the black spot, the worst rating for transmission reliability. In response to the recurring problem, the manufacturer extended the warranty covering the transmission to 7 yrs or [...] on U.S.A. models. A class-action lawsuit was settled to extend the transmission warranty for U.S.A. owners or entities to 7.75 years for all models made from 1998 to 2002 and some 2003 models by VIN; however, Canadian owners warranties were not extended.

40|$|International audienceBronze, a copper-tin alloy, widely {{utilizing}} {{in manufacturing}} of <b>gears,</b> bearing, and <b>packing</b> technologies {{due to its}} versatile physical, mechanical, and chemical properties. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of biofield treatment on physical and structural properties of bronze powder. Bronze powder was divided into two samples, one served as control and the other sample was received biofield treatment. Control and treated bronze samples were characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size analyzer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. XRD result showed that the unit cell volume was reduced upto 0. 78 % on day 78 in treated bronze as compared to control. Further, the crystallite size was significantly reduced upto 49. 96 % in treated bronze sample on day 106 as compared to control. In addition, the biofield treatment has significantly reduced the average particle size upto 18. 22 % in treated bronze powder as compared to control. SEM data showed agglomerated and welded particles in control bronze powder, whereas fractured morphology at satellites boundaries were observed in treated bronze. The yield strength of bronze powder calculated using Hall- Petch equation, was significantly changed after biofield treatment. The FT-IR analysis showed that there were three new peaks at 464 cm- 1, 736 cm- 1, and 835 cm- 1 observed in treated bronze as compared to control; indicated that the biofield treatment may alter the bond properties in bronze. Therefore, the biofield treatment has substantially altered the characteristics of bronze at physical and structural level...|$|R
