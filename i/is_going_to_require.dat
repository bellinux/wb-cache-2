40|$|Cognitive {{architectures}} {{should be}} designed with learning performance as a central goal. A critical feature of intelligence {{is the ability to}} apply the knowledge learned in one context to a new context. A cognitive agent is expected to have a lifetime, in which it has to learn to solve several different types of tasks in its environment. In such a situation, the agent should become increasingly better adapted to its environment. This means that its learning per-formance on each new task should improve as it is able to transfer knowledge learned in previous tasks to the solution of the new task. We call this abil-ity cumulative learning. Cumulative learning thus refers to the accumulation of learned knowledge over a lifetime, and its application to the learning of new tasks.

Faced {{with a variety of}} conflicting mandates and uncertainty as to appropriate responses, local land use planners and managers need place-based decision support tools. With the increasing availability of high-resolution digital elevation models and the advancing speed and sophistication of web-based mapping, a number of web geographic information systems (GIS) tools have been developed to map and visualize what areas of a coastal landscape will potentially be flooded under different scenarios of sea level rise. This paper presents a case study of one such WebGIS application, NJFloodMapper (www. NJFloodMapper. org), with a focus on the user-centered design process employed to help our target audience of coastal decision-makers in the state of New Jersey, USA, access and understand relevant geographic information concerning sea level rise and exposure to coastal inundation, as well as assess the vulnerability of key infrastructure, populations and natural resources within their communities.

40|$|AbstractThe {{preceding}} {{articles in}} this volume have identified and discussed {{a wide range of}} methodological and practical issues in the development of personalized medicine. This concluding article uses the resulting insights to identify implications for the economic incentives for evidence generation. It argues that promoting an efficient path to personalized medicine <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>require</b> appropriate incentives for evidence generation including: 1) a greater willingness on the part of payers to accept prices that reflect value; 2) consideration of some form of intellectual property protection (e. g., data exclusivity) for diagnostics to incentivize generation of evidence of clinical utility; 3) realistic expectations around the standards for evidence; and 4) public investment in evidence collection to complement the efforts of payers and manufacturers. It concludes that such incentives could build and maintain a balance among: 1) realistic thresholds for evidence and the need for payers to have confidence in the clinical utility of the drugs and tests they use; 2) payment for value, with prices that ensure cost-effectiveness for health systems; and 3) levels of intellectual property protection for evidence generation that provide a return for those financing research and development, while encouraging competition to produce both better and more efficient tests...|$|E

We report {{on the experience of}} working directly with a local government authority to develop an affordable housing strategy. This experience highlights a range of practical responses.

These include the lack of housing knowledge and experience within the planning profession; the need to modify established work practices and policies; and council's reluctance to further overburden its budgets and staffing levels. These inhibitors all conspire to undermine the potential effectiveness of local housing strategies to deliver necessary housing reforms.

It is of particular value to those interested in nomadic pastoralists and to people focused on developing rangeland environments in a practical manner that takes into account the needs of both wildlife and nomads with their animals. In discussing the Chang Tang, Schaller writes, ‘To become familiar with an area that is still healthy, productive and diverse, one still unspoiled by humankind, has a special appeal. It is not a matter of surveying the last orangutans in Sarawak or searching for saola in Laos, as I have done, but of conserving vigorous populations of all animal and plant species in an ecosystem. Conservation has in recent decades focused on rain forests, with their great diversity of species, whereas attention to rangelands, which cover 40 percent of the earth’s land surface has languished. Yet rangelands too display biological treasures in beauty, variety, and uniqueness.’ With most of the Tibetan Plateau comprised of rangelands, conserving the Tibetan ecosystem <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>require</b> improved understanding of the ecology of the rangelands and increased participation of nomad communities in development and conservation programs.
