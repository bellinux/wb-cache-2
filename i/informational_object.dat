The solution to these problems is to develop a modular informational architecture that takes into account the diverse management needs of the various forms of information that are handled within the ANSA Prroject.

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} process {{has to be}} modeled and documented for its reengineering and continuous improvement. A {{development process}} model {{is the basis for}} how a system will be designed. Due to the special nature of integrated product development processes, a method for process modeling {{has to be able to}} support and easily map the high interconnectivity between processes of different engineering disciplines over all hierarchies. The dominant elements in a model of integrated product development processes are the informational relations and flows. The analysis of models and textual documentation of the engineering processes in an automotive company revealed the special need for modeling concurrent engineering processes. Existing methods didn’t support these needs sufficiently. Therefore, a single method for mapping and interconnecting the processes of all different engineering disciplines was agreed upon, which describes inputs and outputs (e. g. <b>informational</b> <b>objects)</b> for every process. The paper describes the reasons for an engineering process driven modeling method, the method itself and its application. Also, lessons learned from this approach are described...|$|R

These artifacts can be physical things, <b>informational</b> <b>objects,</b> or conceptual artifacts.

The Marc 21 Format for Community Information was selected by the Centro de Producción Audiovisual, Department of Film and Television at the National University of Córdoba for the database "Niawi" designed to be the core of an information system for audiovisual producers in order to promote audiovisual production (film, tv, multimedia) through a regional hub. The specificity of the proposed information system required some changes to the format. However the flexibility of the Marc 21 Format for Community Information provided an adequate structure to locate all the required data.

40|$|This {{series of}} essays offers a {{critique}} of Information Studies, taken as a discipline largely concerned with <b>informational</b> <b>objects</b> and their representations {{on the one hand}} and the control of these same by means of other <b>informational</b> <b>objects</b> and their representations on the other. Specifically, the critique put forward here attends to the ways that the common practices of Information Studies may reinforce representationalist ideologies that are historically problematic and that are likely to continue to be so into the future if allowed to persist. Such ideologies are bound up with histories of oppression, colonialism, and cognitive injustice in ways that seem likely to be undesirable to most practitioners upon consideration. The critique offered seeks to point out this conjunction of aesthetic and ethical issues in our practical epistemological constructs, opening out largely untried avenues of exploration with regard to our axiological habits [...] axiology being defined here as the inquiry that includes ethics, aesthetics, and epistemology [...] and the architectonic structures of meaning and understanding that we deploy with ever increasing density in (and occasionally as) the world. In the related field of semiotics, an assumption, bordering on a principle, obtains that meaning has structure and that that meaning is intelligible. The work of semiotic theorists has shown that this is not likely to be exclusively a logocentric prejudice. The works of Gilles Deleuze and his sometimes partner Felix Guattari, along with those of C. S. Peirce and Justus Buchler, each postulate in their own way that meaning and its structure are continuous with the world, and, going further, that the structures of meaning that exist in the world have no intrinsic limit to their complexity in a general sense other than the availability of resources to build that complexity. This is not equivalent to saying that the forms of such complexity are unlimited in the sense that they could take all possible forms, though the number of possible form-states may be infinite in principle when the availability of resources is bracketed off as a concern. That indicates to us the likelihood that no single ideology gives us a complete picture of all possible semiotic modalities and that, with sufficient resources, multiple modalities may coexist and interact in a single system, event, or order. All of this places semiosis in a thermodynamic milieu between complex systems theory and computation theory, even while suggesting analogies to ecophenomenology and ecosystems thinking as an interpretation of Peircean "infinite semiosis. "While semiotics, as an architectonic discipline, traces continuities with the Kantian paradigm, the Deleuzean approach represents a turn in philosophy both in expressive style and ways of doing philosophy, such that both a reinvestigation of semiotic structures and the production of new rhetorical modes are suggested in light of it [...] though Deleuze is a threshold for such matters, not a container. Making use of Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Niklas Luhmann, Luciano Floridi, and François Laruelle (as well as Patrick Wilson, Marcia Bates, and Jonathan Furner) to construct an ordinal semiotic compatible with various structural realisms, the arguments here commit to a pataphysical and hermetic swerve that aligns with the "Dark Deleuzean" aesthetics of Nick Land and Reza Negarestani, exploring the metaphor of darkness itself by way of the immanence theories of Timothy Morton and Eugene Thacker. The argument pattern described can be seen as an affirmation of possibly novel values of global, transspecies cognitive justice and "cognitive veganism" at least partially consistent with the ethical concerns and images of thought of such thinkers as Richard Kahn and Stephen David Ross. Due to the emphasis on continuity with the world, the above motivates us to take seriously various posthumanistic rhetorics' priorities: cybernetics, informatics, thermodynamics, complex and autopoietic systems, codality, cognitive and neuro-diversity, enhanced and artificial intelligence, postvitalist ecology, and perhaps even Singularity. Because of that same continuity, each of these should be necessarily thought in relation to planetarity and global history. Through that thought we can understand semiotic processes and ecologies as bound up with what Land has called a "terraprocess. " Information Studies, as a discipline emerging into full fruition within the context of a posthumanistic moment, situated in turn within the Anthropocene Era, should understand and engage with this terraprocess as the architectonic syntax for a more fundamental informatic and metainformatic axiology...|$|R

While {{a growing number of}} studies have explored the use of social media in natural disasters by emergency staff, military personnel, medial and other professionals, very few studies have investigated the use of social media by members of the public. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore citizens’ information experiences in social media during times of natural disaster. Method. A qualitative research approach was applied. Data was collected via in-depth interviews. Twenty-five people who used social media during a natural disaster in Australia participated in the study. Analysis. Audio recordings of interviews and interview transcripts provided the empirical material for data analysis. Data was analysed using structural and focussed coding methods. Results. Eight key themes depicting various aspects of participants’ information experience during a natural disaster were uncovered by the study: connected; wellbeing; coping; help; brokerage; journalism; supplementary and characteristics.

We identify five distinctive types of activities entailing interactions that combine symbolic and material artifacts, generating collective social value. We demonstrate how complex, multi-faceted socio-economic spaces bridge the divide between virtual and embodied space, <b>informational</b> and material <b>objects,</b> and social and economic transactions. Our findings expand the knowledge of online community dynamics, collaborative practices, and value-creation processes. We draw a research agenda for the practices and dynamics at play among users of online communities transcending the boundary between offline and online, generating novel insights to understand digitally-enabled practices...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a longstanding}} {{conflict}} between information and matter, a tension which is highly evident within {{the discipline of}} information studies today. The proliferation of digital archives and libraries has raised challenging questions {{about the relationship between}} the informational and material qualities of objects. In a world in which everything is becoming digital, the turn to privilege the <b>informational</b> content of <b>objects</b> over their material presence raises concerns about originality and authenticity, ownership and authorship. Bodies, like archival records or books, are information objects. It is not surprising, then, in this cultural moment, that a plethora of research, dialogue, and art focuses on the changing role of the body in the information age. But though it is common to associate information and the body through contemporary digital technologies, this paper is predicated on the argument that this relationship in fact long precedes our ability to turn bodies into bits...|$|R
40|$|Computational ontologies are a {{new type}} of {{emerging}} scientific media (Smith, 2016) that process large quantities of heterogeneous data about portions of reality. Applied computational ontologies are used for semantically integrating (Heiler, 1995; Pileggi 2 ̆ 6 Fernandez-Llatas, 2012) divergent data to represent reality and in so doing applied computational ontologies alter conceptions of materiality and produce new realities based on levels of informational granularity and abstraction (Floridi, 2011), resulting in {{a new type of}} informational ontology (Iliadis, 2013) the critical analysis of which requires new methods and frameworks. Currently, {{there is a lack of}} literature addressing the theoretical, social, and critical dimensions of such informational ontologies, applied computational ontologies, and the interdisciplinary communities of practice (Brown 2 ̆ 6 Duguid, 1991; Wenger, 1998) that produce them. This dissertation fills a lacuna in communicative work in an emerging subfield of Science and Technology Studies (Latour 2 ̆ 6 Woolgar, 1979) known as Critical Data Studies (boyd 2 ̆ 6 Crawford, 2012; Dalton 2 ̆ 6 Thatcher, 2014; Kitchin 2 ̆ 6 Lauriault, 2014) by adopting a critical framework to analyze the systems of thought that inform applied computational ontology while offering insight into its realism-based methods and philosophical frameworks to gauge their ethical import. Since the early 1990 s, computational ontologies have been used to organize massive amounts of heterogeneous data by individuating reality into computable parts, attributes, and relations. This dissertation provides a theory of computational ontologies as technologies of individuation (Simondon, 2005) that translate disparate data to produce informational cohesion. By technologies of individuation I mean engineered artifacts whose purpose is to partition portions of reality into computable <b>informational</b> <b>objects.</b> I argue that data are metastable entities and that computational ontologies restrain heterogeneous data via a process of translation to produce semantic interoperability. In this way, I show that computational ontologies effectively re-ontologize (Floridi, 2013) and produce reality and thus that have ethical consequences, specifically in terms of their application to social reality and social ontology (Searle, 2006). I use the Basic Formal Ontology (Arp, Smith, 2 ̆ 6 Spear, 2015) —the world’s most widely used upper-level ontology—as a case study and analyze its methods and ensuing ethical issues concerning its social application in the Military Ontology before recommending an ethical framework. “Ontology” is a term that is used in philosophy and computer science in related but different ways—philosophical ontology typically concerns metaphysics while computational ontology typically concerns databases. This dissertation provides a critical history and theory of ontology and the interdisciplinary teams of researchers that came to adopt methods from philosophical ontology to build, persuade, and reason with applied computational ontology. Following a critical communication approach, I define applied computational ontology construction as a solution to a communication problem among scientists who seek to create semantic interoperability among data and argue that applied ontology is philosophical, informational in nature, and communicatively constituted (McPhee 2 ̆ 6 Zaug, 2000). The primary aim is to explain how philosophy informs applied computational ontology while showing how such ontologies became instantiated in material organizations, how to study them, and describe their ethical implications. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we argue that digital {{simulations}} promote and explore complex relations between the player and the machines cybernetic system with which it relates through gameplay, that is, the real application of tactics and strategies used by participants as they play the game. We plan {{to show that the}} realism of simulation, together with the merger of artificial objects with the real world, can generate interactive empathy between players and their avatars. In this text, we intend to explore augmented reality as a means to visualise interactive communication projects. With ARToolkit, Virtools and 3 ds Max applications, we aim to show how to create a portable interactive platform that resorts to the environment and markers for constructing the games scenario. Many of the conventional functions of the human eye are being replaced by techniques where images do not position themselves in the traditional manner that we observe them (Crary, 1998), or in the way we perceive the real world. The digitalization of the real world to a new <b>informational</b> layer over <b>objects,</b> people or environments, needs to be processed and mediated by tools that amplify the natural human senses.

5000|$|In many memory {{institutions}} of the Western World, including libraries and museums, focus is often placed on the informational content and physical attributes, or artifactual value, of collected materials. Preservation policies are primarily concerned with the maintenance of these two things, either through reformatting to preserve textual information, or repairs and environmental controls to ensure continued existence of their physical structure (Foot, 19). However, {{it is necessary to}} look beyond the physical and <b>informational</b> aspects of <b>objects</b> in order to ensure we are also preserving the integrity of the spiritual or cultural values which may be fundamental in defining the object. [...] Concerns arise when actions taken to preserve the physical object may compromise the spiritual or cultural integrity of a given object. Artifacts, including books, throughout history and the present were created and utilized according to rules and taboos that may not be inherently understood in today's world of mass consumer goods and material culture. While not all books, documents, and artifacts have rituals or socially constructed beliefs associated with their continued existence, it is a relevant issue for many cultural and religious collections.|$|R
