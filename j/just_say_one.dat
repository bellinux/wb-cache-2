The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Marge's mother Jackie is particularly nightmarish in her first real appearance. The final sequence on the rooftop with Lisa and Bart is lovely, and Homer's comment to Marge is a magical wrap-up to a good episode." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the episode [...] "maintained a nicely irreverent tone most of the time— irreverent {{enough to make it}} amusing, at least," [...] and added: [...] "The interaction of the Simpson and Bouvier families at dinner was terrific, and Bart’s experiences on skid row made their point while they still managed to be pointed and clever. 'Bart vs. Thanksgiving' was another winner." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said [...] "Bart vs. Thanksgiving" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Substitute", another season two episode, were the first episodes that [...] "asked [...] to truly care about the characters, and they work beautifully." [...] Both Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal and Jacobson thought the most memorable line of the episode was Jackie's line to Marge: [...] "I have laryngitis and it hurts to talk, so I'll <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> thing— you never do anything right." [...] A reviewer for DVD.net, on the other hand, thought the best line was Homer's [...] "Oh Lord, be honest– are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?".|$|E

[...] "Nobody knows how it {{originated}} or {{anything about it}} except that Lucinda herself admitted it to us afterwards. But, in the first flush of her rage, she told Romney {{that she would never}} speak to him again as long as she lived. And HE said he would never speak to her until she spoke first--because, you see, as she was in the wrong she ought to make the first advance. And they never have spoken. Everybody in the connection, I suppose, has taken turns trying to reconcile them, but nobody has succeeded. I don't believe that Romney has ever so much as THOUGHT of any other woman in his whole life, and certainly Lucinda has never thought of any other man. You will notice she still wears Romney's ring. They're practically engaged still, of course. And Romney said once that if Lucinda would <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> word, no matter what it was, even if it were something insulting, he would speak, too, and beg her pardon for his share in the quarrel--because then, you see, he would not be breaking his word. He hasn't referred to the matter for years, but I presume that he is of the same mind still. And they are just as much in love with each other as they ever were. He's always hanging about where she is--when other people are there, too, that is. He avoids her like a plague when she is alone. That was why he was stuck out in the blue room with us to-day. There doesn't seem to be a particle of resentment between them. If Lucinda would only speak! But that Lucinda will not do." ...|$|E

Fury's trainer and uncle Peter Fury said, [...] "this is what we've been working on in the gym for five months, to beat someone like Wladimir Klitschko {{you have to take}} boxing to a whole new level." [...] Tyson Fury also congratulated Klitschko for the shots he did land, saying that they both found each other awkward to land on.

Instead of listing names after names, however, I will <b>just</b> <b>say</b> <b>one</b> big thanks to all the people who deserve to be thanked but not mentioned here by name. I am highly indebted to my advisor, Professor Mahdi Abdelguerfi. He deserves my heartfelt appreciation for the warm and constant support he has given me to accomplish this thesis. In addition, I would like to thank Dr. Shengru Tu and Dr. Nauman Chaudhry for being on my thesis committee. A special thanks goes to Mr. Venkata Mahadevan whose continuous support in getting this thesis prepared is invaluable. If it were not for his well-organized instruction, I would not imagine completing this successfully. Most of all, I would like to thank my family and friends, for their unending support and help they provided to me. To them, this thesis is dedicated...|$|E
