Architects were Hindhammer–Sundt–Thomassen, Lund & Løvseth, and Lund & Slaatto. An H pylon was chosen instead of an A pylon both because it was more <b>functional,</b> <b>and</b> would be more aesthetic {{in conjunction with the}} other bridges in the area, particularly three suspension bridges.|$|E

5|$|In 1881, Tesla {{moved to}} Budapest, Hungary, {{to work under}} Tivadar Puskás at a {{telegraph}} company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so {{he worked as a}} draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became <b>functional,</b> <b>and</b> Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.|$|E

5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain <b>functional,</b> <b>and</b> therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, an individual's tissues are {{resistant}} {{to the effects of}} parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully <b>functional,</b> <b>and</b> the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy; with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.|$|E

5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in <b>functional</b> <b>and</b> anatomical remodeling of vestibular and proprioceptive nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce macroscopic anatomical remodeling of the hindbrain, including the cerebellum. The magnitude of this remodeling and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult neurogenesis to these changes.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, design {{management}} {{was seen as}} limited to the management of design projects, but over time, it evolved to include other aspects of an organization at the <b>functional</b> <b>and</b> strategic level. A more recent debate concerns the integration of design thinking into strategic management as a cross-disciplinary and human-centered approach to management. This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an abductive mode of inference, compared to practices associated with the more traditional management paradigm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, and the country's coastal defences {{received}} little attention. The Gorges family continued as captains at Hurst, with Sir Edward Gorges taking up the post in 1610, but the castle was neglected. In 1628, the castle was unable to prevent Flemish ships from passing along the Solent, as only {{four or five of}} the castle's twenty-seven guns were <b>functional,</b> <b>and</b> the fort had no ammunition or powder for them. The government replaced all the brass ordnance in the castle, which were preferred, particularly on ships, as they could fire faster and more safely, with iron guns in 1635.|$|E

5|$|Metagenomics allows {{researchers}} {{to access the}} <b>functional</b> <b>and</b> metabolic diversity of microbial communities, but it cannot show which of these processes are active. The extraction and analysis of metagenomic mRNA (the metatranscriptome) provides information on the regulation and expression profiles of complex communities. Because of the technical difficulties (the short half-life of mRNA, for example) {{in the collection of}} environmental RNA there have been relatively few in situ metatranscriptomic studies of microbial communities to date. While originally limited to microarray technology, metatranscriptomcs studies have made use of transcriptomics technologies to measure whole-genome expression and quantification of a microbial community, first employed in analysis of ammonia oxidation in soils.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{construction is}} a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a luthier makes only stringed instruments. Some make only {{one type of}} instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both <b>functional</b> <b>and</b> aesthetically pleasing. Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{was built on}} the site of derelict farm buildings. There were different designers for different parts of the service area, with Owen Williams as the coordinating architect. An ornate design for a footbridge by Clough Williams-Ellis was rejected in favour of a more <b>functional</b> <b>and</b> conservative modernist design by Owen Williams. When the services opened the new buildings were incomplete so the food was served from temporary sheds. The original plan had been for trucks to use this service station and for cars to use Newport Pagnell. In practice, however, both service areas were unrestricted. The first owners of the services were Blue Boar Limited, a family company that owned a nearby petrol station on the A5. Although the official name has always been Watford Gap, the services were colloquially called Blue Boar for some time after opening.|$|E
