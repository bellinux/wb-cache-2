25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason why <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators {{did not know that}} uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E

In the scene, Pete comes to Liz's office and tells her about how Jack set-up the TGS stage in which they can play poker. Liz asks him if <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right if she brings Gretchen to the poker game.|$|E

Morris {{described}} {{the first week}} as [...] "fucking awful", and suggested to Noel that they abandon the session: [...] "He just shrugged and said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right. So on we went." [...] Liam was under heavy tabloid focus at the time, and on 9 November 1996 was arrested and cautioned for cocaine possession following a bender at the Q Awards. A media frenzy ensued, and the band's management {{made the decision to}} move to a studio less readily accessible to paparazzi.|$|E

500|$|Survivors {{participated in}} a {{publicity}} campaign to expand attention to the case. Langley and Lee Ruth Davis appeared on The Maury Povich Show on Martin Luther King Day in 1993. Gary Moore published another article about Rosewood in the Miami Herald on March 7, 1993; he had {{to negotiate with the}} newspaper's editors for about a year to publish it. At first they were skeptical that the incident had taken place, and secondly, reporter Lori Rosza of the Miami Herald had reported on the first stage of what proved in December 1992 to be a deceptive claims case, with most of the survivors excluded. [...] "If something like that really happened, we figured, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> over the history books", an editor wrote.|$|E
500|$|While McKellen {{had made}} his sexual {{orientation}} known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, {{it was not until}} 1988 that he came out to the general public, in a programme on BBC Radio. The context that prompted McKellen's decision– overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career– was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament. Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality [...] "... as a kind of pretended family relationship". McKellen became active in fighting the proposed law, and, during a BBC Radio 3 programme where he debated Section 28 with the conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne, declared himself gay. McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin. In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking. He has said of this period: My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [...] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right for other people to be as well, gay and straight. Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.|$|E

Some think, as the same writers observe, that the word [...] "Tob", translated [...] "well", {{is the name of the}} kinsman, the same with Tobias; so R. Joshuah says, that Salmon (who was the father of Boaz), and Elimelech (the father of Ruth's husband), and Tob (this near kinsman), were brethren.|$|E
2500|$|When I was {{at first}} asked to attend the St. Louis World's Fair I {{did not wish to}} go. Later, when I was told that I would receive good {{attention}} and protection, and that the President of the United States said that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right, I consented ... Every Sunday the President of the Fair sent for me to go to a wild west show. I took part in the roping contests before the audience. There were many other Indian tribes there, and strange people of whom I had never heard ... I am glad I went to the Fair. I saw many interesting things and learned much of the white people. They are a very kind and peaceful people. During all the time I was at the Fair no one tried to harm me in any way. Had this been among the Mexicans I am sure I should have been compelled to defend myself often.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right for him to gather it up and take it home {{for his wife and}} children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E

2500|$|From 1925 to 1927, Nicolson {{lived in}} Tehran where Sackville-West went to often visit him. Sackville-West's book A Passenger to Tehran recounts {{her time in}} Iran. Sackville-West disliked Tehran, a city without running water or electricity, which she called a [...] "squalid city of bad roads, rubbish heaps and a few pretentious {{buildings}} and mean houses {{on the verge of}} collapse". At same time, she noted because of Tehran's location high up in the Alborz mountains the air was [...] "pure as the note of a violin". Nicolson and Sackville-West were present at the lavish coronation of Rezā Khan, in Tehran, Persia (now Iran). Sackville-West called Rezā Khan [...] "...an alarming man, six feet four in height, with a sullen manner, a huge nose, grizzled hair and a brutal jowl." [...] Sackville-West wrote {{on the eve of the}} coronation of Rezā Khan, there was [...] "an air of excitement hanging about" [...] Tehran as the [...] "flags were out; festoons of electric light bulbs swooped along the face of the municipal bodies. Wild romantic horsemen paraded the streets in little bunches. Triumphal arches were in the process of erection". She also noted the Persians had [...] "with a characteristic lack of foresight...left everything to the last", but they acted [...] "like people preparing for amateur theatricals...sustained by the conviction that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right on the day". People from all over Persia had come for the coronation of the new Shah, and Sackville-West noted how the capital was full of Baluchi, Turkoman, and Kurdish tribesmen all dressed in their best colorful clothing, adding to the air of excitement. At night, all of Tehran was lit up by vast array of candlesticks and oil lamps burning in many buildings while the main streets were lit up by special oil lamps put up for the coronation and the night sky was illuminated by fireworks. Sackville noted how the streets and even buildings were covered with brightly woven Persian carpets, turning a city of [...] "bricks and plaster" [...] into a [...] "a great and sumptuous tent open to the sky".|$|E
