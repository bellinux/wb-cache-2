5|$|Despite its disappointing box-office returns, in {{what was}} then {{considered}} a risky move, Warner Home Video shipped 320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States in 1995.

5|$|Eddy changed {{printers}} for {{the second}} edition, which was also poorly proofread, and for the third edition in 1881 switched again, this time to John Wilson & Sons, University Press, Cambridge, MA. John Wilson and his successor, William Dana Orcutt, continued to print the book until after Eddy's death. To the 6th edition in 1883, Eddy added with a <b>Key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Scriptures (later retitled with <b>Key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Scriptures), a 20-page glossary containing her definitions of biblical terms. The book sold 15,000 copies between 1875 and 1885.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States' win at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Harris and her {{teammates}} {{became the first}} women's sports team to be honored with a Ticker Tape Parade in New York City.

5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of a dampened kite string and flown the kite in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{back of his hand}} showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E

5|$|Thirty-two such modules {{were then}} stacked and wired {{together}} with a mass of twisted-pair wires into a single processor. The basic cycle time was 2.11ns, or 474MHz, allowing each processor to reach about 0.948 GFLOPS, and a 16 processor machine a theoretical 15.17 GFLOP. <b>Key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high performance was the high-speed access to main memory, which allowed each process to burst up to 8 GB/s.|$|E
5|$|Three warrant {{officers}} survived: the gunner and carpenter were spared {{because they}} were considered useful to the ship, and Southcott the master was spared so he could navigate.

Three petty officers joined the mutiny, one midshipman, Surgeon's Mate Cronin, and Master's Mate Turner.|$|E
5|$|Although such a {{long-range}} {{attack on a}} state far from {{the centre of the}} Empire may seem extraordinary (the last time the Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be explained in terms of Manuel's foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire. This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that {{in the context of the}} wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.|$|E
