40|$|Abstract The {{enhanced}} <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide (CO 2) due {{to increased}} population density has {{significant effect on the}} growth of plant biomass. It is noted here that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is absorbed by plant biomass during photosynthesis. In this paper, therefore, a nonlinear mathematical model is proposed to study the dynamics of population density dependent <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide in the atmosphere. The phenomenon is assumed to be governed by three nonlinearly dependent variables namely; plant biomass density, population density and the concentration <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide. The model is analyzed using stability theory of ordinary differential equations and numerical simulations. It is shown that the density of plant biomass increases as the concentration <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide increases. It is, further, shown that the equilibrium density of plant biomass decreases as the density of human population increases but the concentration <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide increases in the atmosphere.

25|$|Specifically, {{the buildup}} of {{biofouling}} on marine vessels poses a significant problem. In some instances, the hull structure and propulsion systems can be damaged. The accumulation of biofoulers on hulls can increase both the hydrodynamic volume of a vessel and the hydrodynamic friction, leading to increased drag of up to 60%. The drag increase has been seen to decrease speeds by up to 10%, which can require up to a 40% increase in fuel to compensate. With fuel typically comprising {{up to half of}} marine transport costs, antifouling methods are estimated to save the shipping industry around $60 billion per year. Increased fuel use due to biofouling contributes to adverse environmental effects and is predicted to increase <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide and sulfur dioxide between 38 and 72% by 2020.|$|E
