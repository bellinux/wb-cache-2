40|$|The {{extensive}} {{territory of}} the ancient (Hellenistic to Byzantine) city of Sagalassos (SW Turkey) offered a rich variety in natural mineral resources. The frequent occurrence of iron slag in the excavations at the site proved the local working of metal. A <b>geochemical</b> <b>prospection</b> campaign {{was done in the}} {{territory of the}} ancient city in order to identify or discard the city and its territory as a self-sustaining metallurgical centre. Secondly, the geochemical impact of ancient metallurgy was investigated. Geochemical anomalies identified in stream sediments are explained by the presence of mineralised deposits and ancient metal working. Mg, Cr, Co and Ni anomalies point to chromite and chrysotile-magnetite deposits related to the basic rocks of the Lycian nappes in the area. Fe, V and Ti anomalies indicate the presence of iron mineralisations, which have been worked for iron production in ancient times. Finally, the association of P, Cu, Ph, Mn, As and Ag anomalies are an indicator of human activity at archaeological sites'. Within the framework of this <b>geochemical</b> <b>prospection,</b> a metal working site apart from the city of Sagalassos was identified. Here, ore was both extracted and processed to workable iron.

40|$|In {{order to}} take full {{advantage}} of the archaeological information contained within buried archaeological sites, it is important to apply an integrative approach combining complementary prospection methods. In this study, <b>geochemical</b> <b>prospection</b> data are combined with archaeological and geophysical survey results on an unexcavated site in suburban Sagalassos (SW-Turkey), with the aim of obtaining better insights into the structural shapes and past functionalities of the area. Spatial and multivariate statistical analyses of the chemical data reveal anomalies of K, P and Zn on a location where archaeological and geophysical results suggest the presence of ceramic producing kilns. These elemental enrichments are thought to result from burning wood or dung as fuel for the detected kilns. In addition, local anomalies of Co, Cr, Fe, Mg, Mn and Ni were found to reflect the working and storage of ophiolitic clays, employed as a raw material for ceramic production. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal in a 2. 5 m deep drill core in this zone provides ages between AD 120 and 350 at depths of 50 and 60 cm. Al, As, Ba, Ca, Na, Sr, Ti and Pb are considered geogenic elements in this study. The present study supports the theory that <b>geochemical</b> <b>prospection</b> holds potential as a surveying technique, as it was found that chemical data facilitate the interpretation of structures detected by geophysical and archaeological methods, thereby creating an extra dimension to the interpretation of survey data. The results further argue in favour of using strong-acid extractions and the consideration of a large suite of elements when applying chemical soil survey as an archaeological prospection technique, and highlight the importance of considering site lithology. Multivariate statistics proved to be invaluable in distinguishing anthropogenic from lithological soil patterns. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Organic geochemistry. a {{comparatively}} young scientific discipline {{integrated into the}} basic geological model can affect the reduction {{of oil and gas}} exploration risks. The correct use of these data, particularly on a regional level, so-called geochemical mapping, has been successful in discovering the hydrocarbon reservoir. By selecting relevant geochemical parameters (source, migration, temperature regime) it has been possible to obtain particulary useful information about marginal, markedly unfavourable parts of the basin, where exploration costs are very high. The geochemical results are used as correlation parameters, not only in exploration, but also during hydrocarbon production. They enable determination of reservoir destruction, as well as composition change of reservoir hydrocarbons. However, the combination of all geological and geopbysical methods and techniques in the course of exploration process results in the maximum effect of <b>geochemical</b> <b>prospection.</b> </div...|$|E
40|$|Like other geodynamically active areas {{also the}} Hellenic {{territory}} {{is affected by}} {{a large number of}} geogenic gas manifestations. These occur either in form of point sources (fumaroles, mofettes, bubbling gases) or as diffuse soil gas emanations. Geogenic sources release huge amounts of gases, which, apart from having important influences on the global climate, could have strong impact on human health. Gases have both acute and chronic effects. Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen Sulphide are the main gases responsible for acute mortality due to their asphyxiating and/or toxic properties. Gas hazard is often disregarded because in fatal episodes connected to geogenic gases the death cause is often not correctly attributed. Due to the fact that geodynamic active areas can release geogenic gases for million years over wide areas, {{it is important not to}} underestimate potential risks. The present work produced a first catalogue of the geogenic gas manifestations of the whole Hellenic territory also considering literature data. Carbon dioxide dominated manifestations are the majority (61 out of 81). Most of them are found along the South Aegean Active Volcanic Arc. Many sites are also found in northern Greece and along the Sperchios basin - north Evia graben (central Greece) which are characterised by extensional tectonic activity. A preliminary estimation of the gas hazard has been made for the time period of the last 20 years considering the whole population of Greece. In this period at least two fatal episodes with a total of three victims could be certainly attributed to geogenic gases (specifically carbon dioxide). This would give a risk of 1. 3 10 - 8 fatalities from geogenic gas manifestations per annum. Of course this risk is unevenly distributed along the whole Hellenic territory and it will depend on many factors. The most important factor will be the geographical distribution of the natural gas manifestations while also the strength of the source, the chemical composition of the gases, the meteorological conditions and the topography of the area will contribute to the determination of the local risk. The assessment of the geographical distribution of the risk levels is a difficult task, but the present catalogue of the gas manifestations of the natural gas manifestations of Greece will be a contribution to its determination. Since deaths due to natural gases are often wrongly attributed we cannot exclude that some fatal episode has not be recognized and thus that the risk is somewhat higher than that here assessed. Although very low this risk has not to be neglected, not only because possibly underestimated but also because simple countermeasures could be adopted. Dangerous area can be easily identified and delimited by <b>geochemical</b> <b>prospections</b> and their hazard properly evidenced...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{growth of}} energy consumption, the progressive and fast depletion of hydrocarbon reserves, the environmental pollution, {{in addition to}} frequent political crises, have generated a global importance energy emergency. At the same time, the growth in energy production has to be ‘sustainable’, meaning a social and economic development respectful of the natural times and of {{the resources of the}} Planet. Within this general framework, {{one of the most important}} ‘renewable’ is the geothermal, being the energy originated from the heat released by the Earth. In the Country that launched the geothermal energy in the world, initiating the era of energy production from this source (Larderello 1904), the aim of this Ph. D. thesis is to investigate the less promising east side of Italy in a region with surface thermal manifestations, in order to characterize the potential geothermal system. The study area was identified in the Acquasanta anticline (Acquasanta Terme, Southern Marche Region, Central Italy), located within the foredeep Laga basin with low heat flow values and water temperatures ranging between 20 º C and 30 º C at surface. To achieve the purpose, we integrate different <b>prospections</b> (<b>geochemical,</b> seismic and structural) that allow for a comprehensive picture of the geothermal system. The model of a geothermal system characterized by water of meteoric origin flowing from south to north is proposed. Water infiltrates at altitudes ranging between 1400 m and 1700 m, identifying the recharge area with the Laga Mountains, located in the southernmost part of the anticline, about 30 km South of Acquasanta Terme. From geochemical data collected along more than one year of monitoring three “end – member” waters with different chemical features and circuits are defined. The first water type shows higher temperatures (25. 3 º C – 30. 0 º C), and salinity and chemical composition stable during time. It displays a clear contact with the Burano Anhydrites Fm and with carbonatic rocks, confirmed by Sr isotopic values. Furthermore, it has a residence time greater than sixty years (0 T. U.), indication of long circulation period, and no mixing with younger waters. Moreover, some indications (i. e. Rubidium) of a possible slight contribution from deep fluids are present. The second water end – member likely infiltrates at lower quotes than the previous one, following a shorter deep circuit within the same formations as suggested by ion concentrations. It was also recognized within the Varoni_ 1 deep well (AGIP s. p. a., 1987). The third type is inferable from samples distribution on correlation graphs and from identified mixing trends, characterized by warm temperature, but lower ions concentrations than the others. This water likely flows only within the Calcare Massiccio Fm, just interacting with anhydrites, probably following a slightly faster circuit. Except for the easternmost springs (first end – member), all the other collected springs are influenced by mixing phenomena both among the three end-members and also with surface freshwater. The lateral confinement of the easternmost springs and the peculiar mixing processes are strictly linked to the complex structural setting, in particular to N – S oriented faults. The reservoir is identified mainly within the Calcare Massiccio Fm (CM). In detail, by seismic interpretation, it is slightly N-plunging, following the anticline geometry, and laterally bounded by a N – S oriented thrust to the east, a related backthrust to the west, and by a WNW – ESE normal fault to the north. Its bottom depth ranges between 3000 m and 3800 m below the surface. A first estimation gives back a computed volume of about 66 km 3. The mentioned WNW – ESE extensional discontinuity is also considered to be the main rising conduit for the deep hot waters. In the final part of the fluid circuit, hot waters flow within the shallow reservoir of the Scaglia Rossa Fm (SR) creating relevant karst caves phenomena. Finally, all the thermal manifestations occur at the base of the low permeability Scaglia Cinerea Fm (reservoir cap rock), on the right bank of the Tronto River, as confirmed by relevant travertine deposits. Detailed quantitative structural analyses were performed both in the lower (CM) and shallower (SR) reservoirs, in order to create the DFN model and to compute their connectivity properties. In particular, for the CM buried reservoir, an analogue example has been used to perform the field analyses. The highest permeability is shown along the bottom up and the longitudinal directions, whose calculated permeability value is 0. 148 mDarcy. Moreover, fractured volume derived from these structural data allows to calculate an estimation of the total profit volume of the reservoir, resulting in 1. 32 km 3. Concerning the temperature reached by the system, K/Mg geothermometer applied on the most stable samples gives back an estimated temperature at the bottom of the reservoir (top of the Burano Anhydrites Fm) of about 90 º C, consistent with the normal geothermal gradient of the sedimentary Laga Basin...|$|R
40|$|Roughly, {{the name}} {{chemical}} geology {{has been used}} for as long as chemistry has been applied in geology; the name geochemistry was introduced by Schönbein, in 1838. Whereas initially the names were often regarded as synonymous, in our century {{there is a tendency to}} make a distinction between the two on the basis of the way in which the subject is approached. In the previous century most of the work dealt with mineral and rock analysis and the occurrence of geochemical cycles. Other fields of study, such as isotope “geology”, physico-chemical petrology and crystal chemistry reached maturity early in the twentieth century. Somewhat later sedimentary geochemistry began to expand. The rise of <b>geochemical</b> <b>prospection</b> took place mainly in the nineteen thirties. In the meantime, a considerable progress was also achieved in the field of analytical geochemistry, particularly through the development of various new techniques...|$|E

40|$|A <b>geochemical</b> <b>prospection</b> of the fluids {{circulating}} over {{a volcanic}} island highlighted {{the existence of}} reservoirs of both fresh and thermal water although only a few natural manifestation, mainly occurring in submarine environment, provide clues of their existence. Coupling the {{information provided by the}} diffuse gas bubbling and the low-salinity waters discharged from the sea floor off the Island with those from the low-salinity and thermal waters collected from in-land wells drilled in recent times we found that a large amount of fresh and thermal waters are continuously discharged at the sea level. The thermal waters, collected at a temperature of 32 - 36 °C, show a typical marine recharge with equilibrium temperatures estimated to be in the range of 120 - 160 °C. As matter of fact, the small island holds relatively large reservoirs of both fresh and thermal waters.

40|$|In Central Brazil, a {{lateritic}} trust {{was formed}} on a Pleistocene peneplanation surface. In the central {{western part of}} the State of Goias, this trust, which is being dismantled by recent weathering, occurs parti-ally above metasedimentary rocks with copper sulfide mineralization. Some mineralogical and geochemical evidences show a close lithodependence with the immediately underlying rock. Isovolumetric and isoaluminium analyses show that during the weathering there was a depletion of elements. This depletion is slight for iron and aluminium but total for the alkaline elements. Silica shows an intermediate behaviour. However, we observe in the trust an absolute accumulation of iron. Where the topography presents gentle slopes a secondary trust has been formed, with the rock structure preserved. In this case the absolute accumulation of iron is more abundant than in the primary trust. This seems to indicate a vertical but also a lateral mobility of iron. Varions analyses show a clear relationship between iron oxides and hydroxides and coPPer in the top part of the weathered mantle. However, in the studied profiles, this relationship seems to be closer in the deeper portions than in the superficial horizon. The results obtained SO far suggest that for <b>geochemical</b> <b>prospection,</b> analysis of the iron-oxide-rich phases, for example, nodules formed by trust destruction, may give a better geochemical picture than other classical procedures...|$|E
40|$|Geological mapping and {{regional}} <b>geochemical</b> <b>prospection</b> {{on a scale}} of 1 : 50, 000, covered an area of about 4, 000 km 2 in the Zamtyn Nuruu region of the eastern Mongolian Altay. Northern part of the region is formed by the Lake Zone Terrane, the southern by the Gobi Altay Terrane; these two units are separated by the Bogd fault. The panned-concentrate heavy mineral survey was combined with the dry stream-sediment geochemistry, both being complemented by lithogeochemical sampling. The dry stream-sediment geochemistry proved to be a suitable method for regional prospection in semiarid to arid areas of Mongolia. The morphology and composition of placer gold grains were studied in order to estimate the distance from the primary source, and to constrain the nature of prospective primary mineral deposits. Based on the results of the regional geochemical survey and geological mapping, follow-up works were focused on prospective areas including the reconnaissance field works, detailed geochemical sampling, and geophysical measurements. New occurrences and signs of Au, Cu, Zn and (Ba) -As-Sb-Hg mineralizations were discovered. The ascertained gold-bearing mineralizations are represented namely by Au and Au-(Ag) quartz veins in basic metavolcanic rocks of the Neoproterozoic Khan Taishir and volcanic rocks of the Permian Delger Khangay formations. Gold locally accompanies vein-disseminated base metal mineralization in some Proterozoic and Lower Palaeozoic formations. A prospective occurrence of clastic gold in Mesozoic conglomerates and sandstones was found at the northern edge of the Zamtyn Nuruu around the Samoandamba Uul.
