50|$|Refractive {{modulators}} {{most often}} {{make use of}} an electro-optic effect. Some modulators utilize an acousto-optic effect or magneto-optic effect or take advantage of polarization changes in liquid crystals. The refractive modulators are named by the respective effect: i.e. electrooptic modulators, acousto-optic modulators etc.The effect of a refractive modulator {{of any of the}} types mentioned above is to change the phase of a light beam. The phase modulation can be converted into amplitude modulation using an interferometer or directional coupler. Separate case of modulators are spatial light modulators (SLMs). The role of SLM is modification two <b>dimensional</b> <b>distribution</b> of amplitude and/or phase of an optical wave.|$|E

50|$|An optical {{modulator}} is an optical device {{which is used}} to modulate a beam of light with a perturbation device. It is a kind of transmitter to convert information to optical binary signal through optical fiber (optical waveguide) or transmission medium of optical frequency in fiber optic communication. There are several methods to manipulate this device depending on the parameter of a light beam like amplitude modulator (majority), phase modulator, polarization modulator etc.The easiest way to obtain modulation is modulation of intensity of a light by the current driving the light source (laser diode). This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason, light modulators are called external light modulators.According to manipulation of the properties of material modulators are divided into two groups, absorptive modulators (absorption coefficient) and refractive modulators (refractive index of the material). Absorption coefficient can be manipulated by Franz-Keldysh effect, Quantum-Confined Stark Effect, excitonic absorption, or changes of free carrier concentration. Usually, if several such effects appear together, the modulator is called electro-absorptive modulator. Refractive modulators most often make use of electro-optic effect (amplitude & phase modulation), other modulators are made with acousto-optic effect, magneto-optic effect such as Faraday and Cotton-Mouton effects. The other case of modulators is spatial light modulator (SLM) which is modified two <b>dimensional</b> <b>distribution</b> of amplitude & phase of an optical wave.|$|E

This study assessed variability trends in kernel <b>dimensional</b> <b>distributions</b> of Bengal (medium-grain), Cypress, and Drew (long-grains) rice varieties.
