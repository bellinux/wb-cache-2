40|$|In {{this thesis}} an attempt {{is made to}} make a step forward in the {{development}} of next a generation scanning electron lithography machine for sub 25 nm chip making. One of the challenges for such a system is to have sufficient beam-lets with enough current for parallel writing which requires a sufficiently bright electron source. Since the present day commercial electron source is unable to provide the necessary number of beamlets with enough current, an array of bright and stable electron sources such as Schottky emitters is needed. As the Schottky emitter is operated at 1800 K, this results in challenges pertaining to alignment between various electrodes and emitters, which is important for beam to beam uniformity and beam stability. This thesis focuses mainly on the study of creating an array of Schottky emitters and addresses the various requirements and issues associated with the design such as thermal loading, positional stability and manufacturability. For parallel electron beam lithography, an array of miniaturized Schottky emitters is proposed. The design of this miniaturized Schottky emitter unit is analyzed thermally in chapter 2 to determine the optimum power and the filament dimensions. A numerical thermal analysis in steady state condition has been done and the temperature of the tip has been determined for different currents and heating filament dimensions. The optimized solution from the model is used for the fabrication of a miniature Schottky emitter. Apart from the heat radiation from the tip, emission from 200 such emitters would generate the considerable thermal load of 200 W on the extractor. Chapter 3 describes a possible way of reducing the thermal load on the extractor: it is shown by simulation that the extractor can be operated and the heat load can be halved if the Schottky emitter is operated without suppressor electrode. Simulation results show that if the suppressor electrode is removed, the same field as for the standard configuration can be obtained at the tip apex at an extraction voltage of 2265 V instead of 5000 V. The estimated total emission without the suppressor electrode rises to 668 ?A in comparison to 500 ?A in the standard configuration. However the total heating power dissipating on the extractor would be 40 % lower than the standard configuration. The position of the Schottky emitter tip is not stable during its life time. The position stability of the Schottky emitter is an issue as any misalignment with respect to the extractor would result in a change of the virtual source position. An attempt to study the tip stability and its mechanism from a thermo-mechanical point of view is presented in chapter 4. It is concluded that the tip movement is determined by many factors such as thermal history/thermal cycle, stress present and non-symmetrical filament length. Because of a time dependent- stress relaxing creep, the drift rate goes down with time, therefore it is imperative to know the thermal history of the tip to predict its movement. A better creep resistant material such as W-Re alloy for the filament could minimize the effect of creep. However the best alternative is to have a design which can compensate for such drifts. To compensate for the drift in z direction, a possible actuating mechanism was proposed using RTV 566. Chapter 5 reports the preliminary feasibility study of the RTV 566 for its application as a "spring" for in-situ height adjustment in our proposed design for an array of Schottky emitters. Although RTV 566 shows very little hysteresis, it shows clear sign of viscoelastic behavior, rendering it unsuitable for the application. The effort for z actuating of individual tips is then discontinued for the future design process. Another challenge is to miniaturize the Schottky emitter to 1 mm diameter. The diameter of a conventional Schottky emitter unit is too large (17. 5 mm) to use in an array of emitters, which would consist of 200 emitters at a pitch of 1. 5 mm. Chapter 6 discusses a novel method of fabricating a miniaturized Schottky emitter of 1 mm diameter by Wire-Electro Discharge Machining (WEDM) of polycrystalline tungsten with very good dimensional control and reproducibility. Joule heating in vacuum shows good operational feasibility and temperature stability. Therefore this concept has been considered for the design of Schottky emitter array. Chapter 7 documents various concepts of the Schottky emitter array. This chapter also shows the feasibility based on the results from earlier chapters. After careful evaluation some of the requirements were modified and re-assessed. It is deduced that the design with position control and temperature control would be difficult to implement. A design with no individual temperature and position control is proposed which consists of a tungsten block with monocrystalline tips on it. This, however, would require a large piece of W(100) which is not easily available. Chapter 8 presents the concept of DC Joule heating for the crystallographic transformation to convert polycrystalline tungsten to W(100) for the fabrication of the Schottky emitters. A miniature Schottky emitter fabricated by Wire Electrical Discharge Machining (WEDM) was heated by a DC current and the crystallographic orientation was subsequently determined by electron diffraction. In chapter 9 the design concept was extended for the fabrication of a prototype multi-tip for parallel electron beam lithography using WEDM technique. An attempt is made to recrystallize the tips but the experiment could not be completed. The recrystallization of polycrystalline tungsten in DC Joule heating can open up possibilities of using it in other shape and sizes. However, all the above concepts possess challenges of ensuring a uniform tip radius, where the recipe may need tailoring. A concept of parallel etching is proposed. Combining the above knowledge, a design for a next generation Schottky emitter array is proposed in chapter 10. It consists of four basic units: a heating plate, emitter block consisting of 200 tips, electrodes system and several accessories. The important components included in this design are a simple heater which can be fixed to the emitter block, a water channel in the insulating periphery of the electrodes for the cooling of the electrodes, a piezo-electric stage and an alignment screw plate for the alignment of tips and electrodes. Since the alignment between the tips and electrodes is very critical, it is important to estimate the performance and reliability of such units. In chapter 11, a detailed analysis involving determination of temperature profiles across various electrodes and the resulting stress is carried out by two methods and for two different configurations. The thermal load is evaluated and the necessary cooling is calculated. It is concluded that the thermal load is within the limit if sufficient cooling is done. Although the calculated temperature on the electrodes would not be an issue, the displacement in x-y direction on the extractor/micro-lens could be an issue for the configuration with 4 kV extraction and lens voltage. For optimum a design lower voltage on the extractor and the microlens with fixed edges is proposed. Based on the above thermal evaluation, chapter 12 reports the simulation study of the change in the field at the tip apex and the shift in the position of the virtual source of the Schottky emitter for a given shift in the <b>extractor</b> <b>plate</b> by CPO 3 D ray tracing calculations. The effect of the lateral and axial shift of the extractor on the field at the tip is negligible. However, the shift in virtual source position in x,y and z direction could be an issue even for a micron displacement. Separate deflectors for each beamlet can be used to compensate the x, y displacement. The axial displacement can be compensated by the piezo-stage with relative ease. The above shift in the virtual source position reduces considerably for the suppressor-less configuration. When the extractor is operated at 1 kV, without suppressor, the shift is within the design constraint. Therefore a design without suppressor electrode and an extractor with 1 kV potential is the most preferred concept. Imaging Science & TechnologyApplied Science...|$|E

For the estimation of SWCC using the VPPE system, four specimens with different grain size and void ratio are prepared. The volumetric water contents of the specimens according to the matric suction are measured by the burette system and are estimated in the TDR system during five cycles of SWCC tests. The volumetric water contents estimated by the TDR system are almost identical to those determined by the burette system. The experimental time significantly decreases with the new VPPE. The hysteresis in the SWCC is largest in the first cycle and is nearly identical after 1. 5 cycles. As the initial void ratio decreases, the air entry value increases.

40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that unsaturated soil behaviour and properties {{are governed by}} two stress state variables: soil suction and net stress. Although a soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) can provide a measurement of the water retention ability of an unsaturated soil, very often only a single stress state variable, i. e. soil suction, is considered in experimental programs. In addition, the volume changes of soil specimens during the determination of SWCC have often been ignored. Some recent experimental {{studies have demonstrated that}} the other stress state variable, i. e. net stress, is also important and needs to be considered. Ignoring the effects of net stress and volume changes on measuring any soil property of an unsaturated soil may impose severe constraints in the development and verification of advanced constitutive soil models and hence may affect the accuracy of numerical predictions significantly. In this study, a modified volumetric pressure <b>plate</b> <b>extractor</b> was used to determine the state-dependent soil-water characteristic curve (SDSWCC) of a completely decomposed granite (CDG) with due consideration of volume changes.

40|$|Soil erosion {{tends to}} occur with {{rainfall}} runoff, thus leading to grave {{soil and water}} loss. An increase of water content in soil caused by rain makes the loss of matrix suction and the decrease of shear strength obvious, and will promote soil erosion. The soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) {{can be used to}} describe the relationship between the water content and the matrix suction in unsaturated soil. For this paper we studied the SWCCs of the granite residual soils in a collapsing erosion area in Jiangxi Province, China. A GEO-Experts pressure <b>plate</b> <b>extractor</b> was used to measure SWCCs for soils with different dry density, grain size, drying and wetting cycles, and lime content. The initial dry density has a significant impact on SWCC. With increasing dry density, the suction was decreased for the same water content. The larger the grain size, the greater the suction value for the same volumetric water content. Under the same suction, the volumetric water content decreases as the lime percentage increases and water stability improves. SWCCs of the drying and wetting cycle demonstrate the hysteresis phenomenon. The area of the hysteresis loop decreased with the increase of the dry density and drying and wetting cycle number. It also became small when the soils were mixed with lime. In this paper, the Van Genuchten model, the Fredlund and Xing model, and the Gardner model were used to fit the experimental data of SWCCs. The presented fitting parameters show that the residual sum of squares is less than 0. 002. All the experimental data fit well to three models for SWCC. The results indicated that the simulated value of the Gardner model does provide best agreement with the measured value.

Isotropically consolidated drained (CID) tests were performed on the laboratory compacted samples at different degree of saturation including fully saturated specimens. Suction pressure was measured in the laboratory by adopting pressure <b>plate</b> <b>extractor</b> and compared with determined effective suction in triaxial testing. A generalized failure equation, in term of strength parameters and suction pressure, was defined for all degrees of saturation. The consideration of unsaturated soil sets the current modified model apart from previous bounding surface which only allows use of fully saturated cohesive soil. The saturated material constants associated with the model are identified. These new constants are obtained from a generalized failure equation. The model was then verified by comparing predictions with other laboratory tests which are not used in the calibration. Generally a good agreement between the model and test results was found for stress-strain, stress path and volumetric strain response at different degrees of saturation. Extensive interface tests were performed in the conventional direct shear machine with some modification. Similar to trench cap soil and natural soil in the field, the test specimens were prepared at different degrees of saturation and density (compaction effort). Comparisons were made for the effects of magnitude of normal load, degree of saturation, density, compaction effort, moisture migration and dissimilar bodies density.

40|$|Soil-water {{characteristic}} curve (SWCC) {{is a key}} property for unsaturated soils. It descibes the water retention capacity of unsaturated soils. SWCC {{can be used to}} predict other useful soil properties such as water permeability and is an essential property for both numerical and analytical transient seepage and slope stability analyses. In the thesis, a newly modified triaxial apparatus has been used to investigate the influence of isotropic (ISO) stress conditions on measured SWCCs of some unsaturated expansive soils from China. A one-dimensional (1 D) stress controllable volumetric pressure <b>plate</b> <b>extractor</b> and pressure plate/membrane extractors without applying any external stress are also used in the study. The SWCCs of the expansive soils are found to be stress dependent. The difference between SWCCs tested under zero stress and non-zero stresses is significant. Generally, the expansive soil has a lower water retention ability under stress compared with the results from conventional SWCC tests without external stress. However, the difference between 1 D and ISO stresses is small except for the part in the matric suction range of l- 10 kPa. There is no difference in soil-water characteristics under stress of 50 - and lOO-kPa when the suction is higher than 10 kPa. The test results of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Mercury Instrusion Porosimetry (MIP) show that the recompacted ZY expansive soil has a bi-modal distribution of pore sizes. The pore spaces are mostly composed by inter-aggregate and intra-aggregate pores. Because inter-aggregate pores can be compressed by external stresses, the SWCCs exhibit clear difference under the low suction range from 1 to 10 kPa. Intra-aggregate pores are left unchanged, therefore, the soil-water characteristics are {{more or less the same}} in high suction range of l 0 - 500 kPa, regardless of different stress conditions. A parametric study has been carried out to investigate the influence of rainfall patterns, amount and duration on groundwater responses in an unsaturated slope of residual soils. As for 24 -hr short rainfalls, the advanced rainfall pattern seems to be the most critical rainfall type for the slope stability because it can always induce the highest pore-water pressure distributions along the slope. The higher the rainfall depth is, the higher the pore-water pressure buildup will be. However, in this study, it is found that a further increase in the return period of a rainfall of l 00 -yr, the pore-water pressure does not necessarily increase. Rainfall patterns are more relevant for short rainfalls, since the rainwater distributes more uniformly for storms with long duration...|$|R
40|$|The soil-water {{characteristic}} curve (SWCC) {{is a fundamental}} physical property describing the water retention ability of a soil at different suctions, which is essential for transient seepage analysis in unsaturated soils. In this thesis, the influence of stress state on stress-dependent soil-water {{characteristic curve}}s (SDSWCCs) of both intact and recompacted specimens of completely decomposed granite (CDG) excavated behind the Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital was studied using a triaxial pressure plate system for isotropic and deviatoric stress states, and a stress-controllable volumetric pressure <b>plate</b> <b>extractor</b> for Ko stress state. Measured results were used as input parameters in conjunctive surface-subsurface flow (CSSF) programme, which is capable to determine interaction between surface flow, subsurface flow and infiltration automatically, to investigate the influence of stress state on conjunctive modelling and stability analysis. Parametric studies were also conducted using the CSSF programme to examine the influence of conjunctive modelling on slopes with different slope angles. A slope stability analysis programme CSLOPE, which uses the Morgenstern-Price method, was written to determine the corresponding change in factor of safety after the computation of pore-water pressure by the CSSF programme. It is found that regardless of the stress state (i. e., isotropic, Ko or deviatoric stress conditions), as the stress level increases, the measured SDSWCCs of both recompacted and intact specimens show a reduction in desorption rate, adsorption rate, hysteresis loop size and amount of air entrapment. The above responses for intact specimens are more significant than that for recompacted specimens. Under the same net mean stress but at a higher stress ratio, both intact and recompacted specimens tend to show higher water retention ability and lesser hysteretic responses. Comparatively, the effects of stress ratio on soil-water characteristics are more significant on recompacted specimen than intact specimen. For the recompacted specimens, when the applied stress is higher, the effects of stress ratio are also more noticeable. From the results of numerical analysis, {{it is found that}} the surface water plays an important role on pore-water pressure changes under rainfall. The increase in pore-water pressure is larger when surface water is considered. In other words, ignoring surface water may underestimate pore-water pressure increase due to rainfall infiltration. It is also concluded that the use of deviatoric SDSWCC predicts the greatest increase in pore-water pressure under a given rainfall infiltration. As the deviatoric stress state is also the most relevant stress state for slopes, it is suggested that the deviatoric SDSWCC should be used to analyse slope responses under rainfall. For the range of angles studied, it is concluded that the influence of conjunctive modelling on slope stability at a given depth of 1. 5 m is the more significant on a 15 -degree slope than on a 45 -degree slope...|$|R
40|$|Pumice Soils (Typic Udivitrands) in the Galatea Basin in {{the eastern}} Bay of Plenty, central North Island, New Zealand, are formed on weakly weathered, coarse textured, glassy, pumice tephra {{deposits}} and associated buried soil horizons. The Galatea Basin tends to experience summer drought and decreased summer pasture production. Observations that refilled holes had better summer pasture growth in the disturbed materials compared to growth in adjacent undisturbed soils led to trials where the underlying finer-textured, buried soil horizons were “flipped” (excavated and mixed into the pumiceous surface horizons) using a mechanised digger. The main objective {{of this study was}} to test the hypothesis that the mixing of the finer textured buried horizons into the pumiceous surface soils will give increased water holding capacity and thus improve water availability to plants during dry summer periods. The top 2. 5 m of a reference sequence of four tephra deposits and associated buried soil horizons in an exposed section through a terrace at the southern end of Galatea Basin was described. The tephras and their dates or ages of deposition are(from top) Kaharoa (AD 1314 ± 12), Taupo (AD 232 ± 10), Whakatane (5526 ± 145 calendar years BP), and Rotoma (9423 ± 120 calendar years BP). Undisturbed cores from each soil horizon and the pumiceous tephra layers were collected for water retention and bulk density determination. Four sites were identified that had previously been modified by flipping. Each site contained a flipped area comprising excavated and mixed soil materials and an adjacent “undisturbed” (control) area comprising undisturbed soil. At each of site, three pits were excavated in the flipped area and three in the undisturbed area. Detailed soil descriptions were made and undisturbed soil cores were taken from all horizons in each pit to a depth of 0. 6 m. Water retention was determined using a hanging water column and a pressure <b>plate</b> <b>extractor.</b> The water retention curves for the undisturbed horizons from the reference profile show that most of the water was held in the soil at lower tensions (< 100 kPa). The 3 bBw horizon (Whakatane Tephra) had the highest readily available water (25 % v,v) while the 2 bAB horizon (Taupo Tephra) had the highest total available water capacity (37 % v,v). The mean profile readily-available water contents to 600 mm depth from the flipped soils were higher (P< 0. 01) than those of the undisturbed soils. Plant readily-available water content was calculated in the flipped soils to 600 mm depth and to 450 mm depth in the undisturbed soils (based on plant root observations in the field over summer). Plant readily-available water content was greater in the flipped soils compared to that in the undisturbed soils at sites 1, 2 and 3 (P< 0. 05) and at site 4 (P≤ 0. 1). Assuming an evaporation rate of 4 mm per day and that plant rooting depth is deeper in flipped soils than in undisturbed soils (~ 600 mm compared to ~ 450 mm), the flipped soils can hold more readily-available water (mean of 39 days) than the undisturbed soils (mean of 19 days) between rainfall/irrigation events (assuming soils were wet to field capacity at the start) before the soil water drops below the readily available limit. The hypothesis that “flipping” of the multilayered Pumice Soils will give increased water holding capacity in modified surface horizons (mixed buried soil horizon materials), and thus improve moisture availability to plants during dry summer periods, was accepted...|$|R
