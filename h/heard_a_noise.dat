5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side of}} his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
500|$|Moustache {{is said to}} {{have left}} the cuirassiers after he was struck by a cavalryman with the flat of his sword. [...] De Fivas says that he {{attached}} himself to a unit of dragoons which he followed to Spain, taking part in two campaigns with them during which he would walk ahead of their column and bark warnings whenever he <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise.</b> [...] During a battle in the Sierra Morena mountain range in southern Spain Moustache is alleged to have led back to camp the horses of dragoons killed on the battlefield. [...] Shortly after this he {{is said to have}} been secretly taken by a Colonel who wished to own him. [...] After spending seventeen days in captivity the dog apparently escaped by an open window and joined with a gunboat crew. [...] Afterwards he participated in the Battle of Badajoz where he was struck by a cannonball and killed on 11 March 1812, at the age of twelve years.|$|E
500|$|One of the conspirators, Thomas Percy, was {{promoted}} in June 1604, {{gaining access to}} a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the King's Wardrobe. [...] Fawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy. [...] The contemporaneous account of the prosecution (taken from Thomas Wintour's confession) claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniard's house to Parliament, although this story {{may have been a}} government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but even then he could not locate the tunnel. [...] If the story is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords. [...] They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> from above. [...] Fawkes was sent out to investigate, and returned with the news that the tenant's widow was clearing out a nearby undercroft, directly beneath the House of Lords.|$|E

500|$|It was {{announced}} on 24December that the re-opening of Parliament would be delayed. Concern over the plague meant {{that rather than}} sitting in February, as the plotters had originally planned for, Parliament would not sit again until 3October 1605. [...] The contemporaneous account of the prosecution claimed that during this delay the conspirators were digging a tunnel beneath Parliament. [...] This {{may have been a}} government fabrication, as no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found. [...] The account of a tunnel comes directly from Thomas Wintour's confession, and Guy Fawkes did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation. [...] Logistically, digging a tunnel would have proved extremely difficult, especially as none of the conspirators had any experience of mining. [...] If the story is true, by 6December the Scottish commissioners had finished their work, and the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords. [...] They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> from above. [...] The noise {{turned out to be the}} then-tenant's widow, who was clearing out the undercroft directly beneath the House of Lordsâ€”the room where the plotters eventually stored the gunpowder.|$|E
2500|$|According to T. Ryle Dwyer, {{the prisoners}} [...] "supposedly" [...] {{got hold of}} hand grenades and threw them. One of the sentries testified that he and a {{colleague}} <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> behind them and noticed {{that two of the}} prisoners had thrown the grenades at them. They dived for cover behind some mattresses, but the grenades did not detonate. One of the prisoners was also said to have got hold of a rifle according to one of the guards, which he levelled and fired at the guard commander as he entered the room, but missed. The prisoner then turned the rifle and fired another shot at another guard. The guard said he then fired at the prisoner, and the prisoner dropped, and that the guard commander also fired at the prisoner.|$|E
2500|$|He {{said his}} prayer was {{interrupted}} by a [...] "being from the unseen world". Smith said the being caused his tongue to swell in his mouth so that he could not speak. One account said he <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> behind him like someone walking towards him and then, when he tried to pray again, the noise grew louder, causing him to spring to his feet and look around, but he saw no one. In some of the accounts, he described being covered with a thick darkness and thinking that he would be destroyed. At his darkest moment, he knelt a third time to pray and, as he summoned all his power to pray, he felt ready to sink into oblivion. At that moment, he said his tongue was loosed and he saw a vision.|$|E

50|$|The {{students}} were asked about an uneventful night during their week, where they experienced uninterrupted sleep, uninfluenced by alcohol or other drugs, and inability to recall dreams. While the {{students were}} placed under hypnosis, {{they were told that}} they had <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> loud <b>noise</b> at 4 a.m. After hypnosis, the {{students were asked}} if they remembered hearing <b>a</b> loud <b>noise</b> at 4 a.m. 28% of the informed students and 44% of the uninformed students claimed that they had <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> loud <b>noise</b> at 4 a.m.|$|R

2500|$|In 1986, {{staff writer}} David Jarrard for The Tennessean and {{photographer}} Bill Wilson, the latter {{also a member}} of the National Speleological Society, were given permission to sleep in the cave over night. While in the first cave room they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> from deeper in the cave Jarrard estimated at 30 yards. [...] Subsequently, an [...] "unwavering groan" [...] repeated again with greater volume and accompanied by several loud thumps. When it began a third time, the men retreated to the gate entrance. They explored the wiring to the lights looking for a reason for the noises. They went back to the first cave room but heard a rumble near the entrance. Walking back to the entrance they discovered the rumble was noise from a jet. As they reached the gate, a loud, high pitched scream emanated from inside the cave. The journalists left and did not spend the night.|$|E
2500|$|Prince {{was caught}} in February 1991 after he tried to break into a Scripps Ranch house. A woman, whom he had {{followed}} home from the Miramar Road health club, {{was getting ready to}} shower when she <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> <b>noise</b> at the front door. She ran from the house and sought help from a neighbor who came and confronted Prince. Prince claimed he was trying to find a female friend who had entered the woman's home but eventually gave up and scuttled away. The eyewitnesses took down Prince's license plate number and identified Prince from photographs, and he was arrested on [...] {{in the parking lot of}} a health club after police alerted health club workers to be on the lookout for Prince's automobile. After his arrest, he agreed to provide blood and saliva samples, and the DNA results connected him to the murder of Janene Weinhold. That murder connected him to the others by the pattern presented by the murders.|$|E
