500|$|Scott's story {{concept was}} {{partially}} inspired by Chariots of the Gods?, Erich von Däniken's work about {{the theory of}} ancient astronauts which hypothesizes that life on Earth was created by aliens. Scott said, [...] "NASA and the Vatican agree that [...] almost mathematically impossible {{that we can be}} where we are today without there being a little help along the way... That's what we're looking at , at some of Erich von Däniken's ideas of <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> humans come about." [...] Spaihts originated the idea that David, the android, is like humans but {{does not want to be}} anything like them, eschewing a common theme in [...] "robotic storytelling" [...] such as Blade Runner. He also developed the theme that while the human crew is searching for their creators, David is already among its creators. Scott liked these ideas and further explored them in Lindelof's rewrite. For Shaw, Lindelof felt it was important that she was distinct from Aliens Ripley, to avoid inevitable comparisons between the two characters. In Spaihts's draft, Shaw was directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants to seek out potentially dangerous knowledge. As with David, Lindelof expanded this facet of the character during his rewrites. He spent approximately eight months developing the script, finishing in March 2011 as filming began.|$|E

[...] Christie asked during a Brick, New Jersey town hall meeting. [...] The Star-Ledger editorial board answered that Richard Nixon had cut deals with Democrats, but had still abused power; and that despite Christie's early bipartisanship, he has thrown himself into several partisan standoffs; and that his personal style had always been [...] "vindictive and aggressive"; and concluded that Christie [...] "created the culture that inspired" [...] the lane closures.|$|E
2500|$|Consider some {{subtleties}} {{that people}} are not consciously aware of. The verb is may be used in its full form or its reduced form: people say Kim is happy or Kim’s happy. However, certain instances of is never reduce, for example, the underlined items in Kim is happier than Tim is or I wonder what the problem is in Washington. Most people are not aware of this, but we all know subconsciously not to use the reduced form here. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> come to this? The question arises because the eventual knowledge is richer than relevant experience. As children, we heard instances of the full form and the reduced form, but we were not instructed to avoid the reduced form in certain places; we had no access to [...] "negative data," [...] information about what does not occur.|$|E
2500|$|Netanyahu {{opposed the}} Oslo accords from their inception.

He asserted that Amin al-Husseini {{had been one of}} the masterminds of the Holocaust, and that Yasser Arafat was heir to the former's 'alleged exterminationist Nazism.' During his term as prime minister in the late 1990s, Netanyahu consistently reneged on commitments made by previous Israeli governments as part of the Oslo peace process, leading American peace envoy Dennis Ross to note that [...] "neither President Clinton nor Secretary [...] Albright believed that Bibi had any real interest in pursuing peace." [...] In a 2001 video, Netanyahu, reportedly unaware he was being recorded, said: [...] "They asked me before the election if I'd honor ," [...] "I said I would, but... I'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> do it?

2500|$|The buttery {{books of}} Jesus College, Oxford show Thomas Vaughan being {{admitted}} in May 1638, {{and it has}} long been assumed that Henry went up at the same time, although Wood states, [...] "He made his first entry into Jesus College in Michaelmas term 1638, aged 17 years. There is no clear record to establish Henry's residence or matriculation, but the assumption of his association with Oxford, supported by his inclusion in Athenae Oxoniensis, is reasonable enough." [...] Recent research in the Jesus College archives, however, suggests that Henry did not enter Jesus College before 1641, unless he did so in 1639 without matriculating or paying an admission fee, and left before the record in the surviving buttery books resumes in December of that year. It has been suggested that Henry went to Oxford later, after Thomas, {{on the basis of a}} comparison of the poems each wrote for the 1651 edition of the Comedies, Tragi-Comedies, with Other Poems of William Cartwright, who had died in 1643. Thomas had clearly attended Cartwright's lectures, which were a great draw at the time: [...] "When He did read, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> flock to hear!" [...] Henry, however, apparently had not, since he begins his poem [...] "Upon the poems and plays of the ever-memorable Mr William Cartwright" [...] with the words, [...] "I did but see thee." [...] This and the 1647 poem [...] "Upon Mr Fletcher's plays" [...] are both celebrations of Royalist volumes that implied [...] "a reaffirmation of Cavalier ideals and a gesture of defiance against the society which had repudiated them." ...|$|E
