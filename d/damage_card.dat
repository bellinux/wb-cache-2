5000|$|Each {{plane is}} {{depicted}} on a card {{and has a}} set of maneuver cards specifically designed for it, with large arrows on them. The player controlling the plane plans his turn choosing three of the maneuver cards in sequence and putting them {{face down on the}} gaming mat. All players then reveal their first maneuver card at the same time, put {{it in front of the}} plane card and move the latter so that the little arrowhead on the rear of the plane card matches the one in front of the maneuver card. In this way, planes can then [...] "fly" [...] on the table or the floor.A ruler is used to see if a plane has enemy planes (cards) in his field of fire. If so, the player chooses one target that must take a <b>damage</b> <b>card</b> with a random amount of points (optional rules cover special damages too). Short range fire (up to half ruler of distance) mean two damage cards rather than one.The different planes available determine the firepower, maneuver cards available, and number of damage points able to be sustained before being eliminated and are based on that planes historic performance.|$|E
50|$|Dragon Ball Z: Legendary Super Warriors {{features}} a turn-based card fighting system. There are 125 {{cards in the}} game to be used. The 3 types of cards are attack cards, support cards, for healing or stat boosting, and defense cards. The game has character specific cards to be used strategically during battles. Each character has 4 stats which are Health Points, Strength, Ki, and Speed. Health points determine how long you can last in battle, Strength determines how much damage the melee cards do, Ki determines how much damage the beam cards deal, and Speed determines {{the accuracy of the}} player's attacks, the phase of battle the character is in, and the chance of avoiding an enemies attack. The Speed stat is mostly a defensive stat. To increase these stats the player must level up the characters by gaining experience points through battling or to temporarily increase stats by using a support card mid-battle. Each character may only be leveled up 4 times total and since each character has unique stat attributes the game has a strategy element. Before a battle the player must assemble a deck of 20 cards that they must use to battle the opponent with. In a battle there are two phases, the attack and defense phase. During the attack phase the player's main objective is to both build up card cost (CC) points, which are currency {{to be able to use}} the cards in the deck, with command cards, which require quick button presses to activate, and to deal damage to the opponent. In the attack phase the character may use a basic no cost melee card, a command card, to gain CC, a support card, a <b>damage</b> <b>card,</b> a beam card or use the Gather-power card to increase the Ki and Strength stat. During the defense phase the player has the option to use CC on a support card, a defensive card, or to guard, or move up, forward, or down. The phase the player is in is determined by the character's speed stat and depending on the support cards used can change the phase mid-battle. Each character has 3 decks. The first is the limit deck in which up to 3 cards, 2 cards for a few exceptions, may be placed into to be used by the character indefinitely provided they use the Gather-power card first. The second is the deck the player assembled. The third deck is a fixed deck that has the stage-attack, Gather-power, Guard and move cards.|$|E

40|$|A {{very high}} density of monumental {{heritage}} falls within Palermo Historical Centre, an area characterized by high variability of near surface geology and soil physical-mechanical properties {{on a very}} short distance scale, even few meters. So, neighboring heritage elements can have a totally different hazard exposition. Within a project regarding Palermo area (Project 7 T 7, Cluster 29, funded by Ministero dell’Università e della Ricerca, Italy) a very reliable high density stratigraphic-geotechnical dataset has been assembled, {{by means of a}} careful data reviewing process. This dataset has been stored in a Geographic Information System (GIS) application, named City-GIS, having all GIS functions and tools specifically dedicated to the assessment of natural hazards in urban areas. City-GIS manages the whole dataset developed for Palermo, including also the Historical Centre heritage database. The available dataset and the utilities of City-GIS have allowed reconstructing the geological structure characterizing Palermo Historical Centre. After the 6 th September 2002, Mw 5. 9, earthquake, instrumental and macroseismic surveys have been performed in Palermo, by the INGV and Geology and Geodesy Department of Palermo University the first, by the Regional Department of Civil Protection the latter. Instrumental survey - Eight temporary digital seismic stations were installed to record aftershocks on sites sampling the main different stratigraphic-geotechnical models recognized inside Palermo Historical Centre (Giammarinaro et al., 2000). The variability of ground shaking in Palermo has been evaluated by applying different spectral ratio techniques to seismograms of about 30 aftershocks, with magnitude ≥ 2. 8. Relevant spectral variations have been estimated among the different stratigraphic-geotechnical models, in frequency bands varying from 1 to 3. 5 Hz. Macroseismic survey – A high-density damage census has been performed, using the “AeDES” census <b>damage</b> <b>card,</b> which codifies the damage suffered by structural elements in few features (damage class, typology and area of the damaged structural element). The “AeDES” database has been stored in the City-GIS archive and easily related to the whole dataset concerning Palermo area. Sectors of Palermo Historical Centre, described by stratigraphic-geotechnical models having a different value of VS 30 quantity, are also characterized by different values of the damage indicators used in the “AeDES” system. The obtained values of the damage indicators, used in the “AeDES” system, show a remarkable correlation with the local stratigraphic-geotechnical model, according to the instrumental data. The performed reconstruction of the near-surface geology allowed defining for each heritage element the corresponding stratigraphic-geotechnical model, obtaining a classification of Palermo Historical Centre heritage based on the vulnerability induced by this one...|$|E

5000|$|In a {{standard}} deck, {{there are usually}} two Jokers. The Joker's use varies greatly.

Other games, such as a 25-card variant of Euchre which uses the joker as the highest trump, make {{it one of the}} most important in the game.
