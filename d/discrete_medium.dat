50|$|Neprimerov's {{research}} in various sciences - physics, gravitation theory, geology, biology, etc. - suggested that these had common basics. The search for these fundamentals lead Neprimerov, {{in the early}} 1980s, {{to the creation of}} a physical model of the <b>discrete</b> <b>medium</b> consisting of particles with mass, size, charge and mechanical and magneticmoments that interact through strong forces in the microcosm and through electric and magnetic forces in the three-dimensional macrocosm.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{considerable}} increase of magnetic recording density, the deviation {{of the head}} from the centerline of the track becomes a serious problem for the cross-track interference. In this paper, a three-dimensional read/write simulation system was used to investigate {{the effect of the}} width of the write head on the behavior of the flux and magnetization for continuous track <b>medium</b> and <b>discrete</b> track <b>medium.</b> It is shown that the magnetization in a neighboring track of the <b>discrete</b> track <b>medium</b> is smaller than that of the continuous track medium. The output of the read head using the <b>discrete</b> track <b>medium</b> is larger than that of the continuous track medium when a suitable read head width is chosen so that the cross talk is negligible. </p...|$|R
40|$|Paramecium {{is covered}} by cilia. It uses the cilia to swim and {{transport}} food particles to its mouth. The cilia are synchronised into a collective action by propagating membrane potential and mechan- ical properties of their underlying membrane and the liquid phase en- vironment. The cilia inspired us to design and manufacture a hardware prototype of a massively parallel actuator array, emulated membrane po- tentials via a <b>discrete</b> excitable <b>medium</b> controller and mechanical prop- erties based on vibrating motors. The <b>discrete</b> excitable <b>medium</b> is a two-dimensional array of finite automata, where each automaton, or a cell, updates its state depending on states of its closest neighbours. A local interaction between the automata lead to emergence of propagating patterns, waves and gliders. The excitable medium is interfaced {{with an array of}} actuators. Patterns travelling on an automaton array manifest patterns of actuation travelling along the array of actuators. In com- puter models and laboratory experiments with hardware prototypes we imitate transportation of food towards mouth pore of the Paramecium. The hardware actuator arrays proposed could in future replace simple manipulators in demanding micro-scale application...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} some {{probable}} consequences of introduction of <b>discrete</b> <b>medium</b> - carrier for fields of a substance are considered. The given medium is thinked {{as a set}} of harmonic oscillators filling all space. <b>Discrete</b> <b>medium</b> is introduced on an image and similarity of a crystalline lattice of a condensed matter. The particles - excitation are concentrated in space of a "reciprocal lattice " of <b>discrete</b> <b>medium.</b> This leads to the violation of the energy and momentum conservation laws at the wave number of particles higher then the wave number of the reciprocal lattice. Some possible confirmation of the given consideration may be the behavior of cosmic rays at high energy. The other possible consequences of the proposed approach in physics of elementary particles, cosmology, and quantum mechanics are also discussed. Comment: 8 page...|$|E

40|$|We {{employ the}} numerically exact {{superposition}} T-matrix method to perform extensive computations of electromagnetic scattering by {{a volume of}} <b>discrete</b> random <b>medium</b> densely filled with increasingly absorbing as well as non-absorbing particles. Our numerical data demonstrate that increasing absorption diminishes and nearly extinguishes certain optical effects such as depolarization and coherent backscattering and increases the angular width of coherent backscattering patterns. This result corroborates the multiple-scattering origin of such effects and further demonstrates the heuristic value {{of the concept of}} multiple scattering even in application to densely packed particulate media...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} <b>discrete</b> porous <b>medium</b> equations of {{the form}} ∂_t ρ_t = Δϕ(ρ_t), where Δ is the generator of a reversible continuous time Markov chain on a finite set X, and ϕ is an increasing function. We show that these equations arise as gradient flows of certain entropy functionals with respect to suitable non-local transportation metrics. This {{may be seen as}} a discrete analogue of the Wasserstein gradient flow structure for porous medium equations in R^n discovered by Otto. We present a one-dimensional counterexample to geodesic convexity and discuss Gromov-Hausdorff convergence to the Wasserstein metric. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

Several approaches, among them algorithm parallelization, have been designed to tackle the numerical difficulties arising from such problems.

Existence results had been known, until now, {{in the case of}} local, diffusive coupling {{and in the case of}} a <b>discrete</b> <b>medium,</b> with finite-range, non-local coupling. Our approach replaces methods from geometric singular perturbation theory, that had been crucial in previous existence proofs, by a PDE oriented approach, relying on exponential weights, Fredholm theory, and commutator estimates...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{asymptotic}} {{behavior of the}} cross-polarized enhancement factor {{in the framework of}} the standard low-packing-density theory of coherent backscattering by discrete random media composed of spherically symmetric particles. It is shown that if the particles are strongly absorbing or if the smallest optical dimension of the particulate medium (i. e., the optical thickness of a plane-parallel slab or the optical diameter of a spherically symmetric volume) approaches zero, then the cross-polarized enhancement factor tends to its upper-limit value 2. This theoretical prediction is illustrated using direct computer solutions of the Maxwell equations for spherical volumes of <b>discrete</b> random <b>medium...</b>|$|R
40|$|Reflection from a {{one-dimensional}} random <b>medium</b> of <b>discrete</b> scatterers is considered. The <b>discrete</b> scattering <b>medium</b> {{is modeled}} by a Poisson impulse process with concentration lambda. By employing the Markov {{property of the}} Poisson impulse process, an exact functional integro-differential equation of the Kolmogorov-Feller type is found for the average reflected power. Approximate solutions to this equation are obtained by regular perturbation and two variable expansion techniques {{in the limit of}} small lambda. The regular perturbation results is valid for small slab thicknesses, while the two-variable result is uniformly valid for any thickness. The two-variable result shows that as the slab size becomes infinite all of the incident power is reflected on the average...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{analyzed}} {{circumstances under which}} a rigid particulate sample can behave optically as a true <b>discrete</b> random <b>medium</b> consisting of particles randomly moving relative to each other during measurement. To this end, we applied the numerically exact superposition T-matrix method to model far-field scattering characteristics of fully ordered and quasi-randomly arranged rigid multiparticle groups in fixed and random orientations. We have shown that, in and of itself, averaging optical observables over movements of a rigid sample {{as a whole is}} insufficient unless it is combined with a quasi-random arrangement of the constituent particles in the sample. Otherwise, certain scattering effects typical of discrete random media (including some manifestations of coherent backscattering) may not be accurately replicated...|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} wave motions {{propagate}} in a nonequilibrium <b>discrete</b> <b>medium</b> modeled by a onedimensional array of diffusively coupled Chua’s circuits. The {{problem of the}} existence of the stationary wave solutions is reduced to the analysis of bounded trajectories of a fourth-order system of nonlinear ODEs. Then, we study the homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations of the ODEs system. The lattice can sustain the propagation of solitary pulses, wave fronts and complex wave trains with periodic or chaotic profile...|$|E

Physical space inside the homogeneous optical medium should be described by the Lorentz group with the parameter $c/n$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium.

40|$|Using as {{an example}} a large lattice of locally {{interacting}} Hindmarsh-Rose chaotic neurons, we disclose the origin of ordered structures in a <b>discrete</b> nonequilibrium <b>medium</b> with fast and slow chaotic oscillations. The origin of the ordering mechanism {{is related to the}} appearance of a periodic average dynamics in the group of chaotic neurons whose individual slow activity is significantly synchronized by the group mean field. Introducing the concept of a "coarse grain" as a cluster of neuron elements with periodic averaged behavior allows consideration of the dynamics of a medium composed of these clusters. A study of this medium reveals spatially ordered patterns in the periodic and slow dynamics of the coarse grains that are controlled by the average intensity of the fast chaotic pulsation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{some aspects of}} {{numerical}} modeling of electromagnetic scattering by <b>discrete</b> random <b>medium</b> by using numerically exact solutions of the macroscopic Maxwell equations.

Our study {{is based on the}} results of extensive computations of different characteristics of electromagnetic scattering obtained by using the superposition T-matrix method which represents a direct computer solver of the macroscopic Maxwell equations for an arbitrary multisphere configuration. As a result, in particular, we clarify the range of applicability of the low-density theories of radiative transfer and coherent backscattering as well as of widely used effective-medium approximations...|$|R
40|$|We study {{a system}} of phase {{oscillators}} with nonlocal coupling in a ring that supports self-organized patterns of coherence and incoherence, called chimera states. Introducing a global feedback loop, connecting the phase lag to the order parameter, we can observe chimera states also for systems with {{a small number of}} oscillators. Numerical simulations show a huge variety of regular and irregular patterns composed of localized phase slipping events of single oscillators. Using methods of classical finite dimensional chaos and bifurcation theory, we can identify the emergence of chaotic chimera states as a result of transitions to chaos via period doubling cascades, torus breakup, and intermittency. We can explain the observed phenomena by a mechanism of self-modulated excitability in a <b>discrete</b> excitable <b>medium.</b> Comment: postprint, as accepted in Chaos, 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} modelling of {{the propagation of}} weak nonlinear waves in a <b>discrete</b> <b>medium</b> is carried out. The structured medium {{is considered to be}} a massif of three sizes spheres. The separated spheres interact each other according to the Hertz law. The spectral analysis of the wave perturbation has shown that this model medium possesses the nonlinear properties. The nonlinearity is caused by both the nonlinear contacts of the discrete elements and the redistribution of the energy between different scale elements. Under the wave propagation, the relative part of the high frequencies in wave increases...|$|E
40|$|The {{numerical}} {{method of}} Contact Dynamics {{is used in}} order to simulate the Ring Simple Shear Experiment of a granular medium model (Schneebeli material). The numerical results on the <b>discrete</b> <b>medium</b> are then post-processed in order to construct the displacement fields of an equivalent continuum, {{and the formation of}} a shear interface layer is observed. The existence and magnitude of individual grain rotations imply that the equivalent continuum could be a Cosserat continuum in this case, at least for the material inside the interface layer.

40|$|Photographic {{documentation}} of sculpture produces significant {{consequences for the}} way in which sculptural space is conceived. When viewed as <b>discrete</b> <b>mediums</b> the interaction of the photograph and its sculptural subject is always framed by notions of loss. However, when taken as a composite system, the sculpture-photograph proposes a new ontology of space. In place of the fixity of medium, we can observe a topology at play: a theory drawn from mathematics in which space is understood not as a static field but in terms of properties of connectedness, movement and differentiation. Refracted through the photographic medium, sculpture becomes not a field of fixed points in space, but rather as a fluid set of relations - a continuous sequence of multiple ‘surfaces’, a network of shifting views. This paper will develop a topological account of studio practice through an examination of the work of the contemporary Belgian sculptor Didier Vermeiren (b. 1951). Since the 1980 s, Vermeiren has made extensive use of photography in his sculptural practice. By analysing a series of iterations of his work Cariatide à la Pierre (1997 - 1998), this paper proposes that Vermeiren’s use of photography reveals patterns of connection that expand and complicate the language of sculpture, while also emphasising the broader topology of the artist’s practice as a network of ‘backward glances’ to previous works from the artist’s oeuvre and the art-historical canon. In this context, photography is not simply a method of documentation, but rather a means of revealing the intrinsic condition of sculpture as medium shaped by dynamic patterns of connection and change. In Vermeiren’s work the sculpture-photograph, has a composite identity that exceeds straightforward categories of medium. In their place, we can observe a practice based upon the complex interactions of objects whose ontology is always underpinned by a certain contingency. It is in this fundamental mobility, that the topology of Vermeiren’s practice can be said to rest...|$|R

More precisely, {{although}} we require {{the main part of}} the matrix to be sparse, we allow some dense columns with possibly large coefficients.

In particular, this eases the computation of <b>discrete</b> logarithms in <b>medium</b> and high characteristic finite fields, where nearly sparse matrices naturally appear...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose the}} {{deterministic}} dynamics {{of a free}} particle in a physical vacuum, which is considered as a <b>discrete</b> (quantum) <b>medium.</b> The motion of the particle is studied taking into account its interactions with the medium. It is assumed that this interaction results in the appearance of special virtual excitations, called "inertons," in the vacuum medium in the surroundings of the canonical particle. The solution of the equation of motion shows that a cloud of inertons oscillates around the particle with amplitude Λ=λ v/c, where λ is the de Broglie wavelength, v is the initial velocity of the particle, and c is the initial velocity of the inertons (velocity of light). This oscillating nature of motion is also applied to the particle, and the de Broglie wavelength λ becomes the amplitude of spacial oscillations. The oscillation frequency ν is given by the relation E=hν. The connection of the present model with orthodox nonrelativistic wave mechanics is analyzed.

The characteristic properties of all diagrams are the nonlinearity, hysteresis, and the dependence of the diagram shape on the deforming speed: if the loading duration increases, the curvature of a deformation diagram increases too, but the hysteresis area decreases.

The {{aim of the}} study was to assess the distribution and the pathogenicity of the hirudinea parasites among the inhabiting finfish populations, in various seasons of the time period. The presence of Piscicola spp was recorded only into the Dunavat-Dranov and Razim-Sinoie complexes, in four finfish species: rutilus rutilus, abramis brama, carassius gibelio and perca fluviatilis. The frequency of the infestations differed among the fish species and between the two areas where the parasite was found. The infestation prevalence was highest at the end of the summers, during the autumns and at the beginning of the springs.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{is devoted}} to {{numerical}} analysis of permeability in rocks with multiple fractures. We propose a discrete approach for porous media with dual porosity. The intact porous rock is first discretized by an assembly of impermeable blocks according to the Voronoi diagram. The pore space of the intact rock is replaced by an equivalent network of interfaces between blocks, which produces the same macroscopic hydraulic conductivity as the intact rock. An induced network of macroscopic fracture or cracks is then introduced into the discrete porous rock. A specific numerical algorithm is developed to solve the obtained dual-porosity <b>discrete</b> porous <b>medium.</b> A series of numerical studies are performed in order to verify {{the efficiency of the}} proposed method and to investigate influences of mesh sensitivity, effects of fracture geometry and distribution. The proposed model is then applied to the study of permeability evolution in rock samples submitted to biaxial compression tests with different confining pressures. It is found that the proposed model is able to correctly reproduce the progressive process of initiation and propagation of fractures and the related evolution of permeability...|$|R
