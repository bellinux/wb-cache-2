5000|$|Most {{industry}} standards {{express the}} direction of the grain last when giving dimensions (that is, 17 × 11 inches is short grain paper and 11 × 17 inches is long grain paper), although alternatively the grain alignment can be explicitly indicated with an underline (11 × 17 is short grain) or the letter [...] "M" [...] for [...] "machine" [...] (11M × 17 is short grain). Grain is important because paper will crack if folded across the grain: for example, if a sheet 17 × 11 inches is to be folded to divide the sheet into two 8.5 × 11 halves, then the grain will be along the 11-inch side. Paper intended to be fed into a machine that will bend the paper around rollers, such as a printing press, photocopier or typewriter, should be fed <b>grain</b> <b>side</b> first so that the axis of the rollers is along the grain.|$|E
50|$|Water-logged finds {{generally}} {{consist of}} loose components since the threads used to sew the objects together does not survive humid burial. A tracking {{system should be}} used for keeping the loose components in order throughout the analysis and conservation processes. For wet archaeological leather, the first step is cleaning gently in water with a small soft brush. Conservation is preferably performed after the documentation phase. Documentation consists of drawings and written notes, photographic records are less useful since blackish leather does not show fine detail well. The first step for the Goubitz notation registration is an exact tracing of the fragment’s outline, usually positioned <b>grain</b> <b>side</b> down, flesh side up. Then symbols that indicate the type of stitches and seams are drawn in their appropriate place inside the outline. Sole constructions (the way in which the upper parts of the shoe is fixed to the sole), fastening method and ensembles of components from the same shoe as well as animal type, leather thickness, folds and creases should be noted. If present, decoration type and technique used should also be recorded.|$|E
5000|$|Fuselage era Chryslers all {{featured}} a full width loop style chrome front bumper. Quad headlamps and grille were recessed inside the loop, with differing grille inserts for each series. Turn signal and parking lamps were recessed into the bumper below the head lamps. Body sides were simple and smooth with a subtle character line originating {{at the front}} bumper, descending slightly {{for the length of}} the car, and ending at the wrap-around rear bumper. On Town and Country wagons, this character line was also the location of the lower molding surrounding the standard wood <b>grain</b> <b>side</b> paneling, simulated cherry for 1969. The fuselage profile extended the length of a full sized “long roof” made for a rather striking looking wagon. At the trailing edge of the long roof, body sides, D pillars, and a unique roof top air foil formed one continuous arch over the tailgate opening. The airfoil directed airflow from the roof downward and over the tail gate window, intended to keep the glass clear of dirt accumulation.|$|E

50|$|Town and Country for 1972 {{borrowed}} {{most of its}} exterior trim {{from the}} New Yorker. Die cast grille inserts were shared with New Yorker, and rear wheel openings once again wore fender skirts. Brushed bright metal moldings about two inches wide {{ran the length of}} the car from front bumper to rear, and served as the lower border for the standard simulated wood <b>grain</b> <b>side</b> panels. Standard wheel covers were shared with the Newport, and were identical to the 1969 wheel covers, then shared with the New Yorker. Inside, the front seating choices and door trim were again shared with the Newport Custom. Seatbacks for the standard notch-back front seat featured a high back design with integral head rests. And, Chrysler's two-way door-gate became a three-way, able to open as door with the glass up. Unfortunately, as the Town and Country (and every other car in the ‘70s) grew heavier, available powertrain choices became fewer and weaker. Compression ratios were further reduced to 8.2:1. An increase in bore from 4.25” in the 383 to 4.34” produced a new LB series engine displacement of 400 cu. in. With a 2-BBL carburetor, it just matched the 190 net horsepower and 310 lbft Nm net torque ratings of the prior year 383s. The only remaining optional engine was the 440 cu. in. 4-BBL V8 producing 215 net horsepower and 345 lbft Nm net torque.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A dodecyl/amino {{functionalized}} polysiloxane (RASO) was firstly {{prepared by}} copolymerization of octamethylcyclotetrasiloane (D 4), aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane (KH- 551), dodecylmethyldimethoxysilane (HD- 109), and hexamethydisiloxane (MM) under basic catalyst. Then novel carboxylated polysiloxane (RCAS) was prepared by reaction of RASO with maleic anhydride. Finally RCAS was emulsified with alkyl alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (AEO) to form RCAS emulsions which were utilized in leather waterproofing. The as-synthesized RCAS {{was characterized by}} FT-IR, 1 H-NMR, TEM, and Particles size distribution (PSD) analyses, respectively and effect of dose of RCAS emulsion on hydrophobicity of the treated crust leather was also investigated in this work. Results showed that RCAS emulsion particles presented an uniform sphere with an average diameter of 96 nm. When dose of RCAS emulsion was larger than 6 % (based on the weight of wet blue leather), the RCAS treated leather possessed better water-repellent property and water contact angle (WCA) on the <b>grain</b> <b>side</b> and flesh side of that could attain 130 ° and 138 °, repectively...|$|E

After a campaign by the RDS they agreed to allow a maximum of two excursion trains per year to use these routes. On 1 October 1983 400 people boarded a Class 31-hauled ten coach train bound for Portsmouth. Although the Class 31 broke down at Woking, the delayed service made the complete journey. In 1984, due to stock shortages and economic factors, only one special was operated, when a four-car Class 101 DMU carried 200 people between Dereham and Clacton. In 1985 a Class 101 DMU carried 100 passengers from Dereham to Cambridge. While the Dereham passengers were in the city, the DMU ran a rail tour to North Elmham, carrying 100 people from Cambridge.

40|$|Quinoa, {{pronounced}} “KEEN-wah,” is a pseudocereal. Unlike the monocot cereal crops {{wheat and}} rice, quinoa {{is not and}} does {{not look like a}} grass. Quinoa is in the Amaranthaceae family along with garden favorites spinach and beets as well as the weed lambsquarters. It is a tall, broadleaved, ornamental dicot. The seeds are small, round, and range in color: white, brown, red, and black. Typically prepared in a similar manner as boiled rice, quinoa can be served as a <b>grain</b> <b>side</b> dish or incorporated into salads and other recipes. Quinoa is desirable not just for its flavor, described as earthy, nutty, and sweet, but also for its nutritional profile. Quinoa is gluten free, high in protein, and contains all necessary amino acids required for human health. Many people are now cooking this Andean grain at home, and most of the quinoa consumed in this country is imported from South America, primarily Bolivia and Peru.

40|$|Multi-processor {{systems are}} {{becoming}} the de-facto standard across different computing domains, ranging from high-end multi-tenant cloud servers to low-power mobile platforms. The denser integration of CPUs creates {{an opportunity for}} great economic savings achieved by packing processes of multiple tenants or by bundling all kinds of tasks at vari-ous privilege levels to share the same platform. This level of sharing carries with it a serious risk of leaking sensitive information through the shared microarchitectural compo-nents. Microarchitectural attacks initially only exploited core-private resources, but were quickly generalized to re-sources shared within the CPU. We present the first fine <b>grain</b> <b>side</b> channel attack that works across processors. The attack does not require CPU co-location of the attacker and the victim. The novelty of the proposed work is that, {{for the first time}} the directory protocol of high efficiency CPU interconnects is targeted. The directory protocol is common to all modern multi-CPU systems. Examples include AMD’s HyperTransport, Intel’s Quickpath, and ARM’s AMBA Coherent Interconnect. The proposed attack does not rely on any specific characteristic of the cache hierarchy, e. g. inclusiveness. Note that in-clusiveness was assumed in all earlier works. Furthermore, the viability of the proposed covert channel is demonstrated with two new attacks: by recovering a full AES key in OpenSSL, and a full ElGamal key in libgcrypt within the range of seconds on a shared AMD Opteron server...|$|E
