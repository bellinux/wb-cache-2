25|$|BMW {{said the}} flexible, {{stretchable}} water resistant translucent man-made fabric skin– polyurethane-coated Spandex, is resilient and durable. It resists {{high or low}} temperatures, does not swell or shrink and the movement does not slacken or damage the fabric. The body changes its shape according to exterior conditions and speeds, and it also allows the driver to change its shape at will. The fabric is stretched over a moveable frame; essential shapes are formed beneath the skin by an aluminium wire structure, though at points where movement is needed (ducts, door openings, spoiler) flexible carbon struts are used. The shape of the frame is controlled by many electric and hydraulic actuators; for example, the headlights are revealed when small motors pull the <b>fabric</b> <b>back</b> in an eyelid like fashion. As the fabric is translucent the taillights shine through it.|$|E
2500|$|A pleat (older plait) {{is a type}} of fold {{formed by}} {{doubling}} <b>fabric</b> <b>back</b> upon itself and securing it in place. [...] It is commonly used in clothing and upholstery to gather a wide piece of fabric to a narrower circumference.|$|E
5000|$|This {{arrangement}} is called [...] "drop feed" [...] {{in reference to}} the way the dogs drop below the needle plate when returning for the next stroke. Allen B. Wilson invented it during the time period 1850 to 1854, while also developing the rotary hook. Wilson called it a [...] "four-motion feed", {{in reference to the}} four movements the dogs perform during one full stitch: up into the <b>fabric,</b> <b>back</b> to pull the fabric along to the next stitch, down out of the fabric and below the needle plate, and then forward to return to the starting position.|$|E
50|$|Gorilla Tape {{incorporates}} a three-layer construction: a weather-resistant outer shell, reinforced <b>fabric</b> <b>backing,</b> and {{an adhesive layer}} that is applied twice as thick as the adhesive found on duct tape, which Popular Science says allows it to better surround and grip uneven surfaces. To prevent premature tearing, the two layers of <b>fabric</b> <b>backing</b> are slightly offset, making the tape 145 percent stronger than duct tape, while still allowing it to be torn by hand.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} type of top vent is a {{disk-shaped}} flap of fabric called a parachute vent, invented by Tracy Barnes. The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of [...] "vent lines" [...] that converge in the center. (The arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a parachute—thus the name.) These [...] "vent lines" [...] are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line. Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent <b>fabric</b> <b>back</b> into place. A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing.|$|E
40|$|The human {{tendency}} for bounded space bridges time, place and culture. Boundaries {{can either be}} physical or invisible, permanent or temporal, political or natural, they can invite or exclude, unite or divide. Boundaries can assist in regulating communication between separate entities, {{but they can also}} isolate and be detrimental to the well being of their contents. It is a natural human tendency to place people and things into well-defined categories, and {{it can be difficult to}} dismantle our preconceptions about these categories. If designers are not aware of this predilection, harmful environments can be created if these boundaries are replicated spatially. 	The Oldtown and Penn Fallsway neighborhoods in East Baltimore, Maryland are disconnected and therefore isolated from their surroundings, and also function as a centrifugal boundary between downtown and East Baltimore. This thesis explores the rise and fall of these neighborhoods over time, and how a series of decisions relating to physical and sociocultural boundaries were instrumental in their eventual decline. This thesis explores how to dissolve those perceived and actual boundaries by weaving the urban <b>fabric</b> <b>back</b> into the surrounding context. By critically studying how boundaries related to the temporal, sociocultural, and ecological aspects of this site, Oldtown can once again be a healthy connected neighborhood...|$|E

50|$|Sometime after nylon-backed {{neoprene}} appeared, {{the blind}} stitch method was developed. A blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle, {{which does not}} {{go all the way}} through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the <b>fabric</b> <b>backing,</b> crosses the glue line, and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene. This is similar to the overlock stitching used for teeshirts and other garments made from knitted fabrics.|$|R

25|$|Lorica squamata was a type {{of scale}} armour used during the Roman Republic and at later periods. It was made from small metal scales sewn to a <b>fabric</b> <b>backing.</b> It is {{typically}} seen on depictions of standard bearers, musicians, centurions, cavalry troops, and even auxiliary infantry, but could be worn by regular legionaries as well. A shirt of scale armour was shaped {{in the same way}} as a lorica hamata, mid-thigh length with the shoulder doublings or cape.|$|R
50|$|The curved needle {{allows the}} <b>fabric</b> <b>backing</b> to be sewn {{together}} without punching a hole completely through the neoprene, and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam. Blindstitch seams also lay flat, butting up {{the edge of}} one sheet against another, allowing the material to lay flatter {{and closer to the}} skin. For these reasons blindstitching rapidly became the primary method of sewing wetsuits together, with other methods now used mainly for decorative or stylistic purposes.|$|R
5000|$|An {{embroidered}} patch, {{also known}} as a cloth badge, is a piece of embroidery which is created by using a <b>fabric</b> <b>backing</b> and thread. Embroidered patches can be attached with a pin, sewn on, or affixed with more modern methods such as iron-on, dryer heat-activated adhesive, and Velcro backing. The art of making embroidered patches is decades old, but the introduction of new high-speed, computerized machines has brought a once rare, time-consuming art into mass production.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{computer}} technology, patches were made by hand. The general process, however, remains the same today. First, a <b>fabric</b> <b>backing</b> is cut to shape. To prevent fraying, {{the edges of the}} backing are heat-sealed. Then, the thread is stitched into place. Some designs incorporate the backing as the background of the patch, while others completely cover the backing with stitches. To finish the patch, iron-on adhesive may be applied to the reverse—a step that was not originally done.|$|R

25|$|There are {{generally}} three layers in a quilt: the quilt top, the middle layer of batting, and the <b>fabric</b> <b>backing.</b> The quilt top is the design layer. The cotton or polyester batting {{in the middle}} layer is what determines {{the warmth of the}} quilt. Batting comes in different thicknesses depending on the purpose of the final quilt, and multiple layers of batting can be combined to increase the warmth of the final product. The bottom layer is often a simple layer of solid fabric, in a neutral or complimentary color and design scheme, though some quilters use the extra or spare fabric from the quilt top to make a secondary design for the backing.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the fall}} of the Shang dynasty, the Zhou dynasty used many weapons and types of {{equipment}} that originally came from the Shang. However, the Zhou incorporated some of their own different styles of armour. One type was the gé jiǎ (...) , a sleeveless coat of animal hide formed on a wooden dummy. The hide used was of buffalo and rhinoceros. Because of the disappearance of the rhinoceros in the region, buffalo came to be most common material. Another type of armour used by the Zhou was the wei jia, made of boiled leather with a <b>fabric</b> <b>backing.</b> Red lacquer was often used to form a protective layer for most armour used by the Zhou.|$|R

50|$|Lord Lonsdale {{organised}} boxing {{matches and}} was the first president of the National Sporting Club. In 1909, he introduced the Lonsdale Belt as a new trophy for the British champion at each weight division. The belts were crafted from porcelain and twenty-two carat gold, supported by red, white and blue <b>fabric</b> <b>backing,</b> and were only to be held by a fighter {{as long as he was}} British champion. However, a British champion was allowed to keep his Lonsdale Belt if he defended his title successfully twice. Later belts were made from nine carat gold rather than the original twenty-two carat. A total of 22 Lonsdale belts were issued by the National Sporting Club, and of these 20 were won outright.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using {{ultrafine}} {{carbon black}} (CB) dispersions to dye cotton <b>fabrics</b> <b>back</b> is feasible through an exhaustion procedure. The effects of CB particle size, {{the type of}} dispersants, electrolyte concentration and cationic modification of cotton on the colour yields of CB dyed cotton fabrics have been investigated. CB particle size ranging from 130 nm to 200 nm is appropriate to achieve a deep black shade in cotton fabrics. Cationic dispersant improves the K/S values and wash fastness of the CB dyed cotton fabrics. However, caution should be exercised in adding electrolytes to CB dispersions. Cationic modification of cotton is an effective method to achieve higher K/S values of CB dyed fabrics. It is desirable to dye cotton fabrics with ultrafine CB particles instead of with sulfur dyes and reactive dyes...|$|R
40|$|For smart {{clothing}} {{integration with}} the wireless {{system based on}} radio frequency (RF) backscattering, we demonstrate an ultra-high frequency (UHF) antenna constructed from embroidered conductive threads. Sewn into a <b>fabric</b> <b>backing,</b> the T-match antenna design mimics a commercial UHF RFID tag, which was also used for comparative testing. Bonded to the fabric antenna is the integrated circuit chip dissected from another commercial RFID tag, which allows for testing the tags under normal EPC Gen 2 operating conditions. We find that, despite of the high resistive loss of the antenna and inexact impedance matching, the fabric antenna works reasonably well as a UHF antenna both in standalone RFID testing, and during variety of ways of wearing under sweaters or as wristbands. The embroidering pattern does not affect much the feel and comfort from {{either side of the}} fabrics by our sewing method...|$|R

3000|$|... {{cost-saving}} {{approach is}} to create a composite of a PUF core encapsulated by one of these intrinsically FR foams. For example, Hashish ([Hashish et al. 2003]) evaluated a polyimide foam as a fire barrier for spacecraft cushion material. When tested by cone calorimetry, the application of polyimide foam layers over standard PUF increased the minimum heat flux for ignition of flammable PUF from 27 [*]kW/m 2 to 48 [*]kW/m 2. This ignition risk reduction was sufficient to enable the noncompliant PUF to pass the targeted regulations. Inclusion of polyimide foam layers also significantly reduced the PHRR, mass loss rate (MLR), and the generation of smoke and carbon monoxide. Carboxylated chloroprene foams are also commonly used to encapsulate the PUF core or as a <b>fabric</b> <b>backing.</b> Chloroprene foams are high density foams which are generally specified for public transport applications. They generally act as active fire barrier materials.|$|R
