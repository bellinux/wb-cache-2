According to the new design, <b>draught</b> <b>burners</b> with automatic control system shall be used to eliminate problems encountered during application of original burner. In addition to implement automatic control of combustion processes, the new system may minimize labor intensity and enhance safety of facilities...|$|R

50|$|Balanced draught is {{obtained}} {{through use of}} both induced and <b>forced</b> <b>draught.</b> This is more common with larger boilers where the flue gases have to travel a long distance through many boiler passes.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{currently}} available Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools to adequately describe Externally Venting Flames (EVF) is assessed, aiming to demonstrate compliance with performance-based fire safety regulations.

Numerical results of the temporal evolution of gas velocity, gas temperatures and flame shape are obtained for both the interior and {{the exterior of the}} compartment. Predictions are compared to respective experimental data, as well as to correlations suggested by the Eurocode methodology. The effects of ventilation conditions are investigated by simulating both <b>Forced</b> <b>Draught</b> (FD) and No <b>Forced</b> <b>Draught</b> (NoFD) test cases. The obtained results suggest that currently available CFD tools are capable of achieving good qualitative agreement with experimental data and, in certain cases (e. g.
