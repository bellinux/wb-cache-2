5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear <b>door</b> <b>latches</b> across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E

40|$|Physical {{modeling}} is a {{modeling and}} simulation technique that captures the physics and mathematics of a system through high fidelity dynamic models {{which are based on}} equations and symbolic manipulation. In this study, a physical model of a side <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> release mechanism for an automotive application has been developed in Dynamic Modelling Laboratory (Dymola) which is a popular multi-domain object-oriented physical modelling tool. The performance of the developed door lock model is evaluated against measurements from a real vehicle <b>door</b> <b>latch.</b> The variables of the developed physical model of the <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> are parameterized against supplier specification or calculated from standard textbook equations. The model accurately emulates the degree of mobility of the <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> design by investigating the required voltage and timing requirements for the locking/unlocking functions, given a set of parameters within the normal operating range. ...|$|R
2500|$|The entry shotgun or {{breaching}} shotgun is a {{role that}} can be filled by a standard riot shotgun, or one further modified for these purposes. They may have an extremely short barrel (14" [...] or less) and often only a pistol grip rather than a buttstock, or a folding or collapsing buttstock if it is provided with one. In addition, the barrel often has a muzzle brake, used to disperse hot gases {{that might otherwise be}} deflected toward the shooter. This type of shotgun is designed to fire special breaching rounds which are designed to disable or destroy <b>door</b> <b>latches</b> while limiting overpenetration of the projectiles used beyond the door. Since these shotguns would in most areas be classified as short barreled shotguns, they are highly restricted under gun control laws such as the National Firearms Act and generally only used by police and military.|$|E
2500|$|The 1973 {{model year}} VAM Hornets were {{redesigned}} and incorporated a new front end design with larger horizontal rectangular side marker lights, semi-square headlight bezels, and a [...] "V"-shaped grille and hood edge. The front bumper included AMC's five-mile-per-hour design, {{but without the}} recovering shocks; in their place were regular rigid bumper mounts as in previous years. The automobile product standards in Mexico were less restrictive than in the U.S.; thus, VAMs mounted the bumpers placed closer to the body than their AMC counterparts. The 232 engine {{was replaced by the}} AMC [...] I6 rated at [...] gross with Carter RBS/YF one-barrel carburetor, 266 degree camshaft, and an 8.5:1 compression ratio. The three-speed automatic transmission for the first time became available in the sedan models as an option and the rear differential gear ratio changed to 3.31:1 in all units. Other features included new door panels, longer narrower inside <b>door</b> <b>latches,</b> controls for the cigarette lighter, wiper/washer, and lights knobs had rubber knobs, modified tail light lenses, the deletion of the rectangular [...] "RAMBLER" [...] emblem in favor of [...] "American" [...] script on the rear panel, [...] "258" [...] emblems replacing the [...] "232 SIX" [...] rectangular ones and the removal of the bullseye emblems on the C-pillar base.|$|E
