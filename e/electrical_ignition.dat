25|$|In late 1883, Daimler and Maybach {{patented}} {{the first}} of their engines fueled by ligroin. This engine was patented on December 16, 1883. It achieved Daimler's goal of being small and running fast enough to be useful at 750 rpm. Improved designs {{in the next four}} years brought that up to 900 rpm. Daimler had three engines built to this design early in 1884, and a flywheel was included in one of the engines. This design was smaller and lighter than engines by other inventors of the time. Daimler relied on hot tube ignition, until 1897, when he adopted the <b>electrical</b> <b>ignition</b> designed by Bosch.|$|E
25|$|Work on the John F. Kennedy burial site {{continued}} {{over the}} next two and a half years. The Washington Gas and Light Company offered to build, maintain, and supply gas to the eternal flame at no expense. The final burner was a specially designed torch created by the Institute of Gas Technology with an <b>electrical</b> <b>ignition</b> which kept the flame lit in wind or rain and which fed the gas oxygen to create the correct color. A debate broke out between providers of bottled propane gas and line-fed natural gas as to which source of fuel should be used to supply the eternal flame. The debate was so vigorous that it broke out in public in March 1964. The cost of construction of the approaches, elliptical plaza, walls were estimated at $1.77 million in February 1965. The cost of construction of the actual grave site was estimated at $309,000. Fifteen firms were invited to bid on the construction contract and nine did so. A $1.4 million contract for construction was awarded to Aberthaw Construction in mid-July 1965. The Army Corps of Engineers consulted with the Kennedy family before letting the award. A second contract for structural design consulting in the amount of $71,026 went to Ammann & Whitney. At this time, contracts for the quotation inscriptions, the marble base for the flame, the bronze brazier, and the slate markers had yet to be let. The white marble for the plaza, terrace, and steps came from Proctor, Vermont, and the granite for the approaches came from Deer Isle, Maine.|$|E

2500|$|Daimler {{had founded}} an {{experimental}} workshop {{in the garden}} shed behind his house in Cannstatt near Stuttgart in 1882. Together with his employee Maybach they developed a compact, high-speed single-cylinder engine, patented on April 3, 1885 and called [...] "grandfather clock engine." [...] It had a float metered carburetor, used mushroom intake valves which were opened by the suction of the piston's intake stroke, and instead of an <b>electrical</b> <b>ignition</b> system, it used hot tube ignition, a platinum tube running into the combustion chamber, heated by an external open flame. [...] It could also run on coal gas. It used twin flywheels and had an aluminum crankcase.|$|E

50|$|A gradual {{implementation}} of both competition and safety-based modifications {{have been made}} to the cars used in the CASCAR Super Series. These have included a move to a Goodyear 9.5” tire, the same size that is used in all NASCAR stock-car series, on-dash <b>electrical</b> and <b>ignition</b> systems, in-car fire suppression equipment and increased fuel cell protection. In 2009, the option of utilizing the NASCAR spec engine program was introduced. The cars uses steel tube-framed silhouette stock cars powered by carbureted V8 engines. The cars have a relatively high minimum weight, so development of lightweight components is minimal. A number of components are specified by the rules, as parity is given priority over vehicle development. Manufacturer involvement is therefore limited largely to supply arrangements for long-developed crate motors, and branding on the largely standard bodywork.|$|R
50|$|Common {{applications}} include household water heaters, {{central heating}} systems, fireplaces, flamethrowers, and hot air balloons.

50|$|Once {{the engine}} had been started and the {{temperature}} had risen to the minimum operating level, the external air hose and connectors were removed and the engine's resonant design kept it firing without any further need for the <b>electrical</b> <b>ignition</b> system, which was used only to ignite the engine when starting.|$|E

50|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} a major explosion occurred when something disturbed the dust, creating a cloud, which ignited. The investigation was unable to determine what disturbed the dust or what ignited it, due to the extensive damage at the plant. However, {{it is known that}} the machine had suffered multiple internal fires, including one that was powerful enough to blow off the mixer door. Four other theories were developed regarding possible causes: a batch of rubber that overheated and ignited; an electrical ballast or light fixture that ignited accumulated dust; a spark caused by a possible <b>electrical</b> fault; or <b>ignition</b> of dust in a cooling air duct feeding an electric motor.|$|R

The micro FID embeds the fluidic components, the micro burner, the <b>electrical</b> structures for <b>ignition</b> and ion current measurement, and resistive temperature measurement elements in one monolithic ceramic component. Characterisation of the micro FID revealed good sensor performance with high sensitivity and reduced gas consumption compared to conventional FIDs.

50|$|Production of the Black Knight {{began in}} the spring of 1955. Lucas {{components}} replaced the less reliable Miller <b>electrical</b> system and <b>ignition</b> was upgraded to coil and distributor. The rear enclosure, which incorporated the oil tank, was hinged allowing access to the rear wheel and final drive chain. Amal Monobloc carburettors improved starting. The centre stand was operated by a lever accessible from the saddle and the lower front mudguard stay served as an emergency front stand to facilitate the removal of the front wheel. Delay in delivery of the fibreglas components from subcontractors held back the availability of the first production bikes until spring 1955. Approximately 200 of the enclosed models were built.|$|R

50|$|The {{lack of an}} <b>electrical</b> <b>ignition</b> system greatly {{improves}} the reliability. The high durability of a diesel engine is also due to its overbuilt nature (see above).

50|$|The construction, {{directed}} by Germain Sommeiller, {{was scheduled to}} take 25 years, but was completed in only 14 years thanks to technical innovations such as pneumatic drilling machines and <b>electrical</b> <b>ignition</b> of explosive charges.

40|$|ERAF: 48421 This review swnmaries tests {{which have}} been used to define the fire {{performance}} of combustible materials including plastics. Many of the small scale tests are intended to classify the characteristics of materials in the form of small standard test specimens and seem to bear little relationship to the final application (see ASTM D 635 BS 2782 Method 50 BA, ASTM 1929 etc.). Other tests expose a standard specimen to conditions which might prevail in the application (see BS 476 Part 1, BS 476 Part 6 globar, <b>electrical</b> spark <b>ignition</b> test etc.). The multiplicity of tests reflects efforts to develop relevant procedures but they often suggest a lack of co-ordination or a psychological need for the developers to make their mark - note the series of tests ASTM D 635, BS 2782 Method 50 BA, BS 3532 etc. At RAPRA the fire performance of plastics is being studied using standard tests and non-standard environmental tests. This review was prepared as part of a consideration of "relevant" tests and to establish what procedures were already available. An attempt has been made to group tests into a logical order but this has not been possible throughout because of some multiple purpose tests. Where available tests,for smoke and toxic combustion products have been included. Reference is made to published environmental tests but it is not suggested that these are sensible standard classification tests...|$|R
