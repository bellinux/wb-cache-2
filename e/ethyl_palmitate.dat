50|$|In {{contrast}} to other drugs consumed, alcohol is deposited {{directly in the}} hair. For this reason the investigation procedure looks for direct products of ethanol metabolism. The main part of alcohol is oxidized in the human body. This means it is released as water and carbon dioxide. One part of the alcohol reacts with fatty acids to produce esters. The sum of the concentrations of four of these fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs: ethyl myristate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate) are used as indicators of the alcohol consumption. The amounts found in hair are measured in nanograms (one nanogram equals only one billionth of a gram), however {{with the benefit of}} modern technology, it is possible to detect such small amounts. In the detection of ethyl glucuronide, or EtG, testing can detect amounts in picograms (one picogram equals 0.001 nanograms).|$|E

Immediately after heat treatment, 20 gallons of heated milk were vacuum distilled at 30 °C in a semi-continuous, reduced pressure glass apparatus. Twenty gallons of non-heated milk were distilled {{in a similar}} manner to serve as a control. Continuous liquid-liquid ethyl ether extractions were employed to recover the compounds from the aqueous distillates. Gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, infrared spectrophotometry and odor confirmation were used to characterize the compounds in the flavor concentrates. A technique for collecting and transferring packed column gas chromatographic fractions to capillary columns for mass spectral analysis was developed. The following compounds were identified in UHT-treated milk (the underlined compounds appeared to result from the heat treatment) : the C₃, ₄, ₅, ₇, ₈, ₉, ₁₀, ₁₁, ₁₃ n-methyl ketones, the C₈, ₁₀, ₁₂ delta-lactones, acetaldehyde, hexanal, benzaldehyde, furfural, phenylactaldehyde, vanillin, the C₆, ₈, ₁₀ n-alkanoic acids, ethanol, oct- 1 -en- 3 -ol, n-heptanol, 2 -butoxyethanol, diacetyl, maltol, acetophenone, ethyl acetate, benzothiazole, toluene, naphthalene, a dichlorobenzene, a trichlorobenzene, methyl iodide, benzonitrile and chloroform.

The liquidus and solidus lines were obtained through differential scanning calorimetry. The thermograms of pure compounds were resolved into the corresponding overlapping peak components by a fitting analysis, allowing a better estimation of phase-change properties of polymorphs. All binary systems show immiscibility in the solid phase, although those containing dodecylcyclohexane present small regions of partial miscibility. The system formed by <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and dodecylcyclohexane presents a peritectic transition, {{which was also}} observed in the ternary system. The thermodynamic modeling was conducted using different models for liquid-phase non-ideality and considering different polymorphs in solid phase.

40|$|Aims: In {{a variety}} of {{clinical}} and forensic situations long term use of alcohol must be monitored. In this project we explore the utility of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) in this regard. Additionally, we propose a cut-off value of FAEE to distinguish teetotallers/moderate/social drinkers from alcoholics or individuals drinking at harmful levels. Patients and methods: FAEE levels from 18 alcohol-dependent patients in detoxification were contrasted with those of 10 social drinkers and 10 teetotallers. FAEE in hair were determined, using headspace solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. CFAEE, as sum of the concentrations of four esters, was compared to a major FAEE, <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate.</b> PEth was measured in heparinized whole blood with a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Drinking validation criteria include self reports, phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth) in whole blood {{as well as the}} traditional markers of heavy drinking, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT). Results: Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for CFAEE, indicated a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 90 % for a cut-off of 0. 29 ng/mg. By using a cut-off of 0. 4 ng/mg, CFAEE identified 94. 4 % correctly. CFAEE and <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> were significantly associated (r = 0. 945; P < 0. 001) as were CFAEE and PEth (r = 0. 527; P = 0. 025).

40|$|The {{consensus}} on alcohol markers in hair was revised {{for the fourth}} time by an expert group of the Society of Hair Testing based on current state of research. This revision was adopted by the members of the Society during the business meeting in Brisbane on August 29 th 2016. For both markers, ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), two cut-off values for discrimination between teetotalers or occasional low amount consumption and moderate alcohol drinking (low cut-off), and between non-excessive (abstinence up to moderate alcohol intake) and chronic excessive drinking (high cut-off value) were critically examined. For the current revision, the cut-off values for EtG (7 pg/mg and 30 pg/mg, respectively) remained unchanged despite different findings or discussions published in the meantime. This was mainly {{due to the lack of}} broader data collections from new studies with great numbers of volunteers following thorough study concepts. In contrast, an essential change of the consensus was accepted for the FAEEs, where the concentration of <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> (E 16 : 0) can be used autonomously for interpretation instead of the concentration sum (ΣFAEE) of the four esters ethyl myristate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate, as previously applied. After evaluation of the data from seven laboratories, the E 16 : 0 cut-off for abstinence assessment was defined at 0. 12 ng/mg for the 0 - 3 cm segment and at 0. 15 ng/mg for the 0 - 6 cm segment. The cut-off for chronic excessive drinking was fixed at 0. 35 ng/mg for the 0 - 3 cm segment and at 0. 45 ng/mg for the 0 - 6 cm segment. The use of E 16 : 0 with these cut-offs in place of ΣFAEE for alcohol intake assessment produces only a minor loss in discrimination power, leads to no essential difference in the interpretation concerning chronic excessive alcohol consumption and is suitable to confirm EtG results in abstinence assessment if ethanol containing hair sprays or lotions are excluded...|$|E

However, ethanol can also be metabolized non-oxidatively generating phosphatidylethanol and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). This study aims to investigate the effects of FAEEs on barrier function, and to explore the role of oxidative stress as possible mechanism. Methods Epithelial permeability was assessed by paracellular flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran using live cell imaging. Cell integrity was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase release. Localization and protein levels of ZO- 1 and occludin were analyzed by immunofluorescence and cell-based ELISA, respectively. Intracellular oxidative stress and cellular ATP levels were measured by dichlorofluorescein and luciferase driven bioluminescence, respectively. Results In vitro, ethyl oleate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> dose dependently increased permeability associated with disruption and decreased ZO- 1 and occludin protein levels, respectively, and increased intracellular oxidative stress without compromising cell viability. These effects could partially be attenuated by pretreatment with the antioxidant, resveratrol, pointing {{to the role of}} oxidative stress in the FAEEs-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction.

However, ethanol can also be metabolized non-oxidatively generating phosphatidylethanol and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). This study aims to investigate the effects of FAEEs on barrier function, and to explore the role of oxidative stress as possible mechanism. Methods: Epithelial permeability was assessed by paracellular flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran using live cell imaging. Cell integrity was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase release. Localization and protein levels of ZO- 1 and occludin were analyzed by immunofluorescence and cell-based ELISA, respectively. Intracellular oxidative stress and cellular ATP levels were measured by dichlorofluorescein and luciferase driven bioluminescence, respectively. Results: In vitro, ethyl oleate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> dose dependently increased permeability associated with disruption and decreased ZO- 1 and occludin protein levels, respectively, and increased intracellular oxidative stress without compromising cell viability. These effects could partially be attenuated by pretreatment with the antioxidant, resveratrol, pointing {{to the role of}} oxidative stress in the FAEEs-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. Conclusions: These findings show that FAEEs can induce intestinal barrier dysfunction by disrupting the tight junctions, most likely via reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism. ...|$|E
40|$|Fatty acid {{ethyl esters}} (FAEE), direct {{metabolites}} of ethanol, are suit-able alcohol markers {{that can be}} detected in different tissues. The de-termination of FAEE in hair can help to evaluate social and excessive alcohol consumption. Due {{to the presence of}} FAEE in the hair of teeto-talers, proving alcohol abstinence seems to be impossible. To verify these results, an solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry procedure for the determination of the four FAEE: ethyl myristate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate in hair was validated with special focus on low concentration levels. Besides very high sensitivity (limits of detection between 0. 005 and 0. 009 ng/ mg), good results for linearity, precision and accuracy, recovery and stability were achieved. In addition, 73 hair samples with measured ethyl glucuronide (EtG) concentrations between 4 and 10 pg/mg were analyzed for FAEE. By using the following cut-offs: EtG: 7 pg/mg, FAEE: 0. 2 ng/mg a satisfying matching rate of 72. 6 % was found. This shows that FAEE can be determined to verify borderline EtG concentra-tions even in the context of abstinence tests. However, the diversified influencing factors on analyte concentrations in hair, which may explain the large deviations between EtG and FAEE results observed in some cases, have to be mentioned when interpret ambiguous results...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{oral route}} is widely {{accepted}} {{as the most}} physiological path for exogenous administration of insulin, as it closely mimic the endogenous insulin pathway. Thus, in this work it is proposed an innovative lipid-polymeric nanocarrier to delivery insulin orally. Areas covered: Nanoparticles were produced through a modified solvent emulsification-evaporation method, using <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate as matrix. Lipid-polymeric nanoparticles were around 300 nm in size, negatively charged (- 20 mV) and associated insulin with efficiency higher than 80 %. Differential scanning calorimetry suggested thermal stability of nanoparticles. In vitro release assays under simulated gastrointestinal conditions resulted in 9 % and 14 % of insulin released at pH 1. 2 during 2 h and at pH 6. 8 for 6 h, respectively, demonstrating the ability of those nanoparticles to protect insulin against premature degradation. Importantly, nanoparticles were observed to be safe at potential therapeutic concentrations as did not originate cytotoxicity to intestinal epithelial cells. Lastly, the permeability of nanoencapsulated insulin through Caco- 2 monolayers and a triple Caco- 2 /HT 29 -MTX/Raji B cell model correlated well with slow release kinetics, and fosters the effectiveness of nanoparticles to promote intestinal absorption of peptidic drugs. Expert Opinion: Lipid-polymeric nanoparticles were developed to encapsulate and carry insulin through intestine. Overall, nanoparticles provide insulin stability and intestinal permeability.

The structures of the compounds were established by spectroscopic techniques. The compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemotaxis by using the Boyden chamber technique and on human whole blood and neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by using a luminol-based chemiluminescence assay. Among the compounds tested, compounds 1 – 4, 6 and 9 exhibited strong inhibition of PMN migration towards the chemoattractant N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) with IC 50 values of 6. 8; 2. 8; 2. 5; 4. 1; 3. 7 and 3. 6 μM, respectively, {{comparable to that of}} the positive control ibuprofen (6. 7 μM). Compounds 2 – 4, 6, 7 and 9 exhibited strong inhibition of ROS production of PMNs with IC 50 values of 0. 9; 0. 9; 1. 3; 1. 1; 0. 5 and 0. 8 μM, respectively, which were lower than that of aspirin (9. 4 μM). The bioactive compounds might be potential lead molecules for the development of new immunomodulatory agents to modulate the innate immune response of phagocytes...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are the {{following}} two: (1) To show that in Langmuir monolayers (LM) at low supersaturation, domains grow forming fractal structures without an apparent orientational order trough tip splitting dynamics, where doublons are the building blocks producing domains with a seaweed shape. When supersaturation is larger, there is a morphology transition from tip splitting to side branching. Here, structures grow with a pronounced orientational order forming dendrites, which are also fractal. We observed this behavior in different Langmuir monolayers formed by nervonic acid, dioctadecylamine, ethyl stearate, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> using Brewster angle microscopy. (2) To present experimental evidence showing an important Marangoni flow during domain growth, where the hydrodynamic transport of amphipiles overwhelms diffusion. We were able to show that the equation that governs the pattern formation in LM is a Laplacian equation in the chemical potential with the appropriate boundary conditions. However, the underlying physics involved in Langmuir monolayers is different from the underlying physics in the Mullins-Sekerka instability; diffusional processes are not involved. We found a new kind of instability that leads to pattern formation, where Marangoni flow is the key factor. We also found that the equations governing pattern formation in LM can be reduced to those used in the theory of morphology diagrams for two-dimensional diffusional growth. Our experiments agree with this diagram. 1...|$|E
