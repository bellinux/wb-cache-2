500|$|In Southey's tale, three {{anthropomorphic}} bears [...] "a Little, Small, Wee Bear, a Middle-sized Bear, and a Great, Huge Bear" [...] {{live together}} {{in a house in}} the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these [...] "bachelor" [...] bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it's too hot to eat, so take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools. An old woman approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is a disgrace to them. She is [...] impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The dark end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and the old woman in his bed and cries, [...] "Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!" [...] The old woman starts, runs away, breaks her neck and goes to the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a moment}} of respite, when the Director leaves the stage, his Assistant collapses <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> then springs out and wipes it vigorously, as if to avoid contamination, before reseating herself. This helps the {{audience}} appreciate better her relationship {{to each of the}} parties. She is after all the one who dressed the Protagonist warmly and who – twice – highlights {{the fact that he is}} shivering. In some ways she is just “another victim rather than a collaborator.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, May 3, {{sometime}} before 9 p.m., Virgil Starks, age 37, a farmer and welder, {{was in his}} modest, yet modern ranch-style house on his 500-acre farm off Highway 67 East, almost [...] northeast of Texarkana. He turned on his favorite weekly radio show and his wife, Katie, age 36, gave him a heating pad for his sore back. He sat in his armchair in the sitting room, which was just off {{of the kitchen and}} the bedroom. While Katie was in her bedroom lying on the bed in her nightgown, she heard something from the backyard and asked Virgil to turn down the radio. Seconds later, while Virgil was reading the May 3rd edition of the Texarkana Gazette, two shots were fired into {{the back of his head}} from a closed double-window [...] away. Katie did not hear the gunshots; instead, she heard what [...] "sounded like the breaking of glass". She thought Virgil dropped something and went to see what happened. As she entered the doorway to the living room, she saw Virgil standing up and then suddenly slump back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> She saw blood then ran to him and lifted up his head. When she realized he was dead, she ran to the phone to call police.|$|E

60|$|Under some foolish, aimless impulse, {{he took a}} few quick steps {{towards the}} door. Then he turned, and, {{throwing}} himself <b>into</b> <b>his</b> study <b>chair,</b> he plunged back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> work.|$|R

6000|$|... "You'll {{do nothing}} of the sort," [...] said the mother coldly. And then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him <b>into</b> <b>his</b> little <b>chair,</b> and said: [...] "Now cry there, Misery!" ...|$|R
50|$|Barber {{chairs in}} {{engravings}} from the Civil War era share many features with modern chairs, including high seating, upholstery, and a footrest. The first factory-manufactured chairs date to around 1850. The first one-piece reclining barber chair with an attached footrest was patented in 1878 by the Archer Company of Saint Louis. Archer quickly followed {{it with a}} chair that raised and lowered mechanically. Eugene Berninghaus of Cincinnati improved on Archer's design with the first reclining and revolving chair, the Paragon. Theodore Koch of Chicago incorporated all of these innovations <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chairs,</b> selling more than 35,000 chairs in the period before 1885.|$|R

6000|$|... "O he is, is he? I won't {{have the}} dinner {{kept waiting for}} him, Jane"; with which this worthy man lapsed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> {{particular}} <b>chair,</b> and then the utter silence in his genteel, well-furnished drawing-room was only interrupted by the alarmed ticking of the great French clock.|$|R
60|$|Silas {{took his}} seat in silence on the wooden box before the fire, and Venus {{dropping}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> low <b>chair</b> produced from among his skeleton hands, his tea-tray and tea-cups, and put the kettle on. Silas inwardly approved of these preparations, trusting they might end in Mr Venus's diluting his intellect.|$|R

60|$|Mannering slowly {{subsided}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> His {{cheeks were}} blanched. Richard Fardell watched him with feverish anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We rode to Brightling, {{and past}} Sir John's lodges, where the keepers would have shot at us for deer-stealers, {{and we had}} Sir John down <b>into</b> <b>his</b> Justice's <b>chair,</b> and when we had told him our tale and showed him the cow-hide which Sebastian wore still girt about him, he laughed till the tears ran.|$|R

This was the spectacle of his own wife taking tea in floods of tears, and being encouraged in her difficult task by Mrs Penrose and a few sympathising friends.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose we'd better {{wait and}} find out what the umpires will say. The Admiral won't be exactly pleased." [...] Captain Malan spoke very soothingly. Moorshed looked out through the stern door at Two Six Seven. Pyecroft and I, at attention, studied the {{paintwork}} opposite. Captain Panke had dropped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> desk <b>chair,</b> and scribbled nervously at a blotting-pad.|$|R

5000|$|Darrac got {{his idea}} for his patent in Germany, where {{upholstered}} chairs and sofas were fitted with metal springs. He adapted them <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>chairs</b> and bed bases, thus creating the [...] "sommier élastique" [...] (French for bed base with elastic/spring suspension). The {{advantage of the}} bed base was that a much thinner mattresses could be produced, thus saving material. The bed base consisted {{of a combination of}} natural fillings and metal springs, thus enhancing the comfort. The invention initially saw limited commercial success, but it was later sold by a succession of several new owners under the name [...] "Literie Darrac" [...] in Paris, France. Darrac's invention was later perfected and used in mattresses fitted with a combination of natural comfort fillers and metal springs, thus creating the spring mattress.|$|R
