40|$|We used a {{representative}} sample of the adult population of Mexico to examine the influence of gratitude on life satisfaction and <b>importance</b> given <b>to</b> helping others. Questionnaires were administered by a trained interviewer in a face-to-face format outside the participants’ home. Path analysis, treating the variables as observed, was used to test our hypotheses. Results showed that gratitude had a positive relationship with life satisfaction while controlling for financial satisfaction. Similarly, gratitude was positively related <b>to</b> <b>importance</b> given <b>to</b> helping others. For the most part, the positive influence of gratitude on life satisfaction and <b>importance</b> given <b>to</b> helping other remained significant at different income levels. The implications of the results were discussed...|$|R

5|$|Although Mendelssohn {{attributed}} great <b>importance</b> <b>to</b> musical education, {{and made}} a substantial commitment to the Conservatoire he founded in Leipzig, he did not greatly enjoy teaching and took only a very few private pupils who he believed had notable qualities.

5|$|Angelou later gained fame as {{an author}} and a poet, most notably her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.

In 1995, the album was re-released as a CD {{during a period of}} {{customer}} interest in 1950s exotica. Its artistry was re-examined in light of Angelou's later fame; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period, spiced with a feeling for the tradition's roots.|$|E
5|$|Another such ill-fated {{settlement}} was Canemah, {{located near the}} Willamette Falls. Canemah prospered until 1861, when the same great flood swept most of the town over the falls. Even after reconstruction, much of the town's <b>importance</b> <b>to</b> river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of the Willamette Falls Locks. Ships no longer needed to dock and unload goods and passengers for portage around the falls. The remaining town officially survived until 1929, when it was annexed to Oregon City.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how the importance that {{is attributed to}} a variety of financial and non-financial performance measures depends on the type of use - evaluation versus reward. Survey data, collected on a sample of industrial companies, provide consistent evidence of a difference in the <b>importance</b> attached <b>to</b> performance measures for these two uses. More <b>importance</b> is attached <b>to</b> both financial and non-financial performance measures for the periodic evaluation than for variable rewards. The study also shows that the influence of production strategy and departmental interdependence on the <b>importance</b> attached <b>to</b> performance measures differs for evaluation and reward uses. A production strategy focused on differentiation by product-performance has a negative effect on the <b>importance</b> attached <b>to</b> financial measures for variable rewards but no effect on their importance for periodic evaluation. Moreover, departmental interdependence decreases the <b>importance</b> attached <b>to</b> financial measures for variable rewards but not for periodic evaluation. Departmental interdependence also has only a positive effect on non-financial measures for periodic evaluation and no effect on non-financial measures for variable rewards. Overall, the data suggest that it is essential to distinguish between different uses when studying performance measurement choices and their determinants. ...|$|R
