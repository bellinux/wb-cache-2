50|$|The third wing or two-storeyed {{section is}} more {{elaborate}} both in scale and detail. It has open verandahs on the north-western side with lower verandahs now enclosed in casement windows and weatherboard cladding, The upper construction and detailing of this two-storey wing includes polychromatic brickwork, timber <b>floors,</b> <b>shuttered</b> {{windows and doors}} and a steeply-hipped roof surmounted by a widows' walk with cast iron lace balustrading.|$|R
5000|$|The Rue de la Vau Saint-Jaques is {{a narrow}} street lined with medieval timber-framed houses, with {{vegetable}} plots climbing the slopes that rise above {{either side of}} the street. At one time this would have been the main pilgrimage route from the Porte St-Jacques up to the town centre, and was occupied by weavers. Many of the houses retain the wooden ground <b>floor</b> <b>shutters</b> that folded down to form a stall.|$|R

50|$|The 1974 {{renovation}} replaced {{and updated}} building systems {{and increased the}} size of several rooms by removing internal walls. As {{a part of this}} renovation, interior trim was painted white and the walls a palette of mostly neutral colors. Little consideration was given to historic preservation with interior or exterior spaces, and no attempt was made at restoration of any interior space to its appearance at the period of construction or early use. The 1961 era white paint on the exterior was retained. Second <b>floor</b> <b>shutters,</b> which appear in an 1895 photograph, were reinstalled.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls of}} the Parliament Chamber are paneled with mahogany. <b>Floor</b> length <b>shuttered</b> windows allow light and air to enter, and north-facing windows have small balconies. The floor is made of local {{greenheart}} wood.|$|R

50|$|The kitchen {{house was}} {{completely}} reconstructed from the 1843 notarial archives drawings by J.A. Pueyo and historic architect, Rick Fifield. The plan showed the ground {{plan of the}} kitchen and a painting of an overseer's cottage, allowing additional details and assumptions of the style and scale of the kitchen house. That plan pointed to the location of the kitchen house which lead to excavation of the site. Brick <b>flooring,</b> <b>shutter</b> hinges, and part of the fireplace were discovered. The owner and his consultants were able to examine the house for clues of how the kitchen house would have been built, for example, the chimney in the house was a reference point for the construction of the chimney where it meets the roof.|$|R
50|$|On {{the east}} (front) facade the blocks are laid in a Flemish bond pattern. The two windows {{flanking}} {{the main entrance}} have paneled wooden shutters; all and the doorway are topped with splayed brick lintels. On the sides the stonework reverts to a more random pattern. The north has two windows on either story; the south one on the first <b>floor,</b> with <b>shutters,</b> and two on top.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{it was a}} {{three floors}} building, former private mansion of the Prince Joachim Murat. It is raised with four floors by Marcel Jamet in 1933 : then, seven {{imposing}} <b>floors</b> with white <b>shutters</b> always closed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whittington didn't {{come out}} again, and {{by and by}} I got kind of restive, and began to mouch around. All the ground <b>floor</b> windows were <b>shuttered</b> tight, but upstairs, {{on the first floor}} (it was a two-storied house) I noticed a window with a light burning and the {{curtains}} not drawn.|$|R
60|$|After half an hour's brisk walking they again {{approached}} {{the house from}} the side at which they had before come upon it, and where, as Geoffrey observed, there were no windows; {{they made their way}} cautiously up to it, and then moved quietly round to the side. Here there were two windows on the ground <b>floor.</b> The <b>shutters</b> were closed, for glass was unknown except in the houses of the comparatively wealthy. Its place was taken by oiled paper, and this in bad weather was protected by outer shutters. Geoffrey stole out a few paces to look at the window above.|$|R
60|$|Cloomber lay {{beneath us}} in {{a blaze of}} light. In the lower <b>floors</b> the <b>shutters</b> {{obscured}} the illumination, but above, from the broad windows of the second storey to the thin slits at the summit of the tower, there was not a chink or an aperture which did not send forth a stream of radiance. So dazzling was the effect that for a moment I was persuaded that the house was on fire, but the steadiness and clearness of the light soon freed me from that apprehension. It was clearly the result of many lamps placed systematically all over the building.|$|R
60|$|They chiefly wanted {{boards to}} make window <b>shutters,</b> <b>floors,</b> doors, {{and several other}} things; but as the gentleman above favored them, and the country was by that means made easy with them, and, above all, that they {{were known to be}} all sound and in good health, {{everybody}} helped them with what they could spare.|$|R
60|$|The light which I had {{observed}} {{from the sea}} was moving backwards and forward past the lower <b>floor</b> windows, the <b>shutters</b> {{of which had been}} removed. I could now see that a second fainter light followed a few paces behind the other. Evidently two individuals, the one with a lamp and the other with a candle or rushlight, were making a careful examination of the building.|$|R
50|$|The north (entrance) porch has a {{flat roof}} of nearly fifteen feet by ten {{and a half}} feet. The south porch has a tin shed roof twenty feet by ten and a half feet. Both porches are on brick piers. The {{exterior}} {{of the house is}} restored and the interior is reconstructed. The first-floor, second-floor and basement windows are 6/6 DH. The first and second <b>floor</b> windows have <b>shutters.</b> The north facade entry door is a wood door with four raised panels, with a fifteen-light transom above.|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} {{it has also}} been used as a meeting place for hunters with their fox hounds, and a luncheon house for {{shooting}} parties in the park, prior to the park being donated for public use in 1928. Internally, the tower retains a number of 19th century fittings, including timber <b>floors,</b> slate fireplaces, <b>shuttered</b> windows and a castellated roof. The tower is a grade II listed building. A narrow spiral staircase gives access to the upper floor, and is open to visitors on the park's guided walk programmes.|$|R
60|$|They {{came into}} a more pretentious street, where trade, it could be surmised, flourished by day. And again the priest paused; this time before a lofty building, whose great doors and windows in the lowest <b>floor</b> were {{carefully}} <b>shuttered</b> and barred. Its higher apertures were dark, save in the third story, the windows of which were brilliantly lighted. Lorison's ear caught a distant, regular, pleasing thrumming, as of music above. They stood at an angle of the building. Up, along the side nearest them, mounted an iron stairway. At its top was an upright, illuminated parallelogram. Father Rogan had stopped, and stood, musing.|$|R
50|$|Paired double-hung sashes with {{semi-circular}} {{heads and}} hood moulds with supporting decorated stops are located {{each side of}} the main entrance door. A secondary entrance is located on the east side with single double-hung windows and French doors. There are single double-hung windows on the west side. At first <b>floor</b> level <b>shuttered</b> French doors open onto the verandahs from each room. Entry into the banking chamber is via a set of heavy timber doors with semi-circular hopper window that features a pair of peacocks in etched glass. To the left of the entry is the banking chamber and to the right two offices and the east side entrance hallway. Three rooms extend north from the north west corner behind these offices. A secondary stair rises to the first floor in this area. None of the original banking chamber fittings exist although the space has remained intact and the original coffered lath and plaster ceilings exist although they are damaged. Cast iron columns {{at the rear of the}} banking chamber support an upper storey wall, and beyond this is a room running off the banking chamber to the north. Original timber architraves and skirting survive in the principal offices.|$|R
50|$|Edmund J. and Margaret A. Sullivan House; 1931-32; 45 Balton Road, Providence, RI; Edwin E. Cull, architect; A. H. Leeming & Sons, builder. A large, handsome, two-and-a-half-story brick {{dwelling}} in the Georgian Colonial {{style of}} the middle Atlantic region, with segmental-arch ground <b>floor</b> windows, paneled <b>shutters,</b> a modillion cornice, segmental-arch dormers, and a high hip roof with a flat central deck surrounded by a balustrade. Set on a corner lot, the house has two facades: one facing Balton Road and one facing a motor court of f Intervale Road. The Balton Road front contains a recessed central doorway trimmed with Ionic pilasters on pedestals, a cushion-frieze entablature, and a segmental-arch pediment. The more elaborate courtyard front has a pedimented doorway in a central projecting entrance pavilion flanked by large bow windows. Sullivan, grandson of rubber magnate Joseph Banigan, lived with his new bride and parents in the family home at 254 Wayland Avenue until this house was completed. Like others in his family, he worked in manufacturing.|$|R

Several {{doors and}} rectangular windows {{can be seen}} in the shade of a porch other first floor of the large, brick building. The four rectangular windows of the second <b>floor</b> have open <b>shutters,</b> but the four on the third floor are closed. A plant stands just outside on the left where a shorter building protrudes out of the I. O. O. F. building. On the right, an automobile is parked next to what appears to be a gas pump in front of the Peek Hotel. What appears to be a tow truck {{can be seen in}} the foreground on the left.; Picture file card reads "The I. O. O. F. Hall was claimed to be the second highest building in California. When it was built in 1854, the other tall one was the Perrot Building (three stories), 1852, which was in San Francisco but has long since disappeared leaving the Mokelumne the oldest three story in the state"...|$|R
50|$|The Pâquet House (Maison Pâquet) {{is located}} at 1630 Marie-Victorin Road, and was built around 1760. It {{is a good example}} of French vernacular architecture. A long-façaded (over 90 ft) building, it was {{enlarged}} twice, once on each side of the original building, during its history (though the dates are not known precisely, the last addition was made before 1850). The dimensions of the original building are still very visible as they are marked by the position of the two chimneys. This size is in part attributable to the various uses the house has had: at some point a general store was located inside. The house is built using pièce-sur-pièce techniques where notched logs are piled horizontally, and covered with vertical wood sidings, with low foundations (compared with buildings of the 19th century and later) and a tall roof. The ceiling lines are low, and a half-story is built under the roof, lit by straight gable-fronted dormer windows on two levels, with the higher dormers much smaller. The roof is straight, with little to no overhang, and covered in cedar shingles. All windows are divided in smaller square panes; those of the ground <b>floor</b> have external <b>shutters.</b> The original door was placed asymmetrically in regard to the building, and a carriage door is on the right side.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{recommendations}} for wood dust sampling include sampling {{according to the}} inhalable convention of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7708 (1995) Air quality [...] particle size fraction definitions for health-related sampling. However, a specific sampling device is not mandated, and while several samplers have laboratory performance approaching theoretical for an 'inhalable' sampler, the best choice of sampler for wood dust is not clear. A side-by-side field study was considered the most practical test of samplers as laboratory performance tests consider overall performance based on {{a wider range of}} particle sizes than are commonly encountered in the wood products industry. Seven companies in the wood products industry of the Southeast USA (MS, KY, AL, and WV) participated in this study. The products included hardwood flooring, engineered hardwood <b>flooring,</b> door skins, <b>shutter</b> blinds, kitchen cabinets, plywood, and veneer. The samplers selected were 37 -mm closed-face cassette with ACCU-CAP 22 ̆ 01 e 2, Button, CIP 10 -I, GSP, and Institute of Occupational Medicine. Approximately 30 of each possible pairwise combination of samplers were collected as personal sample sets. Paired samplers of the same type were used to calculate environmental variance that was then used to determine the number of pairs of samples necessary to detect any difference at a specified level of confidence. Total valid sample number was 888 (444 valid pairs). The mass concentration of wood dust ranged from 0. 02 to 195 mg m(- 3). Geometric mean (geometric standard deviation) and arithmetic mean (standard deviation) of wood dust were 0. 98 mg m(- 3) (3. 06) and 2. 12 mg m(- 3) (7. 74), respectively. One percent of the samples exceeded 15 mg m(- 3), 6...|$|R
