Tri-State Homes began managing housing. In 1946, tenants were permitted to paint their houses in different colors from the wartime olive drab. Comprehensive medical insurance, originally instituted for security reasons, was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Health care had been provided by the Army. As Army doctors were separated from the service they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane-Anderson. The <b>dental</b> <b>service</b> was transferred to civilians in February 1946, and private medical practices were permitted at Oak Ridge from 1 March 1946 on.|$|E

40|$|Fair {{access is}} a value {{enshrined}} through universal insurance {{for health care}} in Australia. However, dentistry {{is not included in}} this system. As a consequence, there is a strong likelihood of inequalities in access to <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> among adults. Data from the 1989 - 90 National Health Survey were analysed to determine sociodemographic factors related to use and comprehensiveness of <b>dental</b> <b>services.</b> Age, income, age of leaving school and occupation were independently {{associated with the use of}} <b>dental</b> <b>services,</b> and occupation was associated with an indicator of comprehensiveness of care: self-reported extraction at the last visit. In different adult age groups these sociodemographic factors had different effects, with the disparities in use of <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> greater in older age groups. Planning of <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> in the 1990 s and beyond should include not only the removal of financial barriers to <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> among adults but also attention to the specific barriers experienced by the elderly...|$|R
25|$|By 1920, the <b>dental</b> <b>service</b> {{had been}} demobilised. During the interwar years, {{the focus of}} Australia's {{military}} planning was upon maintaining a reduced permanent force with a larger part-time military force. The need for dental services was thus greatly reduced and, as a result, they were largely provided by civilian dentists that were also serving in the Militia, although {{a small number of}} permanent dental staff were retained on the establishment. Nevertheless, in 1928 an inspector of dental services was appointed, and although training opportunities were limited due to the economic hardships of the Great Depression, throughout the interwar years the service developed its capabilities and corporate knowledge through a series of tactical exercises.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{was officially}} formed in 1943, the corps has its genesis {{in an earlier}} {{formation}} that was raised for service during World War I {{as part of the}} Australian Army Medical Corps. Prior to the war some efforts had been made to try to raise a <b>dental</b> <b>service</b> in the Australian military as part of the institution of universal military service as a result of lessons learned during the Sudan Expedition and the Boer War, however, these attempts had not come to fruition. Upon the outbreak of the war in 1914, the Australian authorities initially saw no need to provide dental services to soldiers, although a number of trained dentists volunteered for service. Largely the services of these volunteers were rejected, however, when the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force was raised for deployment against German possessions in the Pacific, the senior Australian medical officer, Lieutenant Colonel (later Major General) Neville Howse, approved the attachment of John Henderson, a fourth year dental student, to deploy with them. Henderson later transferred to the infantry and was killed at Pozières in 1916, while serving as a captain in the 13th Battalion. He nevertheless has the distinction of being the first dentist to serve in the Army in that capacity.|$|E

In Washington state, a program known as Access to Baby and Child Dentistry (ABCD) has helped increase access to dental services by providing dentists higher reimbursements for oral health education and preventive and restorative services for children.

40|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>services</b> in Australia are {{available}} both privately and publicly. However, {{access to public}} <b>dental</b> <b>services,</b> like access to public hospital services for non-urgent treatment, is subject to a considerable waiting period. Moreover, access to public <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> is restricted to certain categories of welfare beneficiaries who qualify for a health care card. Because of the waiting time for public treatment, there is a frequent call for more public dental resources. This paper addresses {{the issue of what}} the waiting time for public <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> represents. One view largely confirmed by our research is that state governments are using the waiting time as a way of trying to push more and more people into the private sector.

The disparity has been seen in areas across the United States. Based on prior discussions with dental providers and advocates, one of the common barriers to <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> for adult Medical Assistance recipients is the lack of knowledge and information on available <b>dental</b> <b>services.</b> The objective {{of this study is to}} be able to provide non-profit organizations that serve the Medical Assistance population, such as the Consumer Health Coalition, with a detailed assessment of the dental providers that accept Medical Assistance. If a better understanding and knowledge of the <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> available to Medical Assistance recipients is provided to non-profit organizations, that serve the Medical Assistance population in the Southwestern Pennsylvania area, then we can expect better access to <b>dental</b> <b>services.</b> To gain the information needed, seventy-two individual dental practices located in Allegheny, Westmoreland, Washington, and Butler Counties were surveyed. The results of the survey indicated that the issue in lack of access does exist in the Southwestern Pennsylvania area. The results of study were able to gain a larger knowledge of individual dental practices across the area. The information will be effectively used by the Consumer Health Coalition to inform Medical Assistance recipients looking for <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> and hereby increasing access to <b>dental</b> <b>services.</b> The public health relevance of the issue of lack of access to <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> for the Medical Assistance population is the health concerns that arise as a result...|$|R

ISSN 0102 - 311 X. Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the use of <b>dental</b> <b>services</b> by {{children}} in Sobral, Ceará State, Brazil, relating such use to socioeconomic factors and patterns of service consumption. An analytical cross-sectional study was performed, interviewing parents or guardians of 3, 425 children.

Of these, 65. 3 % had used such services in the previous year and 85. 4 % in public <b>dental</b> <b>services.</b> The importance of the Brazilian Unified National Health System is highlighted by the response in terms of access to <b>dental</b> <b>services,</b> considering that the vast majority of treatment was provided by this public system.
