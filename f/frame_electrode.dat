40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was the {{advanced}} design, fabrication, and application of combined atomic force microscopy - scanning electrochemical microscopy (AFMSECM) probes for high-resolution topographical and electrochemical imaging. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes innovative approaches for the optimization of AFM-SECM probe fabrication with recessed <b>frame</b> <b>electrodes.</b> For this purpose, commercial silicon nitride AFM cantilevers were modified using optimized critical fabrication processes including improved metallization for the deposition of the electrode layer, and novel insulation strategies for ensuring localized electrochemical signals. As a novel approach for the insulation of AFM-SECM probes, sandwiched layers of PECVD SixNy and SiO 2, and plasma-deposited PFE films were applied and tested. Using sandwiched PECVD SixNy and SiO 2 layers, AFM-SECM probes providing straight (unbent) cantilevers along with excellent insulation characteristics facilitating the functionality of the integrated electrode were reproducibly obtained. Alternatively, PFE thin films were tested according to their utility for serving as a mechanically flexible insulating layer for AFM-SECM probes. The electrochemical characterization of PFEinsulated AFM-SECM probes revealed excellent insulating properties at an insulation thickness of only approx. 400 nm. Finally, AFM-SECM cantilevers prepared via both insulation strategies were successfully tested during AFM-SECM imaging experiments. In the second part of this thesis, disk-shaped nanoelectrodes were for the first time integrated into AFM probes for enabling high-resolution AFM-SECM measurements. Disk electrodes with an electrode radius < 100 nm were realized, which provides a significantly improved lateral resolution for SECM experiments performed in synchronicity with AFM imaging. Furthermore, the developed fabrication scheme enables producing AFM-SECM probes with integrated disk nanoelectrodes at significantly reduced time and cost based on a highly reproducible semi-batch fabrication process providing bifunctional probes at a wafer scale. The development of a detailed processing strategy was accompanied by extensive simulation results for developing a fundamental understanding on the electrochemical properties of AFM-SECM probes with nanoscale electrodes, and for optimizing the associated processing parameters. Thus fabricated probes were electrochemically characterized, and their performance was demonstrated via bifunctional imaging at model samples. The third part of this thesis describes the development and characterization of the first AFM tip-integrated potentiometric sensors based on solid-state electrodes with submicrometer dimensions enabling laterally resolved pH imaging. Antimony and iridium oxides were applied as the pH sensitive electrode material, and have been integrated into the AFM probes via conventional microfabrication strategies.

40|$|Introduction Measuring {{the beam}} profile on a medical cyclo-tron {{in real time}} can aid in {{improved}} tuning of the cyclotron and give important information for a smooth operation. Typically the beam profile is measured by an autoradiography technique or even by a scintillator that can be viewed in real time [1, 2]. Another method is to use collimators {{in front of the}} target to assess the beam center-ing [3]. All these methods have potential draw-backs including; an inability to monitor the beam in real time for the radiograph, exhibiting a non-linear correlation in signal response to the power deposited for a scintillator, and not providing a 2 -dimensional profile of the complete beam for collimators. Our goal was to design a realtime, linear, 2 -dimensional beam-profile monitor that is able to withstand the high power of a PET cyclotron. Material and Methods The beam-profile monitor (PM) is designed for the TR 13, a 13 MeV negative hydrogen-ion cyclotron at TRIUMF. The design follows the concept of a ‘harp’ monitor, widely used at TRIUMF for tuning proton and radioactive ion beams, and is installed on the extraction port without separation from the tank vacuum. The TR 13 monitor is designed to withstand a 13 MeV proton beam with a beam current of up to 25 µA, has an active area of 10 by 10 mm and does not affect the 10 - 7 torr tank vacuum. The device consists of a water-cooled Faraday cup made out of aluminium for low activation and two orthogonal rows of eight tungsten electrodes each mounted on a water-cooled support <b>frame.</b> <b>Electrodes</b> are spaced 1 mm apart from each other, see FIG. 1. The electrodes are electrically isolated from each other and each has a current pickup soldered to it. The material and the shape of the electrodes are optimized to withstand the deposited power of the proton beam. A voltage of - 90 V is applied to the electrodes to repel secondary electrons and prevent crosstalk between neighbouring electrodes. The electrode current is amplified using a custom current amplifier, and read by an ADC. From there, the current data is displayed on a PC. This allows one to observe changes of the beam profile in real time. The electronics are designed to read out all sixteen channels in parallel, or, if {{only a limited number of}} ADC channels are available, to cycle through the different channels. In our current setup all sixteen channels are read out simultaneously. Results and Conclusion The beam-profile monitor provides a real-time representation of the proton beam, see FIG. 2. The data can also be recorded and analyzed at a later time. The linearity of the monitor has been measured up to 30 µA of proton beam current [4]. With the use of the monitor, it was possible to increase the output of the ion source into the target by 50 % in comparison to the standard tune...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of simultaneous EEG and fMRI data is generally {{based on the}} extraction of regressors of interest from the EEG, which are correlated to the fMRI data in a general linear model setting. In more advanced approaches, the spatial information of EEG is also exploited by assuming underlying dipole models. In this study, we present a semi automatic and efficient method to determine electrode positions from electrode gel artifacts, facilitating the integration of EEG and fMRI in future EEG/fMRI data models. In order to visualize all electrode artifacts simultaneously in a single view, a surface rendering of the structural MRI is made using a skin triangular mesh model as reference surface, which is expanded to a "pancake view". Then the electrodes are determined with a simple mouse click for each electrode. Using the geometry of the skin surface and its transformation to the pancake view, the 3 D coordinates of the electrodes are reconstructed in the MRI coordinate <b>frame.</b> The <b>electrode</b> labels {{are attached to the}} electrode positions by fitting a template grid of the electrode cap in which the labels are known. The correspondence problem between template and sample electrodes is solved by minimizing a cost function over rotations, shifts and scalings of the template grid. The crucial step here is to use the solution of the so-called "Hungarian algorithm" as a cost function, which makes it possible to identify the electrode artifacts in arbitrary order. The template electrode grid has to be constructed only once for each cap configuration. In our implementation of this method, the whole procedure can be performed within 15 min including import of MRI, surface reconstruction and transformation, electrode identification and fitting to template. The method is robust in the sense that an electrode template created for one subject can be used without identification errors for another subject for whom the same EEG cap was used. Furthermore, the method appears to be robust against spurious or missing artifacts. We therefore consider the proposed method as a useful and reliable tool within the larger toolbox required for the {{analysis of}} co-registered EEG/fMRI data. © 2011 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

A postop 3 D MPRAGE MRI was performed to localize the distal end of the distorsion artifact induced by the contacts of the electrodes. The size of this artifact was studied independently by scanning the electrode in a reference system. It allowed us to calculate {{the center of each}} contact, together with the projected angles of the electrode, the height of one contact and the distance between 2 adjacent contacts. Results: A distance of 1. 4 mm was measured between the artifact and the contact. 208 contacts and 65 active contacts were projected on sagittal, coronal and axial views of the Schaltenbrand and Wahren stereotactic atlas (SWSA).

40|$|This report aims to {{describe}} the work done {{in order to develop}} a solution for automation of failure detection and performance of rapid voltage surges. The automated system was developed with basis in the experimental circuit developed at NTNU/SINTEF. The experimental circuit relied on manually performing rapid voltage surges and detecting cable failure. Meaning that unknown variables may have been introduced due to the inequality of each grounding. The realized automation system consisted of two parts. The first part was a switch that was able to withstand the voltage applied and able to perform the rapid voltage surges. The second part was a program that controlled the switch and regularly monitored the condition of the cable object, indicating failure when electrical treeing had caused breakdown in the cable insulation. Two solutions for switches were examined. One switch utilized an arm moving between two electrodes for grounding the objects, using textile bakelite as insulation and support <b>frame</b> for the <b>electrodes.</b> The other switch utilized a sphere gap with air as insulation and an electric field strength close to the breakdown strengt of the air. Groundings in the sphere gap switch were performed using a striker to greatly enhance the electric field and cause a spark between the spheres, causing a transition from a highly insulating state to a highly conductive state. As the experimental circuit had a large current limiting resistance, the experimental circuit was sensitive to leakage currents as they set up a voltage over the resistance, instead of the cable objects. Leakage currents in the switches were examined and {{it was found that the}} arm switch had leakage current unacceptable for use in the experiment. Similarly, leakage currents in the sphere gap switch were examined and found to be acceptable for use in the experiment. The behaviour of cable objects that, due to electrical treeing had developed insulation failure was examined and measurement parameters for detecting cable failure were found. These parameters were implemented using LabView as a platform for creating a a control program and interface to the instruments connected to the switch. Having fully created the automated system, the system was used in testing cable objects and was found able to inflict and detect a cable failure due to electrical treeing. However, compared to previous results, a lower number of groundings were needed, which may indicate that the introduction of the sphere gap switch has altered the circuit in a manner such that new results will differ from former results. </p...|$|R

The results in the lower frame show what would be observed if the data collected by the CPT electrode have been corrected for the effects of the push rod. Figure 5 shows the results obtained when the starting initial model is a homogeneous half-space with a resistivity of 20 ohm-m. This figure can be compared with Figure 4 to see the effect that different starting models have on the inversion. Figure 6 shows results that are analogous to those in Figure 4. In this case, the true model is the one shown in the lower frame of Figure 1. Figure 7 compares corrected and uncorrected results. Both results only used data that can be collected when CPT electrodes are used. The top frame shows results when data is collected with point electrodes (no correction used). The bottom frame shows results when data is collected using a CPT electrode; a correction was applied to remove the effects of the electrically conducting pushrod. Figure 8 compares data collected using the CPT electrodes to data collected with point electrode. The blue diamonds represent the uncorrected CPT data and the red squares represent the corrected CPT data. The top frame (electrical gap = 0. 0 m) corresponds to the case where the CPT electrode and the pushrod are connected together thorigh the metal. The bottom frame corresponds to the case where the CPT electrode and pushrod are separated by a 1. 0 m gap; the electrical connection between rod and electrode is through the soil...|$|R
