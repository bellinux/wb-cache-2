40|$|The <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> of {{regenerated}} cellulosic fibres (TENCEL (R), Viscose and Modal) {{was investigated}} by reaction calorimetry {{in comparison with}} cotton, polyester and TENCEL (R) Fabric. Reaction calorimetry is a technique applied for measuring the heat evolved in chemical reactions where very high analytical precision is required Before the measurements, the fibre samples were dried in an oven at 80 degrees C for 60 min with a low and constant nitrogen flow to eliminate initial moisture. As final results the amount of heat in Joules per gram fibre is given. The experimental {{results showed that the}} highest <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> was measured for man-made cellulosic fibres, middle for cotton, while the lowest <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> was observed for polyester fibres. The <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> depends on the interaction of water with hydroxyl groups in the non-crystalline domains of the fibre.

The general aim of this investigation was to obtain further information by means of heats of wetting measurements. Several different studies were made and for purposes of clarity are presented in separate sections. A new technique for the determination of the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> of bone dry cellulose was developed; using this method the value for the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> of standard cotton was measured. A study of the hysteresis effect observed in water sorption was made by measuring the heats of wetting of cellulose containing various amounts of water, left both as the result of adsorption from the dry state, and as the result of desorption from saturated conditions. Measurements were made of the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> of sulphite pulp at different temperatures between 9 ° and 30 ºC. Further measurements were made in the same temperature range using pulp containing a small amount of adsorbed water. The heats of wetting of standard cellulose that had been subjected to severe mechanical treatment were determined. The treatment included compressing, pounding and shredding.

The proposed heating method utilizes acoustic absorption of cellulose fiber, which exhibits viscoelastic properties. The {{surface acoustic waves}} propagate on the piezoelectric substrate and refract into a wet paper strip on the substrate. The refracted longitudinal waves deliver acoustic energy into the wet paper by vibration damping in the form <b>of</b> <b>heat.</b> Acoustothermal heating was discovered to be frequency-dependent and to reach local maxima at certain frequencies.

40|$|On one {{sample of}} 'standard cellulose' the isotherms for the {{sorption}} of water vapor at different relative vapor pressures, {{have been established}} at 20 degree intervals from 0 °C to 80 °C. These have been determined for both adsorption and desorption. These isotherms have the regular sigmoidal shape and hysteresis is exhibited between the adsorption and desorption curves. It is shown that as the temperature is raised the sorptive power of cellulose toward water decreases and also that the hysteresis decreases, i. e., the desorption and adsorption curves approach one another. The Olausius-Clapeyron relationship bas been applied to these and to "equilibrium" isotherms derived from them to determine the differential <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>of</b> "standard cellulose" at different moisture contents.

40|$|A {{comparative}} Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{was performed}} on two natural fibre thermal insulation products made from hemp and sheep wool and a benchmark mineral wool product. The assessment revealed both advantages and some disadvantages with the natural fibre materials. A major finding was the particularly low or absent impact in terms of global warming potential shown by the natural fibre materials. This {{was caused by the}} renewable carbon sequestered in the material withdrawing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. With regard {{to the end of the}} product life, the study showed that only a proportion of the total amount of carbon dioxide was released in landfilling and composting scenarios. Dynamic vapour sorption analysis was conducted on varied natural fibres in order to develop a protocol for studying moisture sorption in natural fibres. Data from these studies were subsequently used in calculating the integral <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> in hemp fibres. The energy release caused by the quantity of material studied in the LCA during predicted relative humidity fluctuations was found unlikely to affect the results of the LCA. However, where large quantities of natural fibres are used throughout a construction the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> may produce a notable difference in the internal temperature of a building and provide a degree of passive environmental control...|$|E
40|$|The {{heat and}} mass {{transfer}} phenomena {{that occur in}} beds of ventilated hygroscopic porous media are coupled. This results in two transfer waves traversing bulks of porous medium that initially have a uniform temperature and moisture content, and that are subsequently ventilated with air {{that is not in}} thermodynamic equilibrium with the solids. The more rapidly travelling wave is known as a temperature wave and the slower wave is known as the moisture wave. Between the two waves the bed of porous medium is at its dwell state. In an Eulerian formulation of the differential equations that govern heat and mass transfer in beds of hygroscopic porous media a solution is obtained using computational fluid dynamics software. This approach has the advantage of enabling a wide range of geometries and operating conditions to be investigated. A second analysis relies on the observation that thermodynamic states of transfer waves lie on straight lines in - space. The Lagrangian analysis is used to investigate the effect on heat and mass transfer of the differential of the integral <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> of the solids with respect to temperature. The numerical and analytical solutions are compared, and it is shown that the numerical solution captures dispersive effects arising from the finite intra-particle resistance to moisture transfer and thermal conductivity. It is observed that accounting for the differential of the integral <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> of the solids with respect to temperature in the analysis has a significant effect on the predicted velocity of the temperature wave. However, this may be an artifice arising {{from the fact that the}} sorption isotherm was obtained by extrapolation to low moisture contents. It may be that sorption isotherms need to be constrained to ensure that the ratio of the differential heat of sorption to the latent heat of vaporisation of water is independent of temperature. It is shown that such isotherms do indeed lessen the effects of the integral <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetting</b> on the velocity of the temperature wave. However, the velocity of the moisture transfer wave is found to be strongly dependent on the form of the isotherm...|$|E

50|$|There {{are various}} {{factors that affect}} soil temperature, such as water content, soil color, and relief (slope, orientation, and elevation), and soil cover (shading and insulation). The color of the ground cover and its {{insulating}} properties have a strong influence on soil temperature. Whiter soil tends {{to have a higher}} albedo than blacker soil cover, which encourages whiter soils to have lower soil temperatures. The specific <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> soil is the energy required to raise the temperature of soil by 1 °C. The specific <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> soil increases as water content increases, since the <b>heat</b> capacity <b>of</b> water is greater than that of dry soil. The specific <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> pure water is ~ 1 calorie per gram, the specific <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> dry soil is ~ 0.2 calories per gram, hence, the specific <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>wet</b> soil is ~ 0.2 to 1 calories per gram. Also, a tremendous energy (~540 cal/g) is required to evaporate water (known as the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> vaporization).

40|$|Supercritical Water Gasification is a {{promising}} technology to convert wet biomass into syngas.
