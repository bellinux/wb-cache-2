5|$|Both {{teams had}} exited the {{respective}} European competitions they were competing <b>in</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> competition. Anderlecht were eliminated {{in the second}} round of the 1978–79 European Cup Winners' Cup by eventual winners Barcelona. Anderlecht won the first leg 3–0, but a 3–0 victory by Barcelona in the second leg meant the tie went to extra-time and a subsequent penalty shootout, which they lost 4–1. Liverpool were competing in the 1978–79 European Cup and were eliminated in the first round by the eventual winners Nottingham Forest of England in the first round. Forest won the first leg 2–0 and a 0–0 draw in the second leg saw them progress at Liverpool's expense.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} Allied {{offensive}} in Italy, the battalion {{was assigned to}} the new 9th New Zealand Infantry Brigade, which was allocated as the divisional reserve in April for Operation Buckland. Initially, the battalion protected the engineers bridging the Senio. When the bridges were finished, it covered the open flank around Barbiano resulting from a delay to the 3rd Carpathian Division. The battalion then attacked Massa Lombarda in preparation for a crossing of the Sillaro river, boarding Kangaroo APCs and moving forward. Tiger tanks forced the battalion to dismount and dig <b>in</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Tigers were knocked out by Allied artillery. A and C Squadrons supported the 22nd Battalion in attacking Squazzaloca. The battalion reached the Sillaro River, crossed it at first light and was relieved by the 27th Battalion on 15 April. D Squadron cleared Sesto Imolese of Axis troops, with A and BSquadrons protecting the left flank. On 16–17 April, the battalion protected the right flank behind the 22nd Battalion. The attack across the Gaiana began with a massive artillery barrage during the night of 18 April. Although the battalion crossed the river unopposed, it was counter-attacked beyond the barrage area. Advancing against stiff Axis resistance, A and CSquadrons were {{on the far side of}} the Quaderna Canal by 01:30 on 19 April. The battalion dug in there, resisting Axis counter-attacks; eleven men from the battalion were killed and 47 wounded.|$|E

5|$|The music {{composition}} and recording were handled by underground musicians Falk Au Yeong, Funk Fiction, Andy Tunstall, James Landino, DJ Max-E, Mr. Lange, and Li Xiao'an. Daneluz {{had not made}} plans to incorporate original music until Falk approached him requesting collaboration on the game. Funk Fiction has claimed that the music spans more than twenty genres and was influenced by rock, jazz, disco, and trip hop and the soundtracks of game franchises like Sonic, Donkey Kong, and Kirby. Due to the levels in After the Sequel generally taking longer to complete than those <b>in</b> <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> Sequel, the music tracks are longer, estimated by Falk as ranging from one minute and 45 seconds to three minutes.|$|E

25|$|The tunnels were {{constructed}} in the late 1970s, using mining techniques, and {{were constructed}} as single-track tubes with a diameter of 4.75 metres. The tunnels under Newcastle were mechanically bored through boulder clay and lined with cast iron or concrete segments. The tunnel under Gateshead, was bored through sandstone and excavated coal seams. Old coal mine workings, some of which dated from the Middle Ages had to be filled <b>in</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> tunnelling began.|$|E
25|$|Harris was a Toronto {{organizer}} for {{the federal}} Green Party for the 1993 election, recruiting seventeen candidates in the area.

By fielding seventeen candidates in the Toronto region (which then had roughly twenty-two ridings) the Toronto team presented over one-third of the national requirement.

25|$|Written laws also specify {{that some}} {{criminal}} matters {{should be tried}} in the Subordinate Courts {{rather than in the}} High Court.

The Court exercises its appellate jurisdiction when it hears appeals from trials originating in the Subordinate Courts.|$|E

25|$|The {{outcome of}} the war did nothing to solve the {{problems}} that had been responsible for it in the first place. The revenues of the state were still massively insufficient to pay the soldiers' salaries, causing violence to break out among the troops. The military continued to demand complete control over the affairs of the state, and met with hostility the attempts to the caliphs to reduce their authority. As a result, the government soon reverted to the state of instability it had been <b>in</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before this}} summit, the Commission {{moved into the}} Breydel building. This was due to {{asbestos}} being discovered in the Berlaymont, forcing its evacuation in 1989. The Commission threatened {{to move out of}} the city, which would have destroyed Brussels's chances of hosting the Parliament, so the government stepped in to build the Breydel building a short distance from the Berlaymont in 23 months, ensuring the Commission could move <b>in</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Edinburgh summit. Shortly after Edinburgh, Parliament bought its new building in Brussels. With the status of Brussels now clear, NGOs, lobbyists, advisory bodies and regional offices started basing themselves in the quarter near the institutions.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th century entremets {{began to}} involve not just {{eye-catching}} displays of amusing haute cuisine, {{but also more}} prominent and often highly symbolic forms of inedible entertainment. In 1306, the knighting of the son of Edward I included performances of chansons de geste {{in what has been}} assumed {{to be part of the}} entremets. During the course of the 14th century they would often take on the character of theatrical displays, complete with props, actors, singers, mummers and dancers. At a banquet held in 1378 by Charles V of France in honor of Emperor Charles IV, a huge wooden model of the city of Jerusalem was rolled <b>in</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> high table.

As the second Sea Stallion landed, a figure with a pistol {{who turned out to be}} the missing pilot appeared running towards the Marines and immediately went to the Sea Stallion. As the side door opened, he was pulled <b>in</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> second 20 Marines poised to leave by the rear ramp could even move. They were called back to their seats, and those who had formed the defensive perimeter reboarded the other helicopter. After a quick head count, the Stallions took off. They had been on the ground no more than seven minutes.|$|E
