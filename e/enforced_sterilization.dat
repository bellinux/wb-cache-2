In New York, after attending a conference on abortion at Barnard College in 1970, she focused on reproductive rights of women and became an advocate for women's reproductive rights, campaigning for change at a policy level. In 1970, Rodriguez-Trias was a founding member of Committee to End Sterilization Abuse and in 1971, {{a founding member of the}} Women's Caucus of the American Public Health Association. Rodriguez-Trias supported abortion rights, fought for the abolishment of <b>enforced</b> <b>sterilization,</b> and sought that neonatal care to underserved people be provided. In 1979, Rodriguez-Trias became a founding member of the Committee for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse and testified before the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for passage of federal sterilization guidelines. The guidelines, which she drafted, require a woman's written consent to sterilization, offered in a language they can understand, and set a waiting period between the consent and the sterilization procedure. She is credited with helping to expand the range of public health services for women and children in minority and low-income populations in the United States, Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.|$|E

However, {{the vast majority}} of married Indians (76% in a 2009 study) reported significant problems in accessing a choice of contraceptive methods. The above table clearly indicates more evidence that the availabity of cocontraceptives problem for people in India. In 2009, 48.4% of married women were estimated to use a contraceptive method. About three-fourths of these were using female stst sterilization whichs by far the most prevalent birth-control method in India. Condoms, at a mere 3%, were the next most prevalent method. Meghalaya, at 20%, had the lowest usage {{of contraception}} among all Indian states. Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were the other two states that reported usage below 30%.

Some previous attempts to limit population growth in India or China, which appear to have this same intention, have in some cases met resistance because they focused on limiting the number of children that each family may have without taking into account the differences between individuals in the number of children desired. During India's state of emergency between 1975 and 1977, under the direction of the son of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi there was reported to be overzealous enforcement of vasectomy and tubal ligation programs in order to meet quotas. The resulting backlash made subsequent family planning efforts more difficult. Also in China, under the One-Child Policy (instituted in 1979 to limit the number of children born to urban dwellers to one child) there were also overzealous officials who were jailed for <b>enforcing</b> <b>sterilization</b> or using forced abortions in order to meet population quotas.|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{medicine}} this century is darkened by {{the downfall of}} the German medical profession, exposed during the doctors' trial at Nuremberg in 1946. Relying largely on documents published during 1933 in German medical journals, this paper examines two widely accepted notions of those events, metaphorically termed "slippery slope" and "sudden subversion. " The first connotes a gradual slide over infinitesimal steps until, suddenly, all footing is lost; the second conveys forced take over of the profession's leadership and values. Both concepts imply that the medical profession itself became the victim of circumstances. The slippery slope concept is a prominent figure of argument in the current debate on bioethics. The evidence presented here, however, strongly suggests that the German medical community set its own course in 1933. In some respects this course even outpaced the new government, which had to rein in the profession's eager pursuit of <b>enforced</b> eugenic <b>sterilizations.</b> In 1933 the convergence of political, scientific, and economic forces dramatically changed the relationship between the medical community and the government. That same convergence is occurring again and must be approached with great caution if medicine is to remain focused on the preservation of physical and medical integrity...|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to suffering systematic sexual slavery, forced <b>sterilization,</b> <b>enforced</b> marriage, torture, and extrajudicial execution, women also faced rape {{and sexual abuse}} during interrogation by Indonesian authorities. These women included the wives of resistance members, resistance activists and suspected Fretilin collaborators. Often times women were targeted and subjected to torture {{as a form of}} proxy violence when male relatives who were suspected of being Fretilin were not present. [...] In 1999 researcher Rebecca Winters released the book Buibere: Voice of East Timorese Women, which chronicles many personal stories of violence and abuse dating to the earliest days of the occupation. One woman tells of being interrogated while stripped half-naked, tortured, molested, and threatened with death. Another describes being chained at the hands and feet, raped repeatedly, and interrogated for weeks. A woman who had prepared food for Fretilin guerrillas was arrested, burned with cigarettes, tortured with electricity, and forced to walk naked past a row of soldiers into a tank filled with urine and feces.|$|R

5000|$|Charles Davenport (1866-1944), a {{scientist}} from the United States, {{stands out as}} one of history's leading eugenicists.

Definition of conflict-related sexual violence Conflict-related sexual violence includes “rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, forced pregnancy, <b>enforced</b> <b>sterilization,</b> or {{any other form of}} sexual violence [...] . against women, men, girls or boys.
