2500|$|The album's artwork {{was shot}} by Mert and Marcus and {{directed}} by Giovanni Bianco. The deluxe edition was unveiled through Madonna's official Facebook page on January 31, 2012. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News described the image as [...] "glamorous, deconstructed photograph" [...] where Madonna [...] "cocks her head up, her curly <b>hair</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back.</b> She's wearing lots of mascara, bright red lipstick, a choker and a silky bright pink top. The photo {{has some kind of}} broken mirror filter over it, giving it a funky, dance-queen vibe." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator compared the [...] "multi-hued" [...] artwork to the one of True Blue (1986), with the similarity in Madonna's blond locks and the tilting of her head. He further added that the artwork symbolized the different angles through which the singer has been scrutinized throughout her career. The standard edition cover was revealed on February 6, 2012. Its art direction included the same color palette and the distorted appearance like the deluxe version image, but featured a body-shot of Madonna in a red dress and gloves with jewelry.|$|E

50|$|Kenbu (剣舞, occ. 剣武) is {{performed}} in hakama and kimono, wearing tabi, {{a type of}} divided-toe socks.

When these other items are used, a white cloth belt is traditionally worn over the hakama ties. This white belt was originally worn by samurai preparing to go into battle and served to reinforce the hakama ties so that, in the event they were cut, the samurai would not find himself with his pants suddenly heaped around his ankles.|$|E

50|$|Dance is a {{significant}} element of traditional Korean culture. Special traditional dances are performed as part of many annual festivals and celebrations (harvest, etc.), involving traditional costumes, specific colors, music, songs and special instruments. Some dances are performed by either men only or women only, while others are performed by both. The women usually have their <b>hair</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> away from the face in a bun, or may be wearing colorful hats. Some variation of the traditional hanbok is typically worn, or a special costume specific to that dance. In some dances, the women's costumes will have very long sleeves, or trail a long length of fabric, to accentuate graceful arm movements. Outdoor festivals are loud and joyous, and cymbals and drums can prominently be heard. Masks may be worn.|$|E

5000|$|British {{soldiers}} and sailors during the 18th century wore their hair in a style known as the queue. While not always braided, the <b>hair</b> was similarly <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> very tight into a single tail, wrapped around a piece of leather and tied down with a ribbon. The hair was also often greased and powdered in a fashion similar to powdered wigs, or tarred {{in the case of}} sailors. It was said that the soldiers' <b>hair</b> was <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> so tightly that they had difficulty closing their eyes afterwards. The use of white hair powder in the British Army was discontinued in 1796 and queues were ordered to be cut off four years later. They continued to be worn in the Royal Navy for a while longer, where they were known as [...] "pigtails". Officers wore pigtails until 1805 and other ranks continued to wear them until about 1820.|$|R

5000|$|With only a {{month to}} go until the release of A Public Affair, Simpson {{switched}} the cover photo of the album. The first cover art for the album surfaced showing a sultry Simpson with her hair down, sporting a dress with the straps pulled down. Ultimately, Simpson's representative Rob Shuter told TMZ the final decision on a cover had not {{been made by the}} time one had to be provided to Simpson's record label, so the first cover option (of three choices they had) was given. The original cover was ultimately not chosen, and Simpson went with the cover eventually released. The chosen album cover has a casual-looking Simpson [...] "with nothing but a T-shirt on", her <b>hair</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> and wearing a ring on her right index finger.|$|E
5000|$|Robbie Daw of Idolator {{commented that}} [...] "once again, the country act serves up a pop-crossover jam that should {{appeal to a}} variety of listeners, and will no doubt find a home on an array of radio format playlists." [...] Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song a four and a half stars rating out of five. He {{explained}} [...] "‘We Owned the Night’ is rootsy, something that couldn’t be said about any of the group’s previous singles. This being their third album, it was wise to take a chance sonically to avoid fan fatigue. The trio still manages to hang on to the lyrical suspense that makes their music so captivating." [...] He concluded saying [...] "This song is like Lady A with no makeup on, in beat up blue jeans and their collective <b>hair</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> in a ponytail. It’s a new style that’s still familiar, but sexy in its own way." ...|$|E
5000|$|Van Buren's seated figure {{creates a}} {{pyramidal}} composition, activated by {{the movement of}} her head, arms, and torso. Her body is illuminated and given sculptural form by a strong shaft of light coming from the left. Her face is thin and serious, her graying <b>hair</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back,</b> as she supports her head with her left hand, her right hand counterpoised in her lap, holding a fan. For Eakins's biographer John Wilmerding, {{the contrast between the}} arms is noteworthy: one arm is solid and [...] "architectural...suggestive of an unspoken potential for great vitality", and [...] "the anchor of the portrait" [...] that belies the otherwise reflective countenance; the other hand is shadowed and limp. She sits in a Jacobean-revival chair, a prop that Eakins often used for his studio portraits. It is selectively detailed, so as to support without distracting from Van Buren's figure. Van Buren's dress contains complex passages, composed in part of broad, brilliant pink forms, and of creased light-colored fabric with floral patterns.|$|E
