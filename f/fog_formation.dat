A centralized joint communication and computation resource allocation scheme is proposed in [6]. The work in [7] studies the resource allocation in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks for energy efficiency. The power-delay tradeoff in centralized MEC systems is discussed in [8] using tools from stochastic optimization. In [9], the problem of latency minimization under a resource utilization constraint is studied, where an algorithm is proposed to balance between minimizing computing latency and energy consumption. However, these works rely on centralized solutions in which the MEC network has information about all users requests and channel-state information (CSI). A semi-distributed solution for the joint computing and communication resource optimization is proposed in [10] under asymmetric user preferences and capabilities. A distributed framework to realize the power-delay tradeoff in latency constrained fog networks is proposed in [11]. Game-theoretic solutions are discussed in [12] to design decentralized computing offloading schemes for edge cloud computing. Game theory is also used in [13] to model the competition of IoT nodes over the fog network resources {{with the aim of}} minimizing both energy and delay.

However, due to the unpredictable arrival of available neighboring fog nodes, the dynamic <b>formation</b> of a <b>fog</b> network can be challenging.

In this paper, this problem of <b>fog</b> network <b>formation</b> and task distribution is studied considering a hybrid cloud-fog architecture.

To find the desired set of neighboring fog nodes, an online algorithm is developed to enable a task initiating fog node to decide on which other nodes can be used as part of its fog network, to offload computational tasks, without knowing any prior information on the future arrivals of those other nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed online algorithm can successfully select an optimal set of neighboring fog nodes while achieving a latency that is as small as the one resulting from an ideal, offline scheme that has complete knowledge of the system.

Positive matrix factorization (PMF) {{as a tool for}} the source apportionment was employed to understand the sources of pollution. Four major sources viz. biomass burning, refractory, secondary and mineral dust were identified. Aerosols properties during foggy episodes were heavily influenced by almost all the sources and they caused considerable loading of almost all the organic and inorganic species during the period. The biomass generated aerosols were removed from the atmosphere by scavenging during foggy episodes. The wet removal of almost all the species by the fog droplets was observed. The K +, water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), water soluble inorganic carbon (WSIC) and NO 3 - were most heavily scavenged among the species and their concentrations consequently became lower than the nonfoggy episode concentrations. The production of secondary inorganic aerosol, mainly sulfate and ammonium, during foggy episodes was considerably higher than nitrate which was rather heavily scavenged and removed by the fog droplets. The fogwater analysis showed that dissolved inorganic species {{play a vital role in}} processing of organic carbon such as the formation of organo-sulfate and organo-nitrate inside the <b>fog</b> droplets.

One of such potential sources is fog water collection. In the past, collection of fog water was considered negligible and non-worthy. However, recent studies suggest that fog-water collection can be a reasonable sustainable source of water depending on favorable topographic and atmospheric conditions. This paper presents {{development of a mathematical}} model for fog-formation and eventual quantification of fog-water collection. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) equation for dew point calculation has been modified and extended to incorporate effects of different climatic parameters on <b>fog</b> <b>formation.</b> A new parameter named Fog Potential Index (FPI), which is a function of difference between dew point and air temperature for a particular location has been introduced and defined. NOAA proposed an equation to calculate dew point based on actual water vapor pressure in the air, which can be calculated from dry bulb temperature of the air and relative humidity. Following calculation of average dew point using NOAA equation between a timestep, FPI was calculated for a particular time step. FPI for each timestep was multiplied with the humidity factor, wind velocity factor and area of the fog collector to incorporate the effects of humidity ratio, wind velocity and fog collector area in the quantification of fog water. Effect of wind velocity on <b>fog</b> <b>formation</b> has been discussed.

The governing equations of energy and diffusion, coupled with the saturation con@on, are solved and analytical correction factors are derived. Sub-sequently, the “negligible induced velocity ” (NIV) fog film model is applied to channel flow, yielding analytical expressions for the variation of bulk vapour mass fraction, bulk temperature, and the possible creation of bulk fog. Multiplying the NIV correction factor for fog only by the classical film model correction factors for induced velocity, reveals that the product corresponds to the film model correction factors for the combined effects of fog and induced velocity. Furthermore, a thorough comparison with theoretical and experimental results of foregoing two-dimensional studies, concerning <b>fog</b> <b>formation</b> {{in the presence of}} free and forced convection, confirms the accuracy of the present fog film model. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Smoke from {{wildland}} {{burning in}} association with fog has been implicated as a visibility hazard over roadways in the southern United States. A project began in 2002 to determine whether moisture released during the smoldering phases of southern prescribed burns could contribute to <b>fog</b> <b>formation.</b> Temperature and relative humidity measurements were taken from 27 smoldering 'smokes ' during 2002 and 2003. These data were converted to {{a measure of the}} mass of water vapor present to the mass of dry air containing the vapor (smoke mixing ratio). Some smokes were dry with almost no moisture beyond ambient. Other smokes were moist with moisture excesses as large as 39 g kg- 1. Calculations show that ground-level smoke moisture excesses have no impact on ambient relative humidity during the day. However, the impact at night can be large enough to increase the ambient relative humidity to 100 %. Therefore smoke moisture may be a contributing factor to the location and timing of <b>fog</b> <b>formation...</b>|$|E
40|$|During winter 2003 - 04, several {{instruments}} were deployed at Payerne, Switzerland {{in support of}} COST Action 720, which aims to develop integrated ground-based remote-sensing stations for atmospheric profiling. In this short paper, we examine the accuracy of observations and temperature and humidity retrievals from microwave radiometers. We also investigate how cloud radar and wind profiler data could add extra information in {{a case study of}} <b>fog</b> <b>formation</b> and dissipation. 1...|$|E
