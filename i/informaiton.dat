Lastly, the paper investigates the impact of online sexual information on Japanese young people's behaviors and values in comparison with that of other countries in an attempt to provide the basis for accurate measures. The results of the research found that online sexual information has some significant impact on young people, including the increase of the curiosity for sexual crimes.

The study is based on a holistic approach to information security that does not confine itself to technical measures and technology implementations, but encompasses other equally important aspects such as human, social, motiviational and trust. In order to achieve this purpose, a comprehensive intellectual framework of the concepts of information security using Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) was utilised. The survey questions were drived from this conceptual model to ensure their coherence, completeness and relevance to the topic being addressed. The paper concludes with a discussion of the survey results and draws significant insight into the existing status of <b>informaiton</b> assurance in organisations that could be useful for security practitioners, researchers and managers. ...|$|E

A surprising finding is that <b>informaiton</b> technology competence has been stable and rarely increased or decreased rapidly. The usage rate of information technology service, satisfaction, and unawreness are also relatively stable and consistent as a whole. Finally, usage and satisfaction of information technology services are not always positively related.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{information}} analysis and an information model called the Semantic Structure Model based on {{information analysis}} are explained for semantic processing. Methods for self organization of information are also described. In addition, Information-Base Systems for thinking support {{of research and development}} in non linear optical materials are explained. As a result of information analysis, general properties of information and structural properties of concepts become clear. General properties of <b>informaiton</b> are as follows: 1) concepts which are a basic unit of information are uncountable, 2) information is not processed unless it is represented, 3) <b>informaiton</b> contains uncertainty. Structural properties of concepts are as follows: 1) concepts have internal structures, 2) concepts have overlap mutually, 3) concepts are relative. The Semantic Structure Model {{based on information}} analysis reflects properties of information in the real world. The model is formulated as the extended hypergraphs which are nested labeled directed hypergraphs. Each hyperlink of the extended hypergraphs has a label which describes meaning of information. Nodes and links in the extended hypergraphs are dealt with homogeneously as hyperlinks. The model can describe internal structures of concepts, overlap among ones, and relativity of ones. C-TRAN SS-KWIC SS-SANS and SANS are useful methods for self organization of information. Self organaization of information means that information is organaized automatically by using information itself. Since information stored in computers is vbery large information must be structuralized by self organization, otherwise it is too difficult to structuralize a huge amount of complicated information mannally. Information Base Systems are constructed for thinking supoort of research and development in the sciences and technologies. Information-Base Systems are self organizing systems, which store necessary information for research and development e. g. primary information and sturcutured information, and facilitate sophisticated functions such as analogical reasoning, inductive inference and problem solving etc. Meaning is carried by structures, and semantic processing is performed by operations on the structures.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) reporting by banks in the developing economy of Bangladesh. This paper also aims to examine the users' perceptions relating to CSR disclosures issues. Design/methodology/approach – The study collected two types of data. First the annual reports of 20 selected banking companies, which are listed in Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), were considered. A questionnaire was also used to investigate the level of users' understanding and their perception of CSR reporting. Findings – The principal findings are twofold: first, the study shows that the selected banking companies did some (albeit little) CSR reporting on a voluntary basis. Second, that the user groups are in favor of CSR reporting, and would like to see more disclosure. The current disclosures by the selected banks, however, are not ample at all to measure the social responsiveness of the organizations.

The accuracy of analyses using FGGE data base coupled with the errors due to modeling imperfections determines the present skill of numerical models. An estimte of initial uncertainty is determined by examining differences in several FGGE analyses.

Several different calculations of predictability error growth are also compared. Finally, present-day forecast skill using FGGE analyses is contrasted to the estimates of ultimate skill, and the partition of model error versus initial uncertainty is discussed...|$|E

In addition, informal stories of pregnancy and birth are routinely told between women. However, increased prenatal testing means that more fetuses are diagnosed with abnormalities, shifting the <b>informaiton</b> requirements during pregnancy. Traditional {{sources of information}} cannot cover all possible outcomes, and the Internet is beginning to fill this gap. In this article, we draw from interviews about experiences of antenatal screening and pregnancy to explore how the Internet provides a unique resource for problematic pregnancies. It allows access to information about rarer conditions beyond standard pregnancy texts, as well as personal narratives about conditions. Learning how others have coped or are coping in similar situations can alleviate feelings of isolation, and also places women back in a familiar territory of shared pregnancy narratives.

Different outcomes of normal karyotype AML suggest that this subgroup of AML could be genetically heterogeneous.

CIITA, a master regulator of MHC class II gene expression and truncated in B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin disease, is found to fuse with DEXI in 48 % of normal karyotype AML cases. The fusion transcripts formed between adjacent genes highlight the possibility that certain such fusions could be involved in oncological process in AML, and provide a new source to identify genetic markers for normal karyotype AML...|$|E
