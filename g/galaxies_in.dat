5|$|At {{least two}} pairs of {{interacting}} galaxies have been observed. Arp107 {{is a pair of}} <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the process of merging, located 450million light-years away. NGC3395 and NGC3396 are a spiral and irregular barred spiral galaxy, respectively, that are interacting, located 1.33degrees southwest of 46 Leonis Minoris.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{prominence}} of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the Universe are dwarf galaxies. These galaxies are relatively small when compared with other galactic formations, being about one hundredth {{the size of the}} Milky Way, containing only a few billion stars. Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies have recently been discovered that are only 100parsecs across.|$|E
5|$|NGC 4027 {{is another}} member of the NGC 4038 group, notable for its {{extended}} spiral arm. Known as the Ringtail Galaxy, it lies close to 31 Crateris. A barred spiral galaxy, its distorted shape is probably due to a past collision, possibly with the nearby NGC 4027A. NGC 4782 and NGC 4783 are a pair of merging elliptical <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the northeastern part of the constellation, around 200 million light-years distant.|$|E

50|$|NGC 6166 is an {{elliptical}} <b>galaxy</b> <b>in</b> the Abell 2199 cluster. It lies 490 million {{light years}} away in the constellation Hercules.

5000|$|NGC 3271 is a barred spiral <b>galaxy</b> <b>in</b> the {{constellation}} Antlia. At magnitude 11.7, {{it is the}} brightest spiral <b>galaxy</b> <b>in</b> the Antlia Cluster, which lies about [...] away.|$|R
5|$|The <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the {{constellation}} are faint. IC 4633 {{is a very}} faint spiral galaxy surrounded by {{a vast amount of}} Milky Way line-of-sight integrated flux nebulae—large faint clouds thought to be lit by large numbers of stars.|$|E
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E

5000|$|On June 22, 2016 Lucasfilm {{requested}} {{the production of}} <b>Galaxy</b> <b>in</b> Turmoil be halted. [...] On July 31, 2016, Frontwire Studios announced the cancellation of the game {{was due to the}} [...] "possibility of <b>Galaxy</b> <b>in</b> Turmoil taking away attention from Electronic Arts' Battlefront franchise". Proposals of <b>Galaxy</b> <b>in</b> Turmoil falling under the paywall of Electronic Arts, and ideas of Lucasfilm giving Frontwire Studios a Star Wars IP licence were both rejected due to an agreement between Electronic Arts and Lucasfilm. Although Frontwire Studios may have fallen within Fair Use laws, legal conflict was avoided and the fan made Star Wars inspired project was canceled. There is a playable alpha that contains assets from Free Radical Design that was released to the public then removed early on within <b>Galaxy</b> <b>in</b> Turmoil's lifetime. <b>Galaxy</b> <b>in</b> Turmoil is now planned to be released as a brand new [...] "cyber-punk" [...] themed IP without any Star Wars references, but still with Battlefront III-inspired mechanics including space-to-ground battles.|$|R
50|$|NGC 6086 is an {{elliptical}} <b>galaxy</b> <b>in</b> {{the constellation}} of Corona Borealis. It has an apparent magnitude of 12.7. A Type-cD galaxy, it is the brightest cluster <b>galaxy</b> <b>in</b> the cluster Abell 2162. In 2010, a supermassive black hole was discovered in NGC 6086.|$|R
5|$|Messier 87 (also {{known as}} Virgo A or NGC 4486, and {{generally}} abbreviated to M87) is a supergiant elliptical galaxy {{in the constellation}} Virgo. One of the most massive <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the local universe, it is notable for its large population of globular clusters—M87 contains about 12,000 compared to the 150–200 orbiting the Milky Way—and its jet of energetic plasma that originates at the core and extends outward at least 1,500 parsecs (4,900 light-years), travelling at relativistic speed. It {{is one of the}} brightest radio sources in the sky, and is a popular target for both amateur astronomy observations and professional astronomy study.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the Universe are gravitationally {{bound to}} a number of other galaxies. These form a fractal-like {{hierarchical}} distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group of galaxies is {{the most common type of}} galactic cluster, and these formations contain a majority of the galaxies (as well as most of the baryonic mass) in the Universe. To remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.|$|E
5|$|NGC 678 and NGC 680 are {{a pair of}} <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> Aries {{that are}} only about 200,000 light-years apart. Part of the NGC 691 group of galaxies, both are at a {{distance}} of approximately 130 million light-years. NGC 678 is an edge-on spiral galaxy that is 4.5 by 0.8 arcminutes. NGC 680, an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary, is the brighter of the two at magnitude 12.9; NGC 678 has a magnitude of 13.35. Both galaxies have bright cores, but NGC 678 is the larger galaxy at a diameter of 171,000 light-years; NGC 680 has a diameter of 72,000 light-years. NGC 678 is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane. NGC 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight. It has multiple spiral arms and a bright core. Because it is so diffuse, it has a low surface brightness. It has a diameter of 126,000 light-years and is 124 million light-years away. NGC 877 is the brightest member of an 8-galaxy group that also includes NGC 870, NGC 871, and NGC 876, with a magnitude of 12.53. It is 2.4 by 1.8 arcminutes and is 178 million light-years away with a diameter of 124,000 light-years. Its companion is NGC 876, which is about 103,000 light-years from the core of NGC 877. They are interacting gravitationally, as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust. Arp 276 is a different pair of interacting <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> Aries, consisting of NGC 935 and IC 1801.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} decade, megamasers were also {{discovered}} for formaldehyde (H2CO) and methine (CH). Galactic formaldehyde masers are relatively rare, and more formaldehyde megamasers are known than are galactic formaldehyde masers. Methine masers, {{on the other}} hand, are quite common in the Milky Way. Both types of megamaser were found in <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> which hydroxyl had been detected. Methine is seen in galaxies with hydroxyl absorption, while formaldehyde is found in galaxies with hydroxyl absorption {{as well as those}} with hydroxyl megamaser emission.|$|E
5|$|The final {{images were}} {{released}} {{at a meeting}} of the American Astronomical Society in January 1996, and revealed a plethora of distant, faint galaxies. About 3,000 distinct galaxies could be identified in the images, with both irregular and spiral galaxies clearly visible, although some <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the field are only a few pixels across. In all, the HDF is thought to contain fewer than twenty galactic foreground stars; by far the majority of objects in the field are distant galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers and kilomasers {{are found}} {{primarily}} associated with active galactic nuclei, while galactic and weaker extragalactic water masers {{are found in}} star forming regions. Despite different environments, the circumstances that produce extragalactic water masers {{do not seem to}} be very different from those that produce galactic water masers. Observations of water megamasers have been used to make accurate measurements of distances to <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> order to provide constraints on the Hubble constant.|$|E

5|$|The data {{processing}} yielded four monochrome images (at 300nm, 450nm, 606nm and 814nm), one at each wavelength. One image was designated as red (814nm), the second as green (606nm) {{and the third}} as blue (450nm), and the three images were combined to give a colour image. Because the wavelengths at which the images were taken do not correspond to the wavelengths of red, green and blue light, the colours in the final image only give an approximate representation of the actual colours of the <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the image; the choice of filters for the HDF (and the majority of Hubble images) was primarily designed to maximize the scientific utility of the observations rather than to create colours corresponding to what the human eye would actually perceive.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120km/s. In 4billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% chance that the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% chance that it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy. After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%, the galaxies' supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant elliptical galaxy. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst. In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an active galactic nucleus. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.|$|E
5|$|Hoag's Object, located 600 {{million light-years}} from Earth, {{is a member}} of the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies. The outer ring is largely {{composed}} of young blue stars while the core is made up of older yellow stars. The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a barred spiral galaxy whose arms had velocities too great to keep the galaxy's coherence and therefore detached. Arp 220 is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy, Arp 220 is somewhat closer than Hoag's Object at 250 million light-years from Earth. It consists of two large spiral <b>galaxies</b> <b>in</b> the process of colliding with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive star formation throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies' core. Another interacting galaxy pair, albeit in an earlier stage, consists of the galaxies NGC 5953 and NGC 5954. In this case, both are active galaxies, with the former a Seyfert 2 galaxy and the latter a LINER-type galaxy. Both are undergoing a burst of star formation triggered by the interaction.|$|E
