40|$|The {{survival}} of pancreatic beta cells {{depends on the}} balance between external cytotoxic and protective molecular systems. The neuropeptide neurotensin (NT) {{has been shown to}} regulate certain functions of the endocrine pancreas including insulin and glucagon release. However, the mechanism of action of NT as well as the identification of receptors involved in the pancreatic functions of the peptide remained to be studied. We demonstrate here that NT is an efficient protective agent of pancreatic beta cells against cytotoxic agents. Both beta-TC 3 and INS- 1 E cell lines and the mouse pancreatic islet cells express <b>the</b> three <b>known</b> <b>NT</b> receptors. <b>The</b> incubation of beta cells with NT protects cells from apoptosis induced either by staurosporine or by IL- 1 beta. In beta-TC 3 cells, NT activates both MAP and PI- 3 kinases pathways and strongly reduces the staurosporine or the Il- 1 beta-induced caspase- 3 activity by a mechanism involving Akt activation. The NTSR 2 agonist levocabastine displays the same protective effect than NT whereas the NTSR 1 antagonist is unable to block the effect of NT suggesting the predominant involvement of the NTSR 2 in the action of NT on beta cells. These results clearly indicate {{for the first time that}} NT is able to protect endocrine beta cells from external cytotoxic agents, a role well correlated with its release in the circulation after a meal...|$|R

40|$|Neurotensin (NT), a distal gut peptide, has {{important}} regulatory and trophic effects throughout the gut; however the intracellular mechanisms that regulate the gene expression and release of human <b>NT</b> are not <b>known.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this}} endeavor was to study a functioning human pancreatic carcinoid cell line (called BON) in vitro that expresses the NT gene, and to study {{the effect of the}} cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signal-transduction pathway on the expression and release of human NT. RNA was prepared from BON cell line (which has been established in this laboratory); the RNA was analyzed for NT mRNA expression by Northern hybridization with a complementary DNA probe. RNA blot analysis demonstrated that the NT gene is expressed in BON and is transcribed to two mRNAs of 1. 0 - and 1. 5 -kb sizes. In the second part of this study, BON cells were treated with either forskolin (FSK), which increases intracellular levels of cAMP, or with serotonin (5 -HT), which reduces cAMP in BON cells. Forskolin produced a dose-dependent increase in NT peptide release and, furthermore, FSK (10 (- 6) mol/L) rapidly increased NT mRNA abundance 1 hour after addition; conversely, 5 -HT (10 (- 5) mol/L) decreased NT mRNA at 1 hour. Neurotensin mRNA levels returned to control values by 3 hours after either FSK or 5 -HT, which suggests that the transcript half-life for NT is relatively short. These findings show that the expression and peptide release of human NT is mediated, in part, by the cAMP signal-transduction pathway. Our human carcinoid cell line will provide a useful model to study the in vitro regulation of NT gene expression and peptide release...|$|R

40|$|Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{endogenous}} small non-coding RNAs {{of about}} 20 – 24 <b>nt,</b> <b>known</b> to play key roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation, {{that can be}} coded either by intergenic or intragenic loci. Intragenic (exonic and intronic) miRNAs can exert {{a role in the}} transcriptional regulation and RNA processing of their host gene. Moreover, the possibility that the biogenesis of exonic miRNAs could destabilize the corresponding protein-coding transcript and reduce protein synthesis makes their characterization very intriguing and suggests a possible novel mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. This work was designed to carry out the computational identification of putative exonic miRNAs in 30 plant species and the analysis of possible mechanisms involved in their regulation. The results obtained represent a useful starting point for future studies on the complex networks involved in microRNA-mediated gene regulation in plants. </p...|$|R

Using consumer rejection threshold (CRT) method, this study aimed to assess whether systematic changes in the taste intensities of familiar foods would lead to earlier rejection of these products by PROP tasters than by PROP non-tasters.

For each food, Ts were more sensitive to variations in tastants than NTs.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of growth cone (GC) and neurite retraction {{resulting from a}} rapid incrase in concentration of the trophic molecule NGF was studied. Neurite outgrowth from explants of 8 -d chick embryo dorsal root ganglia was achieved at very low NGF concentrations with heart conditioned medium during overnight culture. Quickly incrasing the NGF concentration in the growth medium dramatically affected GC and neurite morphology: the majority of GCs and neurites collapsed and retracted towards the cell body over a course of approximately 2 - 5 min. Retraction was elicited by increasing NGF levels from 0 to 0. 05 ng/ml to as little as 0. 5 ng/ml but did not occur if the NGF concentration during the initial overnight culture period exceeded 0. 8 ng/ml, regardless of how much the concentration was elevated. Similar concentration changes of cytochrome c or insulin <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> result in retraction. Neurites that had been separated from their cell bodies by cutting close to their exit from the explant still retracted when NGF levels were raised. Cytochalasin B reversible inhibits retraction, whereas colchicine allows retraction to occur.

However, it is still unknown whether the actions of NTs in dark-reared animals involve interaction with neurotransmitter systems.

NT treatment specifically counteracts DR effects; NGF acts primarily on the NMDA system, whereas BDNF acts primarily on the GABAergic system.
