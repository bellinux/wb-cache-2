40|$|Automated traffic <b>enforcement</b> <b>schemes,</b> {{employing}} {{speed and}} red light cameras, are increasingly used by local {{governments in the}} United States. In some schemes, traffic violations are pursued against the owners {{as well as the}} drivers of the recorded motor vehicles. Here, the mens requirements that typically accompany criminal code violations are often lacking. A form of strict liability for secondary culprits is justified because of their ability to control the primary culprits using the vehicles and because traffic accidents will be reduced. While likely to continue to anger many citizens, the surge of automated traffic <b>enforcement</b> <b>schemes</b> will also likely continue since significant deterrence of vehicle violations may follow and because significant additional revenue for local governments will follow. Many violations charged through automated schemes will be processed administratively, that is outside the judicial article courts, freeing trial court judges to handle the pressing business of civil and criminal cases and freeing prosecutors to focus on more serious offenses. Increasing numbers of vehicle owners will likely be punished for the driving of others whose bad acts were never aided, and may even have been expressly banned. There are limits to local governmental regulation of traffic violations involving secondary culprits. Besides public outcry, there are state and federal government preemption's as well as constitutional interests. The constitutional bars include property owner interests in equal protection, non-excessive fines, and due process. Notwithstanding these limits, there is much room for expanding automated traffic <b>enforcement</b> <b>schemes</b> aimed at secondary culprits. Judicial precedents suggest as well there can be expansions of non-automated traffic <b>enforcement</b> <b>schemes,</b> as well as non-traffic <b>enforcement</b> <b>schemes,</b> aimed at property owners as secondary culprits. Such non-traffic schemes today involve trash, booze, tobacco, drugs and adult entertainment. This paper will first review contemporary local regulations of secondary culprits through automated traffic <b>enforcement</b> <b>schemes.</b> It will then examine the limits on such regulations, focusing on the schemes in Knoxville, Cleveland and Chicago. Finally, it will explore potential new local governmental regulations of property owners as secondary culprits in and outside of traffic, and with and without automated enforcement...|$|R

However, enterprise security requirements are often better encoded, or can only be encoded, using role-based access control policies rather than information flow policies. In this paper, we provide an alternative formulation of role-based access control that enables us to apply existing cryptographic schemes to core and hierarchical role-based access control policies. We then show that special cases of our cryptographic <b>enforcement</b> <b>schemes</b> for role-based access control are equivalent to cryptographic <b>enforcement</b> <b>schemes</b> for temporal access control and to ciphertext-policy and key-policy attribute-based encryption schemes.

Empowerment of ad hoc wireless networks comes with carryover such as security issues, fairness and resource limitation kindles maliciousness, selfishness and misbehavior among nodes; as a result cooperation cannot be taken for granted.

This Article shows that imperfect enforcement can alter the de facto content of the written law in predictable and beneficial ways. Specifically, in the tax compliance context, even if perfect enforcement were costless, it would not always be socially optimal.

40|$|Cryptographic {{access control}} {{has been studied}} for over 30 years {{and is now a}} mature {{research}} topic. When symmetric cryptographic primitives are used, each protected resource is encrypted and only authorized users should have access to the encryption key. By treating the keys themselves as protected resources, it is possible to develop schemes in which authorized keys are derived from the keys explicitly assigned to the user's possession and publicly available information. It has been generally assumed that each user would be assigned a single key from which all other authorized keys would be derived. Recent work has challenged this assumption by developing schemes that do not require public information, the trade-off being that a user may require more than one key. However, these new schemes, which require a chain partition of the partially ordered set on which the access control policy is based, have some disadvantages. In this paper we define the notion of a tree-based cryptographic <b>enforcement</b> <b>scheme,</b> which, like chain-based schemes, requires no public information. We establish that the strong security properties of chain-based schemes are preserved by tree-based schemes, and provide an efficient construction for deriving a tree-based <b>enforcement</b> <b>scheme</b> from a given policy that minimizes the number of keys required.

40|$|We may enforce an {{information}} flow policy by encrypting a protected resource {{and ensuring that}} only users authorized by the policy are able to decrypt the resource. In most schemes in the literature that use symmetric cryptographic primitives, each user is assigned a single secret and derives decryption keys using this secret and publicly available information. Recent work has challenged this approach by developing schemes, based on a chain partition of the information flow policy, {{that do not require}} public information for key derivation, the trade-off being that a user may need to be assigned more than one secret. In general, many different chain partitions exist for the same policy and, until now, it was not known how to compute an appropriate one. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a tree partition, of which chain partitions are a special case. We show how a tree partition may be used to define a cryptographic <b>enforcement</b> <b>scheme</b> and prove that such schemes can be instantiated {{in such a way as}} to preserve the strongest security properties known for cryptographic <b>enforcement</b> <b>schemes.</b> We establish a number of results linking the amount of secret material that needs to be distributed to users with a weighted acyclic graph derived from the tree partition. These results enable us to develop efficient algorithms for deriving tree and chain partitions that minimize the amount of secret material that needs to be distributed.
