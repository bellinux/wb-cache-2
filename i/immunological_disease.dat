5000|$|Chittick {{first became}} aware of AIDS in the 1980s when media reports focused on the <b>immunological</b> <b>disease</b> that caught the world's attention. He changed his focus at Harvard to the rising risk of {{adolescents}} to AIDS {{and the need for}} more effective, age-appropriate prevention information. In his doctoral thesis, he predicted a future HIV epidemic among maturing teens that engage in unprotected sex and lack medically accurate knowledge, often because of censorship. [...] Dr. Chittick began his first AIDS speaking at the 1992 World AIDS Day Commemoration in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. He next presented original research on youth vulnerability at the 1993 National HIV/AIDS Update Conference in San Francisco. Upon completion of his doctorate in 1994, Dr. Chittick presented his research at the 10th International AIDS Society (IAS) Conference in Yokohama, Japan.|$|E

It was submitted by the TEVA Pharmaceutical Company to the FDA for approval, under the name of Copaxone, on June 14, 1995. [...] Since multiple sclerosis is an <b>immunological</b> <b>disease,</b> Cop 1 is an immunospecific drug, which is no surprise, as Arnon has focused the majority of her work in the field of immunology. It specifically aids neuroprotection and generation as well as prevents the demyelination of axons, a hallmark of diseases such as multiple sclerosis. In fact, studies by Arnon et al. have shown an increase in myelination as a result of Cop 1.

40|$|Methcathinone (ephedrone) is {{relatively}} easily accessible for abuse. Its users develop an extrapyramidal syndrome {{and it is}} not known if this is caused by methcathinone itself, by side-ingredients (manganese), or both. In the present study we aimed to clarify molecular mechanisms underlying this condition. We analyzed whole genome gene expression patterns of peripheral blood from 20 methcathinone users and 20 matched controls. Gene expression profile data was analyzed by Bayesian modelling and functional annotation. In order to verify the genechip results we performed quantitative real-time (RT) PCR in selected genes. 326 out of analyzed 28, 869 genes showed statistically significant differential expression with FDR adjusted p-values below 0. 05. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed differential expression for the most of selected genes. Functional annotation and network analysis indicated that most of the genes were related to activation <b>immunological</b> <b>disease,</b> cellular movement and cardiovascular disease gene network (enrichment score 42). As HIV and HCV infections were confounding factors, we performed additional stratification of patients. A similar functional activation of the <b>immunological</b> <b>disease</b> pathway was evident when we compared patients according to the injection status (past versus current users, balanced for HIV and HCV infection). However, this difference was not large therefore the major effect was related to the HIV status of the patients.

40|$|In {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) of healthy animals, T {{lymphocytes}} and cellular expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene products are virtually undetectable. Yet, in CNS <b>immunological</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as multiple sclerosis in humans, these constituents of the immune response must appear by some mechanism. Immunohistochemical examination of the CNS of F 1 hybrid rats following induction of graft-vs. -host disease by parental lymphocytes revealed extensive parenchymal and vascular expression of host class I and II (Ia) MHC-encoded cell surface molecules. In addition, occasional scattered T lymphocytes were detected in the CNS of these animals. F 1 hybrid rats reconstituted during the neonatal period with bone marrow cells from one parental strain also expressed increased levels of MHC antigens in the CNS. Thus, evidence is presented that the "immunological privilege" of the CNS seems to decrease or disappear during a strong systemic immune response such as graft-vs. -host disease.
