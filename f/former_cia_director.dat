In his 2011 documentary The Man Nobody Knew, Colby's son Carl suggested that his father suffered from guilt due to his actions in the CIA and committed suicide. Carl's step-mother and siblings, as well as Colby's biographer Randall Woods, criticized Carl's portrayal of William Colby, and rejected the allegation that the <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>director</b> killed himself as inconsistent with his character.|$|E
25|$|Republican Congressman Peter T. King {{charged that}} the filmmakers were given {{improper}} access to classified materials, which they denied.

Unbeknownst to Panetta, screenwriter Mark Boal was among the 1,300 present during the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Between 1993 and 2001, {{the major}} attacks or {{attempts}} against U.S. interests stemmed from militant Islamic jihad extremism {{except for the}} 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. On September 11, 2001, nearly 3,000 {{people were killed in}} New York City, Washington, D.C., and Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, during the September 11 attacks organized by 19 al-Qaeda members and largely perpetrated by Saudi nationals, sparking the War on Terror. <b>Former</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>Director</b> Michael Hayden considers homegrown terrorism to be the most dangerous threat and concern faced by American citizens today. As of July 2011, there have been 52 homegrown jihadist extremist plots or attacks in the United States since the September 11 attacks.|$|E

25|$|Ahmad Shah Massoud {{had been}} the only {{resistance}} leader able to defend vast parts of his territory against the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and the Pakistani military and was sheltering hundreds of thousands of refugees which had fled the Taliban on the territory under his control. He had been seen as the leader most likely to lead post-Taliban Afghanistan. After his assassination, Abdul Haq was seen as one of the main contenders for that position. He had private American backers which had facilitated his re-entry into Afghanistan after 9/11. But journalists reported about tensions between the CIA and Haq. <b>Former</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>director</b> George Tenet reports that, at the recommendation of one of Haq's private American lobbyists Bud McFarlane, CIA officials met with Abdul Haq in Pakistan but after assessing him urged him not to enter Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Next to the CPC, {{a second}} secret army command center, labeled Allied Clandestine Committee (ACC), {{was set up}} in 1957 on the orders of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR). This {{military}} structure provided for significant US leverage over the secret stay-behind networks in Western Europe as the SACEUR, throughout NATO's history, has traditionally been a US General who reports to the Pentagon in Washington and is based in NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium. The ACC's duties included elaborating on the directives of the network, developing its clandestine capability, and organizing bases in Britain and the United States. In wartime, it was to plan stay-behind operations in conjunction with SHAPE. According to <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>director</b> William Colby, it was 'a major program'.|$|E
500|$|Sixty letters {{asking for}} {{leniency}} for Hastert were {{submitted to the}} court ahead of sentencing, but nineteen of these letters were withdrawn after Judge Durkin {{said that he would}} not consider any letters that were not made public. Of the forty-one letters that were made public, several were from current or former members of Congress: John T. Doolittle, David Dreier, Thomas W. Ewing, and Porter Goss (who also is a <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>director).</b> The Chicago Tribune noted that DeLay and Doolittle had [...] "have had legal troubles of their own" [...] stemming from the Abramoff scandal, although DeLay's conviction in that scandal was later overturned and Doolittle was never charged. Other supporters of Hastert who wrote letters on his behalf included his family members; former Illinois Attorney General Tyrone C.

They criticized the report as [...] "a partisan attack on the agency that has done the most to protect America after the 9/11 attacks." [...] They said that the CIA's interrogation program was invaluable to the capture of al Qaeda operatives and the disruption of al Qaeda's efforts and also stated that, contrary to the Senate Intelligence Committee's findings, [...] "there is no doubt that information provided by the totality of detainees in CIA custody … was essential to bringing bin Laden to justice." [...] Additionally, they wrote that the CIA remained within the interrogation techniques authorized by the DOJ; that the CIA did not mislead the DOJ, White House or Congress; and that the threat of a [...] "'ticking time bomb' scenario" [...] context was critical to understanding the program. Additionally, they established a website to defend the actions of the CIA.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2012, Seymour Hersh {{reported}} that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009. According to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009. Hersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>directors</b> James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N.

500|$|A 1988 U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations concluded: [...] "The saga of Panama's General Manuel Antonio Noriega {{represents}} {{one of the most serious}} foreign policy failures for the United States. Throughout the 1970s and the 1980s, Noriega was able to manipulate U.S. policy toward his country, while skillfully accumulating near-absolute power in Panama. It is clear that each U.S. government agency which had a relationship with Noriega turned a blind eye to his corruption and drug dealing, even as he was emerging as a key player on behalf of the Medellín Cartel (a member of which was notorious Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar)." [...] Noriega was allowed to establish [...] "the hemisphere's first 'narcokleptocracy'". One of the large financial institutions that he was able to use to launder money was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. In the 1988 U.S. presidential election, Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis highlighted this history in a campaign commercial attacking his opponent, Vice President (and <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>Director)</b> George H. W. Bush, for his close relationship with [...] "Panamanian drug lord Noriega". Kempe argued in 1990 that the U.S. provided much of the training that allowed him to seize control of Panama, and called Noriega's relationship with the U.S. a [...] "sordid marriage of convenience".|$|E

5000|$|The three <b>former</b> <b>CIA</b> <b>directors</b> George Tenet, Porter Goss, and Michael Hayden, who had {{supervised}} the program during their tenure, {{objected to the}} Senate Report in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece, calling it poorly done and partisan. They insisted that some information derived from the CIA program was useful, specifically that interrogation techniques made some detainees compliant and that the [...] "information provided by the totality of detainees in CIA custody" [...] had led to Osama Bin Laden. According to the CIA, enhanced interrogation [...] "conditions" [...] were used for security and [...] "other valid reasons, such as {{to create an environment}} conducive to transitioning captured and resistant terrorist (sic) to detainees participating in debriefings." ...|$|R

500|$|Several former {{intelligence}} officials described the attack as emotionally distressing for the spy agency. <b>Former</b> <b>CIA</b> deputy <b>director</b> John E.

[...] Bruce Hoffman, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, characterized the assault as a serious reversal in NATO's war efforts. <b>Former</b> <b>CIA</b> Counterterrorism Chief Robert Grenier described the attack as the Taliban equivalent of a precision guided weapon.

5000|$|On 15 March 2017, <b>former</b> Acting <b>CIA</b> <b>Director</b> Michael Morell raised {{questions}} about the dossier.
