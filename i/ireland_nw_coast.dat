40|$|This work {{presents}} a teleseismic P-wave receiver function study on 34 stations deployed across Ireland {{in order to}} determine the first-order crustal properties, thickness (H) and mean crustal Vp/Vs, over the entire island. We apply the H − Vp/Vs stacking method, which exploits the information contained in both the Ps and the multiple phases from the free-surface. In this way, we obtain the first Moho depth and Vp/Vs maps of Ireland based on a uniform distribution of measurements. The results are used to examine in detail the lateral variation of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio across the major terrane boundaries in Ireland. Our results show a good agreement with the available previous estimates from onshore wide-angle/refraction experiments and add new information in poorly constrained areas such as Northern <b>Ireland</b> and the <b>NW</b> <b>coast</b> of <b>Ireland.</b> The mean Vp/Vs ratio is 1. 73 ± 0. 05 with a consistently low (≈ 1. 70) value in the Leinster domain and in central Ireland. The mean crustal thickness is 30. 9 ± 2. 3 km. The southern portion of the island shows a nearly flat Moho at a depth of 32 – 33 km, while north of the Southern Uplands Fault, a relatively higher spatial frequency variation in Moho topography exists with values ranging from 28 to 32 km. This reflects the complex history of multiphase terranes accretion during the Caledonian orogeny, althoug...|$|R

40|$|In November 2002, {{the tanker}} 'Prestige' {{released}} about 19, 000 tonnes {{of a heavy}} fuel oil (no. 6) before sinking with about 58, 000 tonnes of its cargo, 135 miles from Cabo Finisterra (Spain). A considerable part of the released fuel oil reached the Galician coast, causing a heavy black tide and an ecological disaster. Although the black tide did not reach the <b>NW</b> <b>coast</b> of Portugal, {{it is possible that}} some of the fuel oil or its components also arrived to this area directly through the sea water and/or indirectly through the food chain. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate possible changes in two widely used biomarkers, the activity of the enzymes cholinesterases (ChE) and glutathione S-transferases (GST), of three molluscs (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Nucella lapillus and Monodonta lineata) from wild populations of the <b>NW</b> Portuguese <b>coast</b> in relation to the 'Prestige' oil spill. Molluscs were collected seasonally before (autumn 2002) and after (winter 2002 / 2003), spring and summer 2003) the oil spill at several sites along the Portuguese <b>NW</b> <b>coast.</b> Enzymatic activities determined before the accident were compared with those determined at different times after the oil spill taking into consideration abiotic factors. Information from different parameters was integrated by Redundancy Analysis and Principal Response Curves (PRC). Results show that GST and ChE activities were influenced by abiotic factors. Despite this influence, the results of PRC analysis also suggest that some of the fuel oil reached the <b>NW</b> Portuguese <b>coast</b> changing the patterns of ChE and GST activities of local populations of rocky shore species. Furthermore, the present study highlights the need of long-term monitoring with wild populations to assess both historical and punctual effects of pollution in the marine environment.

40|$|Since the 1980 s over 60 % of {{eelgrass}} (Zostera marina) habitats {{have been}} lost from the Swedish <b>NW</b> <b>coast,</b> resulting in significant losses of the valuable ecosystem services provided by these habitats. The eelgrass loss has largely been attributed {{to the effects of}} eutrophication and overfishing, but coastal development could constitute an additional threat, since eelgrass often reside in shallow sheltered areas, where pressure from exploitation is high. In response to the historical losses, restoration of eelgrass ecosystems is being proposed by national agencies to assist recovery, but methods have not been available for high latitude environments, where the short growth season, ice-formation in the winter and muddy, organic-rich sediments present unique challenges for restoration. The overall aim of this thesis was to 1) develop methods suitable for large-scale restoration of eelgrass in high latitude, Scandinavian waters, 2) increase our understanding of environmental conditions that promote or impede eelgrass growth along the <b>NW</b> <b>coast</b> of Sweden and 3) assess the local and large-scale effect of shading by docks and marinas on eelgrass and identify problems with the current management, which allows for continued exploitation along the Swedish coast. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that shading from docks and marinas constitutes a significant threat to the already decimated coverage of eelgrass along the <b>NW</b> <b>coast</b> of Sweden. In total, 480 ha of eelgrass habitat was estimated to be negatively affected, corresponding to more than 7 % of the present areal coverage of eelgrass in the region. Results also show that eelgrass habitats are rarely assessed or considered within decisions for dock construction, and 80 % of applications in areas with eelgrass were approved. Furthermore, the presence of protected areas only marginally reduces the number of approved cases. In order to stop this gradual deterioration of eelgrass habitats, and to achieve both national and international goals on environmental status, {{there is a need to}} revise management practice and include a large-scale perspective when assessing the effects of small-scale development. Results from field and laboratory studies demonstrate that eelgrass shoots have a strong capacity to acclimatize when transplanted between different depth, light- and hydrodynamic exposure conditions, through adjustments in morphology, pigmentation and growth strategy. They further show that transplants have the ability to store carbohydrates at light levels down to 11 % of the surface irradiance (SI), but that light levels above 18 - 20 % of SI are needed to ensure positive growth, and that even greater levels likely are required to ensure high vegetative reproduction and winter survival at sites targeted for restoration. Results from field studies in the southern parts of the <b>NW</b> <b>coast</b> demonstrate that water quality conditions have deteriorated in many areas where large historical meadows {{have been lost}} (1 - 2 m reduction in the maximum depth distribution of eelgrass). Eelgrass recovery and restoration in these areas are presently not possibly due to sediment resuspension and bottom drifting algal mats, suggesting that a local regime shift has occurred after the loss of eelgrass. It is therefore critical that management efforts focus on the protection of the remaining eelgrass beds in these areas, since losses may be irreversible over the foreseeable future and affect the water quality negatively also in neighbouring areas. The results from these studies further demonstrate that careful site selection is imperative for successful eelgrass restoration along the Swedish <b>NW</b> <b>coast,</b> where light attenuation, sediment grain size and the presence of drifting algal mats are key variables to consider. Results from method assessments for eelgrass restoration suggest that both shoot- and seed methods can be successfully used to restore eelgrass at this latitude and that high vegetative reproduction occur in shallow areas, where shoot densities can increase with > 500 % over 2 growth seasons. In deeper areas slow vegetative reproduction, a shorter growth season and high winter losses make restoration difficult. The high losses of seeds, particularity in shallow areas, as a result of transport by currents, bioturbation and predation, make restoration with seeds inefficient. The recommended method for large-scale restoration of eelgrass along the Swedish <b>NW</b> <b>coast</b> includes transplantation of single unanchored shoots without sediment from the donor meadow...|$|R
