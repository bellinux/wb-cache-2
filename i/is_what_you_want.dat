By this point of the season, Smith had experienced success as an opener in the limited-over matches, scoring half centuries in one-day and Twenty20 matches, although his batting average in first-class matches was a disappointing 8.50 from four matches. Moores backed Smith {{to succeed in the}} long form of the game, stating [...] "We've backed Tom to do it because it balances our team and he has shown he is a very good player. I think we've seen that in the one-day stuff. I think Tom is playing well. You judge a player on how he's playing. Tom's developing and learning quickly. Technically, he stands up tall and plays up the ground which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> your openers to do".|$|E
