Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary emphysema. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> in {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation in vitro.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: PCR assay is {{a highly}} sensitive, {{specific}} and reliable diagnostic tool for the identification of pathogens in many infectious diseases. Genome sequencing Mycobacterium leprae revealed several <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> {{that could be used}} for the detection of DNA from clinical and environmental samples. The PCR sensitivity of particular <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> for specific clinical and environmental isolates has not yet been established. The present study was conducted to compare the sensitivity of RLEP, rpoT, Sod A and 16 S rRNA <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> in the detection of M. leprae in slit skin smear (SSS), blood, soil samples of leprosy patients and their surroundings. Method: Leprosy patients were classified into Paucibacillary (PB) and Multibacillary (MB) types. Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) staining method for all the SSS samples and Bacteriological Index (BI) was calculated for all patients. Standard laboratory protocol was used for DNA extraction from SSS, blood and soil samples. PCR technique was performed for the detection of M. leprae DNA from all the above-mentioned samples. Results: RLEP <b>gene</b> <b>target</b> was able to detect the presence of M. leprae in 83 % of SSS, 100 % of blood samples and in 36 % of soil samples and was noted to be the best out of all other <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> (rpoT, Sod A and 16 S rRNA). It was noted that the RLEP <b>gene</b> <b>target</b> was able to detect the highest number (53 %) of BI-negative leprosy patients amongst all the <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> used in this study. Conclusion: Amongst all the <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> used in this study, PCR positivity using RLEP <b>gene</b> <b>target</b> was the highest in all the clinical and environmental samples. Further, the RLEP <b>gene</b> <b>target</b> was able to detect 53 % of blood samples as positive in BI-negative leprosy cases indicating its future standardization and use for diagnostic purposes...|$|R
30|$|One aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the suitability of various CFPHV <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> in PCR assays for detection of CFPHV in affected tissues. To accomplish this, we tested three different <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> for the CFPHV genome, and applied primary and nested PCR assays to detect the DNA in both tumored and non-tumored tissues. The PCR technique was successful at amplifying the virus from tumors, with polymerase nested PCR performing the most consistently. All but one of the 34 CFPHV-positive tumors yielded a positive result using the nested PCR technique for the polymerase <b>gene</b> <b>target</b> (97.2 %). Our results are comparable to other studies which have described the use of nested PCR technique for polymerase <b>gene</b> <b>target</b> to detect CFPHV DNA in tumor tissues. The CFPHV DNA was detected in 100 % and 95.7 % of tumors examined from green turtles in Hawaii and Florida, respectively (Lackovich et al. 1999; Lu et al. 2000). The study reported here is an important addition to previous work because it compares three different <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> for CFPHV DNA detection. As expected, the polymerase <b>gene</b> <b>target</b> proved to be superior to the capsid maturation protease and membrane glycoprotein B <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> in the positive detection of CFPHV DNA. It is vital, however, not to overlook the utility of the alternative <b>gene</b> <b>targets.</b> The one tumor which was negative by nested PCR for polymerase was positive for CFPHV DNA by nested PCR for both capsid maturation protease and membrane glycoprotein B. So, the overall sensitivity of viral detection may be improved in future studies by the use of these additional targets.|$|R

500|$|Advances in <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> {{technologies}} which hijack the {{homologous recombination}} mechanics of cells are now {{leading to the}} development of a new wave of more accurate, [...] isogenic human disease models. These engineered human cell models are thought to more accurately reflect the genetics of human diseases than their mouse model predecessors. This is largely because mutations of interest are introduced into endogenous genes, just as they occur in the real patients, and because they are based on human genomes rather than rat genomes. Furthermore, certain technologies enable the knock-in of a particular mutation rather than just knock-outs associated with older <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> technologies.|$|E
500|$|Many {{methods for}} {{introducing}} DNA sequences into organisms to create recombinant DNA and {{genetically modified organisms}} use the process of homologous recombination. Also called <b>gene</b> <b>targeting,</b> the method is especially common in yeast and mouse genetics. The <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> method in knockout mice uses mouse embryonic stem cells to deliver artificial genetic material (mostly of therapeutic interest), which represses the target gene of the mouse by the principle of homologous recombination. The mouse thereby acts as a working model to understand {{the effects of a}} specific mammalian gene. [...] In recognition of their discovery of how homologous recombination can be used to introduce genetic modifications in mice through embryonic stem cells, Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies were awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
500|$|Homologous {{recombination}} is conserved {{across all}} three domains {{of life as}} well as viruses, suggesting that it is a nearly universal biological mechanism. [...] The discovery of genes for homologous recombination in protists—a diverse group of eukaryotic microorganisms—has been interpreted as evidence that meiosis emerged early in the evolution of eukaryotes. [...] Since their dysfunction has been strongly associated with increased susceptibility to several types of cancer, the proteins that facilitate homologous recombination are topics of active research. [...] Homologous recombination is also used in <b>gene</b> <b>targeting,</b> a technique for introducing genetic changes into target organisms. [...] For their development of this technique, Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies were awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine; Capecchi and Smithies independently discovered applications to mouse embryonic stem cells, however the highly conserved mechanisms underlying the DSB repair model, including uniform homologous integration of transformed DNA (gene therapy), were first shown in plasmid experiments by Orr-Weaver, Szostack and Rothstein. [...] Researching the plasmid-induced DSB, using γ-irradiation in the 1970s-1980s, led to later experiments using endonucleases (e.g. I-SceI) to cut chromosomes for genetic engineering of mammalian cells, where nonhomologous recombination is more frequent than in yeast.|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{our data}} {{revealed}} 13 miRNAs that may play {{important roles in}} transgenic maize plants through the dys-regulation of <b>gene</b> <b>targets.</b> These 13 miRNAs generally modulate unique <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> but co-ordinately target a few common pathways, with partially overlapping key nodal molecules, highlighting the redundancy of miRNAs and <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> that focuses on reprogramming critical pathways to facilitate transgene expression in maize cells.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility of using PharmGKB, a pharmacogenomic database, as a source of training data in combination with text of MEDLINE abstracts for a text mining approach to identification of potential <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> for pathway-driven pharmacogenomics research. We used the manually curated relations between drugs and genes in PharmGKB database to train a support vector machine predictive model and applied this model prospectively to MEDLINE abstracts. The <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> suggested by this approach were subsequently manually reviewed. Our quantitative analysis showed that a support vector machine classifiers trained on MEDLINE abstracts with single words (unigrams) used as features and PharmGKB relations used for supervision, achieve an overall sensitivity of 85 % and specificity of 69 %. The subsequent qualitative analysis showed that <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> “suggested” by the automatic classifier were not anticipated by expert reviewers but were subsequently found to be relevant to the three drugs that were investigated: carbamazepine, lamivudine and zidovudine. Our results show that this approach is not only feasible but may also find new <b>gene</b> <b>targets</b> not identifiable by other methods thus making it a valuable tool for pathway-driven pharmacogenomics research...|$|R

2500|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{combinations}} that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and — according to the goal of the experiment — an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and ES cells, diploid embryo and diploid embryo, ES cell and tetraploid embryo, diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo, ES cells and ES cells. The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for <b>gene</b> <b>targeting</b> to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for. [...] ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst. These injected blastocysts are then implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse's ES cells. This same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of ES cells and diploid embryos, diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit, to these wells ES cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage, and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse.|$|E

2500|$|The {{general methods}} for {{creating}} chimeric mice {{can be summarized}} either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins.

Chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos. ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line.
