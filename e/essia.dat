50|$|The UMFT {{worked with}} the Neo Destour. The association, which does not get its visa until 1951, {{established}} its statutes which aim to build knowledge among women, to direct them to education {{within the limits of}} morality and religion, and to promote institutions for young people and children. The permanent members of the office are Hamida Zahar (Secretary General and sister of Bchira), Tewhida Ben Sheikh, Nebiha Ben Miled, and <b>Essia</b> Ben Miled (sister of Bchira), Hassiba Ghileb, Souad Ben Mahmoud, Naima Ben Salah, Jalila Mzali, and Mongiya Ben Ezzeddine. Other women joined the UMFT as activists like Moufida Bourguiba, Wassila Ben Ammar, Radhia Haddad, and Fethia Mzali.|$|E
40|$|Thatched cottage for Teichman, Milner Street, Pretoria. Single storey 3 bedroom residence. H-shaped north facing plan. Gumpole roof construction. The cottage is {{symmetrical}} and {{a disciplined}} design, reminiscent {{of his early}} cottage designs, especially the Laurels Cottage (1930). However, this time the design {{is a series of}} “cottages” defining various pockets of spaces – almost like a small village. The notion of the house as a village is perpetuated in the later Greenwood Village, but reappears amongst others, more informally in the house and studio for <b>Essias</b> Bosch in Witrivier.

40|$|Photographs {{taken by}} Morne Pienaar of the Studio and House <b>Essias</b> Bosch on July 13, 2007. The house and studio sit very comfortably on the site. Forms and layout are more {{informal}} and simple, while {{reminiscent of the}} Greenwood House of earlier where circular and rectangular forms are combined. A granary-like structure holds the water tanks for the studio, while the kitchen yard for the house has now {{been transformed into a}} circular “kitchen kraal”. The living room is positioned so as {{to make the most of}} the beautiful views toward the north. Due to the tight budget, gum pole roof construction was used together with bagged brick textures. The tower, with monkey heads, reminds of east African Aksumite architectural traditions. A very humble dwelling. Camera model SP- 3000. Photograph 01 : An interior. Photograph 04 : An exterior.

40|$|New pottery {{studio and}} {{dwelling}} for Mr. <b>Essias</b> Bosch on kopje site outside White River, Mpumalanga. A note on this drawing reads “refer to my letter to Valerie dated 15. 3. 61 ”. The house and studio sit very comfortably on the site. Forms and layout are more informal and simple, while {{reminiscent of the}} Greenwood House of earlier where circular and rectangular forms are combined. Sequences of spaces are contained, and held together in the overall layout. Note the articulation of transitional spaces between different forms. A granary-like form holds the water tanks for the studio, while the kitchen yard for the house has now {{been transformed into a}} circular “kitchen kraal”. The living room is positioned so as {{to make the most of}} the beautiful views toward the north. Due to the tight budget, gum pole construction was used together with bagged brick textures. The tower, with monkey heads, reminds of east African Aksumite architectural traditions. The house and studio were not built exactly to the plans – perhaps because of the rock bank on the site.

30|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} is {{of significant}} concern for industrial yeast fermentation (Bischoff et al. 2007) as it decreases the available levels of carbohydrate and nutrients (Muthaiyan et al. 2011; Nwobi et al. 2015), leading to lower product yields {{and production of}} unwanted organic acids that may inhibit yeast growth, e.g. lactic acid (De Oliva-Neto and Yokoya 1998; Makanjuola et al. 1992; Leja and Broda 2009; Muthaiyan et al. 2011). Among the bacterial contaminants in industrial yeast fermentation, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are the most prominent (<b>Essia</b> Ngang et al. 1990). The major LAB species, responsible for contamination, are Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., and Lactococci spp. (Schell et al. 2007).|$|E

The aims {{of this study were}} to determine the frequency of Brugada-type ECG pattern and ERP in Tunisia and to evaluate ECG descriptors of ventricular repolarization in a population of athletes. Methods: Over a 2 -year period, resting 12 -lead ECG recordings were analyzed from athletes (n = 540; 348 males; age 18. 3 &plusmn; 2. 4 years). Brugada-type ECG pattern was defined as Type 1, 2, or 3, and ERP was characterized by an elevation of the J point in the inferior and/or lateral leads. The population was divided into three groups of athletes: ERP group; Brugada-type ECG pattern group; and control group, with neither ERP nor Brugada ECG pattern. Clinical and electrocardiographic parameters were compared among the study groups. Results: Nine subjects (1. 66 %) had a Brugada-type ECG pattern. None of them had the coved-type, 3 (0. 6 %) had the Type 2, and 6 (1. 1 %) had the Type 3. All subjects were asymptomatic. A Brugada-type ECG pattern was observed in seven males. No female had the Type 2 Brugada ECG pattern. ECG parameters were similar among Brugada-type ECG pattern and control athletes. ERP (119 subjects, 22 %) was obtained in 98 males. Heart rate was lower, the QRS duration shorter and QT and Tpeak&ndash;Tend intervals were longer in ERP than control groups. Conclusion: The results indicate that the frequency of the Brugada-type ECG pattern and ERP were respectively 1. 66 % and 22. 00 % in athletes, being more prevalent in males. The ERP group experienced shorter QRS duration and longer Tpeak&ndash;Tend interval than in the control population. Keywords: J wave, ERP athletes, T wav...|$|E
