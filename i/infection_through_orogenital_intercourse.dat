40|$|Between October 1984 and May 1986, 746 {{homosexual}} men, {{living in}} and around Amsterdam, The Netherlands, were surveyed at three consecutive six months periods regarding their sexual behavior. At {{the start of the}} study all subjects, of whom 234 (31 per cent) were HIV-Ab seropositive, were informed about their HIV antibody status. Seropositives initially reported more sexual partners than seronegatives; they also showed a greater {{reduction in the number of}} sexual partners and the number of partners with whom all forms of sexual practices were performed than did seronegatives. In both groups subjects were more likely to terminate <b>orogenital</b> <b>intercourse</b> than anogenital intercourse and masturbation...|$|R
40|$|Sequential sera of 697 {{homosexual}} men, {{participating in}} a prospective study (1984 - 1986) of the risk to acquire human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS, were tested for antibodies to human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-I) by particle agglutination and immunoblotting. No intravenous drug users were included in this trial. Three men (0. 4 %) were HTLV-I antibody positive at intake and an additional 2 {{at the end of}} the observation period, resulting in an attack rate of approximately 0. 3 %. One of the 3 men with HTLV-I antibodies at intake was a Brazilian. One man had an acute HTLV-I infection after sexual intercourse with a Brazilian during holiday in Brazil. No serological cross-reactivity with HIV was observed nor a relationship with other sexually transmissible viral or bacterial infections. In contrast to HIV no relationship with anogenital intercourse was noted; both primary HTLV-I infected men practiced only <b>orogenital</b> <b>intercourse.</b> This suggests that HTLV-I was imported in the Dutch homosexual community after HIV was introduced in the Netherlands. HTLV-I appears to spread slower within the homosexual community than HIV and possibly by other route...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} role of drug using prostitutes in the heterosexual transmission of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV), 117 prostitutes, recruited from December 1985 to November 1987 at a weekly evening sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic for drug using prostitutes only, were studied for the prevalence of HIV and STD. Intravenous drug use was reported by 96 (82 %) of the women. Antibody to HIV was found in 35 / 117 (30 %) women, {{all but one of}} whom had been using drugs intravenously. Most (73, 62 %) of the prostitutes reported having had more than 2000 clients each in the preceding five years. In the six months preceding enrollment to the study they had practised mainly vaginal (106 / 117) and orogenital (82 / 117) intercourse; 90 % (105 / 117) reported frequent use of condoms in vaginal intercourse and 65 % (68 / 105) in <b>orogenital</b> <b>intercourse.</b> Despite frequent condom use, 81 % (84 / 104) contracted one or more STD in this period. Considering the high incidence of HIV and STD and the finding by others that the presence of STD may facilitate transmission of HIV, we conclude that the potential for HIV transmission from these prostitutes to their clients (and vice versa) was clearly present...|$|R
40|$|In December 1985 {{we started}} {{a study to}} {{determine}} the prevalence and risk factors of HIV infection among drug users and drug-using prostitutes in Amsterdam. Recruitment took place at methadone posts (not drug-free; i. e. a low-threshold programme on which some drug users continue to use hard drugs, but at a lower level) and the weekly evening sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic for drug-addicted prostitutes. Three hundred and ten drug users have so far been tested and interviewed. Eighty-one per cent reported intravenous drug use; 83 % of the 166 females and 15 % of the 144 men reported prostitution. Female prostitutes practised mainly vaginal and <b>orogenital</b> <b>intercourse</b> and reported frequent use of condoms (89 % of vaginal and 64 % of orogenital contact). Male prostitutes practised mainly orogenital and manual contact. At entry 88 of the 310 (28 %) were HIV-antibody-seropositive; 85 of these 88 were intravenous drug users and three were male homosexuals. HIV-antigen was detected in two seropositive and one seronegative intravenous drug-user. Antibodies to HTLV-I were found in four out of 308. Risk factors independently associated with HIV-antibody seropositivity among intravenous drug users were: frequency of borrowing used needle or syringe, date of first intravenous drug use, recent intravenous drug use, time living in Amsterdam and German nationality. Of medical history data, an attack of herpes zoster in the previous 5 years had the greatest value in the prediction {{of the presence of}} HIV antibodies (relative risk 20. 90; 95 % confidence interval 2. 41 - 167. 27).

40|$|Background The {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} risk of HIV transmission from <b>orogenital</b> <b>intercourse</b> (OI). Methods Systematic review of the literature on HIV- 1 infectiousness through OI conducted according to MOOSE guidelines for reviews of observational studies. The PubMed database and bibliographies of relevant articles were searched to July 2007. Results Of the titles, 56 214 were searched from which 10 potentially appropriate studies were identified; two additional studies were identified through bibliographies and one through discussion with experts. There were 10 included studies, providing estimates of transmission probabilities per-partner (n = 5), incidence per-partner (n = 3), per-study participant (n = 3, following initially seronegative individuals whose partners are of unknown serostatus) and per-act (n = 3). Only four of 10 studies reported non-zero estimates: two per-partner estimates (20 %, 95 % CI: 6 – 51, n = 10 and a model-based estimate, 1 %, range 0. 85 – 2. 3 %), one per-study participant estimate (0. 37 %, 95 % CI: 0. 10 – 1. 34 %) and one per-act estimate (0. 04 %, 95 % CI: 0. 01 – 0. 17 %). Upper bounds for the 95 % CI for zero estimates tended to be relatively large due to the small study sample sizes: 9. 0, 12. 1 and 2. 8 % for per-partner; 4. 7, 9. 6 and 1. 8 per 100 person-years for incidence per-partner; 4. 4 % per-study participant and 0. 45 and 0. 02 % for per-act. Given the small number of studies, a meta-analysis was not considered appropriate. Conclusions There are currently insufficient data to estimate precisely the risk from OI exposure. The low risk of transmission evident from identified studies means that more and larger studies would be required to provide sufficient evidence to derive more precise estimates...|$|R

40|$|A {{diabetic}} foot {{infection is}} usually {{the result of a}} pre-existing foot ulceration and {{is the leading cause of}} lower extremity amputation in patients with diabetes. It is widely accepted that diabetic foot infections may be challenging to treat for several reasons. The devastating effects of hyperglycemia on host defense, ischemia, multi-drug resistant bacteria and spreading of <b>infection</b> <b>through</b> the foot may complicate the course of diabetic foot infections. Understanding the ways in which <b>infections</b> spread <b>through</b> the diabetic foot is a pivotal factor in order to decide the best approach for the patient&#x 0027;s treatment. The ways in which infections spread can be explained by the anatomical division of the foot into compartments, the tendons included in the compartments, the initial location of the point of entry of the infection and the type of infection that the patient has.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} disease resistance genes to control the transmission of <b>infection</b> <b>through</b> an animal population. Transmission is summarised by R 0, the basic reproductive ratio of a pathogen.

Suppose there is a resistance allele, such that transmission of <b>infection</b> <b>through</b> a population homozygous for this allele will be R 02 1 and R 02 1 {{the probability of a}} minor and major epidemics are 1 /(R 0 + 1) and (R 0 - 1) /(R 0 + 1).
