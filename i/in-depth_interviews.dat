25|$|Throughout its run as an {{independent}} station, The 10 o'clock News was the only news program on KTVU. The station first began programming news outside its established 10:00p.m. slot in September 1986, when it debuted 2 at Noon. Originally anchored by Barbara Simpson and Bob MacKenzie, the hour-long midday news-talk program—which replaced syndicated game shows in the noon time slot—featured a hybrid of <b>in-depth</b> <b>interviews</b> and various lifestyle features, preceded by a news summary during the first half-hour. The program was reformatted into a more traditional newscast in 1990, as The Noon News, at which time it was shortened to a half-hour (the newscast would eventually revert to an hour on April 7, 2016). In September 1989, the station debuted a half-hour 6:00p.m. newscast, The 6:00 News, which lasted until its cancellation in 1991.|$|E
25|$|He {{was hired}} by NBC News' Washington bureau the {{following}} year and became bureau chief by 1989. Russert assumed the job of host of the Sunday morning program Meet the Press in 1991, and would become the longest-serving host of the program. Its name was changed to Meet the Press with Tim Russert, and, at his suggestion, went to an hour-long format in 1992. The show also shifted to a greater focus on <b>in-depth</b> <b>interviews</b> with high-profile guests, where Russert was known especially for his extensive preparatory research and cross-examining style. One approach he developed was to find old quotes or video clips that were inconsistent with guests' more recent statements, present them on-air to his guests and then ask them to clarify their positions. With Russert as host the show became increasingly popular, receiving more than four million viewers per week, and it was {{recognized as one of}} the most important sources of political news. Time magazine named Russert one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2008, and Russert often moderated political campaign debates.|$|E

500|$|Marable {{studied the}} Autobiography {{manuscript}} [...] "raw materials" [...] archived by Haley's biographer, Anne Romaine, and described a critical {{element of the}} collaboration, Haley's writing tactic to capture the voice of his subject accurately, a disjoint system of data mining that included notes on scrap paper, <b>in-depth</b> <b>interviews,</b> and long [...] "free style" [...] discussions. Marable writes, [...] "Malcolm also {{had a habit of}} scribbling notes to himself as he spoke." [...] Haley would secretly [...] "pocket these sketchy notes" [...] and reassemble them in a sub rosa attempt to integrate Malcolm X's [...] "subconscious reflections" [...] into the [...] "workable narrative". This is an example of Haley asserting authorial agency during the writing of the Autobiography, indicating that their relationship was fraught with minor power struggles. Wideman and Rampersad agree with Marable's description of Haley's book-writing process.|$|E
