40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{interpret}} the negative <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomaly</b> of the Western Caribbean Sea {{on the basis of the}} new criterion used by professor M. Ewing et al. in their interpretation of the island arc in Pto. Rico area. The proposed interpretation is a departure from the previous one generally accepted, which was based on the tectogene theory of professor H. H. Hess. In other words, the negative anomaly is attributed here to the sediments' thickenning and possible geosynclinal structure, rather than to deeper tectogenic deformation involving sial and sima. A geomorphologic interpretation of the Caribbean continental shelf is offered on this basis.   The interpretation is locally based on correlation of the <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomaly</b> values (pendulum) with surface gravimetric values (gravity meter) in the Colombian coastal area (near Barranquilla), as compiled by the International Geophysical Year's Colombian Gravity Committee, and general stratigraphic and structural data of the Atlantic coast.   A brief account and analysis of gravimetric principles and previous gravity works and their interpretations is given, especially in connection with isostasy and the general island arc problem.

40|$|International audienceThe Algerian margin {{formed through}} back-arc {{opening of the}} Algerian basin (Mediterranean Sea) {{resulting}} from the roll-back of the Tethyan slab. Recent geophysical data acquired along the Algerian margin showed evidence of active or recent compressive deformation in the basin due to the ongoing Africa–Eurasia convergence. Published data from four wide-angle seismic profiles have allowed imaging the deep structure of the Algerian margin and its adjacent basins. In this study, we converted these velocity models into density models, then into <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomalies.</b> This allowed us to image an isostatic disequilibrium (relative to a local isostasy model) reaching a maximum amplitude at the margin toe. Converting <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> into Moho depth variations shows that the Moho extracted from wide-angle seismic data is deeper than the one predicted by a local isostasy model in the oceanic domain, and shallower than it in the continental domain. These anomalies can be interpreted by opposite flexures of two plates separated by a plate boundary located close to the margin toe. We use a finite element model to simulate the lithospheric flexure. The amplitude of the equivalent vertical Moho deflection is larger in {{the central part of}} the study area (6 – 7 km) than on the easternmost and westernmost profiles (3 km). The effective elastic thickness used to best match the computed deflection is always extremely low (always less than 10 km) and probably reflects the relatively low strength of the lithosphere close to the plate boundary. Comparison with other wide-angle seismic profiles across an active and a passive margin show that the North Algerian margin displays <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> close to that of an active margin. Finally, plate flexure is highest at the southern tip of the ocean-continent transition, possibly indicating that a former passive margin detachment is reactivated as a crustal scale reverse fault pre-dating a future subduction...|$|R

The Venezuela Basin is a broad, extensive basin with a sediment thickness in excess of 1. 5 km. At its eastern margin it exhibits small negative free air anomalies and is in approximate isostatic equilibrium. The Aves Ridge is an elevated linear volcanic prominence parallel to the Lesser Antilles characterised by positive free air anomalies. Its typical form is of two basement ridges marking its western and eastern flanks enclosing a sediment filled trough. The western ridges are shown to be more dense and less magnetic than {{the main body of the}} Aves Ridge and may represent a series of intrusive bodies.

40|$|The Wilkes Land {{margin of}} East Antarctica, {{conjugate}} {{to the southern}} Australian margin, is a non-volcanic rifted margin that formed during the Late Cretaceous. During 2000 - 01 and 2001 - 02, Geoscience Australia (GA) acquired ~ 10, 000 line km of seismic reflection, magnetic anomaly, and gravity anomaly data, on the Wilkes Land margin. Seismic reflection and sonobuoy refraction data provide the first constraints on sediment thickness and images of the deep crustal structure for {{the extent of the}} Wilkes Land margin. Two major post-rift seismic-stratigraphic sequences are recognised, separated by a regionally correlatable unconformity. The unconformity is interpreted as Early- to Middle-Eocene (~ 50 Ma). This unconformity has previously been interpreted to represent the onset of continent-wide glaciation at ~ 34 Ma. A major unconformity at the base of post-rift sediments is interpreted as a breakup unconformity, of approximately Turonian (85 - 90 Ma) age. Timing the onset of seafloor spreading using lineated magnetic anomalies within the Australia-Antarctic Basin (AAB) is extremely difficult due to uncertainties in correlating anomalies to the geomagnetic reversal time scale. Modelling indicates that the anomaly commonly correlated to Chron 34 y may, in some cases, be associated with high level intrusions and/or serpentinisation of exhumed upper-mantle peridotites. Process-oriented gravity modelling indicates that the Wilkes Land margin lithosphere is characterised by a relatively high effective elastic thickness (Te). <b>Isostatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> are most effectively reduced for models utilising Te = 30 km. Although the margin is broadly characterised by a high Te, zones of low Te are inferred from modelling. Spectral analysis of <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> indicates that the power of the flexural <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> is lower than the free air gravity anomalies. The margin {{does not appear to be}} segmented, at least in regard to its long-term strength. However, a change in initial, zero-elevation crustal thickness (Tc) is inferred from west to east. A Tc of ~ 35 km is inferred for western Wilkes Land, whereas eastern Wilkes Land is characterised by Tc = 29 to 31 km.

40|$|The free-air gravity 'edge effect' anomaly at rifted {{continental}} margins {{has generally}} been attributed to the transition between thick continental and thin oceanic crust. While crustal thinning is a major contributor, recent studies suggest that sediment loading and magmatism may significantly modify the edge effect anomaly and cause it, at some margins, to be highly segmented along their strike. In this paper, we use a combined 3 -D flexural backstripping and gravity anomaly modelling technique to determine the role that sediment loading has played in controlling the segmentation of Atlantic-type continental margins. We focus on the East Coast, USA since {{a substantial amount of}} high-quality seismic reflection and refraction, gravity, and magnetic data already exists for this margin. By calculating the gravity anomaly associated with rifting and sediment loading and iteratively comparing it to the observed free-air anomaly, we have determined the 'best-fit' elastic thickness, Te, structure of the margin. We show that 0 105 a) integrated strength of the lithosphere, these results imply that weak regions abut strong ones at the East Coast, USA margin. Te generally decreases with increase in the amounts of crustal thinning, β, and the flexed basement curvature, K, suggesting it is controlled, at least in part, by the mechanical structure of the pre-rift lithosphere and yielding due to flexural loading. However, there is considerable scatter, suggesting other factors such as along-strike changes in crustal composition. Irrespective, we show that an <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomaly</b> that takes into account the 'best-fit' Te distribution is significantly reduced in spectral power compared with one which is computed assuming only Airy compensation (i. e. Te = 0 km). This is not to imply that rifting and sediment loading completely accounts for the anomalies along-strike and across-strike the East Coast, USA margin. To the contrary, significant <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomaly</b> highs and lows persist, especially in inner and middle shelf regions.

40|$|AbstractThe Caucasian-Arabian belt {{is part of}} {{the huge}} late Cenozoic Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt formed by {{collision}} of continental plates. The belt consists of two domains: the Caucasian-Arabian Syntaxis (CAS) in the south and the EW-striking Greater Caucasus in the north. The CAS marks a zone of the indentation of the Arabian plate into the southern East European Craton. The Greater Caucasus Range is located in the south of the Eurasian plate; it was tectonically uplifted along the Main Caucasian Fault (MCF), which is, in turn, a part of a megafault extended over a great distance from the Kopetdag Mts. to the Tornquist-Teisseyre Trans-European Suture Zone. The Caucasus Mts. are bounded by the Black Sea from the west and by the Caspian Sea from the east. The SN-striking CAS is characterized by a large geophysical <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomaly</b> suggesting presence of mantle plume head. A 500  km long belt of late Cenozoic volcanism in the CAS extends from the eastern Anatolia to the Lesser and Greater Caucasus ranges. This belt hosts two different types of volcanic rocks: (1) plume-type intraplate basaltic plateaus and (2) suprasubduction-type calc-alkaline and shoshonite-latite volcanic rocks. As the CAS lacks signatures of subduction zones and is characterized by relatively shallow earthquakes (50 – 60  km), we suggest that the “suprasubduction-type” magmas were derived by interaction between mantle plume head and crustal material. Those hybrid melts were originated under conditions of collision-related deformation. During the late Cenozoic, the width of the CAS reduced to ca. 400  km due to tectonic “diffluence” of crustal material provided by the continuing Arabia-Eurasia collision...|$|E
40|$|Multi-channel seismic {{and gravity}} anomaly data {{have been used}} to {{determine}} the extent of compressional deformation along the SW Portugal rifted continental margin and place constraints on the long-term (> 1 M. a.) strength of the lithosphere. The seismic sections suggest that the region of compressional deformation is broad (~ 100 km) and has been active since the Miocene. Integration with recently compiled high-resolution bathymetric data shows that the main thrust front is located along the base of the continental slope, between north of the Gorringe Bank and the Setúbal Canyon. Gravity data show that the thrust front is associated with a narrow <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomaly</b> 'high' of up to 70 mGal that is flanked on its NW edge by a broad 'low' of up to 20 mGal. This high-low 'couple' can be explained by compressional loading of extended continental lithosphere that increased its flexural strength (or equivalent elastic thickness, Te) since rifting. Based on combined 2 -D backstripping and gravity modelling techniques we estimate a Te of ~ 10 km during the main stretching episode, in the Late Jurassic (maybe earliest Cretaceous?), and of 35 - 50 km during the Miocene to Recent compression. The existence of a broad region of deformation off SW Portugal together with a strong lithosphere have implications for the rupture models of large earthquakes in the region, such as the 1755 Great Lisbon earthquake, particularly when accounting for a complex, multiple rupture in faults which cut through lithosphere of distinct nature and origin, as appears to be required by modellers to explain the historical observational data. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the Martian dichotomy, which divides {{highlands}} from lowlands, is unknown. We examine {{a section of the}} dichotomy (50 - 90 E) defined by steep scarps and normal faults. Stratigraphy and age relationships preclude the formation of the 2. 5 km high boundary via erosion. The abrupt disappearance of topographic knobs similar to 300 - 500 km to the northeast is interpreted as a buried fault. Alignment of the buried fault with grabens, stratigraphy, and age determinations using crater counts indicate that the lowland bench is down faulted highlands crust. The estimated local strain (3. 5 %) and fault pattern are broadly consistent with gravitational relaxation of a plateau boundary. Magnetic and gravity anomalies occur {{on either side of the}} buried fault. Admittance analysis indicates isostatic compensation. Although nonunique, a model with a 10 km thick intracrustal block under the lowland bench, a 20 km thick block under the plains, and an excess density of 200 kg/m(3) provides a good fit to the <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomaly.</b> A good fit to a profile of the magnetic field perpendicular to the dichotomy is produced using uniformly polarized intracrustal blocks 10 - 20 km thick, an intensity of 6 Am/m, a field inclination of - 30 degrees, and gaps aligned with the isostatic anomalies. One interpretation is that high-density intrusions demagnetized the crust after dynamo cessation and that low-lying magnetized areas could be down faulted highlands crust. Another model (inclination of 30 degrees) has magnetized crust beneath the isostatic anomalies, separated by gaps. The gaps could result from hydrothermal alteration of the crust along fault zones...|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{data show}} that the western margin of the British Isles {{in the region of}} the Hatton Bank {{comprises}} a thin wedge of sediments, an extrusive volcanic sequence, stretched continental crust, and a thick high-velocity lower-crustal body. The sediments represent a load {{on the surface of the}} stretched crust, which should subside under their weight. The extrusive volcanic rocks defined by a seaward-dipping reflector sequence, were emplaced in the crust during the later stages of rifting. The lower-crustal body has been interpreted as underplated material which re-thickens the crust and causes uplift. Backstripping techniques have been used to evaluate the contribution of sediment loading and underplating to the observed crust and mantle structure and isolate the initial rift configuration of the margin. The contribution of these processes depends, however, on the elastic thickness, T e, of stretched lithosphere. We have constrained T e by computing the combined gravity anomaly of rifting, sedimentation and underplating and comparing it to the observed free-air gravity anomaly. Underplating gives rise to a distinct pattern of gravity anomaly 'highs' and flanking 'lows': the highs reflect the relatively dense uplifted crust and the lows less dense underplated material. The best fit between observed and calculated anomalies is for a model in which the T e of stretched lithosphere is low (< 5 km) and the width of the initial rift is narrow (< 75 km). Since T e is low, <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> at the margin would be expected to be of small-amplitude and this is indeed the case at the Hatton Bank margin. Sensitivity studies show that large-amplitude <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomalies</b> would be expected, however, if T e is high - with negative anomalies of up to 30 mGal over the underplated region and positive anomalies of up to 10 mGal in flanking regions. Such anomaly patterns are seen west of Ireland and Scotland suggesting that underplating may be a widespread feature of the British Isles margin...|$|R

40|$|Longmen Shan Mountain Belt is a {{prominent}} orogeny {{along the eastern}} margin of the Tibetan plateau. Its current deformation has significant implications for the Cenozoic tectonics of the Tibetan plateau. The M= 8 Wenchuan earthquake substantially ruptured the Longmen Shan mountain in 2008. Numerous tectonics and rheological implications are concluded by this event on crustal dynamics along the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau. Several high-resolution gravity surveys were conducted {{before and after the}} event to investigate the regional isostasy and crustal dynamics. From 2008 to 2011, four gravimetric surveys were carried out along two profiles across southern and northern Longmen Shan from the Sichuan Basin to the Songpan-Graze Terrane. The Bouguer gravity anomalies drop from - 162 mGal to - 431 mGal in the Aba Basin with a steep gradient of 0. 84 mGal/km. There is a significant increase of crustal thickness from 40 km in the Sichuan to more than 60 km in the Tibetan plateau. Negative <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomaly</b> of - 30 mGal over 150 km of the Songpan-Graze Terrane infers an over-compensation of excess crustal thickness up to 20 km. Hence, upward isostatic rebound is resulted and coupled with on-going crustal movement. Gravity values change significantly before and after the Wenchuan earthquake, ranging from - 1. 2 mGal to 0. 7 mGal near the epicentral area. Significant thrust slip of 7. 5 m and normal slip of 4. 5 m were simulated along the Beichuan fault and Wenchuan fault by an elastic dislocation theory. The co-existence of thrusting and normal faulting implies both compressional and extensional settings along Longmen Shan. The normal slip corroborates a large-scale crustal extension, lending support to a model with the inflation of lower crustal flow. The two-year post-seismic gravity variations were more than 0. 1 mGal near the epicentral area. About 25 % of them could be attributed to viscoelastic mantle relaxation. The dynamics topography along the eastern margin of the plateau is proposed to be a consequence of lower crustal flow squeezed by isostatic rebound and topographic load. The strong Yangtze Block is thought to obstruct the crustal flow horizontally and direct it to flow upward beneath Longmen Shan. The steep topography and seismicity along Longmen Shan are then resulted probably from the vertical stress induced in this upward flow. published_or_final_versionEarth SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

In other areas, such as Northern Timor and the inner (volcanic) arc, uplift is occurring where the the gravity data suggest that there should be subsidence. A possible explanation is that a contribution to the high gravity values i made by a cold, and therefore dense, subducted slab which is now sinking independently after rupture near the continental margin. Because of the rupture, the sinking slab no longer exerts a downward pull on the overlying lithosphere which has thus been freed to rebound isostatically...|$|R

The prosposed locations of these hotspots are not always associated with positive gravity anomalies. Theoretical analysis based on simplified flow models for the plumes indicates that unless the frictional viscosities are several orders of magnitude smaller than the present estimates of mantle viscosity or alternately, the vertical flows are reduced by about two orders of magnitude, the plume flow will generate implausibly high temperatures...|$|R

It has been created to establish insights in the region’s mineral potential and its past and future mining activities, and to determine parameter combinations that control the spatial-temporal distribution of the ore deposits. To contribute to the sustainability of the mining industry, environmental data are also integrated in the information system, allowing a regional scale risk assessment for old and new mining projects. The data analysis and synthesis, required to arrive at the different thematic layers, already highlight parameters that may be tentatively linked to ore deposit formation and localization. The assessment and compilation of heat flow data show a large anomalous area of high heat flow, located within the Pannonian basin, adjacent to the east Carpathians with anomalously low heat flow values. Such high contrasts in the thermal regime in the crust {{may play a role in}} the ore genesis. The compilation of multisource gravity information has returned enhanced gravity maps, Bouguer and <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomalies,</b> gravity gradients and gravity discontinuities. Linked in with the earthquake epicenter distribution, these layers contribute to a better understanding of the crustal structure, regionally with th...|$|R

The origin of the pattern of magnetization remains elusive. Correlations with gravity and geology have been examined to better understand the nature of the magnetic anomalies. In the area of the Martian dichotomy between 50 and 90 degrees E (here referred to as the Ismenius Area), we find that both the Bouguer and the <b>isostatic</b> gravity <b>anomalies</b> appear to correlate with the magnetic anomalies and a buried fault, and allow for a better constraint on the magnetized crust]...|$|R

During glacial periods, the sea level falls, and great expanses of the Sunda Shelf are exposed as a marshy plain.

In the margin area a double {{layering}} of the ice was found, with disappearing bottom reflections farther inland. High absorption of approximately 0. 3 dB / m in the lower layer and a decreasing reflectivity at the ice / sea-water interface, probably caused by bottom freezing, have been estimated. Aero-measurements were used to map the surface elevation of the ice, with an accuracy of approximately 3 m. From the plot of ice thickness against surface elevation it was possible to obtain a calibration curve for isostatic conditions. Large deviations from this plot with an ice thickness which is apparently too small (they seem to be <b>isostatic</b> <b>anomalies)</b> were found in {{the central part of the}} ice shelf. The true ice thickness could easily be calculated and mapped from these anomalies and the electromagnetically measured thickness. From the map based on flights made in 1983 - 84 the site for a bore hole was chosen in the central part of the ice shelf with an estimated ice thickness of about 450 m, instead of the less than 200 m deduced by an electromagnetic reflection (EMR) method. Hot-water drilling by the ground party of our group (H. Engelhardt and J. Determann) revealed an ice thickness of 465 m at this site...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale upper mantle {{convection}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} mechanisms to control regional geodynamic processes. Some regional geodynamic processes in the Mongolia-Baikal Rift Zone (MBRZ) are suggested to be related to the small-scale upper mantle convection beneath the area. The aim of the present work is to study the small-scale upper mantle convection beneath the MBRZ by gravity data, and to investigate its contribution to the regional dynamics. Based on the equations relating regional <b>isostatic</b> gravity <b>anomalies</b> and small-scale upper mantle convection, the convection flow field beneath the MBRZ and convection-generated stress field were investigated by using the regional <b>isostatic</b> gravity <b>anomalies</b> data. The numerical results exhibit a very complicated pattern of the mantle convection and the generated stress field, which correlates well with the regional tectonics. The mantle flow and the stress beneath the Siberia Platform and Mongolian fold belt are weak, being consistent with the current inactive tectonics in these regions. A mantle upwelling and extension stress regime is found beneath the Baikal Rift zone. The magnitude of the extension stress is low (~ 8 MPa), suggesting that the mantle convection is not the cause being responsible for the rifting of the Baikal rift. Mantle upwellings are also found beneath the Hangay Plateau, Altay and Gobi-Altai, leading to extension stress in these regions. The mantle upwellings may be the mechanism responsible for the uplift of the Hangay Plateau, and the dynamic background for defining the western boundary of the Amurian Plate. 13 page(s...|$|R
