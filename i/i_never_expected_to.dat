I saw it simply as a chance to go on holiday because my {{grandmother}} was ill at the time in Samoa. It was a chance to go back and see her on expenses as the Samoans were paying for all my flights, accommodation and living expenses. I could not have cared less about playing for them. It was a men's tournament and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rachmaninoff {{sought the}} company of fellow Russian musicians and befriended pianist Vladimir Horowitz in 1928. For Horowitz, the {{opportunity}} represented {{a dream come true}} as Rachmaninoff was [...] "the musical god of my youth ... the most unforgettable impression of my life!" [...] About the pianist's interpretation of Rachmaninoff's own third concerto, the composer said to Abram Chasins that Horowitz [...] "swallowed it whole ... he had the courage, the intensity, the daring." [...] The men remained supportive of each other's work, each making a point of attending concerts given by the other. Horowitz remained a champion of Rachmaninoff's solo works and his Piano Concerto No. 3, about which Rachmaninoff remarked publicly after 7 August 1942 performance at the Hollywood Bowl: [...] "This is the way I always dreamed my concerto should be played, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> hear it that way on Earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|With [...] "The Truth About Heaven", {{the group}} were {{initially}} unsure {{of how to}} go into the first verse. According to Decicco, Jorgensen came up with a part [...] "and he was like, 'I think this would be really cool over the verses." [...] I played it and I was like, [...] "That actually is really cool." [...] Decicco called it a riff [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> hear over it". Decicco said the group wanted [...] "Remember to Feel Real" [...] to [...] "just have it start and ... kick your ass". The pre-chorus riff was written by Jorgensen and Decicco while on tour. The bridge in [...] "Stay on the Ground" [...] features a flange effect, which was written by Decicco and played through a Line 6 Pedal. Jorgensen came up with a keyboard part, which he wrote a song around that became [...] "A Quick Little Flight".|$|E
