500|$|Undisputed Attitude was {{released}} on May 28, 1996, and peaked at number 34 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Paul Kott of AllMusic commented that [...] "Undisputed Attitude, while not perfect, is a fitting tribute to the bands that inspired Slayer to break from the traditional metal mold." [...] Sandy Masuo of Rolling Stone reasoned: [...] "some punk purists will undoubtedly cry foul, but when the dust settles it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>with</b> Slayer's mettle." [...] Entertainment Weekly Chuck Eddy dubbed Slayer's cover interpretations [...] "generic hardcore-punk", and observed that the group [...] "seem to think that playing as fast and rigidly as possible makes for harder rock -- but it's just lazy shtick." ...|$|E
500|$|Christopher Monfette of IGN {{thought that}} season one was [...] "well-written and hilariously-performed" [...] {{and that it}} was [...] "refreshing to travel through the season and watch these {{characters}} grow and evolve". Monfette gave the season a score of 8 out of 10. UGO Entertainment's Kyle Braun said that the season [...] "didn't start out as the funniest new show of 2006", but he praised the seasons progression, proclaiming [...] "now that the show has found its audience, it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>with</b> the laughs thrown down from high atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza." [...] Anna Johns of TV Squad said that she was [...] "particularly excited for the later two-thirds of the season, when Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan got into their groove and the supporting characters started getting better story lines." [...] After six episodes, NBC picked 30 Rock up for a 21 episode season on December 1, 2006.|$|E
40|$|Thad {{is a good}} man. He is old and gnarled {{like some}} dying oak tree, and about as <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> uproot and <b>argue</b> <b>with</b> as an oak tree, but Thad is a good man. The last time I saw Thad was {{in the fall of}} 1939. He stood {{at the end of the}} gravel road that leads into our hunting lodge, one bowed leg stuck up on the birch fence railing, and looked after our car. He must have been at least seventy then, for his {{thinning}} hair was white and his red beard was streaked with snow. Those blue, deep-set eyes were old, and they always crackled with fire when he was happy...|$|R
40|$|Few can <b>argue</b> <b>with</b> {{the message}} that DNA saves lives, and that message is used time and again to justify the {{continued}} bloat of DNA databases. Saving lives and solving cases are the intended outcomes {{of the creation of}} DNA databases, but even with such laudable goals, there are unintended - yet predictable - consequences. This {{is not to say that}} DNA databases are not useful. Indeed, DNA database hits have been instrumental in linking criminals to prior unsolved crimes, bringing closure to many victims and families, and one would be <b>hard</b> pressed <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>with</b> such success. The criminal justice system has told us that the privacy intrusion is just simply part of the “banquet of consequences” upon which the system feasts. With the ambitious and nearly-unfettered expansion of DNA, it is perhaps not surprising that it raises privacy concerns, and, relatedly, Fourth Amendment concerns. This article looks at privacy on the molecular level, and, in particular, an issue that is all too often given short shrift in the DNA database debate: that the collection of DNA is about more than just putting genetic material into a barcode format. Courts time and again liken DNA profiles to fingerprints or license plates, but the information gleaned from a sample is so much more. As we continue the expansion of DNA collection in this country to include more offenders and arrestees and quite possible those outside of the criminal justice system, we should consider the broader implications of warehousing our genetic material...|$|R

500|$|The Grove Book of Hollywood {{wrote that}} the 1978 film, The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and est because actress Diana Ross and writer Joel Schumacher were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard." [...] The film's producer Rob Cohen noted that: [...] "before I knew it, the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing {{who you are and}} sharing and all that. [...] I hated the script a lot. But it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>with</b> Diana because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars." [...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, saying: [...] "I will be eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by the Good Witch, played by actress Lena Horne, at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes," [...] and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Joel Schumacher's {{script for}} The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and his Erhard Seminars Training ("est") movement, as both Schumacher and Diana Ross were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard". [...] "Before I knew it," [...] said Rob Cohen, [...] "the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing {{who you are and}} sharing and all that. I hated the script a lot. But it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>with</b> [...] because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars." [...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, stating that he was [...] "eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life." [...] However, he also complained that [...] "everybody stayed exactly the way they were and went around spouting all this bull****." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by Glinda the Good Witch at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes", and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself". Although Joel Schumacher had seen the Broadway play before writing the script, none of the Broadway play's writing was incorporated into the film's.|$|E
500|$|Once Lowe {{joined the}} {{permanent}} cast, Chris' role changed into {{more of an}} authority figure concerned with integrity and efficiency, although he continued to maintain his positive attitude and personality. Schur said of this second role: [...] "He doesn’t like frayed ends or controversies [...] he wants the body politic to be as clean-running and organic as his own human body. Part of {{the design of the}} character was to give the other characters a true boss [...] an actual authority figure whose rules and regulations meant they had to toe certain lines, even while his endlessly cheery disposition made it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>with</b> him." [...] As a result, Chris Traeger changed in minor ways once he became a regular character. In his earlier episodes, Chris avoided associating himself with anything negative and constantly made Ben report bad news to people. As city manager in later episodes as a regular, however, Chris started imposing rules or changes around the office that were not popular and seemed less resistant about enforcing them. For example, Chris began to enforce his strict no-dating policy around city hall. Additionally, in the episode [...] "Jerry's Painting", Chris forcefully orders Leslie to destroy a painting when it proves to be controversial, and becomes angry with her when she tries to resist those orders.|$|E

50|$|In 1584, Giordano Bruno {{proposed}} a cosmology without firmament: an infinite universe {{in which the}} stars are actually suns with their own planetary systems. After Galileo began using a telescope to examine the sky, it became <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> that the heavens were perfect, as Aristotelian philosophy required. By 1630, the concept of solid orbs was no longer dominant.|$|R
2500|$|The Macks' bad {{business}} decisions {{finally caught up}} with them in 1954. While Roy had hoped to keep the team, Earle wanted out, and the meager attendance figures were <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>with.</b> The A's business plan required attendance of 550,000 to break even. [...] However, in 1954 they drew just 305,000. An embarrassing [...] "Save the A's" [...] committee formed to help, and it published the daily figure of turnout needed {{to stay out of the}} red, but the turnstile count remained flat while the published number grew each day and the committee collapsed in the stretch run. Even Mayor Joe Clark hurt the effort: he admitted he was a Phillies fan. The A's finished 1954 dead last in the majors, 60 games out of first; their final game at Shibe drew only 1,715 fans.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the group's successes, {{there has}} been {{criticism}} of PETA from both the conservative and radical ends of the animal rights movement. Michael Specter writes that it provides for {{groups such as the}} Humane Society of the United States the same dynamic that Malcolm X provided for Martin Luther King, or Andrea Dworkin for Gloria Steinem—someone radical to alienate the mainstream and make moderate voices more appealing. The failure to condemn the Animal Liberation Front triggers complaints from the conservatives, while the more radical activists say the group has lost touch with its grassroots, is soft on the idea of animal rights, and that it should stop the media stunts, the pie-throwing, and the use of nudity. [...] "It's hard enough trying to get people to take animal rights seriously without PETA out there acting like a bunch of jerks," [...] one activist told writer Norm Phelps. However, Phelps continued: [...] "But it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>with</b> success, and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world, in terms of both membership and spreading the animal rights message to the public at large." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{group has}} been the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading {{exporters}} of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough—law professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls [...] "the new welfarists," [...] arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told Salon in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives."What I say to myself all the time is that we have our heads in the clouds looking for Utopia, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground dealing with reality. We make no bones about the fact that we want an end to all cruelty to animals. But I think the meat industry and the leather industry and the experimenters understand, especially if we're fighting them, that we will back off if they move society and their industry a step forward. We're not going to stop everything overnight, so while we work for the ideal we certainly wish to provide the carrot-and-stick incentives to move along toward that goal."Animals are going to die by the millions today in all sorts of ugly ways for all sorts of ridiculous, insupportable reasons. If one animal who is lying in a battery egg farm cage could have the extra room to stretch her wing today because of something you've done, I think she would choose to have that happen." [...] There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, [...] "Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it." [...] Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, [...] "t's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> <b>with</b> success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world." [...] Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be [...] "press sluts." [...] She argues, [...] "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves." [...] PETA has also faced criticism for it's targeting of children, such as distributing comic books entitled Your Mommy Kills Animals.|$|E
