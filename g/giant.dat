5|$|A recent {{modification}} of the Nice model has the Solar System begin with five <b>giant</b> planets, including an additional ice <b>giant,</b> in a chain of mean-motion resonances. About 400 million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System the resonance chain is broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice <b>giant</b> encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and after a series of encounters is ejected from the Solar System. The remaining planets then continue their migration until the planetesimal disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.|$|E

5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed {{regularly}} and the <b>giant</b> is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms to graze the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, coupled with a wet spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the <b>giant,</b> with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas <b>Giant,</b> identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E

5|$|Adult <b>giant</b> otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on <b>giant</b> otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the <b>giant</b> otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a <b>giant</b> otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E

5|$|All lemurs, {{particularly}} the smaller species, {{are affected by}} predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs, despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native euplerids, such as the fossa, feral cats, domestic dogs, snakes, diurnal birds of prey, owls, and crocodiles. Extinct <b>giant</b> eagles, including one or two species from the genus Aquila and the <b>giant</b> Malagasy crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus mahery), {{as well as the}} <b>giant</b> fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including the <b>giant</b> subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than they are today. Today, predator size only restricts owls to the smaller lemurs, usually 100g (3.5oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey, such as the Madagascan harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) and the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus).|$|E

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} <b>giant</b> planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a <b>giant</b> planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of <b>giant</b> planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{recognition}} {{of more than one}} species, differences in population density were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near Ambanja. Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's <b>giant</b> mouse lemur was found in lower densities than the northern <b>giant</b> mouse lemur. The former range between 30 and 210individuals per square kilometer (250acres), with lower densities in open areas of the forest, while the latter has been recorded with 385 to 1,086individuals per km2. However, {{in the case of the}} northern <b>giant</b> mouse lemur, populations were found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of introduced cashew and mango help sustain these higher populations.|$|E
