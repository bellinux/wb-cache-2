Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.|$|E

This thesis explores how to organize a learning process in which early stage elementary school children can actively engage in music with their creativity in full use. Specifically we propose a leaning method consisting of Playing, Searching, and Creating. Playing should include rediscovering a variety of sounds; Searching should be seeking for sounds that the child think are appropriate for expressing what <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> feels; Creating <b>should</b> be the last stage of developing and organizing the sounds the child has ” discovered. ...|$|R

In this bold and controversial book, Hakim explores the applications and significance of erotic capital, challenging the disapproval meted out to women and men who use sex appeal to get ahead in life. Social scientists have paid little serious attention to these modes of personal empowerment, despite overwhelming evidence of their importance. In Erotic Capital, Hakim marshals a trove of research to show that rather than degrading those who employ it, erotic capital represents a powerful and potentially equalizing tool—one that we scorn only to our own detriment...|$|R

40|$|Many {{settlement}} agreements in lawsuits involving either multiple plaintiffs or multiple defendants include so-called "most-favored-nation" clauses. If a defendant facing multiple claims, for example, settles with some plaintiffs early and settles with additional plaintiffs later {{for a greater}} amount, then the early settlers will receive the more favorable terms as well. These MFN provisions have been prominent in the recent MP 3. com case, as well as tobacco litigation, class actions, and many antitrust lawsuits. This paper considers a defendant who is facing {{a large group of}} heterogeneous plaintiffs. Each plaintiff has private information about the (expected) award that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> will receive <b>should</b> the case go to trial. MFN clauses are valuable because they commit the defendant not to raise his offer over time. This has two important effects. First, holding overall settlement rate fixed, MFNs encourage earlier settlement. Second, depending upon the distribution of plaintiff types, MFNs can either increase or decrease the overall settlement rate. Social welfare implications are discussed, and alternative theories, including the strategic use of MFNs to extract value from future plaintiffs, are explored...|$|R

Our preliminary analysis showed that team coordination was an important factor for success. Team diversity in terms of connectivity was a positive factor towards better performance, whereas other factors were not significant. Our study indicates that workers in CIPs are likely to benefit from collaborations, connectivity diversity, and role diversity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} the French Civil Code on the effective Serbian Law on Obligations from 1978 in respect of the cause of contract. This is an institution in respect of which the Law conspicuously departs from the Swiss Law on Obligations, which served as its prime legislative model, and follows the path designated in the French code. The author concludes that the Serbian law transcripts almost verbatim the rules of law in the French code pertaining to the cause of contract. However, its provisions are somewhat more detailed than those of the French counterpart, since it explicitly governs the impact of motives on the validity of a contract as well. Analyzing the Serbian case-law, the author concludes that motives gain legal relevance in Serbian contract law in two different ways. On the one hand, courts confirm the proposition adopted in the doctrine that in gratuitous contracts (permitted) motives pertain to the notion of cause. On the other hand, illicit, non-permitted motives make gratuitous contracts void regardless whether the other party acted in good faith or not, while they render onerous contracts void only if the other party acted in bad faith, that is, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> knew <b>or</b> <b>should</b> have known that the first party was guided by illicit motives to conclude the contract...|$|R
