Ceiling was introdu- ced by the Delors I (1988) to manage the first financial perspective and EU budget stability. Paper is focused on <b>financial</b> <b>ceiling</b> policy of the EU budget expenditures. <b>Financial</b> <b>ceiling</b> is used for the total expenditure size (with relative indicators) and for the individual expenditure headings (with absolute indicators). We designed EU budget models using the methods of <b>financial</b> <b>ceiling,</b> which reflect different total expenditures size (total expenditure ceiling within the range of 2 % EU GNI, 5 % EU GNI, 20 % EU GNI, 1 % EU GNI, and 1, 24 % EU GNI), and new heading structure for total expenditure ceiling of 1, 24 % EU GNI. We tried to design the new budgetary structure to reflect the Lisbon Strategy better than actual EU budget. We strengthened following expenditure headings: 1 a Competitiveness for growth and employment, 3 Citizenship, freedom, security and justice, and 4 EU as a global player. The growth of these headings is compensated by an expenditure decre- ase of the following headings: 2 Preservation and management of natural resources, especially the section of the market-related expenditure and direct payment, and 1 b Cohesion for growth and employment. We made comparative analysis, which compare differences between received expenditures into agriculture and structural operations at individual member states in the case of present and new (our) structure of the EU budgetary expenditures. According to the results of this analysis we can say that new budgetary structure will likely be politically unacceptable...|$|E
40|$|Burglary {{security}} for households {{has been an}} important discussion topic for societies for many generations. Law enforcers, policymakers, academics, politicians and industry practitioners all debate on the most effective means of securing homes. Although individual homeowners can determine how secure and sophisticated their home security systems may be, this is not always the case in many situations e. g. in the delivery of large scale house building. In contrast, designers and specifiers of large house building projects are responsible for the level of security of these new homes in the first instance. Some research have suggested that very simple approaches such as quality window locks, indoor lights, door locks and external lights (the WIDE approach) are sufficient in significantly reducing the possibility of burglary on households. The aim of this research is to highlight some current perceptions and practices of expert designers and specifiers in the large scale house building sector with regard to burglary security. This research uses in-depth qualitative data collected through semi-structured interviews of experienced designers and specifiers from one of the UK’s largest specialists in housing. Findings from this pilot study suggest that these experts consider many issues when making decisions on specifications. These include crime survey statistics of the location of new developments, <b>financial</b> <b>ceiling</b> of retail value of properties and the demographics of the potential tenants. More importantly, word of mouth {{plays an important role in}} how designers and specifiers understand the susceptibility of a given area to burglary. This paper encourages a pathway for additional open discussions between relevant stakeholders such as members of the Secured by Design (official police security initiative), large scale house builders, homeowners and landlords in order to further drive down the occurrences of burglaries...|$|E

On 1 June 1983, 'Pakjun 1983' brought deregulation of the banking system, and the end of the meaningless 6% official deposit rate, with a more market-based <b>financial</b> system. Credit <b>ceilings</b> were removed. Interest rates, initially 18%, remained above 15% over the period.|$|R
5000|$|As noted Black women filmmakers {{have been}} {{producing}} work {{dating back to}} the 1900s. They have produced numerous works, yet there are still eminent struggles they face. First and foremost, when it comes to money and the production funding, Black women filmmakers constantly find themselves bumping their head against a <b>financial</b> glass <b>ceiling.</b> The cost to produce a film is getting costly every year and because there has not been much support for many Black women filmmakers, it has become a constant struggle. There have been attempts to help with the funding and various sites on the internet can be found where donations are being accepted. Yvonne Welbon has taken action through her own hands and her website Sisters in Cinema has a donate tab where one can support Black women filmmakers. There are also other foundations such as the Black Women Film Network [...] where scholarships are awarded to Black women who are pursuing their career in film, screenwriting or a related areas; screenings; workshops and seminars. Their main goal is to help support black women in the making of their untold stories.|$|R

Bolton (1997, "A Theory of Trickle-Down Growth and Development," Review of Economic Studies, 59, 151 - 172) {{provide a}} model {{analyzing}} {{the effect of}} capital accumulation on income inequality. We integrate two additional features to {{a modified version of}} this model. The first one is a costly financial contract enforcement which represents the second type of credit market imperfection in addition to moral hazard. The second one is enabling wealthy agents to undertake larger investment projects relatively to other agents.

40|$|Most {{developing}} countries intervene extensively in <b>financial</b> markets, setting <b>ceilings</b> {{on interest rates}} and spreads and allocating much (often between half and all) of formal credit to"priority"uses. This study reviews interest rate controls and other repressive financial policies on investment and efficiency, and investigates such relationships using a cross section analysis of 34 countries between 1965 and 1985. The report finds a significant positive correlation between growth and interest rates {{as well as between}} efficiency and interest rates. However, it finds little relationship between interest rates and investment levelsand no relationship between interest rates and the current account. The evidence found supports the need for liberalizing financial markets or at least supports measures against severe financial repression. That {{is not to say that}} abrupt liberalization is desirable or that certain interventions in financial markets may not be beneficial [...] at least until measures to improve information, supervision, regulation, and macrostability have become effective.

40|$|This paper {{builds a}} multiperiod, general {{equilibrium}} framework for analyzing the macroeconomic effects of financial reforms {{in developing countries}} {{and the costs of}} maintaining official safety nets under the financial system during such reforms. While a financial liberalization yields efficiency gains, adverse macroeconomic effects can arise if the creditworthiness of the nonfinancial sector is weak. In this situation, financial liberalization may also increase the authorities’ expected deposit insurance funding obligations even with strong prudential supervision. Moreover, given the distortions in a repressed financial system, an increase in the required bank capital-asset ratio may increase the funding obligations associated with deposit insurance, particularly when the debt-servicing capacity of nonfinancial firms is low.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{investment in}} infrastructure, {{in the early}} 1990 s Chile's government introduced private capital into the transport infrastructure sector, covering roads and highways, bridges, tunnels, and airports. The chosen mechanism: a concession scheme through which private firms would finance and build a given project and then operate the infrastructure {{for a set of}} number of years, recovering their investment by collecting tolls from users. Among the lessons learned from the experience: 1) As much as possible, avoid concessioning roads for which there are convenient alternative freeways nearby. 2) Choose the right variable for awarding a concession. Avoid mechanisms that (by promoting large payments to the state or short-term concession periods) encourage high tolls, and if you choose to award a concession to the firm charging the lowest tolls, place a floor and ceiling on possible bids. The floor is to guarantee the concession's <b>financial</b> viability; the <b>ceiling</b> is to prevent inefficient traffic diversions. Ties at either end should be resolved by a second variable, such as the level of transfers {{between the state and the}} firm. 3) Allow downward toll flexibility so that the concessionaire can react to unexpectedly low traffic flows, especially for certain types of vehicles. 4) Pay special attention to the tendering mechanism and to the general incentive structure. There are limits to the pure least-present-value-of-revenue (LPVR) auction, but income guarantees do enhance liquidity. In fact, a minimum-income guarantee through an LPVR auction is an instrument for credit enhancement, not income support. Alternatively, some form of financial innovation should be encouraged to make debt service commitments more flexible. 5) If concessions are tendered by traditional methods and income guarantees will be given, cover only a fraction of the concessionaire's expected income stream, to reduce the state's financial exposure and to improve the incentives to the concessionaire. 6) Make the contracts as complete as possible but allow for later modifications or renegotiations, and include a well-designed dispute resolution mechanism.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for examining the process of financial market development. The framework, consistent with the functional view of financial system design, is anchored in studying the incentives facing the key players in financial markets-borrowers, lenders, liquidity providers, and regulators-whose actions determine whether and how markets develop. While different financial instruments embody different concessions by borrowers and lenders, the framework emphasizes the two main compromises: the tradeoffs between maturity and collateral, and between seniority and control. The framework is {{used to analyze the}} sequencing of financial market development.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the origins of banking crises in sub-Saharan Africa, drawing upon the {{experience}} of ten countries during the period 1985 - 95. It examines, in particular, which factors were the most important sources of these crises. The conclusions underscore that the banking crises examined did not represent an entirely special case-a number of factors identified in the general literature, including macroeconomic shocks, were highly relevant-but note that several of their features were nonetheless specific to this part of the world. These banking crises were the very prototype of endemic crises associated with heavy government intervention in the banking system. In this regard, the paper analyzes the complex role of the government in banking in sub-Saharan Africa, the many channels through which governments intervened, and the economic and institutional environment in which the banks operated.
