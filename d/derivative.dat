40|$|This paper {{presents}} international {{evidence on}} the use of financial <b>derivatives</b> for a sample of 7, 292 non-financial firms from 48 countries including the United States. Across all countries, 59. 8 % of the firms use <b>derivatives</b> in general, while 43. 6 % use currency <b>derivatives,</b> 32. 5 % interest rate <b>derivatives,</b> and only 10. 0 % commodity price <b>derivatives.</b> Firmspecific factors associated with <b>derivatives</b> use are very similar across different countries. Some factors are associated only with specific types of <b>derivatives.</b> The size of the local <b>derivatives</b> market is an important factor determining <b>derivatives</b> use. Other countryspecific factors are not consistently significant. Together these results show that a wide range of factors likely determine the use of <b>derivatives</b> by non-financial firms thus explaining the mixed results from studies examining primarily U. S. firms. However, some of the results are unambiguously counter to theoretical predictions. Finally, we examine whether <b>derivatives</b> use is associated with higher firm value. We find positive valuation effects primarily for firms using interest rate <b>derivatives.</b> <b>Derivatives,</b> corporate finance, risk management, hedging, international finance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract/ Modern Types of <b>Derivatives</b> and its Reflection in the Positive Law The {{purpose of}} my thesis {{is to provide}} an {{introduction}} to modern types of <b>derivatives</b> and analyze its regulation in the positive law of the Czech Republic. The reason for my research is an absence of literature on modern types of <b>derivatives</b> in the Czech language, {{as well as the}} fact that the legal nature of <b>derivatives</b> remains still unclear. The thesis is composed of four chapters. Chapter One provides an introduction into <b>derivatives</b> in general. It deals with the notion of <b>derivatives</b> and classifies them as an innovative instrument of the capital market. It also tries to analyze various definitions of <b>derivatives,</b> and although it concludes that there is no ideal, all-encompassing definition of <b>derivatives,</b> existing definitions usually give fairly good idea about what the <b>derivatives</b> are. Chapter One further deals with the regulation of <b>derivatives</b> in the Czech law (importantly, its tries to rebut an opinion that <b>derivatives</b> fall under the regulation of hazardous activities), it focuses on economic function of <b>derivatives</b> (namely hedging and speculation), it explains and justifies the division of <b>derivatives</b> into "classic" and "modern" or "exotic" <b>derivatives,</b> and finally it describes the main types of classic <b>derivatives</b> and its [...] ...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the <b>derivative</b> concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C. The {{notion of the}} <b>derivative</b> of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex <b>derivative</b> only exists if the real <b>derivative</b> is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E

For this reason, the market infrastructures supporting the trading, clearing and settling of <b>derivatives</b> transactions, in particular trade repositories and central counterparties, play an important role in contributing to the transparency, the safety and the efficiency of <b>derivatives</b> markets.
