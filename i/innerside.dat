60|$|The end of {{the upper}} wings terminates in a fine point, just as the leaves of many {{tropical}} shrubs and trees are pointed, while the lower wings are somewhat more obtuse, and are lengthened out into a short thick tail. Between these two points there runs a dark curved line exactly representing the midrib of a leaf, and from this radiate on each side a few oblique marks which well imitate the lateral veins. These marks are more clearly seen on the outer portion of {{the base of the}} wings, and on the <b>innerside</b> towards the middle and apex, and they are produced by striae and markings which are very common in allied species, but which are here modified and strengthened so as to imitate more exactly the venation of a leaf. The tint of the undersurface varies much, but it is always some ashy brown or reddish colour, which matches with those of dead leaves. The habit of the species is always to rest on a twig and among dead or dry leaves, and in this position with the wings closely pressed together, their outline is exactly that of a moderately-sized leaf, slightly curved or shrivelled. The tail of the hind wings forms a perfect stalk, and touches the stick while the insect is supported by the middle pair of legs, which are not noticed among the twigs and fibres that surround it. The head and antennae are drawn back between the wings so as to be quite concealed, and there is a little notch hollowed out at the very base of the wings, which allows the head to be retracted sufficiently. All these varied details combine to produce a disguise that is so complete and marvellous as to astonish everyone who observes it; and the habits of the insects are such as to utilize all these peculiarities, and render them available in such a manner as to remove all doubt of the purpose of this singular case of mimicry, which is undoubtedly a protection to the insect.|$|E

The game {{is intended to be}} set on the Ringworld itself, an enormous single world discovered at the far reaches of Known Space, a ring around a sun at approximately the orbit of the Earth. It is 997,000 miles wide, about 125 Earth-diameters. The total inner surface of the ring is equal to that of 3 million Earths. The ring is spun at a speed to provide 0.992G of gravity on the <b>innerside,</b> while 20 giant shadow squares at about the orbit of Mercury occlude the Sun to provide night. It was constructed by the Pak Protectors, now mostly extinct, who had a common origin with humans. The Ringworld is home to some 30 trillion sentient inhabitants from up to 2000 hominid species. The world is described in a series of novels by Niven, Ringworld, The Ringworld Engineers, and, after the game's publication, The Ringworld Throne and Ringworld's Children.|$|E
50|$|The head-body {{length is}} usually 96.5 to 104.1 cm, but two {{collected}} specimens had lengths of 145 cm. The tail length is between 13 and 16 cm {{and the weight}} is about 20 kg.

40|$|This {{study used}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) to compare apical canal transportation in mesiobuccal canals of maxillary molars prepared with different techniques. Sixty teeth {{were assigned to}} 3 groups (n= 20), according to the technique used for root canal instrumentation: hand instrumentation with K-Flexofiles, K-Flexofiles activated by an oscillatory system and ProTaper NiTi rotary system. Pre and post-instrumentation CT images were obtained 3 mm short of the apical foramen and were superimposed to compare canal transportation. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test using the SPSS software (&# 945;= 0. 05). In the buccal direction, the manual technique produced significantly less canal transportation than the oscillatory technique (p 0. 05). In the distal and distopalatal directions, the oscillatory technique produced more canal transportation (p 0. 05). In conclusion, all techniques produced canal transportation, and the oscillatory technique produced the greatest removal of root dentin toward the <b>innerside</b> of the root curvature...|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of Triceratiaceae is {{described}} for estuarine environments of Southern Brazil. The valve of Triceratium moreirae sp. nov. is triangular with elevations bearing ocellus and a rimoportula in their basis. The valvar surface has robust pseudoloculi, circular to polygonal, each one confining a group of areolae arranged in a typical pattern. A central larger areola is surrounded by 5 - 8 smaller areolae, and they are poroidal with domed cribra. A septum emerges from the valvocopula, having the base reinforced by ribs and the margins folded to the <b>innerside</b> of the valve. The new species is compared to the closely related diatom Triceratium dubium, which has {{the same pattern of}} areolar disposition, formation of septum and pseudoloculi. The main diferences in relation to T. moreirae are: rimoportulae intercalated to ocelli and with a characteristic morphology (spinules {{on the edge of the}} external aperture), and more elongated elevations with a constriction. Some criteria used for the classification of categories into the Triceratiaceae are also discussed, and we propose that the type of areola (poroidal with cribra) be included in the circumscription of Triceratium...|$|E

This platform consists of two Full Scale Testing Modules. Each module has 9. 00 m² of floor and 3. 00 m high. The vertical envelope is formed by a double layer envelope with exterior and interior insulation. The horizontal envelope (cover) has insulation and a water proofing pre-manufactured system. The horizontal envelope (floor) has insulation outside and inside the structure as well as a radiation barrier. Data from each sensor was recorded every minute. The aim of this research is to characterize the thermal behavior of the Full Testing Modules;we are looking for thermalstability 24 hours a day. In order to do that, the first phase was to determine which of the measured variables directly affects the temperature of the <b>innerside</b> of the envelope. The obtained data was compared and showed that on a cloudy day, the global radiation does not interfere directly in the thermal behavior of the inner part. In this stage, the internal temperature of the module is directly related to the temperature inside the envelope. For a clear day we got that, the global radiation does interfere in the temperature of the innerface of the envelope, but is even more direct the relationship of the temperature inside the module with respect to the envelope temperature...|$|E

40|$|Four {{types of}} drag net models which {{differ in the}} size of the net mouth were used. The models were made in a {{reduction}} to one tenth of the original scale after Tauchi 2 ̆ 7 s comparative method. Experiments were performed in a laboratory tank of circulating water system. Current velocity were measured in and around the nets with a Thermister type currentmeter. Observations were also made on the shape of the nets in situ and the stream-lines. Results are as follows: 1. Current velocity inside the net were mostly equal to or somewhat faster than those at the mouth. As compared to the latter, slower speeds were nearly always measured close to the outersurfaces of the net in both the sides and the rear. 2. The influx of water running towards the sides of the net can be divided into two parts. The major one passes out through the meshes and is transformed into water-eddies to runalong the outerside of the net, its speed being gradually reduced, while the minor part continues to run along the <b>innerside</b> of the net and plays a role in acceleration of current velocity in the core of the net. 3. A current velocity at a given point inside the net is to be theoretically analyzed as given in the following formula: [the fomula is omitted]""where, A_ 0 is the area of the net mouth, V_ 0 the current velocity at the net mouth, A the cross area of the net at a given point inside the net, C a coefficient of the current velocity at amesh, S the total area of meshes per unit length, θ the angle of inclination of the net againstthe current direction, and V 2 ̆ 7 denotes the average current velocity outside the net. It wasfound that values calculated after the formula roughly coincide with the measurements.
