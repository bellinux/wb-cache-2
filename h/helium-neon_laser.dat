5|$|One of {{the guns}} seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol {{modified}} by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; {{because of the high}} power requirement, the <b>helium–neon</b> <b>laser</b> in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.|$|E
5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the <b>helium–neon</b> <b>laser</b> (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E

25|$|Leonard {{has been}} {{established}} {{to have been a}} child prodigy, and a gifted scientist with an impressive knowledge of theoretical physics. His work as an experimental physicist often includes the use of lasers, such as a <b>helium–neon</b> <b>laser</b> or free-electron laser, and his research topics have varied from Bose–Einstein condensates and foundations of quantum mechanics to soft cosmic rays at sea level and development of novel rocket propellants. Leonard designs experiments in order to test theories but, according to Sheldon, his work is mostly derivative and thus unimportant.|$|E
500|$|Fortunately, {{definitions}} of the SI units are quite different from their practical realizations. For instance, the metre {{is defined as the}} distance light travels in a vacuum during a time interval of [...] of a second. However, the metre's practical realization typically {{takes the form of a}} <b>helium–neon</b> <b>laser,</b> and the metre's length is delineated—not defined—as [...] wavelengths of light from this laser. Now suppose that the official measurement of the second was found to have drifted by a few parts per billion (it is actually extremely stable with a reproducibility of a few parts in 1015).|$|E
500|$|Gravity and {{the nature}} of the Kibble balance, which oscillates test masses up and down against the local {{gravitational}} acceleration g, are exploited so that mechanical power is compared against electrical power, which is the square of voltage divided by electrical resistance. However, g varies significantly—by nearly 1%—depending on where on the Earth's surface the measurement is made (see Earth's gravity). There are also slight seasonal variations in g due to changes in underground water tables, and larger semimonthly and diurnal changes due to tidal distortions in the Earth's shape caused by the Moon. Although g would not be a term in the definition of the kilogram, it would be crucial in the delineation of the kilogram when relating energy to power. Accordingly, g must be measured with at least as much precision and accuracy as are the other terms, so measurements of g must also be traceable to fundamental constants of nature. For the most precise work in mass metrology, g is measured using dropping-mass absolute gravimeters that contain an iodine-stabilized <b>helium–neon</b> <b>laser</b> interferometer. The fringe-signal, frequency-sweep output from the interferometer is measured with a rubidium atomic clock. Since this type of dropping-mass gravimeter derives its accuracy and stability from the constancy of the speed of light as well as the innate properties of helium, neon, and rubidium atoms, the 'gravity' term in the delineation of an all-electronic kilogram is also measured in terms of invariants of nature—and with very high precision. For instance, in the basement of the NIST's Gaithersburg facility in 2009, when measuring the gravity acting upon Pt10Ir test masses (which are denser, smaller, and have a slightly lower center of gravity inside the Kibble balance than stainless steel masses), the measured value was typically within 8ppb of [...]|$|E

The earliest tubes were simple quartz, followed by quartz with graphite disks. In comparison with the <b>helium-neon</b> <b>lasers</b> that require just a few milliamperes, the current used for pumping the krypton laser is several amperes, as the gas has to be ionized.

Singlemode fiber lasers with linewidths {{of a few}} kHz can have coherence lengths exceeding 100 km. Similar coherence lengths can be reached with optical frequency combs due to the narrow linewidth of each tooth. Non-zero visibility is present only for short intervals of pulses repeated after cavity length distances up to this long coherence length.|$|R

5000|$|An {{ion laser}} is a gas laser that uses an ionized gas as its lasing medium.

Unlike <b>helium-neon</b> <b>lasers,</b> the energy level transitions {{that contribute to}} laser action come from ions. Because of {{the large amount of}} energy required to excite the ionic transitions used in ion lasers, the required current is much greater, and as a result all but the smallest ion lasers are water-cooled. A small air-cooled ion laser might produce, for example, 130 mW of light with a tube current of 10 A at 105 V. This is a total power draw over 1 kW, which translates into a large amount of heat that must be dissipated.|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{shortcomings}} of in-line “Gabor ” holograms have been overcome by going to an off-axis geometry that allows the various image components to be separated, and also allowed opaque subjects to be front-illuminated.

5000|$|Depending on {{the gain}} of the medium, {{the amount of}} light the OC needs to reflect back can vary widely. <b>Helium-neon</b> <b>lasers</b> require around a 99% {{reflective}} mirror to lase, while nitrogen lasers have an extremely high gain (they are [...] "superradiant") and do not require any OC (0% reflective). The reflectivity of any OC will vary with wavelength. Metal-coated mirrors generally have good reflectivity over a wide bandwidth, but may not cover an entire portion of the spectrum. Silver has up to 99.9% reflectivity in the visual range, but is a poor reflector of ultraviolet. Aluminum does not reflect infrared well, but is a good reflector from the visual range through the near-UV, whereas gold is highly reflective to infrared light but a poor reflector of wavelengths shorter than yellow. A dielectric mirror may have a tuning range as low as a 10nm when designed for a specific wavelength, or can be designed with a wide range, spanning as much as 100nm, for tunable lasers. For this reason the spectral properties of the OC are important to consider when a laser cavity is being assembled.|$|R
