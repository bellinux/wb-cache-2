60|$|Then {{besides the}} men of the church there were {{the men of}} trade, the {{merchant}} in dusty broadcloth and Flanders hat riding at the head of his line of pack-horses. He carried Cornish tin, Welt-country wool, or Sussex iron if he traded eastward, or if his head should be turned westward then he bore with him the velvets of Genoa, the ware of Venice, the wine of France, or the armor of Italy and Spain. Pilgrims were everywhere, poor people for the most part, plodding wearily along with trailing feet and bowed <b>heads,</b> thick <b>staves</b> in their hands and bundles over their shoulders.

50|$|Strong, {{the son of}} John Strong Sr. (1798-1881), from Wroxton, Oxfordshire, England, was a first {{generation}} American born in a log cabin in Greenfield Township, Michigan, which {{is now part of}} Detroit. He received a common school education and engaged in farming. In 1863, he moved to Monroe County where he founded South Rockwood and engaged in milling, manufacturing barrel <b>staves,</b> <b>heading,</b> lumber, merchandising, farming and raising cattle. During a sawmill accident, he lost two fingers on his right hand. He married Emily Buhl, the sister of two Detroit mayors, Frederick and Christian H. Buhl. His nephew John Strong Haggerty (1866-1950) served as Michigan Secretary of State from 1927 to 1931.|$|R
6000|$|The strange [...] "vandyked" [...] crozier-like stone {{objects of}} schist or shale from Portugal were {{possibly}} armes d'apparat, or <b>heads</b> of <b>staves</b> of dignity. There is a sample in the American {{room at the}} British Museum, uninscribed. I submit that the three very curious and artistic stone axe- heads, figured by M. Cartailhac, {114} representing, one an uncouth animal; another, a hooded human head, the third an extremely pretty girl, could never {{have been used for}} practical purposes, but were armes d'apparat. Perhaps such stone armes d'apparat, or magical or sacred arms, were not unknown, as survivals, in Scotland in the Iron Age. A [...] "celt" [...] or stone axe-head of this kind, ornamented with a pattern of inter- crossing lines, is figured and described by the Rev. Mr. Mackenzie (Kenmore) in the Proceedings of the Scottish Society of Antiquaries (1900-1901, p. 310 et seq.). This axe-head, found near a cairn at Balnahannait, is of five inches long by two and a quarter broad. It is of [...] "soft micaceous stone." [...] The owners must have been acquainted {{with the use of the}} metals, Mr. Mackenzie thinks, for the stone exhibits [...] "interlaced work of a late variety of this ornamentation." [...] Mr. Mackenzie suggests that the ornament was perhaps added [...] "after the axe had obtained some kind of venerated or symbolical character." [...] This implies that a metal-working people, finding a stone axe, were puzzled by it, venerated it, and decorated it in their late style of ornament.|$|R

He left the company of angels, and {{encountered}} with the devil (Luke 4; Matt 4). He left heaven's ease for a time, to lie upon hard mountains (Luke 6:12; John 8:1). In a word, he became poorer than they that go with flail and rake; yea, than the very birds or foxes, and all to do thee good. Besides, consider a little of these unspeakable and intolerable slightings and rejections, and the manifold abuses that came from men upon him. How he was falsely accused, being a sweet, harmless, and undefiled lamb. How he was undervalued, so that a murderer was counted less worthy of condemnation than he. Besides, how they mocked him, spit on him, beat him over the <b>head</b> with <b>staves,</b> had the hair plucked from his cheeks. 'I gave {{my back to the}} smiters,' saith he, 'and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and spitting' (Isa 50:6). His head crowned with thorns, his hands pierced with nails, and his side with a spear; together with how they used him, scourged him, and so miserably misusing him, that they had even spent him in a great measure before they did crucify him; insomuch that there was another fain to carry his cross.

6000|$|Love {{knows no}} caste; else why should I, a Musalman {{and the son}} of a Musalman, have sought a Hindu woman--a widow of the Hindus--the sister of the headman of Pateera? But it was even so. They of the headman's {{household}} came on a pilgrimage to Muttra when She was but newly a bride. Silver tires were upon the wheels of the bullock-cart, and silken curtains hid the woman. Sahib, I made no haste in their conveyance, for the wind parted the curtains and I saw Her. When they returned from pilgrimage the boy that was Her husband had died, and I saw Her again in the bullock-cart. By God, these Hindus are fools! What was it to me whether She was Hindu or Jain--scavenger, leper, or whole? I would have married Her and made Her a home by the ford. The Seventh of the Nine Bars says that a man may not marry one of the idolaters? Is that truth? Both Shiahs and Sunnis say that a Musalman may not marry one of the idolaters? Is the Sahib a priest, then, that he knows so much? I will tell him something that he does not know. There is neither Shiah nor Sunni, forbidden nor idolater, in Love; and the Nine Bars are but nine little fagots that the flame of Love utterly burns away. In truth, I would have taken Her; but what could I do? The headman would have sent his men to break my <b>head</b> with <b>staves.</b> I am not--I was not--afraid of any five men; but against half a village who can prevail? ...|$|R
60|$|But, next to {{our very}} {{particular}} friends, hackney-coachmen, cabmen and cads, whom we admire {{in proportion to}} the extent of their cool impudence and perfect self-possession, there is no class of people who amuse us more than London apprentices. They are no longer an organised body, bound down by solemn compact to terrify his Majesty’s subjects whenever it pleases them to take offence in their <b>heads</b> and <b>staves</b> in their hands. They are only bound, now, by indentures, and, as to their valour, it is easily restrained by the wholesome dread of the New Police, and a perspective view of a damp station-house, terminating in a police-office and a reprimand. They are still, however, a peculiar class, and not the less pleasant for being inoffensive. Can any one fail to have noticed them in the streets on Sunday? And were there ever such harmless efforts at the grand and magnificent as the young fellows display! We walked down the Strand, a Sunday or two ago, behind a little group; and they furnished food for our amusement the whole way. They had come out of some part of the city; it was between three and four o’clock in the afternoon; and {{they were on their way}} to the Park. There were four of them, all arm-in-arm, with white kid gloves like so many bridegrooms, light trousers of unprecedented patterns, and coats for which the English language has yet no name—a kind of cross between a great-coat and a surtout, with the collar of the one, the skirts of the other, and pockets peculiar to themselves.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examined}} cask material, including cask <b>staves,</b> <b>heads,</b> hoops, bungs {{and other}} components that casks consist of, recovered from 13 eighteenth century, three nineteenth century, one seventeenth, and two sixteenth century shipwrecks {{in an effort}} to discern a pattern in the types of cask material recovered within different types of vessels (e. g. pirate, merchant, and naval). Literature reviews were conducted and numerous archaeological, anthropological, and historical journals; namely, the International Journal for Nautical Archaeology, Historical Archaeology, The Australian Journal of Historical Archaeology were consulted. Published and unpublished theses and dissertations, proceedings from maritime and historical archaeological conferences for reports on shipwrecks containing cask material, and Parks Canada and National Park Service publications were also reviewed. Cask materials were studied and compared using bar graphs, histograms, and pie charts. Several potential patterns were identified, but none were definitive. This was not because they may not exist, but rather due to the inconsistent reporting methods creating a lack of available data to conduct comparative analysis. The inconsistent nature of the data obtained influenced the need to establish a standard reporting method. The final product of this research was the introduction of a standard reporting method and associated terminology and reporting forms. While the data set was too inconsistent to make conclusive statements, this type of comparative analysis should begin to establish a framework for the interpretation of cask materials from future excavations.   M.

60|$|Ungracious as {{was this}} reception, {{if you could}} judge of the Skinner's {{feelings}} from his manner, it nevertheless delighted him. He moved with alacrity towards the city, and really {{was so happy to}} escape the brutal looks and frightful manner of his interrogator, as to lose sight of all other considerations. But the man who performed the functions of orderly in the irregular troop, rode up to the side of his commander, and commenced a close and apparently a confidential discourse with his principal. They spoke in whispers, and cast frequent and searching glances at the Skinner, until the fellow began to think himself an object of more than common attention. His satisfaction at this distinction was somewhat heightened, at observing a smile {{on the face of the}} captain, which, although it might be thought grim, certainly denoted satisfaction. This pantomime occupied the time they were passing a hollow, and concluded as they rose another hill. Here the captain and his sergeant both dismounted, and ordered the party to halt. The two partisans each took a pistol from his holster, a movement that excited no suspicion or alarm, as it was a precaution always observed, and beckoned to the peddler and the Skinner to follow. A short walk brought them to a spot where the hill overhung the river, the ground falling nearly perpendicularly to the shore. On the brow of the eminence stood a deserted and dilapidated barn. Many boards of its covering were torn from their places, and its wide doors were lying, the one in front of the building, and the other halfway down the precipice, whither the wind had cast it. Entering this desolate spot, the refugee officer very coolly took from his pocket a short pipe, which, from long use, had acquired not only the hue but the gloss of ebony, a tobacco box, and a small roll of leather, that contained steel, flint, and tinder. With this apparatus, he soon furnished his mouth with a companion that habit had long rendered necessary to reflection. So soon as a large column of smoke arose from this arrangement, the captain significantly held forth a hand towards his assistant. A small cord was produced from the pocket of the sergeant, and handed to the other. The refugee threw out vast puffs of smoke, until nearly all of his head was obscured, and looked around the building with an inquisitive eye. At length he removed the pipe, and inhaling a draft of pure air, returned it to its domicile, and proceeded at once to business. A heavy piece of timber lay across the girths of the barn, but a little way from the southern door, which opened directly upon a full view of the river, as it stretched far away towards the bay of New York. Over this beam the refugee threw one end of the rope, and, regaining it, joined the two parts in his hand. A small and weak barrel, that wanted a <b>head,</b> the <b>staves</b> of which were loose, and at one end standing apart, was left on the floor, probably as useless. The sergeant, in obedience to a look from his officer, placed it beneath the beam. All of these arrangements were made with composure, and they now seemed completed to the officer's perfect satisfaction.|$|R
