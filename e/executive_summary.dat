5|$|The <b>executive</b> <b>summary</b> of the TRC {{concluded}} that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that {{would be difficult to}} prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.|$|E

After {{completion of the}} court case, only an <b>executive</b> <b>summary</b> was released to the public. The full report was kept confidential, with only some employees of Haringey Council and Haringey councillors allowed access. The two local MPs whose constituencies cover Haringey (Lynne Featherstone and David Lammy), {{leader of the opposition}} Robert Gorrie, and opposition spokesperson for Children's Services were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements to view the document. Ed Balls condemned the serious case review and called for a second report with an independent adjudicator.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} the report was {{emphasized}} prior to its <b>executive</b> <b>summary</b> with quotations from President of the United States Barack Obama, FBI director James Comey and former United States Attorney General Eric Holder. Obama warned that with globalization came {{an increased risk of}} terrorists passing through the borders of the United States in order to cause harm to U.S. citizens. Comey wrote that terrorists who had garnered battlefield experience in Iraq and Syria posed a threat if they were able to travel to the U.S. Holder said the Syrian Civil War created a fertile bed for Islamic extremism and the U.S. needed to be alert to prevent U.S. citizens from traveling there and returning to their country of origin to commit attacks. During the course of their research for the report, members of the bipartisan task force traveled to foreign countries in order to speak with government workers and intelligence community leaders about the subject matter to gain more expertise in the area. Work for the report's publication was completed in 2015. The book was first published in paperback format by Skyhorse Publishing in 2016. An e-book edition was released the same year.|$|E

500|$|Attempts to {{assimilate}} Indigenous peoples were rooted in imperial colonialism, which centred around a European worldview of cultural practice {{and an understanding}} of land ownership based on the Doctrine of Discovery. As explained in the <b>executive</b> <b>summary</b> of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's (TRC) final report: [...] "Underlying these arguments was the belief that the colonizers were bringing civilization to savage people who could never civilize themselves. The 'civilizing mission' rested on a belief of racial and cultural superiority." ...|$|E

In addition to Nebe, the speakers included: Higher SS and Police Leader Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski; Max Montua, commander of Police Regiment Center; Hermann Fegelein, commander of the SS Cavalry Brigade; and Gustav Lombard, commander of the 1st SS Cavalry Regiment. Nebe's talk focused on the role of the SD in the common fight against [...] "partisans" [...] and [...] "plunderers". He also covered the [...] "Jewish question", with particular consideration to the anti-partisan movement. Following the conference, a 16-page <b>executive</b> <b>summary</b> was distributed to the Wehrmacht troops and police units in the rear area. There was a dramatic increase in atrocities against Jews and other civilians in the last three months of 1941.|$|E
500|$|When a {{petition}} or memo requiring the Sultan's decision {{was to be}} submitted to him, the grand vizier usually prepared an <b>executive</b> <b>summary</b> (telhis) as an attachment. In some cases, rather than prepare a separate summary document, the grand vizier or his deputy would write his summary and views diagonally, on the top or bottom margins of documents coming from lower functionaries (see an example in the first figure above). Such annotations on a written document were called derkenar. Sometimes the grand vizier would append a separate cover page {{on top of a}} proposal coming from a lower-level functionary like the Treasurer (Defterdar) or the Minister of Defence (Serasker), introducing it as, for example, [...] "this is the proposal of the Defterdar". In such cases, the Sultan would write his hatt-ı hümayun on the cover page. In other cases, the grand vizier would summarize the matter directly in the margin of the document submitted by the lower functionary and the Sultan would write on the same page as well. Sometimes the Sultan would write his decision on a fresh piece of paper attached to the submitted document.|$|E
