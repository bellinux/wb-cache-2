5|$|A notable {{physical}} {{difference between}} these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron-capture cross-section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and {{it is commonly used}} for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the cladding of their nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|E

Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>rods,</b> because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties. Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).|$|E

The effect of fuel oxidation in enhancing gas diffusion is included as a parabolic dependence of the stoichiometry excess. The increase of fission gas release in a defective BWR <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> is at the most 3 times higher than in an intact <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> because of small extent of UO{sub 2 } oxidation. The major enhancement contributor in fission gas release of UO{sub 2 +x} fuel is the increased diffusivity due to stoichiometry excess rather than the higher temperature caused by degraded fuel thermal conductivity...|$|R
40|$|The fuel {{irradiation}} and burnup causes geometrical and dimensional {{changes in}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> which affects its thermal resistance and ultimately affects the <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> behavior during steady-state and transient conditions. The consistent analysis of <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> thermal performance is essential for precise evaluation of reactor safety in operational transients and accidents. In this work, analysis of PWR <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> thermal performance is carried out under steady-state and transient conditions at different fuel burnups. The analysis is performed by using thermal hydraulic code, THEATRe. The code is modified by adding burnup dependent <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> behavior models. The original code uses as-fabricated <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> dimensions during steady-state and transient conditions which can be modified to perform more consistent reactor safety analysis. AP 1000 reactor is considered as a reference reactor for this analysis. The effect of burnup on steady-state <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> parameters has been investigated. For transient analysis, hypothetical reactivity initiated accident was simulated by considering a triangular power pulse of variable pulse height (relative to the full power reactor operating conditions) and pulse width at different fuel burnups which corresponds to fresh fuel, low and medium burnup fuels. The effect of power pulse height, pulse width and fuel burnup on <b>fuel</b> <b>rod</b> temperatures has been investigated. The results of reactivity initiated accident analysis show that the fuel failure mechanisms are different for fresh fuel and fuel at different burnup levels. The fuel failure in fresh fuel is expected due to fuel melting as fuel temperature increases with increase in pulse energy (pulse height). However, at relatively higher burnups, the fuel failure is expected due to cladding failure caused by strong pellet clad mechanical interaction, where, the contact pressure increases beyond the cladding yield strength...|$|R

The ground state of this nuclide, technetium-99, is used as a gamma-ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>rods.</b> Because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2million years (technetium-98), the 1952 detection of technetium in red giants, which are billions of years old, helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{metal and}} its alloys {{have a wide}} range of applications, where the {{corrosion}} resistance, the heat stability and the low density (light weight) are of benefit. The foremost use of corrosion-resistant hafnium and zirconium has been in nuclear reactors. Zirconium has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, zirconium (mostly as zircaloy) is used as cladding of <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> in nuclear reactors, while hafnium is used in control rods for nuclear reactors, because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> to burn out the poison.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> for nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|All {{isotopes}} between 242Cm and 248Cm, {{as well as}} 250Cm, {{undergo a}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction and thus in principle {{can act as a}} nuclear fuel in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the nuclear fission cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes 243Cm, 245Cm and 247Cm. These can be used in thermal-neutron reactors, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for fast breeder reactors since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases. The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the neutron activation of 248Cm will create californium. This is strong neutron emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the minor actinides are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> where it is the only actinide present.|$|E

These pumps needed to continuously circulate coolant water through a Generation II reactor for several days to keep the <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> from melting, as the <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> continued to generate decay heat after the SCRAM event.

25|$|During a meltdown, the {{temperature}} of the <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> increases and they can deform, in the case of Zircaloy cladding, above 700–900°C (1,292-1,652 °F). If the reactor pressure is low, the pressure inside the <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> ruptures the control rod cladding. High-pressure conditions push the cladding onto the fuel pellets, promoting formation of uranium dioxide–zirconium eutectic with a melting point of 1200–1400°C (2,192-2,552 °F). An exothermic reaction occurs between steam and zirconium, which may produce enough heat to be self-sustaining without the contribution of decay heat from radioactivity. Hydrogen is released in an amount of about 0.5m3 (17.65 cu. ft.) of hydrogen (at normal temperature/pressure) per kilogram of zircaloy oxidized. Hydrogen embrittlement may also occur in the reactor materials and volatile fission products can be released from damaged <b>fuel</b> <b>rods.</b> Between 1300 and 1500°C (2,372-2,732 °F), the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods melts, together with the evaporation of control rod cladding. At 1800°C (3,272 °F), the cladding oxides melt and begin to flow. At 2700–2800°C (4,892-5,072 °F) the uranium oxide <b>fuel</b> <b>rods</b> melt and the reactor core structure and geometry collapses. This can occur at lower temperatures if a eutectic uranium oxide-zirconium composition is formed.
