40|$|The {{mechanical}} characterization of material components in existing masonry structures {{has been the}} topic of several research studies. Most of them are currently focusing on mortar, the most difficult material component to characterize, trying to evaluate its strength. To achieve this aim, a good option is performing Minor-Destructive Testing (MDT). A novel MDT technique is investigated in this study, based on the field vane shear test for soils. The instrumentation consists in a four-winged pin (X-Drill) and a torque wrench. The testing procedure consists in inserting the pin in a mortar joint and applying a torque to the pin through the <b>dynamometric</b> <b>key.</b> The <b>dynamometric</b> <b>key</b> records {{the magnitude of the}} torque while the pin brings the material to failure. This research presents the results of an experimental campaign based on the comparison between standard tests and X-Drill measurements on different types of mortars.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of historical structures requires appropriate {{knowledge of the}} behaviour of the investigated materials. Concerning masonry, its mechanical characterisation is a challenging task, since its composite nature requires the careful evaluation of the behaviour of its material components. In particular, the experimental {{assessment of}} the strength of existing mortar in historical structures still encounters several difficulties. This study investigates a novel Minor Destructive Testing (MDT) technique virtually equivalent to the vane test used for soils. The instrumentation, called herein Torque Penetrometric Test (TPT), is composed of a steel nail with four protruding teeth and a torque wrench. The test consists in inserting the toothed nail into a mortar joint and then applying a torque by means of a <b>dynamometric</b> <b>key,</b> until reaching the failure of the material. This work presents a novel interpretation theory based on basic concepts of fracture mechanics and applied to the micro-mechanical analysis of the stress state induced by the instrument on the investigated mortar. The proposed interpretative theory is validated through the execution of experimental tests in the laboratory and in a historical masonry building. The test proves to be effective for a quick in-situ MDT evaluation {{of the strength of}} existing mortars. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} pain experience following dental implant placement {{in relation to}} insertion torque using questionnaires. A total 80 implants were placed in 20 patients. Each patient received 4 implants at different times. One implant was inserted and, then, after 40 days was placed the second implant, after 80 days was placed the third implant and after 120 days was placed the fourth implant. At each time the peri-implant bone levels were evaluated on intraoral radiographs taken with the paralleling technique. The implants were placed with a <b>dynamometric</b> <b>key</b> at 35 N, 50 N, 65 N, 85 N. Patients were asked to evaluate their pain experience during surgery, 24 hours after surgery, and at 2 days, 4 days, 1, 2, and 4 weeks after surgery on special pain assessment forms. A separate form was used for each time point. Pain was assessed using a descriptive numerical rating scale of 0 to 10, with 0 indicative of no pain and 10 representing the worst pain imaginable. Patients were instructed that a score of 1 to 3 was indicative of mild pain, 4 to 6 was indicative of moderate pain, and 7 to 10 was indicative of severe pain. A significant correlation pain scores and insertion torque was found between group III and group IV vs group II and group I during surgery, at 24 hours, 2 days, 4 days, 1 week, 2 weeks p≤ 0. 05. No statistical difference was found between group I vs. group II during surgery, at 24 hours, 2 days, 4 days, 1 week, 2 weeks p≥ 0. 05. In conclusion, elevated insertion torque values produces pain and resoption of the crestal bone around the implant...|$|E
