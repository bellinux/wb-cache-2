5|$|Ayumi is Yuu's and Shunsuke's {{energetic}} {{younger sister}} {{in junior high}} school. She has an innocent personality and deeply cares for Yuu, providing moral support to him. Ayumi often cooks for Yuu and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> add pizza sauce to every food she makes, unaware that Yuu's modern tastes cannot handle the sweetness. She {{is a fan of}} the band How-Low-Hello and an avid admirer of Yusa. She eventually awakens an ability to cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, but this is stolen by Yuu to prevent her death.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus {{that there is no}} convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, has said that the media <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} main {{accounts}} of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is Polybius, who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. Livy wrote {{in the time of}} Augustus, and Appian later still. Appian's account describes events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius. Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, functioning as a literary device such that the subsequent Roman recovery is more dramatic. For example, some argue that his casualty figures are exaggerated—"more symbolic than factual". Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> idealize. Scholars tend to discount Appian's account. The verdict of Philip Sabin—"a worthless farrago"—is typical.|$|E
5|$|Because its {{coloration}} {{is similar}} to Bendire's thrasher, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. The bill of the curve-billed is all black, while that of Bendire's is paler down to the lower mandible, showing a dark grey with a basal area that does not feature a stark contrast. The upper and lower mandibles of the curve-billed are curved, while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires'. Although geographic variances for the curve-billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult, the curve-billed <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast, {{in contrast to the}} Bendires' smaller, more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads. However, curve-billed thrashers can also present this feature. Bendires' typically have yellow eyes while curve-billed eyes are typically orange, but Bendires' can have variations that appear yellow-orange while some curve-billed eyes are red-orange, yellow-orange, or yellow. The curve-billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions; Bendires' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as mesquite and prefers open grassland with scattered yucca or around hedgegrows in agricultural areas. The song call of Bendire's is said to be more melodic and continuous with a chuck, while the curve-billed is known for its whit-wheet calls.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe case of Comminges, {{rural area}} of the South of France, allows to see that {{locations}} of food shops and supermarkets changed strongly during the twenty last years. This evolution seems to correspond to a modification of the compromises made between three location logics: a squaring space logic (shops <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> spread regularly in the aim to divide the territory, an accessibility logic (shops <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> locate near major routes) and a synergy logic (shops <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> locate in the aim {{to take advantage of}} the commercial attraction generated by other stores or services) ...|$|R

25|$|Blaufränkisch is {{considered}} a high productive vine capable of producing high yields fairly easily.

Turkey bacon is cooked by pan-frying. Cured turkey bacon made from dark meat can be 90% fat free.

25|$|The Chardonnay vine <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> produce {{excessive}} foliage {{which can}} hamper the ripening process with the vine diverting more energy to its leaves than to producing sugars and phenolics in the grape clusters.
