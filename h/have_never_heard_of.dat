25|$|Vitruvius {{illustrates}} this point by naming {{what he considers}} are the most talented individuals in history. Implicitly challenging the reader that they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> some of these people, Vitruvius goes on and predicts {{that some of these}} individuals will be forgotten and their works will be lost, while other less deserving political characters of history will be forever remembered with pageantry.|$|E
25|$|David Brooks theorises in his 2011 book, The Sons of Clovis: Ern Malley, Adoré Floupette and a Secret History of Australian Poetry, {{that the}} Ern Malley hoax was {{modelled}} on the 1885 satire on French Symbolism and the Decadent movement, Les Déliquescences d'Adoré Floupette by Henri Beauclair and Gabriel Vicaire. However, Stewart claimed to <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Floupette {{at the time}} of the Ern Malley hoax, and there is no evidence McAuley had either.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} regions are settled with prosperous and {{contented}} people. However, this naturally {{is lacking in}} scope for plot. Numerous pockets throughout the land of Oz are {{cut off from the}} main culture, for geographic or cultural reasons. Many <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Ozma, making it impossible for them to acknowledge her as their rightful queen. These regions are concentrated {{around the edges of the}} country, and constitute the main settings for books that are set entirely within Oz. The Lost Princess of Oz, for instance is set entirely in rough country in Winkie Country, between two settled areas. In Glinda of Oz, Ozma speaks of her duty to discover all these stray corners of Oz.|$|E

25|$|In the Harry Potter books, the Ministry's {{employees}} {{appear to}} be a largely unelected body. The post of Minister itself, however, is stated to be an elected position. Who has the power to elect or dismiss ministers is never explained. Nevertheless, both the Minister and the Ministry as a whole are seen throughout the Harry Potter series to be highly sensitive to (and reliant on) wizard public opinion, which they attempt to influence via wizarding newspapers. The most functional newspaper is the Daily Prophet, which gives reliable information about politItaly knowledge, and advertisements. Another reliable news source is Witch Weekly, although it focuses less on politics and prison trials than celebrities and advertisements and Quidditch Season. A less than reliable source is the Quibbler, which gives no advertisements, and focuses on fake news, for instance, saying that a star Quid ditch player didn't break his leg, but was bitten by a creature most people <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of.</b> In the books, employment with the Ministry can be obtained right after completion of a wizarding education, though different offices require different levels of education and sometimes specific exam results.|$|E
500|$|Another 1901 piece led {{to one of}} Mr. Dooley's {{most famous}} quotations. A number of {{lawsuits}} brought {{in the wake of}} the 1898 war dealt with the issue of whether the Constitution applied with full force in the former Spanish colonies annexed by the United States, none of which had been granted an organized government by Congress. This question was known as whether the Constitution follows the flag. In 1901, the United States Supreme Court decided these lawsuits, known as the Insular Cases. The justices' written opinions were difficult to understand, and the court deeply divided, but the net effect was to hold that the Constitution did not follow the flag. The decisions gave Mr. Dooley an opportunity to puncture the court's ivory-tower reputation, [...] "no matter whether the constitution follows the flag or not, the Supreme Court follows the election returns". The phrase has often been quoted, sometimes by people who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Mr. Dooley.|$|E
500|$|Cyber Rights {{received}} a positive review in Salon, which noted, [...] "Readers of 'Cyber Rights' will range {{from those who}} <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> Mike Godwin {{to those who have}} tangoed with him online at some point or have at least lurked silently as the debate raged. Whatever the number in the first category, those falling into the second are legion. Godwin has been online so long he's had a celebrated law that predicts the course of online discussions named after him." [...] The review observed, [...] "Throughout 'Cyber Rights,' it becomes clear that what makes Godwin a sometimes unpleasant online sparring partner is precisely what has catapulted him to the front lines in the seemingly endless battles for free speech on the Net. ... his tenacity and his insistence on wrestling every last breath out of his opponents' arguments." [...] Salon characterized the book as, [...] "an instructional book with an argument to convey – a sort of cross between a dry, textbookish primer and a lively personal history." ...|$|E

500|$|Before the 1979 NFL Draft, new [...] San Francisco 49ers {{head coach}} Bill Walsh flew to Morehead State with {{assistant}} coach Sam Wyche {{to work out}} Simms. Walsh was so impressed {{that he planned to}} draft Simms in the third round, preferring him over the quarterback they ultimately took, Joe Montana of Notre Dame. But the New York Giants decided to make Simms their first round pick (seventh overall) to the surprise of many. As Simms acknowledged, [...] "most people <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> me." [...] When Simms's name was announced by Commissioner Pete Rozelle in front of the audience at the draft in New York, his selection was booed loudly by the Giants fans in attendance. (He was the second quarterback taken; Jack Thompson of Washington State went to Cincinnati with the third overall pick.) Simms was not happy being a Giant either, [...] "All I was thinking was which teams I would rather play for—the Green Bay Packers, the Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego, San Francisco..." [...] Nonetheless, he became popular with his teammates who jokingly dubbed him [...] "Prince Valiant" [...] in his rookie training camp.|$|E
500|$|One of Young's first actions was to hire Ray Perkins as head coach. Perkins was an {{offensive}} assistant coach on the Dallas Cowboys under Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry. In his first draft, Young drafted quarterback Phil Simms from Morehead State University with the seventh overall draft pick {{to the surprise}} of many. Simms had never played on a winning team at Morehead State, and acknowledged after he was drafted that [...] "ost people <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> me." [...] Young was certain of the choice though saying, [...] "nce in a while {{you get a chance to}} get a guy with a great arm and great potential and you'd darn sight better take it." [...] Simms was unhappy with the selection, and had other teams which he favored playing on over the Giants. The Giants lost their first five games of the season with Joe Pisarcik starting at quarterback. Simms came on in relief of Pisarcik in the fifth game and started the next four, all of which the Giants won. They lost five out of their last seven however, finishing 6–10 for the year. They fell to 4–12 in 1980. Simms play was inconsistent, as he combined for 28 touchdowns against 33 interceptions while completing 48.8% of his passes over his first two seasons.|$|E
500|$|IGNs Matt Casamassina {{said that}} the game {{compensated}} for its average graphics with excellent level design and gameplay challenges. He added that the game's puzzles require thought, unlike those in other action/platform games, and that the game's objectives were not clear until {{after the first few}} levels. Casamassina praised the game's transparency effects, anti-aliasing, mipmapping, and scaling rotations. IGN described anticipation for the game as [...] "tremendous", particularly among the game's market of [...] "younger gamers and 2D fans". Nintendo Power thought that the game was the best side-scroller since Super Mario World. Next Generation wrote that [...] "only diehard 2D platform fans" [...] would be interested and did not feel that the game lived up to standards set by Mario 64. In contrast, GameFan said that Mischief Makers did for 2D what Mario 64 did for 3D, and suggested that Sega should be influenced by the game. GamesRadar retrospectively called Mischief Makers [...] "pure, unadulterated awesome" [...] and [...] "2D brilliance". The website summarized the game to be about [...] "grabbing sad-faced aliens, shaking them until gems come out, and then hurling them at other sad-faced aliens." [...] Zachary Miller of Nintendo World Report asserted the game may be the console's most bizarre and surreal, but Gamasutra John Harris {{said that the}} game's premise is [...] "only strange to people who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> anime". GameFan described the game as [...] "obviously deeply Japanese", where [...] "old school gameplay and 64-bit visuals finally meet".|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} problem Biden faced {{was the fact that}} voters did not know about him and his candidacy.

500|$|Although {{she hears}} nothing from Milda after their night together, she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly, so she breaks off with Tonda, who storms the {{dormitory}} demanding his ring back. After {{listening to a}} speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment, she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda's doorstep in the big city, ready to resume their romance. Milda is not home, and she meets his parents, who <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>of</b> her and don't know {{what they should do}} with her. Milda comes home very late, and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty, his parents decide it's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa, requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "It’s a tight fit. The old man wants to sleep; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch, but the mother runs the show and won’t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof." [...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least, she breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and how nice Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E
