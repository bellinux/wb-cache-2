5|$|Modern {{scholars}} tend {{to reject}} the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic and as resultant from miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors. Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000–300,000. These estimates usually come <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.|$|E

25|$|<b>From</b> <b>studying</b> Medieval windows, {{particularly}} those at Canterbury Cathedral, many stained glass artists became adept at designing foliage and decorative borders that reproduce archaeological originals. There are windows {{of this type}} in which the foliate design is overlaid with banners bearing scriptural texts.|$|E
25|$|Microtubule {{polymers}} {{are extremely}} sensitive to various environmental effects. Very {{low levels of}} free calcium can destabilize microtubules and this prevented early researchers <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> the polymer in vitro. Cold temperatures also cause rapid depolymerization of microtubules. In contrast, heavy water promotes microtubule polymer stability.|$|E

25|$|The first {{insight into}} the {{mechanism}} came <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> BCL2, {{the product of a}} putative oncogene activated by chromosome translocations often found in follicular lymphoma. Unlike other cancer genes, which promote cancer by stimulating cell proliferation, BCL2 promoted cancer by stopping lymphoma cells from being able to kill themselves.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{materials}} research {{focuses on}} two main subject areas, nuclear fuels and irradiation-induced modification of materials. Improvement of three nuclear fuels is crucial for obtaining increased efficiency from nuclear reactors. Irradiation effects studies have many purposes, <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> structural changes to reactor components to studying nano-modification of metals using ion-beams or particle accelerators.|$|E

25|$|The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe {{allowed that}} {{comparison}} to be made. The initial observations, released in 2003, suggested that reionization took place from 11<znbsp&<nbsp&30. This redshift range was in clear {{disagreement with the}} results <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> quasar spectra. However, the three year WMAP data returned a different result, with reionization beginning at znbsp&=nbsp&11 and the universe ionized by znbsp&=nbsp&7. This is in much better agreement with the quasar data.|$|E
25|$|Sensory neurons {{can have}} axons that {{run from the}} toes to the {{posterior}} column of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults. Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along {{the entire length of}} their necks. Much of what is known about axonal function comes <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> the squid giant axon, an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5–1 millimeters thick, several centimeters long).|$|E

In Barcelona, he met Thomas N'kono. N'kono of FECAFOOT: Football Federation of Cameroon invited Meza Jr. to watch, study and analyze trainings of Cameroon for the 2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers in Africa.

25|$|The {{founding}} chancellor, Sir John Winthrop Hackett, died in 1916, and bequeathed property which, {{after being}} carefully managed for ten years, yielded £425,000 to the university, a far larger sum than expected. This allowed {{the construction of}} the main buildings. Many buildings and landmarks within the university bear his name, including Winthrop Hall and Hackett Hall. In addition, his bequest funded many scholarships, because he did not wish eager students to be deterred <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> because they could not afford to do so.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, Wallach {{obtained}} a temporary visa to emigrate to the United States, {{and worked as}} a secretary and taught German. After being rejected <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> law, she worked without pay for a patent lawyer to learn about the American legal system. She moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 1937 to work as a secretary for Harry Shulman at Yale University. After completing law school, Wallach worked as a cataloger at the law library at the University of Michigan. She became a US citizen in 1942.|$|E
25|$|The New Culture Movement of the 1910s and 1920s {{produced}} {{a great deal}} of lasting interest in Western music. A number of Chinese musicians returned <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> abroad to perform Western classical music, composing work hits on Western musical notation system. The Kuomintang tried to sponsor modern music adoptions via the Shanghai Conservatory of Music despite the ongoing political crisis. Twentieth-century cultural philosophers like Xiao Youmei, Cai Yuanpei, Feng Zikai and Wang Guangqi wanted to see Chinese music adopted to the best standard possible. There were many different opinions regarding the best standard.|$|E

25|$|Trazodone was {{discovered}} in Italy in the 1960s by Angelini Research Laboratories as a second-generation antidepressant. It was developed according to the mental pain hypothesis, which was postulated <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> patients and which proposes that major depression {{is associated with a}} decreased pain threshold. In sharp contrast to most other antidepressants available {{at the time of its}} development, trazodone showed minimal effects on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Trazodone was patented and marketed in many countries all over the world. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981 and was the first non-tricyclic antidepressant approved in the US.|$|E
25|$|Until then, all {{results from}} the solar radio-spectrographs had been {{inferred}} <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> the Sun by looking at its spectrum with only very limited angular resolution. Wild wanted to actually see what these phenomena looked like on the Sun, actually get a moving picture of them. The frequency range that {{we were interested in}} was around about the metre wavelengths. To get the resolution roughly equivalent to that of the human eye at these long wavelengths required an aperture some three kilometres in diameter. So I devised a method of synthesising a three kilometre aperture with 96 antennas in a ring.|$|E
25|$|A few archeologists are {{concerned}} {{that they are being}} prevented <b>from</b> <b>studying</b> ancient remains which cannot be traced to any historic tribe. Many of the tribes migrated to their territories at the time of European encounter within 100–500 years from other locations, so their ancestors were not located in the historic territories. Such controversies have repeatedly stalled archaeological investigations, such {{as in the case of}} the Spirit Cave mummy; fears have been voiced that an anti-scientific sentiment could well have permeated politics to an extent that scientists might find their work to be continuously barred by Native Americans rights activists.|$|E
