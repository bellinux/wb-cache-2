2500|$|When Griffin took power, {{he sought}} to banish overt anti-Semitic {{discourse}} from the party. He <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> members that [...] "we {{can get away with}} criticising Zionists, but any criticism of Jews is likely to be legal and political suicide". In 2006, he complained that the [...] "obsession" [...] that many BNP members had with [...] "the Jews" [...] was [...] "insane and politically disastrous". In 2004, the party selected a Jewish candidate, Pat Richardson, to stand for it during local council elections, something Tyndall lambasted as a [...] "gimmick". References to Jews in BNP literature were often coded to hide the party's electorally unpalatable anti-Semitic ideas. For instance, the term [...] "Zionists" [...] was often used in party literature as a euphemism for [...] "Jews". As noted by Macklin, Griffin still framed many of his arguments [...] "within the parameters of recognizably anti-Semitic discourse". The BNP's literature is replete with references to a conspiratorial group who have sought to suppress nationalist sentiment among the British population, who have encouraged immigration and mixed race relationships, and who are promoting the Islamification of the country. This group is likely a reference to the Jews, an old fascist canard.|$|E

50|$|The {{curse of}} {{knowledge}} has a paradoxical effect in these settings. By making better-informed agents {{think that their}} knowledge is shared by others, the curse helps alleviate the inefficiencies that result from information asymmetries—a better <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> having an advantage in a bargaining situation—bringing outcomes closer to complete information. In such settings, the curse on individuals may actually improve social welfare.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies a {{competitive}} asset market {{characterized by an}} adverse selection problem. The analysis focuses on {{the link between the}} market participants' productive activities and discretionary disclosures. While informed parties' discretion over disclosure allows them to earn private gains, it leads to an inefficient allocation of resources. A more informative signal makes the <b>informed</b> <b>parties</b> better off, but reduces the uninformed parties' welfare. Nonetheless, it improves the economy's allocative efficiency. The paper also shows that when the signal quality is endogenous, the <b>informed</b> <b>parties</b> over-invest in the signal informativeness relative to the level that maximizes social welfare.

50|$|A {{signaling}} {{game is a}} Bayesian game {{in which}} the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> (the “agent”) knows their type, whereas the uninformed party (the “principal”) does not know the agent’s type.

50|$|Information {{asymmetry}} {{means that}} the parties in the interaction have different information, e.g. one party has more or better information than the other. Expecting {{the other side to}} have better information can lead to a change in behavior. The less <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> may try to prevent the other from taking advantage of him. This change in behavior may cause inefficiency. Examples of this problem are adverse selection and moral hazard.|$|E

However, to fully exploit his advantage, the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> should make the same offer regardless of the amount of material to be divided. But informed parties actually offer more when the amount to be divided is larger. Informed parties are unable to ignore their better information, even when they should.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of signal jamming in games with multiple <b>informed</b> <b>parties</b> whose interests are conflicting. The possibility that signal jamming occurs in equilibrium depends on the observability of individual signals. Paradoxically, if the receiver can observe individual signals perfectly, signal jamming can occur in equilibrium, while it cannot occur if the receiver can observe only the one-dimensional signal synthesized from the senders' individual actions. ...|$|R

50|$|Finally, Milgrom and Roberts (1986) {{bring the}} {{asymmetric}} information framework {{to bear in}} analyzing the issue of advertising and pricing. Traditionally, economists have thought of advertising as being either informative (as for example classified ads, which describe {{the characteristics of the}} product for sale), or persuasive (as for example many television commercials which seem to provide little or no information about a product’s characteristics). Following earlier ideas by Nelson (1970, 1974), Milgrom and Roberts (1986) show that even “uninformative” advertising, that is, advertising expenditures that provide no direct information about a product’s characteristics, may be informative in equilibrium {{to the extent that they}} work as a signal of the advertiser’s quality level. Methodologically, Milgrom and Roberts (1986) also make an important contribution: the study of signaling equilibria when the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> has more than one available signal (price and advertising, in the present case).|$|E

50|$|There is also {{a second}} reason why section 13(2) would be more {{efficient}} then section 13(1) for items such as wedding photos. This reason {{is that there is}} probably asymmetry of information between the photographer and the client, meaning that the photographer is probably aware of the copyright rules while the client is probably not. Under the section 13(2) rule, because the client is initially vested with copyright, the photographer has to ask to buy the copyright from the client if the photographer wants the copyright. In the course of the negotiation, the client would become informed about the law. In this, section 13(2) is efficient in that it creates an incentive for more <b>informed</b> <b>parties</b> to share that information with less <b>informed</b> <b>parties.</b> As there is greater symmetry of information between the parties, transaction costs are less and bargaining is easier. However, if the photographer is the first owner of the copyright, he has no need to ask his client about purchase of the copyright and consequently {{it is unlikely that the}} client will learn about the copyright on the photographs.|$|R
5000|$|Flipism is a {{normative}} decision theory {{in a sense}} that it prescribes how decisions should be made. In the comic, flipism shows remarkable ability to make right conclusions without any information - but only once in a while. Of course, in real life flipping a coin would only lead to random decisions. However, there is an article about benefits of some randomness in the decision-making process in certain conditions. It notes:Though the author himself may have intended this as a rejection of the idea that rationality (in the standard sense) has some special claim to superiority as a basis for making decisions, what he may really have discovered are the potential benefits ofstrategic commitment to randomization.Commitment to a non-trivial mixed strategy can be beneficial for the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> in a potential conflict under asymmetric information, as it allows the player to manipulate his opponent’s beliefs in an optimal fashion. Such a strategy also makes the player less inclined to enter into conflict when it is avoidable.

40|$|When a court sets {{standards}} of due {{care in a}} tort or contract case {{with a view to}} how the standards will affect future behavior of parties similar to the litigants, it should sometimes realize that only one of the two future parties is likely to become informed of the standards. The standards can then only have a direct effect on the behavior of the <b>informed</b> <b>party,</b> and it may be thought that the court should hold the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> strictly liable, which maximizes this effect. However, this ignores that the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> may, although strictly liable, lower her level of care in order to induce the uninformed party to take greater care. In this situation, the negligence rule may do better than strict liability, since the discontinuity of the negligence rule can prevent the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> from strategically lowering her level of care. Under the negligence rule, optimal standards are sensitive to whether the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> acts first and to whether she is the injurer or the victim. For both the informed and the uninformed, there are circumstances in which the standard should be higher than first best and other circumstances where it should be lower...|$|E

40|$|How {{should a}} court set legal {{standards}} of negligence or performance when one party {{to a potential}} future tort or contract case will be uninformed about the standards set by the court? Since the court cannot affect {{the behavior of the}} uninformed party, it might set the standard for the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> at that level which is optimal given the behavior that can be expected of the uninformed. Thus, if the court expects the uninformed to take more than optimal care, it might set a lower than first best standard for the <b>informed</b> <b>party.</b> However, there are circumstances in which the court should maintain the first best standard for the <b>informed</b> <b>party,</b> namely when the uninformed party understands the risk and realizes that the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> has an incentive to take due care to avoid liability. The uninformed party will then expect to bear the loss himself and will take adequate precautions. Hence, in the oft-occurring situation where the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> is the injurer and acts first, it can be possible to induce the first best outcome under the negligence rule; the negligence rule may then, due to its discontinuity, be superior to strict liability. Maintaining the first best standard for the uninformed victim may, on the other hand, not be optimal; it is a weakly dominant strategy for the court to set a lower standard, since doing so will increase the informed party’s incentive to take due care without affecting the behavior of the uninformed party. When the conditions under which first best can (in theory) be realized are not met, as when it is not rational for the victim to believe that the injurer acts with due care, the task for the court is {{complicated by the fact that}} it may be optimal to either raise or lower the standard of due care for the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> compared with the first best. As a further complication, which standards are optimal depend on whether the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> is the victim or the injurer and on who acts first...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on asymmetric {{information has been}} concerned mainly {{with the problem of}} the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> lying to the uninformed parties. However, in many cases, the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> will stop short of lying but will seek to gain from private information by managing the disclosure of news. This article examines the pricing of a firm when there is such manipulation of news. I model this situation as a variant of the "persuasion game" of Milgrom and Roberts (1986) in which I can parameterize the notion of the degree of credence placed by the market on the disclosures of the <b>informed</b> <b>party.</b> An empirical hypothesis thrown up by the theory is that for otherwise identical firms, a low price/earnings ratio will be associated with a greater degree of positive skewness of the disclosure strategy. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} optimal negligence standards {{when only}} one of two (future) parties will be informed of the standards. When the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> is the injurer and acts first, the simple negligence rule is optimal, and under certain conditions, the first best standard of due care is optimal. The <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> will {{have an incentive to}} comply with the standard due to the discontinuity of the negligence rule, whereas the uninformed party may infer this and hence also take appropriate precautions. In general, the optimal policy for the court depends on who acts first and on who the injurer is. Thus, optimal rules are contributory negligence when the <b>informed</b> <b>party</b> is the victim and acts first, no liability when the uninformed party is the injurer and acts first, and strict liability without contributory negligence when the uninformed party is the victim and acts first.
