2500|$|Performance/scalability: In 2008, {{performance}} tests between Drupal 6.1 and Joomla 1.5 demonstrated that Drupal's pages were delivered [...] "significantly faster" [...] {{than those of}} Joomla. Despite this, arguments over speed persist. Drupal {{is likely to be}} slower than a special-purpose application for a given task. For example, WordPress typically outperforms Drupal as a single-user blogging tool. Drupal positions itself for broader applications requirements that are outside the scope of more narrowly focused applications. Drupal offers caching to store various page elements, the use of which resulted in a 508% improvement in one benchmark. When using Drupal's <b>default</b> <b>Page</b> Cache mechanism, the cached pages are delivered only to anonymous users, so contributed modules must be installed to allow caching content for logged in users. Like performance, scalability (the ability to add servers to handle growing numbers of visitors with consistent response) can become a concern on large, interactive sites. MySQL's query caching can help reduce the load on the database server caused by Drupal's high query rate. Drupal caches database schema metadata as well as elements such as blocks, forms and menus. Drupal 7 increases performance in database queries and reduces PHP code usage.|$|E

50|$|The {{design of}} the Arabic Wikipedia differs {{somewhat}} from other Wikipedias. Most notably, since Arabic is written right-to-left, the location of links is {{a mirror image of}} those Wikipedias in languages written left-to-right. Prior to Wikipedia's update to MediaWiki 1.16, Arabic Wikipedia had a <b>default</b> <b>page</b> background of the site inspired by Arabic/Islamic tiling or ornament styles. Switching from MediaWiki's new default Vector layout to the original MonoBook layout may restore this page background.|$|E
50|$|At the time, {{not having}} a {{standing}} charge for such a comprehensive service, especially the webspace, was a radical step. Further revenue was obtained from advertisements on Freeserve's homepage, which was set as the <b>default</b> <b>page</b> in the customers' web browsers upon installing the Freeserve connection software. BT sought to challenge Freeserve's business plan by arguing that under the regulatory model (known as Number Translation Services, or NTS), it should receive more money for each call, and in January 1999 Oftel {{announced that it would}} carry out a review.|$|E

5000|$|A {{personal}} {{web page}} {{can be used}} for self promotion for a person's small business or entrepreneurial venture, to promote an amateur rock band they play in, to promote community activities or charitable causes they support, to provide quick access to information about the user, or just as something [...] "cool" [...] to do. A personal web page gives the owner generally more control on presence in search results and how he/she wishes to be viewed online. It also allows more freedom in types and quantity of content than a social network profile offers, and can link various social media profiles with each other. It can be used to correct the record on something, or clear up potential confusion between you and someone with the same name. Early personal web pages were often called [...] "home pages" [...] and were intended to be set as a <b>default</b> <b>page</b> in a web browser's preferences, usually by their owner. These pages would often contain links, to-do lists, and other information their author found useful. In the days when search engines were in their infancy, these pages (and the links they contained) could be an important resource in navigating the web.|$|E

40|$|A new {{relation}} between Prym varieties of arbitrary morphisms of algebraic curves and integrable systems is discovered. The action of maximal commutative subalgebras {{of the formal}} loop algebra of GL(n) defined on certain infinite-dimensional Grassmannians is studied.

Following some controversial incidents of Internet vigilantism, Reddit introduced a strict rule against the publication of non-public personally-identifying information via the site (colloquially known as doxxing).

40|$|This {{document}} {{explains how}} to use a utility that can plot x-y data and bar-charts, and generate a DrawPerfect WPG graphics file. The format of a sample input text file (using the <b>default</b> <b>page</b> style) is described, and the graphics file it generated was printed on an HP LaserJet IV and is attached. Also attached are output graphs that demonstrate additional page styles. This utility lets you quickly generate x-y graphs and bar-charts for inclusion in WordPerfect documents. R was written because no other readily-available graphics package lets you overlay independent x-y curves on top of one other. Lotus 1 - 2 - 3, Harvard Graphics, and FoxGraph require all curves on the same page to have one common column of independent x-values or y-values. We were stuck in manual loops of cutting and pasting curves from one plot to another before they were included in our documents. Not any more! This document describes how to overcome this problem...|$|E
40|$|Essential to {{the spirit}} of TEX is that it formats the {{document}} whilst you just take care of the content, making for increased productivity. The crossreferencing just mentioned is just part of this. Many more labour-saving mechanisms are provided for through style files. These are generic descriptions of classes of documents, teaching TEX just how each class likes to be formatted. This is taught in terms of font preferences, <b>default</b> <b>page</b> sizes, placement of ti-tle, author, date, etc. For instance, a paper style file could teach TEX that when typesetting a theorem it should embolden the part that states the theorem number and typeset the text of the theorem state-ment in slanted Roman typeface (as in many journals). The typist simply pro- vides an indication that a theorem is being stated, and then types the text of the theorem without bothering to choose any fonts or do any formatting—all that is done by the style file. Style files exist for all manner of document—letters, articles, papers, books, proceedings, review articles, and so on. H. J. Hoogeboom, 15. 9 ’ 10 T E X en zo [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|In May 2011 I went to {{an opening}} party at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York City, where Hollywood stars and celebrities, {{including}} Mickey Rourke, Quincy Jones, and Naomi Campbell mingled near a mish-mash of Eastern European -related artworks, including Robert Crumb's comic book rendition of Kafka's Metamorphosis, Vladimir Tatlin's statue "Monument to the Third International;' and an exhibition called Revolutionary Film Posters, a trove of Russian constructivist imagery from between the wars. I It was a bizarre sight for me, a person {{who grew up in}} 1980 s Czechoslovalda, a satellite nation in the Soviet Bloc. In the 1980 s, Czechoslovak cultural policy, theoretically and declaratively (if not always in practice) respected the norms of socialist realism, and it was {{in the name of the}} very ideals promoted by these posters that Western popular culture (and Kafka, for that matter) were banned as "bourgeois" and "decadent" imperialist propaganda. Here in the spectacle of a Chelsea gallery, the stars of Hollywood - the most visible exponent of American capitalism-celebrated the repurposing of political propaganda into aesthetic objects, as if theatrically reasserting capitalism's victory over the ideologies of the Soviet Bloc. As a cornerstone I am going to use Zde jsou psi/Here Be Dogs, a Czech/ English book about visual culture of Czech independent music scenes that I edited in 2010. (Fellow Czech journalist Martina Overstreet served as a producer for the book). The book features thirty-two musical projects now active in the Czech Republic, each introduced by a) a studio portrait of its personnel by the photographer Adam Holy, b) a representative set of the project's visual communications-costumes, album covers, booklets, flyers, posters, documentary and promotional photographs, video projections used during performances, merchandise, banner ads, computer wallpapers, buddy icons, etc., and c) a short text written by a third party author familiar with the Czech music scene. The image of the visually compelling part of the indie scene is complemented by Dusan Tomanek's documentary photographs, which were taken of Czech audiences in the past four years at festivals, clubs, and various other venues. My experiences as pop music critic, editor of two independent arts and culture publications, and advocate for popular music studies within Czech media studies at Prague's Charles University informed my enthusiasm for the topic and allowed me to foresee the obstacles in the production and reception of this project in the Czech cultural space. There were several. The book packed more than forty names in its colophon, with some ninety members of bands (plus their designers and photographers), and sold out its initial run of a thousand copies. As such it became a useful indicator of positions on the role of the image in the indie music sphere. I began research for the book in 2009 by examining more than 300 contemporary Czech acts that had at least some web presence, and my colleagues Martina Overstreet and Marie Hladikova also conducted a similar scope of research. Most bands I researched got by with the <b>default</b> <b>page</b> settings on MySpace, or a profile on its Czech counterpart, www. bandzone. cz The thirty-two projects included in the book represent only a minority of bands, with our primary criteria being that those selected showed interesting approaches to their visual presentation or at least showed interest in visual presentation. They were singled out as exemplary and the introductory text of the book served as defense of such interests...|$|E

40|$|Link information, {{especially}} anchor text, {{is known}} to be very useful for effective ranking of web pages, par- ticularly in response to navigational queries. We in- vestigated whether enterprise webs contain sufficient internal link information to adequately answer queries derived from the enterprise’s site map or, alterna- tively, whether adding link evidence from the external Web can boost search effectiveness. Using 1266 navigational queries derived from Stanford University’s A-Z site index, we found no difference between the quality of results returned by Stanford’s Google appliance and those from an appropriately site-restricted search of the global Google service. Applying similar methodology to our own crawls of seven Australian organisations, we found that adding external link evidence made no significant difference to search effectiveness in five cases and a slight difference (in different directions) in the other two. We observed that external links to an organisation show very different patterns to internal links. Unlike enterprise web publishers, external web authors heavily favour directory <b>default</b> <b>pages,</b> particularly the organisation’s home page and pages offering information or services likely to be useful on an ongoing basis.
