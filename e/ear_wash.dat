5000|$|Styropian - reedycja is the {{new version}} of Pidzama Porno's album, {{previously}} released in 1998. Remastered and issued by SP Records, it contains bonus tracks and a video clip to [...] "Do nieba wzieci". The band used the original magnetic tapes from the studio to recreate the sound from the start. The result is similar to an <b>ear</b> <b>wash</b> - more details can be heard. The sound was only modified, nothing new was added.|$|E
40|$|Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} of otitis media. One of {{the outer}} membrane proteins of NTHI, P 6, is an antigen common to all strains and is considered {{as a candidate for}} mucosal vaccine. To elucidate the possibility of developing a nasal vaccine against nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) and to investigate mucosal immune responses in the middle ear, mice were immunized intranasally with the P 6 outer membrane protein of NTHI, and P 6 -specific immune responses in the middle ear mucosa were examined. Mice were given with P 6 and cholera toxin intranasally as an adjuvant on days 0, 7, and 14 and were killed on day 21. The P 6 -specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody titer in <b>ear</b> <b>wash</b> was significantly elevated. Mononuclear cells were isolated from middle ear mucosa, and an increase in P 6 -specific IgA-producing cells was shown with an enzyme-linked immunospot assay. In addition, an increase in memory T cells in middle ear mucosa was detected with flow cytometric analysis after intranasal immunization. Moreover, in vitro stimulation with P 6 resulted in proliferation of purified CD 4 + T cells from immunized mice, and these T cells expressed Th 2 cytokine mRNA. These results indicate that P 6 -specific IgAâ€“B-cell immune responses and selected Th 2 cytokine expressing Th cells were induced in middle ear mucosa by intranasal immunization. These findings suggest that a nasal vaccine is useful for preventing otitis media with effusion...|$|E

50|$|Patients {{generally}} {{prefer the}} irrigation solution to be warmed to body temperature, as dizziness {{is a common}} side effect of <b>ear</b> <b>washing</b> or syringing with fluids that are colder or warmer than body temperature.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to {{a high incidence of}} deafness and ear disease among village children, JSC opened an ear clinic in Phnom Penh which performs otoscopy, audiometry, hearing-aid fitting, and referral for surgery at Battambang Emergency Hospital. The Siem Reap clinic offers screening tests, audiometry, <b>ear</b> <b>washing,</b> and basic medical treatment. Banteay Meanchey patients receive primary care and referral to Phnom Penh as needed.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the presence of}} viruses and bacteria in middle ear and adenoids of patients with and without otitis media with effusion (OME). Adenoid samples and middle <b>ear</b> <b>washes</b> (MEW) were obtained from children with OME associated with adenoid hypertrophy undergoing adenoidectomy and tympanostomy, and compared to those obtained from patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery, as a control group. Specific DNA or RNA of 9 respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, influenza virus, picornavirus, syncytial respiratory virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus) and 5 bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus) were extracted and quantified by real-time PCR. 37 OME and 14 cochlear implant children {{were included in the}} study. At the adenoid, virus and bacteria were similarly detected in both OME and control patients. At the middle <b>ear</b> <b>washes,</b> however, a higher prevalence of bacteria was observed in patients with OME (p = 0. 01). S. pneumoniae (p = 0. 01) and M. catarrhalis (p = 0. 022) were the bacteria responsible for this difference. Although total virus detection was not statistically different from controls at the middle <b>ear</b> <b>washes</b> (p = 0. 065), adenovirus was detected in higher proportions in adenoid samples of OME patients than controls (p = 0. 019). Despite both OME and control patients presented similar rates of viruses and bacteria at the adenoid, children with OME presented higher prevalence of S. pneumonia, M. catarrhalis in middle ear and adenovirus in adenoids when compared to controls. These findings could suggest that these pathogens could contribute to the fluid persistence in the middle ear...|$|R
50|$|Myringotomy {{is usually}} {{performed}} as an outpatient procedure. General anesthesia is preferred in children, while local anesthesia suffices for adults. The <b>ear</b> is <b>washed</b> {{and a small}} incision made in the eardrum. Any fluid that is present is then aspirated, the tube of choice inserted, and the ear packed with cotton to control any slight bleeding that might occur. This is known as conventional (or cold knife) myringotomy and usually heals in one to two days.|$|R
2500|$|Others {{have noted}} the {{similarities}} between the maneki-nekos gesture and that of a cat washing its face. There is a Japanese belief that a cat washing its face means a visitor will soon arrive. This belief may in turn be related to an even older Chinese proverb that states that if a cat washes its face, it will rain. Thus, it is possible a belief arose that a figure of a cat washing its face would bring in customers. In his Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang, China's Tang Dynasty author Duan Chengshi (803?-863) wrote: [...] "If a cat raises its paw over the <b>ears</b> and <b>washes</b> its face, then patrons will come".|$|R
5000|$|When {{a man is}} {{becoming}} dull of hearing, which happens most often after prolonged headaches, in the first place, the ear itself should be inspected: for there will be found either a crust such as comes upon the surface of ulcerations, or concretions of wax. If a crust, hot oil is poured in, or verdigris mixed with honey or leek juice or a little soda in honey wine. And when the crust has been separated from the ulceration, the ear is irrigated with tepid water, {{to make it easier}} for the crusts now disengaged to be withdrawn by the ear scoop. If it be wax, and if it be soft, it can be extracted in the same way by the ear scoop; but if hard, vinegar containing a little soda is introduced; and when the wax has softened, the <b>ear</b> is <b>washed</b> out and cleared as above. ... Further, the ear should be syringed with castoreum mixed with vinegar and laurel oil and the juice of young radish rind, or with cucumber juice, mixed with crushed rose leaves. The dropping in of the juice of unripe grapes mixed with rose oil is also fairly efficacious against deafness.|$|R
