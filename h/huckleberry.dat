5|$|With the {{cooperation}} of the United States Department of Agriculture, efforts are under way to promote G.brachycera as a groundcover for use in landscaping. Box <b>huckleberry</b> is commercially available from at least one source {{but it is difficult to}} propagate, making it unprofitable for many nurseries to carry. In New Bloomfield, PA, the box <b>huckleberry</b> has become part of the local New Year's celebrations, as a papier-mâché replica of a <b>huckleberry</b> is dropped, instead of a ball, to mark the new year.|$|E
5|$|About 100 {{separate}} {{stations for}} box <b>huckleberry</b> {{have been documented}} in the scientific literature. By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations of the plant had been lost to science, and his Pennsylvania colony {{was the only one}} known for some time. Specimens of box <b>huckleberry</b> were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870, by William M. Canby.|$|E
5|$|A relict species nearly exterminated by {{the last}} ice age, box <b>huckleberry</b> is self-sterile, and is found in {{isolated}} colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots. One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to {{be as many as}} 13,000 years old; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8,000 years, which would make it the oldest woody plant east of the Rocky Mountains. Another colony in Pennsylvania, about 1,300 years old, has been protected by the Hoverter and Sholl Box <b>Huckleberry</b> Natural Area.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Rosauers {{opened the}} first <b>Huckleberry's</b> Natural Market on Spokane's South Hill. After {{proving to be}} a success, Rosauers opened another <b>Huckleberry's</b> in Spokane Valley in December 1996. The Spokane Valley store was {{eventually}} closed while the South Hill store remains in business. Since 1996, Rosauers has added <b>Huckleberry's</b> Natural Market sections to its new and existing stores.|$|R

5|$|The {{wetlands}} at {{the headwaters}} of Spring Brook are home to boreal forest trees. These include black spruce, paper birch, and tamarack. <b>Huckleberry,</b> lady's slipper, leather leaf, mountain laurel, pitcher plant, and rhododendron plants inhabit bogs in the area.|$|E
5|$|West Branch Fishing Creek {{begins in}} Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13 and southwestern Davidson Township, Sullivan County on <b>Huckleberry</b> Mountain. It flows northeast, almost {{immediately}} entering a valley. It soon {{picks up the}} tributaries Swanks Run and Slip Run from the left and turns southeast, its valley becoming progressively deeper. The creek continues southeast, flowing between <b>Huckleberry</b> Mountain and North Mountain. It picks up two more tributaries from the left and then picks up its first tributary from the right, Shingle Mill Run. Shortly afterwards, the creek turns east and begins receiving unnamed tributaries from both sides. After a few miles, Painter Run flows into the creek. The creek exits Davidson Township and Sullivan County shortly downstream.|$|E
5|$|Although {{details of}} his life story may have been forgotten, Emperor Norton was immortalized in literature. Mark Twain, who resided in San Francisco during part of Emperor Norton's public life, modeled the {{character}} of the King in Adventures of <b>Huckleberry</b> Finn on Joshua Norton.|$|E

5|$|Bart's {{character}} traits of rebelliousness and disrespect for authority have {{been compared to}} that of America's founding fathers, and he has been described as an updated version of Tom Sawyer and <b>Huckleberry</b> Finn, rolled into one. In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes Bart as a nihilist, a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.|$|E
5|$|Box <b>huckleberry</b> prefers dry, acidic soils, {{including}} duff, {{and partial}} shade. Locations on wooded slopes tend to face north; however, the New Bloomfield site faces west. At {{one of the}} Delaware sites, {{a small portion of}} the colony extended to the wet margin of a marsh, but most was located on dry, sandy soil upslope.|$|E
5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera, {{commonly}} known as box <b>huckleberry</b> or box-leaved whortleberry, is a low North American shrub related to the blueberry and the other huckleberries. It is native to the east-central United States (Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee).|$|E

5|$|In the Nescopeck Creek watershed, {{pitch pine}} – scrub oak forests occur on Arbutus Peak and several barren {{areas in the}} {{southern}} part of watershed. In this type of forest, pitch pine, scrub oak, black oak and chestnut oak are the main trees. Bracken fern, teaberry, black chokeberry, blueberry, and <b>huckleberry</b> are the most common shrubs in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|Boreal {{forest trees}} such as black spruce, paper birch, and {{tamarack}} inhabit wetlands in the watershed of Roaring Brook. Plants such as mountain laurel, leather leaf, pitcher plant, rhododendron, <b>huckleberry,</b> and lady's slipper inhabit bogs in these wetlands. Old-growth forests containing oak, pine, and hemlock trees are {{also present in}} the Nay Aug Gorge. Upstream of Ridge Row, the stream's riparian buffer is wooded with some rock outcrops. Upstream of Nay Aug, the riparian canopy is mostly intact. Some hemlock trees in the Nay Aug Gorge {{have been affected by}} hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box <b>huckleberry</b> from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box <b>Huckleberry</b> Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E
5|$|Little Fishing Creek {{begins on}} <b>Huckleberry</b> Mountain in Davidson Township, Sullivan County. It flows south and exits Davidson Township and Sullivan County {{within a few}} tenths of a mile. Upon exiting Sullivan County, the creek enters Jordan Township, Lycoming County. In this township, it {{continues}} south before turning southeast and crossing Pennsylvania Route 118 and Pennsylvania Route 239. Downstream, it exits Jordan Township and Lycoming County.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{reported}} stations for box <b>huckleberry</b> fall within the Appalachian Mountains, ranging from central Pennsylvania in the north to eastern Tennessee in the south. However, the specimens located in Maryland and Delaware {{were found on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain, and the single North Carolina station is in the Piedmont. Its scattered distribution suggests that the species once spread more broadly across North America, but was almost eradicated by glacial advances, surviving only where it escaped the ice in protected refugia.|$|E

5|$|Nescopeck Mountain is one {{of several}} {{mountains}} in Columbia County to contain undisturbed oak/mixed hardwood forests. This forest is also an Appalachian Oak Forest. Specific tree species on the ridge in Columbia County include red oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, black birch, American chestnut, pitch pine, red maple, and serviceberry. Other plants on the ridge include black <b>huckleberry,</b> lowbush blueberry, mountain laurel, sheep's laurel, bracken fern, wild sarsaparilla, and Virginia creeper.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} habitat in the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the dry-oak mixed forest. Common trees in this habitat include northern red oak, white oak, and chestnut oak. This habitat also contains gray and black birch trees. Pine, hemlock, and {{some types of}} oak trees are found on the higher parts of this habitat. Lower to the ground are <b>huckleberry,</b> teaberry, blueberry, and hawthorn and other plants. The wildflowers in this habitat include wild onion and wild strawberries.|$|E
5|$|Upon leaving Sullivan County, West Branch Fishing Creek enters Sugarloaf Township, Columbia County. Immediately after {{entering}} Columbia County, the creek {{flows through the}} community of Elk Grove. It flows east-southeast for a short distance before reaching the communities of Central and Jamison City. The creek then makes a sharp turn south and flows between Central Mountain and <b>Huckleberry</b> Mountain and into a plain. After some distance, it turns southwest and crosses Pennsylvania Route 118. Several hundred feet downstream, it and East Branch Fishing Creek merge to form Fishing Creek.|$|E
