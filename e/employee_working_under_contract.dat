To this end, a large dataset of German manufacturing firms and various panel data models {{are used in}} order to reveal the expected non-linear effect.

GAO's work has shown that reliance on contractors to support core missions, however, can place the government at risk of transferring government responsibilities to contractors. In April 2009, the Secretary of Defense announced his intent to reduce the department's reliance on contractors.

In March 2006, we reported that DOE was engaged in a detailed review of these and other project e-mails and was reworking technical documents to ensure the credibility of the USGS's scientific analyses, particularly its conclusions on water infiltration. At Congress' request, we undertook follow-on work to determine the estimated costs incurred in DOE's response, which also included additional management and quality assurance training for project personnel. We briefed Congressional staff on October 23, 2006, on the results of this work. As Congress requested, we also briefed Congressional staff on the estimated cost of completing the Yucca Mountain Project, based on DOE's new schedule for receiving a license and opening the nuclear waste repository by 2017. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} four chapters. The {{first chapter}} establishes a negative empirical {{correlation between the}} share of <b>employees</b> <b>working</b> <b>under</b> a temporary <b>contract</b> and the share of employees with high educational attainments employed in jobs {{for which they are}} overqualified. Subsequently, I show that a search and matching model with heterogeneous jobs and workers with directed search can explain this correlation. Temporary contracts induce entrepreneurs to post, in relative terms, more vacancies for jobs with low educational requirements thus reducing the time (cost) of finding one such job. As a result, some unemployed agents with high educational levels that were previously looking for a job that matched their level of formation may find it attractive to switch and start searching for one such easy to find job for which they are over-qualified. The second chapter compares the magnitude of fiscal multipliers at the zero lower bound in New Keynesian models with those that arise from a large-scale global semi-structural model (NiGEM). I find that, in NiGEM, once I impose the zero lower bound constraint, multipliers increase, as the literature predicts, but by a much smaller factor than in New Keynesian models. Whereas New Keynesian models predict multipliers well above one, or even larger than two, multipliers in NiGEM remain below one. All of the channels, highlighted by the literature, through which the zero lower bound operates to generate multipliers larger than one are operating in NiGEM but one. Contrary to the predictions of open economy New Keynesian models, a fiscal expansionary shock when the economy is stuck at the zero lower bound does not crowd in foreign demand for home goods in NiGEM. In addition, I also find that the results are sensitive to the degree of expectational myopia. Once I modify NiGEM to reduce the degree of expectational myopia and produce a foreign demand crowd in effect, I obtain that the predictions of the model become more in line with those of the New Keynesian literature. The third chapter describes the cyclical behavior of the relative price of investment using three different measures: instantaneous correlations on data detrended using the HodrickPrescott filter, correlations on VAR forecast errors and instantaneous correlations on frequencydomain filtered data. All three measures suggest that the relative price of equipment goods is countercyclical. Instead, the relative price of household and total private investment is countercyclical according to the correlations computed on VAR forecast errors and frequencydomain filtered data while correlations on data detrended using the Hodrick-Prescott filter suggest that the relative price of household and total private investment is procyclical. The fourth chapter reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on macroprudential policies and tools and tests empirically the effectiveness of several macroprudential policies and tools. We find evidence that macroprudential polices are effective at curbing house price and credit growth, albeit some tools are more effective than others. These include, in particular, taxes on financial institutions and strict loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratio limits...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses the E-Verify program, which provides employers a tool for verifying an employee's authorization {{to work in the}} United States. The opportunity for employment {{is one of the most}} powerful magnets attracting immigrants to the United States. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, as of March 2010, approximately 11. 2 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the country, and an estimated 8 million of them, or about 70 percent, were in the labor force. Congress, the administration, and some states have taken various actions to better ensure that those who work here have appropriate work authorization and to safeguard jobs for authorized employees. Nonetheless, opportunities remain for unauthorized workers to fraudulently obtain employment by using borrowed or stolen documents and for unscrupulous employers to hire unauthorized workers. Immigration experts have noted that deterring illegal immigration requires, among other things, a more reliable employment eligibility verification process and a more robust worksite enforcement capacity. E-Verify is a free, largely voluntary, Internet-based system operated by the Verification Division of the Department of Homeland Security's U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA). The goals of E-Verify are to (1) reduce the employment of individuals unauthorized to work, (2) reduce discrimination, (3) protect employee civil liberties and privacy, and (4) prevent undue burden on employers. Pursuant to a 2007 Office of Management Budget directive, all federal agencies are required to use E-Verify on their new hires and, as of September 2009, certain federal contractors and subcontractors are required to use E-Verify for newly hired <b>employees</b> <b>working</b> in the United States as well as existing <b>employees</b> <b>working</b> directly <b>under</b> the <b>contract.</b> A number of states have also mandated that some or all employers within the state use E-Verify on new hires. From October 1, 2010, through April 5, 2011, E-Verify processed approximately 7. 8 million queries from nearly 258, 000 employers. In an August 2005 report and June 2008 testimony on E-Verify, we noted that USCIS faced challenges in detecting identity fraud and ensuring employer compliance with the program's rules. We highlighted some of the challenges USCIS and SSA faced in reducing instances of erroneous tentative nonconfirmations (TNC), or situations in which work-authorized employees are not automatically confirmed by E-Verify. We also noted that mandatory implementation of E-Verify would place increased demands on USCIS's and SSA's resources. This testimony is based primarily on a report we issued in December 2010 and provide updates to the challenges we noted in our 2005 report and 2008 testimony. The statement, as requested, highlights findings from that report and discusses the extent to which (1) USCIS has reduced the incidence of TNCs and E-Verify's vulnerability to fraud, (2) USCIS has provided safeguards for employees' personal information, and (3) USCIS and SSA have taken steps to prepare for mandatory E-Verify implementation. Our December 2010 report also includes a discussion of the extent to which USCIS has improved its ability to monitor and ensure employer compliance with E-Verify program policies and procedures. ...|$|R
