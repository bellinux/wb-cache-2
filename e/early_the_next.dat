5|$|Hurricane Dennis caused severe {{flooding}} in Miami-Dade County, Florida, in August1981. The tenth tropical cyclone and fourth named storm of the season, Dennis developed from a tropical wave well south of Cabo Verde on August7. The depression intensified into {{a tropical storm}} <b>early</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. Dennis then encountered strong wind shear, causing the storm to weaken to a tropical depression on August11. After crossing the Windward Islands on August12, Dennis degenerated into a tropical wave several hours later over the Caribbean Sea. The wave became a tropical depression again late on August15 while approaching Cuba. Dennis reintensified into a tropical storm before landfall in Matanzas Province. The cyclone emerged into the Straits of Florida on August16, before striking the Florida Keys and then Monroe County <b>early</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. It drifted across Florida, reaching the Atlantic near Cape Canaveral on August19. Dennis continued to intensify and made landfall near Emerald Isle, North Carolina, but moved east-northeastward and soon tracked offshore. Late on August20, Dennis deepened into a hurricane with winds of 80mph (130km/h), before weakening to a tropical storm over colder waters on August21.

5000|$|As with Columbia, NASA {{at first}} {{believed}} that workers' improper installation and {{handling of the}} external tanks at the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana caused the foam loss on Discovery.
