5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E
5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission {{from one person to}} another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ("overt") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) pl^ys an {{important}} role in the pathogenesis of melasma. Ultraviolet rays can cause lipid peroxidation in cell membranes that trigger the generation of free radicals that can stimulate melanocytes to produce many melanin. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is the end product of lipid peroxidation in the body. MDA is {{an important}} indicator of lipid peroxidation. There are a lot of research has been done in linking MDA to the severity of melasma. But there has not yet any research connecting it with sun exposure in patients with melasma. This study aims to find out the relationship between MDA serum levels and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> sun exposure; and Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) scores in patients with melasma. The research method was the case control study. It used 84 samples divided into two groups: a melasma group consisting of 42 people and a control group consisting of 42 people. The examination was performed with anamnesis, questionnaires, <b>duration</b> score <b>of</b> sun <b>exposure,</b> physical examination and the assessment of MDA serum levels with Thiobutiric acid-reactive substance test reaction.

The results show that there is a significant correlation between the levels of MDA with the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> sun <b>exposure,</b> but the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> sun <b>exposure</b> is not associated with MASI score. It means that MDA levels are not significantly associated with MASI scores.

40|$|Abstract. The {{costs of}} mefloquine, chloroquine, doxycycline, primaquine, and atovaquone/proguanil are {{calculated}} for various <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to malaria. The cost is included for detecting glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency before administering primaquine for primary or terminal prophylaxis. For <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> ranging from 3 to 730 days, if no terminal prophylaxis is given, doxycycline (generic) {{is the least}} expensive regimen. Compared with doxycycline hyclate, chloroquine costs {{three to four times}} more, and primaquine, after screening for G 6 PD, costs about eight times more. Atovaquone/proguanil is less expensive than mefloquine for a 3 -day exposure, but more expensive for 7 or more days. When terminal chemoprophylaxis with primaquine for 14 days is used in addition to doxycycline, mefloquine, chloroquine, or atovaquone/proguanil, primaquine alone is the least expensive regimen for <b>exposures</b> <b>of</b> < 10 days. Thereafter, doxycycline plus 14 days of primaquine is most economical. For subsequent exposures when G 6 PD status is already known, primaquine alone is the least expensive regimen for up to 9 days <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> but doxycycline is less expensive thereafter. In general, generic doxycycline hyclate is the least expensive regimen. Primaquine alone is economically attractive. Mefloquine, doxycyline monohydrate, and atovaquone/proguanil, the most expensive regimens, are similar in cost for a 7 -day exposure, but thereafter, atovaquone/proguanil is much more expensive...|$|R

However, the response of the ovary to similar stress regime for 12 weeks was paradoxical as there were increases in the activities of ovarian antioxidant enzymes and 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the number of healthy antral follicles, and decreases in ovarian malondialdehyde concentration and percentage of apoptotic granulosa cells. These changes were accompanied by hyperglycaemia and an increase in the serum levels of insulin, testosterone and oestradiol. In addition the cystic follicles were found in the ovaries of these rats.

25|$|Several {{tests can}} {{determine}} exposure to benzene. Benzene {{itself can be}} measured in breath, blood or urine, but such testing is usually limited to the first 24 hours post-exposure due to the relatively rapid removal of the chemical by exhalation or biotransformation. Most people in developed countries have measureable baseline levels of benzene and other aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons in their blood. In the body, benzene is enzymatically converted to a series of oxidation products including muconic acid, phenylmercapturic acid, phenol, catechol, hydroquinone and 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene. Most of these metabolites have some value as biomarkers of human exposure, since they accumulate in the urine in proportion to the extent and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> and they may still be present for some days after exposure has ceased. The current ACGIH biological exposure limits for occupational exposure are 500 μg/g creatinine for muconic acid and 25 μg/g creatinine for phenylmercapturic acid in an end-of-shift urine specimen.|$|E
25|$|Respiratory {{damage is}} related to the {{concentration}} of the gas and its solubility. Irritant gas exposures predominantly affect the airways, causing tracheitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. Other inhaled agents may be directly toxic (e.g. cyanide, carbon monoxide), or cause harm simply by displacing oxygen and producing asphyxia (e.g. methane, carbon dioxide). The effect of inhaling irritant gases depends on the extent and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> and on the specific agent Chlorine, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and ammonia are among the most important irritant gases. Hydrogen sulfide is also a potent cellular toxin, blocking the cytochrome system and inhibiting cellular respiration. More water-soluble gases (e.g. chlorine, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride) dissolve in the upper airway and immediately cause mucous membrane irritation, which may alert people to the need to escape the exposure. Permanent damage to the upper respiratory tract, distal airways, and lung parenchyma occurs only if escape from the gas source is impeded. Less soluble gases (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, phosgene, ozone) may not dissolve until they are well into the respiratory tract, often reaching the lower airways. These agents are less likely to produce early warning signs (phosgene in low concentrations has a pleasant odor), are more likely to cause severe bronchiolitis, and often have a lag of ≥ 12 h before symptoms of pulmonary edema develop.|$|E

A model has been proposed through which the percentage change in resistance can be estimated in terms of the number <b>of</b> <b>exposures,</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> etc. Based on these studies it was possible to suggest a downward trimming method for polymer film resistors in which the polymer film is exposed to intermittant infrared radiation pulses <b>of</b> the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the order of a few seconds.

The present study demonstrates that a variety of optical parameters must be considered when applying optical traps to the study of biological problems, especially when survival and viability are important factors. The ability of the optical trap to alter either the structure or biochemistry of the process being probed with the trapping beam must be seriously considered when interpreting experimental results...|$|R
500|$|In some diver {{training}} courses for {{these types of}} diving, divers are taught to plan and monitor {{what is called the}} oxygen clock of their dives. This is a notional alarm clock, which ticks more quickly at increased oxygen pressure and is set to activate at the maximum single exposure limit recommended in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Diving Manual. For the following partial pressures of oxygen the limits are: 45 minutes at , 120 minutes at , 150 minutes at , 180 minutes at [...] and 210 minutes at , but it is impossible to predict with any reliability whether or when toxicity symptoms will occur. Many nitrox-capable dive computers calculate an oxygen loading and can track it across multiple dives. The aim is to avoid activating the alarm by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas or by reducing the time spent breathing gas of greater oxygen partial pressure. As the partial pressure of oxygen increases with the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas and the depth of the dive, the diver obtains more time on the oxygen clock by diving at a shallower depth, by breathing a less oxygen-rich gas, or by shortening the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to oxygen-rich gases.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the {{strongly}} oxidizing {{properties of}} ozone, ozone {{is a primary}} irritant, affecting especially the eyes and respiratory systems and can be hazardous at even low concentrations.

The severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations." [...] To protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 μmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and NIOSH has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 μmol/mol. Work environments where ozone is used or where {{it is likely to}} be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA PEL.

6000|$|FLY-SPECK, n. The {{prototype}} of punctuation. It is observed by Garvinus that the systems of punctuation in {{use by the}} various literary nations depended originally upon the social habits and general diet of the flies infesting the several countries. These creatures, which have always been distinguished for a neighborly and companionable familiarity with authors, liberally or niggardly embellish the manuscripts in process of growth under the pen, according to their bodily habit, bringing out {{the sense of the}} work by a species of interpretation superior to, and independent of, the writer's powers. The [...] "old masters" [...] of literature--that is to say, the early writers whose work is so esteemed by later scribes and critics in the same language--never punctuated at all, but worked right along free-handed, without that abruption of the thought which comes from the use of points. (We observe the same thing in children to-day, whose usage in this particular is a striking and beautiful instance of the law that the infancy of individuals reproduces the methods and stages of development characterizing the infancy of races.) In the work of these primitive scribes all the punctuation is found, by the modern investigator with his optical instruments and chemical tests, to have been inserted by the writers' ingenious and serviceable collaborator, the common house-fly--Musca maledicta. In transcribing these ancient MSS, for the purpose of either making the work their own or preserving what they naturally regard as divine revelations, later writers reverently and accurately copy whatever marks they find upon the papyrus or parchment, to the unspeakable enhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value of the work. Writers contemporary with the copyists naturally avail themselves of the obvious advantages of these marks in their own work, and with such assistance as the flies of their own household may be willing to grant, frequently rival and sometimes surpass the older compositions, in respect at least of punctuation, which is no small glory. Fully to understand the important services that flies perform to literature it is only necessary to lay a page of some popular novelist alongside a saucer of cream-and-molasses in a sunny room and observe [...] "how the wit brightens and the style refines" [...] in accurate proportion to the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b>|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT:Melatonin is {{involved}} in a variety of diseases, including cancer, insomnia, depression, dementia, hypertension, and diabetes; its secretion is influenced by environmental light. Although daylight exposure increases nocturnal melatonin secretion in a controlled laboratory setting, whether it increases nocturnal melatonin secretion in an uncontrolled daily life setting remains unclear. OBJECTIVE:We aimed to determine the association between daylight exposure in an uncontrolled daily life setting and urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS:A cross-sectional study was conducted in 192 elderly individuals (mean age, 69. 9 yr). MEASURES:We measured ambulatory daylight exposure using a wrist light meter in two 48 -h sessions; furthermore, we measured overnight urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion, an index of melatonin secretion, on the second night of each session. RESULTS:The median <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> daylight <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> at least 1000 lux was 72 min (interquartile range, 37 - 124). Univariate linear regression analysis showed marginal to significant associations between log-transformed urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion and age, current smoking status, benzodiazepine use, day length, log-transformed <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> daylight <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> at least 1000 lux, and daytime physical activity. In a multivariate model, log-transformed <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> daylight <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> at least 1000 lux was significantly associated with log-transformed urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion (regression coefficient, 0. 101; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 003 - 0. 199; P = 0. 043). Furthermore, an increase in the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> daylight <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> at least 1000 lux from 37 to 124 min (25 th to 75 th percentiles) was associated with a 13. 0 % increase in urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion (6. 8 to 7. 7 μg). CONCLUSIONS:Daylight exposure in an uncontrolled daily life setting is positively associated with urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion in the elderly. 博士（医学）・乙第 1308 号・平成 25 年 3 月 15 日Copyright © 2012 by The Endocrine Societ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to characterize the distribution, variability and determinants <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> to extremely low frequency (ELF) electric and magnetic fields in environments where no information was previously available, and to advance the methodology <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> estimation. The thesis {{is divided into three}} related papers. The first paper reports a study of personal ELF field <b>exposure</b> measurements <b>of</b> 465 randomly selected workers in an electrical utility. By job category, arithmetic mean magnetic field exposures ranged from 0. 09 to 2. 36 $ mu$T (electric fields: 2. 5 to 400 V/m). ELF magnetic field exposures were highest for substation workers, hydroelectric generating station operators and cable splicers; electric fields were highest for forestry workers, equipment electricians and distribution linemen. Most alternative indices <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> were highly correlated with the arithmetic or the geometric means (r $ ge$ 0. 8). Job category explained half of the total variance in logarithms of weekly magnetic and electric field means. The second paper reports a method developed to estimate past ELF field <b>exposures</b> <b>of</b> the electric utility workers. The present intensities and <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> for tasks were measured, then separately extrapolated to the past based on information from interviews with long-service personnel at the utility. From reconstructed time weighted average (TWA) exposures, magnetic fields were estimated to have increased most over time for substation and distribution-line jobs; the increase for electric fields was less than for magnetic. The method is applicable to other exposures where monitoring records allow calculation of the intensity and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> for tasks and estimates of past intensities and <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> for these tasks can be obtained. In the third paper, the methodology developed in the occupational setting was applied to a study <b>of</b> personal <b>exposures</b> to ELF fields among 365 randomly selected Canadian children. Overall, the arithmetic mean total magnetic field was 0. 121 $ mu$T (electric field: 14. 4 V/m), with magnetic fields highest in Quebec and lowest in Alberta. Magnetic fields were highest at home during the day. Measurements were at their lowest at night but provided the highest correlation with total magnetic field exposure (r =. 91). This study found that children's magnetic fields exposures varied substantially between certain provinces (province accounting for 14. 7 % of the variation) most likely because of differences in the proportion of residences in multiple dwellings, heated electrically or cooled by air conditioning. These attributes were identified as potentially useful predictors of magnetic fields...|$|R
