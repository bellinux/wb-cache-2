2500|$|... "Activity-based" [...] {{means that}} {{for people to}} learn, a real object has to be {{actually}} present; as Jacinta Correia puts it: [...] "{{to learn how to}} ride a bike, you need a bike to ride on". Thus, for a large group to learn how to manage a complex enterprise, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a complex enterprise to manage. In the OW context, this means that a group averaging 150, many of whom often with lower levels of education, are actively engaged, for an entire month, in (a) productive or service provision enterprise(s). For all the apparent, e.g., on-the-job training and action learning parallels, the OW's defining features are not only the need for a cooperative large group and the creation of (a) complex, real enterprise(s), but, principally, the position of the trainer {{and the way in which}} training messages are communicated. In OW-learning, the trainer's role is merely subsidiary (known as [...] "scaffolding" [...] in activity theory). In other words, it is not the trainer/instructor, but [...] "the object that teaches".|$|E

This conclusion applies to the generation of new organisms from parental ones. However, what about the very first life forms?

However, the enormous power and ammunition requirements for the piece resulted in <b>it</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two trailers in support - one for power, and one for ammunition - and a crew with a small crane in order to reload the two ammunition drums. With only 28 rounds available in the drums, and an 80-90 rounds/minute fire rate, reloading was a frequent task. It took a crew between ten and fifteen minutes to reload.|$|R
25|$|The United States Air Force's (USAF) {{competition}} for a helicopter {{to be used}} for support on missile bases included a specific requirement to mandate the use of the General Electric T58 turboshaft as a powerplant. The Air Force had a large inventory of these engines on hand for its fleet of HH-3 Jolly Green Giant rescue helicopters and using the same engine for both helicopters would save costs. In response, Bell proposed an upgraded version of the 204B with the T58 engine. Because the T58 output shaft is at the rear, and was thus mounted in front of the transmission on the HH-3, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a separate offset gearbox (SDG or speed decreaser gearbox) at the rear, and shafting to couple to the UH-1 transmission.|$|R
