Ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins also ran an 8-week promotion of the film, selling products such as Shrek's Hot Sludge Sundae, a combination of Oreo Cookies 'n Cream ice cream, hot fudge, crushed chocolate cookies, whipped cream and squiggly <b>gummy</b> worms, and Shrek Freeze Frame Cake, featuring an image of Shrek and Donkey framed by sunflowers. This was to support the film's DVD/VHS release.|$|E
5|$|Authentic bird's nest soup is {{made from}} the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), Aerodramus fuciphagus, and the black-nest swiftlet, Aerodramus maximus. Instead of {{incorporating}} twigs, feathers and straw like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their <b>gummy</b> saliva, which harden when exposed to air. Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these Aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on their populations. The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.|$|E

25|$|Gasolines {{are also}} treated with metal deactivators, which are {{compounds}} that sequester (deactivate) metal salts that otherwise accelerate {{the formation of}} <b>gummy</b> residues. The metal impurities might arise from the engine itself or as contaminants in the fuel.|$|E
25|$|Commonly {{processed}} materials include {{soft and}} hard steels, aluminum, bronze, brass, ceramics, and chrome. Note that <b>gummy</b> grades of stainless steel, aluminum, {{and all but}} the hardest grades of plastic are much tougher for this process. The gumminess problem can be overcome with special oil based cutting fluids. Also, the process does not work well on thin-walled workpieces owing to a tendency to expand when the tool is inserted.|$|E

25|$|<b>Gummy,</b> sticky resin {{deposits}} {{result from}} oxidative degradation of gasoline upon long term storage. These harmful deposits {{arise from the}} oxidation of alkenes and other minor components in gasoline (see drying oils). Improvements in refinery techniques have generally reduced the susceptibility of gasolines to these problems. Previously, catalytically or thermally cracked gasolines are most susceptible to oxidation. The formation of these gums is accelerated by copper salts, which can be neutralized by additives called metal deactivators.|$|E
25|$|Rubber was {{introduced}} to Europe and America and created a shift in shoes from the pattens and clogs to the galosh. The galosh was soft and <b>gummy</b> in warm weather and hard and stiff in the cold. The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy looking, {{as though they were}} held on by suction cups, for the leather barely covered the toes and hardly gripped the heel.|$|E

25|$|It {{can be one}} of {{the most}} {{abundant}} predators in coastal waters in summer and, in southeast Tasmania, there is a high abundance of elasmobranches including the <b>gummy</b> shark in coastal regions in summer. In New Zealand, it is also one of the most common inshore sharks. While it is mainly a nocturnal forager, it may opportunistically feed on prey casually found during the day, however, research in 2010, found even amounts of activity during day and night. During this research, this shark was consistently detected at all depths from bottom to near surface whereas it was the substrate during the day. It also found that as Norfolk Bay does not have adequate shelter cover, this species may use group formation to avoid predation.|$|E
500|$|Various {{companies}} {{profited from}} the attention surrounding Knut by developing themed {{products such as}} ringtones and cuddly toys. [...] Plush toy company Steiff produced several Knut-based plush toys in three sizes and models: sitting, standing, and lying down. The first 2,400 produced toys, which sold exclusively at the Berlin Zoo, sold out in only four days. [...] The money raised from the Steiff deal {{was intended to be}} used to renovate the polar bear enclosure at the zoo. Candy company Haribo released a raspberry-flavored <b>gummy</b> bear sweet called Cuddly Knut beginning in April 2007. They pledged to donate ten cents to the zoo for every tub of Knut sweets it sold. The <b>gummy</b> bears sold so well that the Bonn-based company had to expand production to a second factory to deal with demand.|$|E

500|$|Harmless to humans, the whiskery shark is fished commercially for its meat, {{which is}} sold fresh. It {{is one of}} the shark species marketed as [...] "flake". Along with the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and the <b>gummy</b> shark (Mustelus antarcticus), it is {{targeted}} by a shark fishery operating off Western Australia, currently managed as the Western Australian Joint Authority Southern Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fishery. The fishery began in the 1940s with a small number of demersal longline vessels, though the whiskery shark was not caught in substantial numbers until the 1970s, with the introduction of monofilament gillnets, hydraulic net haulers, and additional vessels. Catches peaked in the early 1980s, when 400–600 tons were taken annually. Overfishing reduced the population to <30% of pre-exploitation levels by the mid-1980s, prompting the Western Australian government to enact a management plan that stabilized the population at 25–30% of pre-exploitation levels.|$|E
500|$|The party pressed onward on August 30, {{having no}} alternative. [...] In {{the heat of}} the day, the {{moisture}} underneath the salt crust rose to the surface and turned the soil to a <b>gummy</b> mass. [...] The wheels of their wagons sank into it, in some cases up to the hubs. [...] The days were blisteringly hot and the nights frigid. Several of the group saw visions of lakes and wagon trains, and believed that they had finally overtaken Hastings. After three days, the water was gone, and some of the party removed their oxen from the wagons to press ahead to find more. Some of the animals were so weakened they were left yoked to the wagons and abandoned. Nine of Reed's ten oxen broke free, crazed with thirst, and bolted off into the desert. Many other families' cattle and horses had also gone missing. The rigors of the journey resulted in irreparable damage to some of the wagons, but no human lives had been lost. [...] Instead of the promised two days journey over 40 miles, the journey across the 80 miles of Great Salt Lake Desert had taken six.|$|E

500|$|John Anderson of Los Angeles Times commented [...] "Spears acquits {{herself as}} well as anyone might, in a movie as {{contrived}} and lazy as this one". Chris Kaltenbach of Baltimore Sun said, [...] "go see Crossroads if you want to hear Britney sing or see her wear next-to-nothing. But otherwise, avoid this train wreck at all costs". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, however, gave the movie a positive review, commenting Crossroads [...] "not only makes excellent use of the singer's sweetly coltish acting abilities, but it also promotes a standardized set of sturdy values with none of Mariah Carey's desperate Glitter, or any of Mandy Moore's <b>gummy</b> pap in A Walk to Remember". Bret Fetzer of Amazon.com also gave a positive review, noting that the movie [...] "could have been trite schmaltz, but the script has some grit and the direction is fresh and relaxed--and, most significantly, Spears is far more sympathetic and engaging than you might expect". Jane Crowther of BBC applauded Cattrall and Aykroyd's interactions with the characters, and said that [...] "Spears manages to come across on film as natural, endearing, and extremely likable". Time named it one of the top 10 worst chick flicks.|$|E
500|$|Adam LaClave and Paul Meany {{were the}} primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message. For example, the song [...] "Said the Sun" [...] is an allegory about God telling Christians to be {{carriers}} of light. [...] "Whitehorse" [...] was written to present {{a different view of}} the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, [...] "Most people, when they hear the term [...] "white horse," [...] think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [...]" [...] The men's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write [...] "Gummy Buffalo"; he found himself in a candy store and squeezed a <b>gummy</b> buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in [...] "Foreign" [...] may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records. The lyrics read [...] "There's no place in your world for me / I've been from sea to shining sea / And I can't retain your policies, excuse me / If I'm just hanging around, I'm foreign." ...|$|E
