5|$|Hastert {{suffers from}} {{diabetes}} and requires daily insulin injections. Because of his condition, <b>he</b> <b>sometimes</b> walked with protective coverings {{on his feet}} to avoid foot problems.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle further {{noted that}} there are many bird forms within the bird kind – cranes, eagles, crows, bustards, sparrows, and so on, just as there are many forms of fishes within the fish kind. <b>He</b> <b>sometimes</b> called these atomon eidos, {{indivisible}} forms. Human is one of these indivisible forms: Socrates {{and the rest of us}} are all different individually, but we all have human form.|$|E
60|$|Q. Doth God always answer presently?--A. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> doth, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> doth not (Isa 30:19; Dan 10:12).|$|R
60|$|Cartwright nodded. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> used tact, but <b>he</b> was <b>sometimes</b> brutally frank.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is very ill, sir. He {{is badly}} wounded, and is unconscious. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> lies for hours without moving; <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> talks to himself but, as I cannot {{understand}} the language, I know not what <b>he</b> says; but <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> certainly calls upon you. He uses your name often.|$|R
5|$|According to Vid Gaković, who was {{a member}} of National Unity in 1914, Stojanović was an ambitious and talented young man. He was {{determined}} that his voice would be heard and he liked being the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom <b>he</b> <b>sometimes</b> sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students liked being around him. Gaković described him as a tall and handsome man who greatly cared about his appearance; he wore a bow tie and a broad-brimmed hat.|$|E
5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. <b>He</b> <b>sometimes</b> repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, the finished product quite often was different from the original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E
5|$|Billy, though experienced, {{is still}} {{somewhat}} goofy and absent-minded. <b>He</b> <b>sometimes</b> helps Harry with scenes and Harry tries {{to convince him}} too {{that he is an}} actor and not a prostitute. On several occasions, Billy picks up men only to discover that the man is not actually his client. In one case he and the man fall in love and they plan to get Billy out of the business and start a life together. Shortly thereafter, Billy mistakes a man (Michael Haynes) for a client in a public restroom and that man stabs him to death.|$|E
5000|$|... : [...] "Yes, man is mortal, {{but that}} would be only half the trouble. The worst of it is that <b>he's</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{unexpectedly}} mortal—there's the trick!" [...] -To Berlioz ...|$|R
50|$|Symeon {{played all}} sorts of roles foolish and indecent, but {{language}} {{is not sufficient to}} paint a picture of his doings. For <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> pretended to have a limp, <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> jumped around, <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> dragged himself along on his buttocks, <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> stuck out his foot for someone running and tripped him. Other times when there was a new moon, he looked at the sky and fell down and thrashed about.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>he's</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{called the}} Metal Monarch, {{and his name}} is Ruggedo. Lives in some {{underground}} cavern. Claims to own all the metals hidden in the earth. Don't ask me why." ...|$|R
5|$|During filming, Bale became {{angry with}} {{director}} of photography Shane Hurlbut for walking onto a set during a scene; he swore and screamed at Hurlbut {{and threatened to}} leave the film. Audio of Bale's tirade leaked {{to the public and}} went viral. Bale apologized publicly and said he resolved his differences with Hurlbut, explaining that <b>he</b> <b>sometimes</b> has a problem with someone walking on set, and that when the incident took place they continued to work together for a number of hours that day.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that <b>he</b> <b>sometimes</b> intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. <b>He</b> <b>sometimes</b> worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes <b>he</b> did, <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> didn't--which was latterly. For he's {{the sort}} that takes all and gives naught, he is--or used to be." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Since {{the first}} living thing gazed upward through the darkness, Man has seldom been content merely to be born, to endure, and to die. With a curious fervor he has {{struggled}} to unlock the mysteries of creation and {{of the world in}} which <b>he</b> lives. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> has won. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> has lost. And sometimes, in the tumbling torrents of space and time, he has brief glimpses of a world he never even dreams..." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a tribute}} by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on April 15, 2006, {{he said of}} Tan, [...] "He makes very good speeches in Parliament. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>he</b> draws blood... <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> has {{offended}} ministers, but he has spoken his mind." ...|$|R
5|$|Interspersed {{throughout}} his scientific essays for Natural History magazine, Gould frequently {{referred to his}} nonscientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected baseball cards and remained a New York Yankees fan {{throughout his}} life. As an adult {{he was fond of}} science fiction movies, but often deplored their poor storytelling and presentation of science. His other interests included singing baritone in the Boston Cecilia, and he was a great aficionado of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He collected rare antiquarian books, possessed an enthusiasm for architecture, and enjoyed city walks. He often traveled to Europe, and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. <b>He</b> <b>sometimes</b> alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.|$|E
5|$|John Wark (born 4 August 1957) is a Scottish former footballer {{who spent}} most of his playing time with Ipswich Town. He won a record four Player of the Year awards before {{becoming}} one of the four inaugural members of the club's Hall of Fame. Wark had long spells at the club, which bookended his career, and a third, brief interlude dividing his briefer periods at Liverpool and Middlesbrough. A versatile player, Wark played most of his professional games as a midfielder, although <b>he</b> <b>sometimes</b> played as a central defender and on occasion as a striker.|$|E
5|$|Lamarck {{proposed}} the transmutation of species ("transformisme"), {{but did not}} believe that all living things shared a common ancestor. Rather he believed that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force, which <b>he</b> <b>sometimes</b> described as a nervous fluid, drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity similar to the mediaeval great chain of being.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a big gray wolf--a timber-wolf, or lofer, as <b>he's</b> <b>sometimes</b> called," [...] replied Dale. [...] "He's high on some rocky {{ridge back}} there. He scents us, an' he doesn't like it.... There he goes again. Listen! Ah, he's hungry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Worse than a liar {{was this}} foolish puffin. [...] He hunted badly. When he flung the spear [...] The seals would laugh {{before they went}} away. [...] <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> missed, <b>{{sometimes}}</b> <b>he</b> tipped the nose, [...] Sometimes hit the wrong animal, [...] And sometimes touched the tail. [...] Amna ajah ajah hey!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't say {{anything}} if it wasn't {{that you were}} like brothers," [...] she said. [...] "But he did begin to have dreadful drinking bouts. You know it was always spirits, and generally brandy:—and that makes such work with them. You've no idea what he's like when <b>he's</b> evil-drunk. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> all for talk, <b>sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> laughing at everything, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> just snappy. And then——" [...] here her tones grew ominous, [...] "——he'll come home evil-drunk." ...|$|R
5|$|Linnaeus {{began his}} {{expedition}} from Uppsala on May 12, 1732, {{just before he}} turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near Gävle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. <b>He</b> <b>sometimes</b> dismounted {{on the way to}} examine a flower or rock and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland.|$|E
5|$|Noda is a {{self-reliant}} {{young man}} who executes the strategies formed by the SSS and fights with a halberd. He does not listen to anyone other than Yuri, for whom he has adoration, and is antagonistic to almost everyone else. He has a one-sided rivalry with Otonashi. He is a complete idiot whose weakness is education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He {{is not afraid to}} harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way. Though he prefers to fight with his halberd, <b>he</b> <b>sometimes</b> uses guns out of necessity, the type of weaponry that he hates.|$|E
5|$|Shiina, {{given name}} unknown, {{otherwise}} {{referred to by}} his nickname , is another adult friend of Shuichi and Yoshino. He was Yuki's classmate in elementary school, and he eventually became her boyfriend after her transition. Unlike Yuki, Shiina had many friends in school. He generally just watches over Shuichi and Yoshino with Yuki, but <b>he</b> <b>sometimes</b> does bold and unexpected things, such as grabbing Yoshino's crotch when he first meets Yoshino because he feared that, because Yoshino was dressed as a boy at the time, Yuki might be having an illicit affair with Yoshino.|$|E
50|$|Anansi is {{depicted}} in many different ways. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> looks like an ordinary spider, <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> is a spider wearing clothes or with a human face and <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> looks much more like a human with spider elements, such as eight legs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brooding?" [...] he {{said with}} a smile. [...] "Well, it has been very dull lately and we need cheering up. Suppose you send Mr. Fuller a note and ask him to dinner to-morrow? <b>He's</b> <b>sometimes</b> amusing and I think you like him." ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{everybody}} had gone home, Dr. Alec paced {{up and down}} the lower hall in the twilight for an hour, thinking so intently that <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> frowned, <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> smiled, and more than once he stood still in a brown study. All of a sudden he said, half aloud, as if he had made up his mind, ...|$|R
5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together. Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them. This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical depth to his work; <b>he</b> <b>sometimes</b> devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E
5|$|Umboh was {{an authoritarian}} perfectionist, who often reshot scenes he felt flawed and refused {{input from the}} actors. <b>He</b> <b>sometimes</b> worked {{together}} with other directors, including Sjumandjaja, Misbach Yusa Biran, and Arifin C. Noer, to improve the film's flow. These collaborations influenced {{the atmosphere of the}} films; for example, films shot with Noer like Sesuatu yang Indah (Something Beautiful; 1976) came across as surrealistic, while collaborations with Sjumandjaja were more realistic. Shooting scripts were often prepared minutes before shooting, but, according to Karya, Umboh memorised each line of dialogue and used his recollection during dubbing.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} the Sibiu-based Astra {{magazine}} Transilvania (where <b>he</b> <b>sometimes</b> used the signature AG), Agârbiceanu remained the editor of Patria until 1927, and also resumed his collaboration with Viața Românească. However, he was disappointed by the cultural and economic decline which came {{as a consequence of}} Transylvania's incorporation: the local press, he noted, had largely lost its purpose and could not hope to survive competition. As noted by reviewers from Ilie Rad to Răzvan Voncu, some of Agârbiceanu's more valuable work saw print in minor provincial reviews.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh yes, for {{the time}} being. I suppose he's very much in earnest with Miss Vance at times, and with Miss Dryfoos at others. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> a painter, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> an architect, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> a sculptor. He has too many gifts--too many tastes." ...|$|R
