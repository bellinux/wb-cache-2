5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} {{how hard it is}} to score against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say to do justice to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.|$|E
5|$|The only soundtrack album {{released}} for {{the game}} was Xenosaga III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, an album of selections from the soundtrack rather {{than all of the}} tracks. The two-disc album has 40 tracks, and a total length of 1:51:46. It was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album reached position #50 on the Japanese Oricon charts, and stayed on the charts for four weeks. In the liner notes for the album, sound producer Keiichi Nozaki explains that the album would <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be six discs long to hold all of the music from the game, so he asked Kajiura to select a sample that would only fill two discs.|$|E

5|$|The work {{eventually}} cost Â£211,000; {{it began}} in 1861, {{with the majority of}} the work being completed by 1870 and the additional iron shielding by 1874. In peacetime, the castle held around 131 officers and men but it would <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be substantially reinforced during wartime if all the weapons were to be manned. Although the fort never received its full complement of guns, by 1881 it had ten 12.5 inch, 38 ton (317mm, 39,000kg) rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns, fifteen 10 inch, 18 ton (254mm, 18,000kg) RML guns, five 9 inch, 12 ton (228mm, 12,000kg) RML guns, and 3 64-pounders (29kg), together forming a powerful arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Turner only {{learned that}} Stacey was Archie's killer {{half an hour}} before the episode aired, in a bid by the {{production}} team to maintain the storyline's secrecy. 51 EastEnders cast members appeared in the episode, with several expressing trepidation about performing live prior to the broadcast. Cast members had two weeks to rehearse the episode, with one rehearsal filmed in case of any serious problems during transmission. When Turner fell ill with the flu on the day of broadcast, it was feared the producers may <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> use the pre-recorded tape, but in the event she recovered enough to appear.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E

5|$|As part {{of these}} works, the Peddars Way was redirected. It had {{previously}} run straight across the de Warenne estates, but it was now diverted so that travellers coming from the south {{had to leave the}} main road, progress west around the priory and the castle fishpond, before reaching {{the southern end of the}} walled town and the route to the north. If they intended to enter the castle, they would <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> enter through the town's western gate, then the castle's gatehouse, before probably passing through a ceremonial sequence of rooms in order to finally meet the lord. The route was designed to highlight the important symbols of the de Warenne lordship of the region and provide a dramatic view of the castle, and may have been a response to the political uncertainties of the Anarchy years.|$|E
5|$|In 1118, Henry {{returned}} north {{over the}} Alps into Germany to suppress fresh rebellions, leaving Matilda as his regent to govern Italy. There are few records of her rule {{over the next}} two years, but she probably gained considerable practical experience of government. In 1119, she returned north to meet Henry in Lotharingia. Her husband was occupied in finding a compromise with the Pope, who had excommunicated him. In 1122, Henry and probably Matilda were at the Council of Worms. The council settled the long-running dispute with the Church when Henry gave up his rights to invest bishops with their episcopal regalia. Matilda attempted to visit her father in England that year, but the journey was blocked by Charles I, Count of Flanders, whose territory she would <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> pass through. Historian Marjorie Chibnall argues Matilda had intended to discuss the inheritance of the English crown on this journey.|$|E
5|$|Wotton {{station was}} {{situated}} in open countryside, about one mile (1.6km) {{from the nearest}} settlement of Wotton Underwood, which in 1871 had a population of around 220. Roughly halfway between the line's terminus at Brill and the junction with the main line at Quainton Road, the station marked the official midpoint of the line for operating purposes. When more than one locomotive was in operation on the line, the Tramway operated a token signalling system using colour-coded staffs; drivers on the section between Quainton Road and Wotton were obliged to carry a blue staff; those between Wotton and Brill (and the Kingswood siding) a red staff. The station was situated on a sharp curve; had the extension to Oxford been built, the station would <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> have been resited to accommodate longer and faster trains.|$|E

5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then would a privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|E

25|$|A study {{published}} by Roger Seymour in 2013 added more {{support to the}} idea that dinosaurs were endothermic.

Seymour reasoned that dinosaurs would <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be endothermic since they would have needed powerful muscles and endurance to compete with and dominate mammals throughout the Mesozoic era.|$|E
