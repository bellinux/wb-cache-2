5|$|In its raw form, {{tungsten}} {{is a hard}} {{steel-grey metal}} that is often brittle and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which <b>exceeds</b> <b>that</b> of many steels), and becomes malleable enough {{that it can be}} worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering.|$|E
5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as {{sodium arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood {{but have been}} less frequently used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now <b>exceeds</b> <b>that</b> of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E

5|$|Major League Soccer {{was founded}} in 1993 {{as part of the}} United States' {{successful}} bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The first season took place in 1996 with ten teams. MLS experienced financial and operational struggles in its first few years: The league lost millions of dollars, teams played in mostly empty American football stadiums, and two teams folded in 2002. Since then, MLS has expanded to 22 teams, owners built soccer-specific stadiums, average MLS attendance <b>exceeds</b> <b>that</b> of the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA), MLS secured national TV contracts, and the league is now profitable.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women <b>exceeds</b> <b>that</b> in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E

5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity <b>exceeds</b> <b>that</b> of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|Portsmouth, as {{the most}} densely {{populated}} city in the United Kingdom, is the only city whose population density <b>exceeds</b> <b>that</b> of London. As of the 2011 census, the city had 205,400 residents. This equates to 5,100 people living in every square kilometre (0.4 sq.mi.), which is eleven {{times more than the}} regional average of 440 people per square kilometre and more than London, which has 4,900 people per square kilometre. The city used to be even more densely populated, with the 1951 census showing a population of 233,545. In a reversal of that decrease, the population of the city has been gradually increasing since the 1990s. With about 860,000 residents, the South Hampshire built-up area is the fifth-largest urban area in England and the largest in South East England, forming the centre of one of the United Kingdom's most populous metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|Three or {{four months}} before the release of Little Busters!, {{it was decided that}} an adult version of the game would be {{developed}} titled , or Little Busters-EX for short. Na-Ga designed the heroine Saya Tokido and Maeda wrote her scenario. Tonokawa wrote Sasami Sasasegawa's scenario, and Shirokiri wrote Kanata Futaki's story. Lines from the original game were rewritten as well for Ecstasy, and the total number of lines with spoken dialogue comes to 43,347 lines. The total word count in Ecstasy <b>exceeds</b> <b>that</b> of Clannad by about 4,000 words, making it Key's longest work, and carries so much data that Ecstasy was released on two DVDs instead of one for the original release.|$|E

5|$|Antananarivo {{has been}} the largest city on the island {{since at least the}} late 18th century, when its {{population}} was estimated at 15,000. By 1810, the population had grown to 80,000 before declining dramatically between 1829 and 1842 during the reigns of Radama I and especially Ranavalona I. Because of a combination of war, forced labor, disease and harsh measures of justice, the population of Imerina fell from 750,000 to 130,000 during this period. In the final years of the Kingdom of Imerina, the population had recovered to between 50,000 and 75,000; most of the population were slaves who were largely captured in provincial military campaigns. In 1950, Antananarivo's population was around 175,000. By the late 1990s the population of the metropolitan area had reached 1.4 million, and – while the city itself now has a population (2013) of about 1,300,000 – with suburbs lying outside the city limits it had grown to almost 2.1 million in 2013. The metropolitan area is thus home to 10 percent of the island's residents. Rural migration to the capital propels this growth; the city's population <b>exceeds</b> <b>that</b> of the other five provincial capitals combined.|$|E
