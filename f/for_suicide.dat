5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard <b>for</b> <b>suicide</b> as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Athens, {{a person}} who {{committed}} suicide without {{the approval of the}} state was denied the honors of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, {{on the outskirts of the}} city, without a headstone or marker. However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat. In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a crime against the state due to its economic costs. Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent. In Rome some reasons <b>for</b> <b>suicide</b> include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, guilt over murdering someone, to save the life of another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from intolerable situations like physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.|$|E

30|$|The {{parameters}} such as age, gender, the social, economic, {{educational and}} professional status of suicide victims {{play a significant}} role towards the suicidal behavior.

The brief study of risk factors <b>for</b> <b>suicides</b> and means of suicides with respect to age category and gender is presented in the next subsection.|$|R
5000|$|A {{frequent}} location <b>for</b> <b>suicides</b> is in Aokigahara, a {{forested area}} {{at the base of}} Mount Fuji. In the period leading up to 1988, around 30 suicides occurred there every year. [...] In 1999, 74 occurred, the record until 2002 when 78 suicides were found. That record was eclipsed the following year when 105 bodies were found in 2003. The area is patrolled by police looking <b>for</b> <b>suicides.</b> Police records show that, in 2010, there were 247 suicide attempts (54 of which were fatal) in the forest.|$|R
25|$|Hanging is {{a common}} method <b>for</b> <b>suicide.</b> The {{materials}} necessary <b>for</b> <b>suicide</b> by hanging are readily available to the average person, compared with firearms or poisons. Full suspension is not required, and for this reason, hanging is especially commonplace among suicidal prisoners (see suicide watch). A type of hanging comparable to full suspension hanging may be obtained by self-strangulation using a ligature around the neck and the partial weight of the body (partial suspension) to tighten the ligature. When a suicidal hanging involves partial suspension the deceased is found to have both feet touching the ground, e.g., they are kneeling, crouching or standing.|$|E
