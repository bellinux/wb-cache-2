40|$|A {{cohort study}} {{was carried out}} on 112 {{breeding}} pig farms in England to investigate the impact of type of <b>farrowing</b> <b>accommodation</b> on preweaning mortality in piglets. Four types of <b>farrowing</b> <b>accommodation</b> were studied; farrowing crates, indoor loose pens, crate/loose systems (where the sow was restrained in a crate during birth and {{the first days of}} lactation before being moved to a loose pen) and outdoor farrowing in arcs in paddocks. Four estimates of preweaning mortality were collected: an oral estimate from the farmer before the visit, an estimate from the 6 -month rolling average from computer records, records from 20 litters observed when the farm was visited and prospective records collected from 20 farrowings after the visit. These four estimates were significantly correlated. The prospective records also included a farmer reported date and cause of death. From the prospective data there were 25, 031 piglets from 2143 litters from 112 farms, 6. 5 % of piglets were stillborn while live born preweaning mortality was 12 %. Mixed effect discrete time survival, binomial and competing risk, models were used to investigate the association between preweaning mortality and <b>farrowing</b> <b>accommodation,</b> controlling for sow parity, litter size and number of piglets stillborn and fostered. There was a reduced risk of stillbirths in outdoor farrowing systems compared with crated systems. Farmers reported that crushing of healthy piglets was the most frequent cause of death accounting for 55 % of live born preweaning mortality. There {{was no significant difference in}} mortality in live born piglets by farrowing system. There was a significantly higher risk of farmer reported crushing of healthy live born piglets in outdoor arcs compared with piglets reared with sows in farrowing crates and a significantly reduced risk of death from causes other than crushing in piglets reared outdoors or in crate/loose systems compared with piglets reared in crated systems. We conclude that, in the farms in this study, farrowing crates reduced the risk of preweaning live born mortality attributable to crushing but piglets in this system were at increased risk of death from other causes. Consequently crates had no significant effect on overall preweaning mortality percentage. In all four commercial production systems; outdoor, farrowing crates, crate/loose farrowing systems and indoor loose housed systems, there were similar levels of mortality...|$|E
40|$|Se compararon tres tipos de parideras y dos épocas de parto de las cerdas en un establecimiento porcino al aire libre. Los tipos de parideras fueron: FA: Parideras de frente abierto de mampostería; AR: Parideras de campo tipo arco; UNRC: Parideras de campo mejoradas, diseño U. N. R. C. Las {{variables}} registradas fueron: Lechones nacidos vivos (NLeNV); Lechones destetados (NLeD); Peso promedio (Kg) de los lechones al destete (PLeD); Lechones muertos nacimiento - destete (NLeMN-D); Porcentaje de mortalidad de lechones nacimiento - destete (%MLeN-D); Número ordinal de partos para cada cerda (NOP). Las épocas de parto fueron Otoño - Invierno (O-I) y Primavera - Verano (P-V). Las condiciones de manejo y alimentación fueron similares para todos los tipos de parideras. Cada cerda y su camada constituyeron una repetición, las que se acumularon en el tiempo con cerdas de un mismo origen genético, asignadas al azar a cada tratamiento. La interacción Tipo de Parideras x EP no fue significativa (p = 0, 89). El %MLeN-D y NLeMN-D fue menor en la paridera UNRC (p 0, 05) entre los dos tipos de parideras de campo. El PLeD fue mayor (p Three farrowing facility {{types and}} two farrowing seasons were compared. The farrowing facility types were: FA: Open front <b>farrowing</b> <b>accommodation</b> with masonry walls and concrete floors; AR: Farrowing arc huts, {{in number of}} eight; UNRC: Improved farrowing huts. The following variables were registered: Piglets born alive (NLeNV); Piglets weaned (NLeD); Average (Kg.) weaning weight (PLeD); Number of piglets died between farrowing and weaning (NLeMN-D); Piglet's mortality in percentage (%MLeN-D); Sows parities numbers (NOP). Feeding and management were similar for all treatments. Each sow and her litter were taken as a replication, which were accumulated over time, with sows of the same genetic origin assigned at random to each <b>farrowing</b> <b>accommodation</b> type. Farrowing season (EP) were: Autumn - Winter (A-W) and Spring - Summer (S - S). The interaction Farrowing Facility Types x EP was not significative (p = 0, 89). The %MLeN-D and NLeMN-D, were lower (p 0, 05) between the two farrowing hut types. PLeD was bigger (p< 0. 05) for the UNRC farrowing hut, with no differences between AR and FA farrowing facility types. With regard to farrowing season (EP) the %MLeN-D was bigger (p = 0, 024) during A - W (20, 68 % ± 1, 57), compared with the S - S season (15, 22 % ± 1, 19) ...|$|E
40|$|Newborn piglets {{in organic}} {{farrowing}} pens {{have a lower}} survival rate than in conventional farrowing pens. This difference is mainly caused by housing the sow loose compared to crated and by climatic effects of the outdoor temperature. Organic lactating sows {{should have at least}} 7. 5 m² indoor area with straw and a 2. 5 m² outdoor run. The aim of the project was to increase piglet survival in order to improve animal welfare as well as the profitability of organic farms. In the experiment we compared survival and behaviour in 3 pen types: type 1 with outdoor run, type 2 with an indoor run and a higher proportion of solid floor and type 3 without run. Data was analysed with Analysis of Variance using parity and liveborn piglets as covariables. Results of 131 litters in total showed 9. 6 a, 10. 8 b and 9. 4 a (p= 0. 05) weaned piglets per litter for pen type 1, 2 and 3. Fouling scores indicating dunging behaviour in the indoor lying area showed 13 a, 21 b and 19 b (p= 0. 04) for pen types 1, 2 and 3. We found a tendency that litters with high survival rates used the separate piglet nest sooner for lying than the litters with low survival rates. Climatic conditions seemed to be crucial for the vitality and survival of the newborn piglets. The better climatic conditions combined with the higher proportion of solid floor resulted in a higher survival rate of the piglets. These results are currently used in a second experiment focussing on extra heating around farrowing and solid floor proportion in a new <b>farrowing</b> <b>accommodation.</b> ...|$|E
