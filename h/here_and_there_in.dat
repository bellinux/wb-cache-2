5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E

25|$|The trochaic tetrameter catalecticfour {{pairs of}} trochees per line, {{with the final}} {{syllable}} omittedwas identified by Aristotle as the original meter of tragic dialogue (Poetics 1449a21). Euripides however employs it <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> his later plays. He {{seems not to have}} used it in his early plays at all, The Trojan Women being the earliest appearance of it in an extant play—it is symptomatic of a curious archaizing tendency evident in his later works.|$|E
25|$|Building on Tatum's pianism and aesthetics, Peterson also absorbed Tatum's musical influences, notably from piano concertos by Sergei Rachmaninoff. Rachmaninoff's harmonizations, as well {{as direct}} {{quotations}} from his 2nd Piano Concerto, are thrown in <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> many recordings by Peterson, including his work with the most familiar formulation of the Oscar Peterson Trio, with bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Herb Ellis. During the 1960s and 1970s Peterson made numerous trio recordings highlighting his piano performances that reveal more of his eclectic style that absorbed influences from various genres of jazz, popular and classical music.|$|E
25|$|He wrote {{at length}} on {{the unity of}} judgment, on the {{different}} kinds of negation, and on the difference between unconditional and conditional necessity. In his doctrine of syllogisms he brought forward the proof for the conversion of universal affirmative judgments, differed from Aristotle <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the laying down and arranging the modi of the syllogisms, partly in the proof of them, partly in the doctrine of mixture, i.e. of the influence of the modality of the premises upon the modality of the conclusion. Then, in two separate works, he dealt with the reduction of arguments to the syllogistic form and on the resolution of them; and further, with hypothetical conclusions. For the doctrine of proof, Galen quotes the second Analytic of Theophrastus, in conjunction with that of Aristotle, as the best treatises on that doctrine. In different monographs he seems to have tried to expand it into a general theory of science. To this, too, may have belonged the proposition quoted from his Topics, that the principles of opposites are themselves opposed, and cannot be deduced from one and the same higher genus. For the rest, some minor deviations from the Aristotelian definitions are quoted from the Topica of Theophrastus. Closely connected with this treatise was that upon ambiguous words or ideas, which, without doubt, corresponded to book Ε of Aristotle's Metaphysics.|$|E

2500|$|Science {{writers and}} skeptics have {{suggested}} that the evidence for Cayce's alleged psychic powers comes from contemporaneous newspaper articles, affidavits, anecdotes, testimonials, and books. Martin Gardner, for example, wrote that while Cayce's trances did happen, most of the information from his trances was derived from books that Cayce had been reading by authors such as Carl Jung, P. D. Ouspensky, and Helena Blavatsky. Gardner's hypothesis was that the trance readings of Cayce contain, [...] "little bits of information gleaned from <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the occult literature, spiced with occasional novelties from Cayce's unconscious." ...|$|E

This is what we grow to look for in Hall Caine, the tenderness and the tragedy of humanity.

Jaysburg served as the de facto county seat for several years after Williamsport was [...] "officially" [...] named the seat of government for Lycoming County. This delay became a cause for concern to the residents of county and the state government in Philadelphia. The county commissioners delayed in constructing a courthouse and jail in Williamsport until 1799. The jail was finally opened in 1801. Next the commissioners approved the construction of the county courthouse in Williamsport. Construction also began in 1800 and work was completed in late 1804, nearly ten years after Williamsport was named the county seat.|$|E
2500|$|Pendelton {{and other}} rodeos {{cancelled}} celebrations {{because of the}} war. [...] With professional rodeo women cut from the picture, amateur cowgirls stepped in to fill the void. It was during this period that informal all-girl rodeos were held <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the southwest to provide entertainment for the troops. [...] In 1942, Fay Kirkwood staged what was billed as an all-girl rodeo in Bonham, Texas but the program was actually an exhibition rather than a competition. [...] Vaughn Kreig produced an all-girl rodeo {{about the same time}} with 8 of its 19 events listed as contests. Neither rodeos featured rodeo queens, perhaps as a general protest against the role of rodeo queens. [...] Cowgirls felt such contests deflected attention from the cowgirl athlete and focused it on the pretty daughters of local boosters instead. [...] Women's barrel racing at Madison Square Garden in 1942 led to that contest's acceptance in rodeo.|$|E
