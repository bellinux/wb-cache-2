5|$|Gasol {{canceled}} {{his original}} plans {{to observe a}} surgery when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with a low-grade fever {{the day before the}} operation, not wishing to risk infecting anyone at the hospital. He was able to reschedule his observation for June 2010, witnessing Skaggs lead a team operating on a 13-year-old girl from Colorado with scoliosis.|$|E
5|$|After he {{announced}} {{the building of}} the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.|$|E
5|$|Rehman {{was named}} in the Pakistan squad for the 2010 World Cup {{qualifying}} matches against Iraq in October 2007, and played the match in Lahore but could not help contain Asian champions Iraq from winning 7–0. In the second leg on 28 October he captained Pakistan to a 0–0 draw. However, he also had {{to withdraw from the}} squad for the SAFF Championship 2008 when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with food poisoning. After nearly four years out, Rehman returned to the Pakistan team for the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers.|$|E

5|$|On Saturday afternoon, Matt Kenseth was fastest in {{the second}} {{practice}} session {{with a time of}} 30.321 seconds, ahead of Clint Bowyer and Earnhardt. Travis Kvapil was fourth-fastest; David Gilliland was fifth and Biffle sixth. Johnson, Newman, Hornish and Edwards followed in the top ten. Kyle Busch scraped the outside wall while driving up the track; he sustained minor damage and did not switch to a back-up car. Later that day, Kahne paced the final practice session with a time of 30.580 seconds; Edwards was second and Paul Menard third. Gordon was fourth-fastest, ahead of Hendrick Motorsports teammates Johnson and Earnhardt. Reutimann was seventh-fastest, Biffle eighth, Bowyer ninth, and Dave Blaney tenth. Bowyer moved to the outside of the track but was unable to steer left and hit the outside wall leaving turn-two and into the backstretch; <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> the track and Kyle Petty hit Bowyer and damaged his front-left fender before Bowyer's car stopped after he made contact with the inside wall. Bowyer was required to use a back-up car but Petty was able to repair his chassis.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{went back}} to China in November 1934, again serving briefly with the 4th Marines in Shanghai. He was soon reassigned as a {{legation}} guard in Peiping, where he taught the post's pistol and rifle teams to shoot competitively. They won {{at least one major}} competition. He also had time to observe the troops of the Empire of Japan, gaining great respect for their discipline. In 1936, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with a serious case of pneumonia and had to be evacuated from China. His next duty was at Puget Sound Navy Yard. In October 1936, he was promoted to captain. In July 1937 he entered Junior Course, Marine Corps Schools in Quantico, which he completed in May 1938. He then served as an instructor at Quantico for two years. In June 1940 he joined the 6th Marines in San Diego, and was promoted to major in April 1941.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> to posterity.|$|E

5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon. From the second {{ball of the}} innings, bowled by Bedser, Barnes got off the mark to avoid his pair. Coxon took the new ball {{at the other end}} and Barnes and Morris saw it off. In {{contrast}} to their English counterparts, the Australian opening pair took a cautious approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps and established a solid start for themselves. Yardley then introduced Laker, who induced Morris to hit a ball back down the pitch in the air, but the bowler was slow to react to the possibility of a caught and bowled. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers {{would have been able to}} reach the ball and attempt a catch. Barnes survived a missed stumping opportunity from Laker in the same over when he was on 18; <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> the pitch and the ball bounced out of the footmarks and narrowly missed leg stump, but Evans fumbled it, and it went away for four byes.|$|E
25|$|In 1952 the {{previously}} healthy and strong Eri-Aaroni suffered from colic a few times, although with good treatment he recovered well. However, in August 1953 <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with a particularly dramatic case, which was {{further complicated by}} laminitis. Eri-Aaroni died in September 1.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the summer}} of 1969/70 he toured the West Indies with the Australian Schoolboys XI, a team that also {{included}} Gary Gilmour, Gary Cosier and Ian Davis. During the tour <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with chicken pox. He recovered to score 52 against St Kitts.|$|E

25|$|England, {{resuming}} on 104 for 6, lasted 12 overs. James Anderson, the night-watchman, propped {{forward to}} the last ball of the first over. Andrew Strauss had extended his overnight 41 to 56 when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> the pitch to hit Rehman over the legside and was stumped by Adnan Akmal. England led by 42 runs in first innings.|$|E
25|$|Harvey did not {{host the}} show {{full-time}} after April 2008, when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with pneumonia. Shortly after his recovery, {{his wife died}} on May 3, causing him to prolong his time away from broadcasting. He voiced commercials, new episodes of The Rest of the Story and News & Comment during middays {{a few times a}} week, with his son handling mornings.|$|E
25|$|In May 1940, van der Post {{volunteered for}} the British Army and upon {{completion}} of officer training in January 1941 {{he was sent to}} East Africa in the Intelligence Corps as a captain. There he took up with General Wingate's Gideon Force which was tasked with restoring the Emperor Haile Selassie to his throne in Abyssinia. His unit led 11,000 camels through difficult mountain terrain and he was remembered for being an excellent caretaker of the animals. In March <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with malaria and was sent to Palestine to recover.|$|E

25|$|In 1845, Angell began {{studying}} at Brown, {{which at the}} time had a total of only seven instructors on the faculty. He graduated in 1849, and eventually obtained part-time jobs as an Assistant Librarian at the university and tutoring a boy whose eyesight prevented him from reading. In 1850, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with a cold and sore throat, but he refused to give his throat any rest from the daily exertion of reading aloud to his pupil. The resultant damage to his throat would last {{the rest of his life}} and make extended speaking difficult.|$|E
25|$|Iqbal {{is known}} for his stance against Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and has spearheaded {{criticism}} of its leaders, several of whom are undergoing trial at the International Crimes Tribunal for their role in Bangladesh liberation war 1971. Zafar Iqbal's father was allegedly killed by Jamaat leader Delwar Hossain Sayeedi. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> heavily on a section of the media for their stand against holding the 10th parliamentary elections in Bangladesh on 5 January 2013, amid a boycott by the main opposition party, alleging that those who were calling for halting the electoral process were actually trying to ensure the participation of Jamaat-e-Islami in the election.|$|E
25|$|On 10 July, Sir William Waller took post on Roundway Down, {{overlooking}} Devizes, {{and captured}} a Royalist ammunition column from Oxford. On 11 July <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> and invested Hopton's foot in Devizes itself. The Royalist cavalry, Hertford and Maurice with them, rode away towards Salisbury. But although {{the siege of}} Devizes was pressed with such vigour that an assault was fixed for the evening of 13 July, the Cornishmen, Hopton directing the defence from his bed, held out stubbornly. On the afternoon of 13 July, Prince Maurice's horsemen appeared on Roundway Down, having ridden to Oxford, picked up reinforcements there, and returned at full speed to save their comrades.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, he {{can open}} {{a hole in}} the bag, and let some of the light air out; and then <b>he</b> begins to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> slowly.

25|$|The Kemp-Welch {{twins were}} educated at Charterhouse School, and George {{went on to}} Cambridge University, where he won Blues for both cricket and {{association}} football, being captain in both sports. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> from Cambridge in 1931. A brief announcement in The Times on 24 February 1934 indicated that a wedding would take place between Kemp-Welch and a Mrs Diana Lucy Munro (Baldwin); a further announcement on 26 February indicated that the deed had been done quietly on 24 February at Kensington Registry Office. The cause for discretion was that the bride {{was not only the}} daughter of {{one of the leaders of}} the National Government, Stanley Baldwin, but also that the bride, some twelve years Kemp-Welch's senior, had divorced her previous husband Richard Gordon Munro.|$|E
25|$|In 1911 Lawrence was {{introduced}} to Edward Garnett, a publisher's reader, who acted as a mentor, provided further encouragement, and became a valued friend, as did his son David. Throughout these months the young author revised Paul Morel, {{the first draft of}} what became Sons and Lovers. In addition, a teaching colleague, Helen Corke, gave him access to her intimate diaries about an unhappy love affair, which formed the basis of The Trespasser, his second novel. In November 1911, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> with a pneumonia again; once he recovered, Lawrence decided to abandon teaching in order to become a full-time writer. He also broke off an engagement to Louie Burrows, an old friend from his days in Nottingham and Eastwood.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Grylls led {{a team of}} four {{to climb}} {{one of the most}} remote unclimbed peaks in the world in Antarctica, to raise funds for children's charity Global Angels and promote the use of {{alternative}} energies. During this mission the team also aimed to explore the coast of Antarctica by inflatable boat and jetski, part powered by bioethanol, and then to travel across some of the vast ice desert by wind-powered kite-ski and electric powered paramotor. However, the expedition was cut short after Grylls suffered a broken shoulder while kite skiing across a stretch of ice. Travelling at speeds up to 50km/h (30mph), a ski caught on the ice, launching him in the air and breaking his shoulder when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>down.</b> He had to be medically evacuated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fellow named Sabin," [...] he answered. [...] "No one {{you would}} be likely to be {{interested}} in. <b>He</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> from London, and he plays a remarkably fine game. Rather a saturnine-looking personage, isn't he?" ...|$|R
60|$|He laughed himself, but in {{a strangely}} mirthless fashion, and, afraid to trust himself, went up on deck and brooded savagely apart. Nor did <b>he</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to breakfast until the skipper and cook had finished.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's your business, my old cock," [...] said Mowbray. [...] "This youngster {{will be here}} perhaps to-morrow, {{with money}} in both pockets--he takes up his rents as <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down,</b> Mick--think of that, my old friend." ...|$|R
