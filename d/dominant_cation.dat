The pH of groundwater indicates acidic to slightly alkaline in the peri-urban and urban settlements, while in the rural area it shows acidic to moderately alkaline in the dry season. The <b>dominant</b> <b>cation</b> and anion in the rural and urban settlements are Ca 2 + and HCO 3 −, while Na+ and Cl− predominate in the peri-urban during the dry season. In the wet season, pH indicates moderately acidic to slightly alkaline. Sodium and chloride are the <b>dominant</b> <b>cation</b> and anion in peri-urban. The pH is moderately acidic to neutral in the rural, and the <b>dominant</b> <b>cation</b> and anion are Na+ and Cl−.The <b>dominant</b> <b>cation</b> and anion are sodium and bicarbonate in the urban settlement. The seasonal variations of the physicochemical parameters of groundwater {{in the study area}} show that about 95.6 % and 60 % of the sampling sites had pH values below the minimum guideline for drinking water. About 2.2 % of the measured EC and TDS fall under high enrichments of salts and moderately saline, respectively, in both seasons. The TH shows that 4.4 % and 6.9 % of the samples are very hard and moderately hard in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The distribution of chloride shows that 2.2 % of the samples indicate brackish-salt in both seasons, while bicarbonate shows that 84.4 % and 66.7 % of the samples fall under poor zone in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The seasonal paired sample T test shows significant variations among four parameters including pH, Ca 2 +, HCO 3 −, and Mg 2 +. The result of the FA explained 73.5 % and 84.2 % of the total variance in the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Two major factors were extracted, namely salinity and weathering of minerals. The salinity factors result from EC, TDS Na+, K+, Cl−, SO 4 2, and anthropogenic source of pollution from leachates, sewage, and wastewater. The weathering of minerals is due to high loading of Ca 2 +. The mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry shows that more than 95 % and 93 % of the anions and cations are dominated by rock-weathering process in both seasons. The results of the drinking WQI in the dry season range between 10 and 573 and between 9 and 430 in the wet season. Approximately 95.6 % and 2.2 % of the sampling sites have excellent/good water quality, while 2.2 % indicates unsuitable water for drinking in the dry season.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In northwestern Pennsylvania (USA), {{numerous}} abandoned {{natural gas}} wells are producing artesian flows of Fe-contaminated water. The {{origin of the}} polluted water has been generally assumed to be brines from the gas-producing sands. We sampled 20 artesian discharges where iron staining was conspicuous.

The study area {{has a long history}} of coal mining in the lower Allegheny formation; however, the coal beds are generally at higher elevations than the discharges. We propose that AMD formed in the coal mines is infiltrating into lower aquifers, moving outside the lateral limits of mining, and using abandoned gas wells as conduits to the surface. While flowing through the underlying sandstones, the AMD chemistry is modified by contact with siderite, the dominant carbonate mineral in this stratigraphy. This would suggest that current remediation strategies that emphasize plugging the pollution-producing gas wells may be ill-advised because the source of the polluted water is more shallow than currently assumed.
