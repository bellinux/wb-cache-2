40|$|Composting in well-designed {{systems is}} a better way of {{treating}} organic wastes than incineration or landfilling [1, 2, 3]. It retrieves waste materials for reuse in greenhouses or on fields in an environmentally acceptable way. The final products can be used as soil improvers or fertilisers and also to suppress plant pathogens [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The suppressive effects of compost can be enhanced by inoculation with specific strains of biological control agents [9, 10; 11].

In addition to the municipal solid wastes generated in large cities, several hundred tons of agricultural wastes (wine and oil industries, cork, rice hulls, etc.) are produced every year [13]. Unfortunately, the practice of disinfecting soil with methyl bromide or other chemicals is extremely widespread [14, 15].

40|$|Abstract The {{projects}} {{discussed in}} this paper, Galileo and ITER, are two contrasting experiences of Euro-Asian cooperation within Very Large (Public) Scientific Enter-prises. They offer key insights into the deepening relations which have given shape to the rapidly expanding field of Euro-Asian collaborative <b>interregional</b> <b>projects.</b> Cooperative agendas within such "Big Science " endeavors heighten {{the question of the}} political considerations supporting the decision to engage specific forms of international cooperation. As the main driving force behind both projects, the EU's choices have resulted in the establishment of novel and distinct forms of Euro-Asian scientific cooperation. A better understanding of how such Euro-Asian initiatives emerge can logically be garnered by confronting the Euro-Chinese cooperation within Galileo, and the Euro-Japanese partnership within ITER. This comparison will show that the agendas and institutions of these two interregional policies vary greatly. Within the same policy field- in casu Large Scientific Projects- and in relationship to the same region- i. e. East Asia- this study shows that fundamentally different policies are practiced side-by-side. If in both cases Euro-Asian scientific cooperation has provided its participants with renewed leverage and unprecedented opportunities, the exact scope and function of these interregional collaborations range from the merely tactical in the Euro-Chinese Galileo experience, to the substantial in the Euro-Japanese ITER experience...|$|R
40|$|This study {{captures the}} {{significant}} {{regional and national}} knowledge that has been accumulated on measuring violence against women through the <b>interregional</b> <b>project</b> "Enhancing capacities to eradicate violence against women through networking of local knowledge communities". Supported by the United Nations Development Account, this two-year project was coordinated by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), through its Division for Gender Affairs, and implemented by the five regional commissions of the United Nations, {{in cooperation with the}} United Nations Statistical Division and UN-Women. Through the project, more than 30 countries worldwide have been engaged in the development, dissemination and testing of core indicators endorsed by the United Nations Statistical Commission. This process has made a decisive contribution to designing and building consensus around a common methodology to measure and document violence against women. Furthermore, the inclusion of all five regions in piloting the newly-developed tools to measure violence has also ensured that these tools capture a more comprehensive and complex vision of violence as experienced by women across cultures and regions. This report presents an overview of the activities that have taken place in the five regions, and outlines the key outcomes and lessons learned. Through its activities, the <b>interregional</b> <b>project</b> has made the cumulative body of existing knowledge in terms of policies, findings, innovative practices, processes and statistical data available to policymakers, activists and women's organizations. New knowledge was also produced through national studies that examined underexplored sources of data on violence against women. National capacities to collect information on violence against women through official statistics were strengthened through targeted training activities as well as through participation in expert meetings which provided the space for an effective exchange of best practices.

First, infrastructural improvements affect the geographical distribution of economic activities. Second, even when localized, infrastructure investment generates externalities that may diffuse quite far across the economy. These two lessons have two far-reaching policy implications. First, effective infrastructure projects require knowledge on their impacts on the spatial distribution of economic activities. These impacts depend crucially on the specific details of the projects and the specific sources of agglomeration economies they affect.

For {{the last two}} decades, exogenous progesterone administration {{has been used as}} luteal phase support (LPS) in connection with controlled ovarian stimulation combined with use of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trigger for the final maturation of follicles. The introduction of the GnRHa trigger to induce ovulation showed that exogenous progesterone administration without hCG supplementation was insufficient to obtain satisfactory pregnancy rates. This has prompted development of alternative strategies for LPS. Augmenting the local endogenous production of progesterone by the multiple corpora lutea has been one focus with emphasis on one hand to avoid development of ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome and, on the other hand, to provide adequate levels of progesterone to sustain implantation. The present study evaluates the use of micro-dose hCG for LPS support and examines the potential advances and disadvantages. Based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of hCG, the mathematical modelling of the concentration profiles of hCG during the luteal phase has been evaluated in connection with several different approaches for hCG administration as LPS. It is suggested that the currently employed LPS provided in connection with the GnRHa trigger (i. e. 1. 500 IU) is too strong, and that daily micro-dose hCG administration is likely to provide an optimised LPS with the current available drugs. Initial clinical results with the micro-dose hCG approach are presented. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

The work analyses and models large-scale integration of renewable power, the potential of process integration and energy efficiency improvements in key industries {{in the region and}} identifies cost efficient solutions for an energy efficient building stock. Energy and emission statistics along with energy and climate plans are used to investigate how well the current “path” with regard to energy use and GHG emissions fits within the corresponding plans for the region. The statistics is also used to define a Reference Energy System (RES) for the region which gives a structured mapping of the energy system of the region, comprising supply, conversion and end-use of the different energy carriers/sources in the region. Based on the analysis the aim of the project is to propose one or more pathways in the short, medium and long term towards a sustainable energy system in the region. The initial work shows that final energy use for parts of the region has actually increased by 25 % since 1990 while GHG emissions have declined only marginally, by 3 %. Furthermore, although most municipalities in the region have targets or at least visions on significant reductions both with regard to energy use and GHG emissions they lack a clear description (pathway) of how to reach these targets (visions). This clearly indicates that thorough analysis of the energy system in the region could provide valuable insights to decision makers and stakeholders on requirements and challenges for transforming the energy system to reach the visions...|$|E

Uncertainty as to how or when neighboring systems will evaluate and consider seams projects as part of their regular planning processes can cause significant delays in the development of seams project. Also a “gap ” between top-down and bottom-up planning studies can lead to an inability to identify beneficial seams projects. Qualification criteria for a seams project often differ between neighbors, and transmission benefits and metrics are not articulated with enough detail to allow for cost allocation based on identified benefits to each entity.

Objective: To study {{the impact of}} {{first-line}} antineoplastic treatment on the ovarian reserve in young girls returning for ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) {{in connection with a}} relapse. Design: Retrospective case-control study. Setting: University hospitals. Patients: Sixty-three girls under the age of 18  years who underwent OTC before (group 1 : 31 patients) and after (group 2 : 32 patients) their initial cancer treatment. Intervention(s) : None. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Follicular densities (follicles/mm 3) measured from an ovarian cortical biopsy before OTC. The ovarian volume (mL) of entire ovaries excised for OTC was also monitored. Result(s) :There was no statistically significant difference in the mean age or follicular density between groups 1 and 2 (334 ± 476 /mm 3 vs. 327 ± 756 /mm 3). In contrast, the ovarian volume and total number of ovarian cortex chips cryopreserved were statistically significantly lower in patients who received gonadotoxic treatment before OTC (mean ± standard deviation [SD]: ovarian volume, 5. 3 ± 3. 1  mL vs. 2. 9 ± 2. 1  mL, respectively; number of cortex chips: 21. 3 ± 8. 1 vs. 15. 2 ± 7. 1, respectively). The reduction in the estimated ovarian reserve ranged from 10 % to 20 % in children to around 30 % in adolescent girls (> 10  years). Conclusion(s) : Girls under the age of 10 tolerate a gonadotoxic insult better than adolescents, who may experience up to a 30 % reduction in the ovarian reserve via first-line gonadotoxic treatment, which at present is considered to have little effect on the follicle pool.

The aim of the subproject is to educate young people, 13 - 15 years old, in sustainability and climate change, and to motivate and involve the youth in creating a sustainable future. As {{a part of the}} activities the learners from six secondary schools got a mission by the Oresund Committee - to work on and plan for sustainability from the perspective of young people. The participants worked in mixed groups with four different themes and presented their results in a workshop together with politicians, planners and other municipal civil servants from Sweden and Denmark. The aim of the research study is to listen to the voices of the Climate Ambassadors and analyse their statements on what they learned during the project, their anxiety for the future, their possibility to make a difference and to affect the future development, and which barriers they identify in creating a sustainable future. The scientific methods are qualitative interviews in groups of participants two-five months after the final workshop and qualitative thematic analyses of their answers. The participants like the way of working in the project and gain new knowledge, competences and skills. They find these useful in their daily life, at school as well as in leisure time. At the interviews they discuss their role and possibilities to influence the future development in the region. The Climate Ambassadors mean that the future belongs to them and one says: “We can make a different if we decide to. ” Identified barriers are adults and economy. The ways of working in the subproject was highly appreciated by the participants and they expressed positive thinking of their possibilities to participate in democratic processes and in development of the future.

October 22, 2012 Executive Summary The <b>Interregional</b> Research <b>Project</b> Number 4 (IR- 4 Project) has been a pivotal resource in providing U. S. residents a plentiful and low-cost array of vegetables, fruits, berries and tree nuts since 1963 by facilitating the registration of newer, lower-toxic pest control products with the EPA for application on specialty crops. Specialty crop growers often are at a disadvantage relative to program crop growers in having access to effective crop loss mitigation options against common agricultural pests. Specialty crops make up about 40 percent of the total value of U. S. crop production and include both food and ornamental crops that afford insufficient economic incentive for a pesticide companies to support initial or continuing registration of commercial pesticides. As all agricultural uses of pesticides are regulated by the EPA, each use must be registered or exempted before applied. Such registration is costly, making only registration for uses on any but large acreage crops unprofitable for pesticide companies. The IR- 4 Project leverages resources to pursue registration for such uses. Along with supporting the use of reduced-toxicity pesticides, with its Biological and Organic Support program, the IR- 4 Project is able to direct necessary resources to meet the U. S. goal of substantially decreasing the environmental and health impacts of agricultural pesticide use following the passage of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996.

To {{initiate}} the <b>Interregional</b> Technical Co-operation <b>Project</b> INT/ 5 / 153 (2014 - 18) on Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Land-Water-Ecosystem Quality in Polar and Mountainous Regions (funded by the International Atomic Energy Agency and supported by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture), we built a database containing 769 of the most significant journal papers on {{the effects of}} climate change in polar and mountainous regions between 2000 - 2014 (up until the Fifth IPCC Assessment). Using the number of paper citations per year (CPY) we derive the top fifty most cited journal papers published in the 15 -year period. Analysis of the focus of these ‘top fifty’ papers is compared to the IPCC Fifth Assessment (AR 5) Report (IPCC, 2013) and the full database. Five categories emerged, and by combining the number of papers in each category with the average CPY for the category, research on the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems (E) in polar and mountainous regions dominated, research on the impact on water resources (W) was second, the impact on people’s livelihood (P) third, with ice and snow (I) fourth and landscape (L) fifth. Landscape (L), in our view, appears to be under researched and is presumably included in the IPCC Terrestrial Ecosystems category. We propose that policy makers should note this under-representation of high impact research into landscape processes (erosion and deposition processes), which needs to be addressed in future.
