50|$|In Europe, {{high-speed}} rail began during the International Transport Fair in Munich in June 1965, when Dr Öpfering, {{the director of}} Deutsche Bundesbahn (German Federal Railways), performed 347 demonstrations at 200 km/h between Munich and Augsburg by DB Class 103 hauled trains. The same year the Aérotrain, a French <b>hovercraft</b> monorail <b>train</b> prototype, reached 200 km/h within days of operation.|$|R
50|$|Bryant {{was chosen}} by TNT to host a series of {{entertainment}} vignettes called Rough Cut. The success of the vignettes prompted TNT to turn Rough Cut into a weekly television series hosted and written by Bryant. This {{marked the beginning of}} Bryant's professional relationship with Turner Broadcasting. TBS soon launched the wraparound series Movies, For Guys Who Like Movies, allowing Bryant to drive a U.S. Naval LCAC <b>hovercraft,</b> <b>train</b> with Marine snipers and engage in other activities. Lorne Michaels later picked Bryant to host his new daily VH1 game show, Name That Video in 2001; Bryant filmed 50 episodes.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1958, The [...] (EPAD) {{buildings}} (of {{which the}} Esso Tower {{was the very}} first) were built and began to slowly replace the city's factories, shanties, {{and even a few}} farms. The Center of New Industries and Technologies (CNIT) was built and first used in 1958. These [...] "first generation" [...] skyscrapers were all very similar in appearance, limited to a height of 100 m. In 1966, the Nobel Tower was the first office skyscraper built in the area. In 1970, the RER line A railway was opened from La Défense to Étoile. In 1974, a contract for a Défense-Cergy high-speed <b>hovercraft</b> <b>train</b> was signed and soon abandoned.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary focus}} of the exhibit is the {{introduction}} of modern science and technology {{through the lens of}} Star Wars. Topics ranging from space travel, mechanical prosthetics, robotics, and levitation technology such as is seen in <b>hovercrafts</b> and Maglev <b>trains</b> are addressed through hands-on activities and volunteer demonstrations.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{questionnaire}} studies is described, which {{was carried out}} on passengers in public service vehicles in the United Kingdom particularly cross-channel <b>hovercraft,</b> helicopter and <b>train.</b> The effectiveness of the different rating techniques employed is examined and it is demonstrated that useful and reliable information can be obtained {{on the effects of}} such physical parameters as vibration, vehicle motion and noise using rating methods which involve no external standards. Some results obtained from analysis of the survey returns are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Tsiolkovsky's first {{scientific}} study {{dates back to}} 1880-1881. He wrote a paper called [...] "Theory of Gases," [...] in which he outlined {{the basis of the}} kinetic theory of gases, but after submitting it to the Russian Physico-Chemical Society (RPCS), he was informed that his discoveries had already been made 25 years earlier. Undaunted, he pressed ahead with his second work, [...] "The Mechanics of the Animal Organism". It received favorable feedback, and Tsiolkovsky was made a member of the Society. Tsiolkovsky's main works after 1884 dealt with four major areas: the scientific rationale for the all-metal balloon (airship), streamlined airplanes and <b>trains,</b> <b>hovercraft,</b> and rockets for interplanetary travel.|$|R
