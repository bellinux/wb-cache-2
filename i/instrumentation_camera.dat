40|$|The {{diffusion}} of {{minimally invasive surgery}} has thrived in recent years, providing substantial benefits over traditional techniques {{for a number of}} surgical interventions.

Powerful semantic analysis tools are required to exploit the full potential of the information content of these data. Semantic analysis of multi-modality imaging data, however, poses unique challenges. Firstly, the analysis of these data sets requires flexible and extensible knowledge-based tools that can extract objective and quantitative semantic knowledge. Secondly, semantic interoperability requires knowledge representation formalisms {{that can be used for}} representation of the extracted semantic information. Thirdly, the high volume of such data requires a powerful computing infrastructure to meet the high-throughput analysis requirements of high-content screening data sets. None of the existing tools provides an integrated solution to these three requirements. ^ In this research we present an integrated framework for addressing all three dimensions of this problem. This framework provides a multi-layered architecture and spatio-temporal models for analysis of biological images. The analysis is divided into low-level and high-level processing. At the lower level, issues like segmentation, tracking, and object recognition are addressed, and at the higher level, finite state machine- and Petri net-based models are used for spatio-temporal event recognition. The proposed system provides high throughput through the use of grid technologies. The grid-enabled implementation comprises two levels of knowledge-based services. The first level provides tools for extracting spatio-temporal knowledge from image sets and the second level provides high-level knowledge management and reasoning services.

Measurement of its characteristics (fringe period, fringe number, etc.) for different focus errors should indicate the best focus.

To our advantage, rapid technical advances have taken place during the past decades and the number of tools available to assist us in providing and maintaining a secure and stable airway has increased significantly. Until the 1970 s tracheal intubation with a conventional laryngoscope or blind nasal intubation were the mainstays of establishing an artificial airway. The choice of endotracheal tubes was limited.

Our aim in this paper is not to provide detailed results and analysis, but rather to tackle several conceptual and methodological issues that have stood in the way of experimentalists in achieving this goal, and to offer tools for overcoming these. We begin by discussing the interplay between analytical and empirical methods, emphasizing that the structure of the models we use to analyse flight control dictates the empirical measurements we must make in order to parameterize them. We then provide a conceptual overview of tethered-flight paradigms, comparing classical;open-loop' and;closed-loop' setups, and describe a flight simulator that we have recently developed for making flight dynamics measurements on tethered insects.

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of axial, radial, and volumetric strain parameters {{are critical to}} the understanding of phase relationships and the constitutive behavior for saturated and unsaturated soils. The use of photographic monitoring techniques for laboratory-based {{measurement of}} these parameters have become common. A novel technique that utilized <b>camera</b> <b>instrumentation</b> located within the triaxial testing cell was developed and validated. By placing the instrumentation inside of the cell, instead of the instrumentation being located outside of the cell, the technique eliminated cumbersome corrections required to account for optical distortions due to 1) the refraction of light at the confining fluid-cell wall-atmosphere interfaces, 2) the curvature of the cylindrical cell wall, and 3) the deformation of the cell wall induced by changes in cell pressure. Digital images of various soil and analog (brass, acrylic) specimens were captured within the triaxial apparatus during testing. The images were processed using the principles of close-range photogrammetry to construct three-dimensional models of the specimens. The models were analysed to determine surface deformation and total volume of the specimens. Additionally, the models obtained from triaxial tests performed on the soil samples were compared to quantify deformation and volume of the sample as a function of axial strain. Sensitivity studies and evaluation of measurement accuracy for the internal, close-range photogrammetry approach are documented herein. Specimen volume, as obtained using the approach, was compared with volume obtained from four other techniques, including: DSLR camera photogrammetry, 3 D structured light scanning, manual measurements (caliper and pi tape), and water displacement. A relative error of 0. 13 percent was assessed for the internal photogrammetry technique.

To better understand these relationships, we conducted controlled releases of single blocks within a soft-rock (black marls) gully of the Rioux-Bourdoux torrent (French Alps). A total of 28  blocks, with masses ranging from 76 to 472  kg, {{were used for the}} experiment. An <b>instrumentation</b> combining video <b>cameras</b> and seismometers was deployed along the travelled path. The video cameras allow reconstructing the trajectories of the blocks and estimating their velocities {{at the time of the}} different impacts with the slope. These data are compared to the recorded seismic signals. As the distance between the falling block and the seismic sensors at the time of each impact is known, we were able to determine the associated seismic signal amplitude corrected for propagation and attenuation effects. We compared the velocity, the potential energy lost, the kinetic energy and the momentum of the block at each impact to the true amplitude and the radiated seismic energy. Our results suggest that the amplitude of the seismic signal is correlated to the momentum of the block at the impact. We also found relationships between the potential energy lost, the kinetic energy and the seismic energy radiated by the impacts. Thanks to these relationships, we were able to retrieve the mass and the velocity before impact of each block directly from the seismic signal. Despite high uncertainties, the values found are close to the true values of the masses and the velocities of the blocks. These relationships allow for gaining a better understanding of the physical processes that control the source of high-frequency seismic signals generated by rockfalls...|$|R

This second model of the ALF 502 R- 5 A serial number LF 11 is a highly instrumented version of the previous engine. The PSL facility provides a continuous cloud of ice crystals with controlled characteristics of size and concentration, which are ingested by the engine during operation at simulated altitudes. Several of the previous operating points tested in the LF 01 engine were duplicated to confirm repeatability in LF 11. The <b>instrumentation</b> included video <b>cameras</b> to visually illustrate the accretion of ice in the low pressure compressor (LPC) exit guide vane region in order to confirm the ice accretion, which was suspected during the testing of the LF 01.

The test data was utilized to determine the losses and blockages due to accretion in the exit guide vane region of the LPC. Multiple data points were analyzed with the Honeywell Customer Deck. A full engine roll back point was modeled with the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) code. The mean line compressor flow analysis code with ice crystal modeling was utilized to estimate the parameters that indicate the risk of accretion, as well as to estimate the degree of blockage and losses caused by accretion during a full engine roll back point.

Methods: The ZEUS Robotic Surgical System (Computer Motion Inc, Goleta, Calif) consists of three interactive robotic arms and a control unit, allowing the surgeon to move the instrument arms in a scaled down mode. The third arm (AESOP, Computer Motion) positions the endoscope via voice control. Phase I: In a phantom model, vascular grafts were anastomosed to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) of 50 pig hearts with either 2 - or 3 -dimensional visualization. Phase II: In 6 dogs (FBI 20 - 25 kg) the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) was harvested endoscopically. Then the animals were placed on an endovascular cardiopulmonary bypass system (Port-Access, Heartport, Inc, Redwood City, Calif). Anastomosis of the LITA to the LAD was performed endoscopically with the telemetric ZEUS instruments. Flow rates through the LITA were measured by Doppler analysis. Phase III: Two patients were operated on with the ZEUS system. After endoscopic harvesting of the LITA and cardiopulmonary bypass with the Port-Access system, the bypass graft (LITA-LAD) was anastomosed endoscopically with the ZEUS system through three thoracic ports. Results: In the dry laboratory, the time range required for the robotically assisted coronary anastomosis was 35 to 60 minutes with 2 -dimensional visualization and 16 to 32 minutes with 3 -dimensional visualization. In the animal experiments, the median time for endoscopic harvesting of the LITA was 86 minutes (range 56 - 120 minutes) and for the anastomosis, 42 minutes (range 35 - 105 minutes); flow rates through the LITA ranged between 22 and 45 mL/min. In the clinical cases, preparation times for the LITA were 83 and 110 minutes, respectively, and anastomosis times, 42 and 40 minutes, respectively. Doppler flow rates measured 125 and 85 mL/min, respectively. Both patients had an uneventful follow-up angiogram and postoperative course. Conclusions: With sophisticated robotic technology, a completely endoscopic anastomosis of the LITA to the LAD is possible, allowing technically precise operations within acceptable time limits.

40|$|Hydrokinetic {{turbines}} will be {{a source}} of noise in the marine environment - both during operation and during installation/removal. High intensity sound can cause injury or behavioral changes in marine mammals and may also affect fish and invertebrates. These noise effects are, however, highly dependent on the individual marine animals; the intensity, frequency, and duration of the sound; and context in which the sound is received. In other words, production of sound is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for an environmental impact. At a workshop on the environmental effects of tidal energy development, experts identified sound produced by turbines as an area of potentially significant impact, but also high uncertainty. The overall objectives of this project are to improve our understanding of the potential acoustic effects of tidal turbines by: (1) Characterizing sources of existing underwater noise; (2) Assessing the effectiveness of monitoring technologies to characterize underwater noise and marine mammal responsiveness to noise; (3) Evaluating the sound profile of an operating tidal turbine; and (4) Studying the effect of turbine sound on surrogate species in a laboratory environment. This study focuses on a specific case study for tidal energy development in Admiralty Inlet, Puget Sound, Washington (USA), but the methodologies and results are applicable to other turbine technologies and geographic locations. The project succeeded in achieving the above objectives and, in doing so, substantially contributed to the body of knowledge around the acoustic effects of tidal energy development in several ways: (1) Through collection of data from Admiralty Inlet, established the sources of sound generated by strong currents (mobilizations of sediment and gravel) and determined that low-frequency sound recorded during periods of strong currents is non-propagating pseudo-sound. This helped to advance the debate within the marine and hydrokinetics acoustic community as to whether strong currents produce propagating sound. (2) Analyzed data collected from a tidal turbine operating at the European Marine Energy Center to develop a profile of turbine sound and developed a framework to evaluate the acoustic effects of deploying similar devices in other locations. This framework has been applied to Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish Country's demonstration project in Admiralty Inlet to inform postinstallation acoustic and marine mammal monitoring plans. (3) Demonstrated passive acoustic techniques to characterize the ambient noise environment at tidal energy sites (fixed, long-term observations recommended) and characterize the sound from anthropogenic sources (drifting, short-term observations recommended). (4) Demonstrated the utility and limitations of instrumentation, including bottom mounted <b>instrumentation</b> packages, infrared <b>cameras,</b> and vessel monitoring systems. In doing so, also demonstrated how this type of comprehensive information is needed to interpret observations from each instrument (e. g., hydrophone data can be combined with vessel tracking data to evaluate the contribution of vessel sound to ambient noise). (5) Conducted a study that suggests harbor porpoise in Admiralty Inlet may be habituated to high levels of ambient noise due to omnipresent vessel traffic. The inability to detect behavioral changes associated with a high intensity source of opportunity (passenger ferry) has informed the approach for post-installation marine mammal monitoring. (6) Conducted laboratory exposure experiments of juvenile Chinook salmon and showed that exposure to a worse than worst case acoustic dose of turbine sound does not result in changes to hearing thresholds or biologically significant tissue damage. Collectively, this means that Chinook salmon may be at a relatively low risk of injury from sound produced by tidal turbines located in or near their migration path. In achieving these accomplishments, the project has significantly advanced the District's goals of developing a demonstration-scale tidal energy project in Admiralty Inlet. Pilot demonstrations of this type are an essential step in the development of commercial-scale tidal energy in the United States. This is a renewable resource capable of producing electricity in a highly predictable manner...|$|R
40|$|The Working Group on Fisheries Acoustics Science and Technology (WGFAST) {{met at the}} Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations in Rome, Italy, from 19 – 22 April 2005. David A. Demer, USA, was Chair, Alex De Robertis, USA, was Rapporteur and Jessica D. Lipsky, USA, was the Recorder. There were 83 {{participants}} from 16 countries. a) The first topic was “Measuring underwater radiated noise from survey vessels {{and its effects on}} fish”. Quiet vessels have distinct advantages over conventional vessels. It has been shown that herring did not respond to a vessel which com-plies with the ICES Cooperative Research Report No. 209 specification for radi-ated noise. Reductions in high frequency vessel noise have also increased acous-tic detection ranges for fish and zooplankton. However, it is clear that some spe-cies, under some circumstances, avoid even quiet survey vessels. Thus, a variety of stimuli produced by vessels such as light and particle motion, as well as radi-ated noise, may cause fish to react to a survey vessel. Noise reduced vessels pro-vide new opportunities to investigate these stimuli. WGFAST recommends that research in this area should proceed swiftly and focus on: i) determining which species of fish react to conventional and quiet survey vessels and under what cir-cumstances; ii) the stimuli for their behaviours; and iii) the design requirements for vessels surveying these species in sensitive situations. Additionally, for cases in which fish avoidance is inescapable, survey biases should be estimated. Devel-opment of economical and portable noise measurement systems is also encour-aged. b) The second topic was “Technologies for remote species identification (low-frequency, Doppler, multi-frequency, broad bandwidth, data integration, optical sensors) ”. Species identification {{can be one of the}} major sources of uncertainty in acoustic surveys of fish and zooplankton abundance, and it is vital to multi-species and ecosystem studies. Substantial progress was reported on a variety of methods for remote species identification. Such methods enable more automated and objective data processing, reduced uncertainty in acoustic estimates of fish biomass, economical ecosystem investigations and studies of predator-prey inter-actions, and may also facilitate a reduction of by-catch during commercial fishing operations. It was noted that further progress towards species identification will likely require a combination of acoustic and other measurements. Because net sampling is typically used to identify acoustic scatterers, gear selectivity can add substantial uncertainty to acoustic surveys. Thus, the WGFAST encourages re-search on random and systematic error in net sampling, and development of new methods for verifying acoustic scatterers. Particularly promising are underwater stereo video instrumentation and analysis methods. c) The third topic was “Alternative technologies (small-craft, buoys, ROV, AUV, gliders, fishing vessels, multi-beam sonar, acoustic cameras), with special atten-tion to shallow water and near boundary assessments (coastal, riverine, demersal and epipelagic species, and bottom typing) ”. Measurement platforms other than research vessels are being used to economically make measurements on ecologi-cally important temporal and spatial scales. For example, acoustic instruments are being deployed on buoys, landers, autonomous underwater vehicles, remotely op-erated vehicles, and fishing vessels. Expanded use of these platforms is impera-tive for successful ecosystem-based fisheries management. Progress was also re-ported on development of multi-beam sonars, and analyses of their data for bio-mass estimation. Finally, productive collaborations between commercial manu-facturers and the scientific community were reported and encouraged. d) The fourth topic was “Target strength (modelling and measurements) ”. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that a first-order approximation of TS ver-sus log-length is generally insufficient to accurately and precisely estimate fish TS. It was shown that factors such as fish orientation (tilt, roll, and yaw), age-dependent changes in morphology, and region-dependent relations between fish mass, length, and swimbladder volumes can eclipse the effect of fish length on their TS. Exemplifying this point was another study showing a bimodal TS distri-bution from herring characterized with a unimodal length distribution. e) WGFAST recommends that it next meets at CSIRO in Hobart, Tasmania, on 27, 28, 29, and 30 March, 2006 to examine works in the following research areas: i) Fish behaviour in response to noise and other vessel related stimuli; ii) Survey techniques for epi-benthic, epi-pelagic and shallow water species; iii) Acoustical species ID techniques for multi-species assessments, ecosystem studies, by-catch reduction, and objective and automated data processing; iv) Instrumentation, survey design, and data analysis techniques for studying aquatic ecosystems, with special attention to the estimation and use of meas-urement uncertainty in statistical analyses of multi-variate time series, and techniques for integrating multi-disciplinary data to elucidate functional rela-tionships; and v) Target strength (modelling and measurements). f) WGFAST recommends that SGASC and SGTSEB both be extended for another year, retaining their current Chairs, to complete their respective CRRs; and SGAFV and SGASC also meet in Hobart on 25 – 26 March, and 31 March- 2 April, respectively. g) WGFAST recommends research on: 1) noise and other vessel related stimuli for fish behaviour; 2) video and still <b>camera</b> <b>instrumentation</b> and data processing; and 3) instrumentation and methods for remote species identification. These topics should be considered for one or more new Study Group at the 2006 meeting. h) WGFAST and WGFTFB jointly recommend that a Task Force be formed, lead by David Somerton, USA, to: evaluate the state-of-the-art in optical imaging and analysis technologies and define the ICES community’s requirements for addi-tional optical technology. i) WGFAST recommends a review of the ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies developed and employed over the past two decades by international communities such as CCAMLR. Accordingly, one or more keynote speakers from CCAMLR and or CSIRO will be invited to the 2006 WGFAST meeting. j) WGFAST recommends that the ICES sponsored “ 2008 Symposium on Fisheries Acoustics and Technology for Aquatic Ecosystem Investigations,” is held from in June 2008 at Grieg Hall, Bergen, Norway. k) WGFAST Recommends the following theme sessions for the 2006 Annual Sci-ence Conference: i) Joint FTC-RMC Theme Session on “Quantifying, summariz-ing and integrating total uncertainty in fisheries resource surveys. ” Co-Conveners: David Demer, U.
