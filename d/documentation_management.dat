In the thesis a review of legal requirements for construction site documentation and recommendations of FIDIC federation is performed with, description of the role of individual document relative to specific construction process and its successful implementation. The preformed SWOT analysis is identifying internal and external factors that affect the <b>documentation</b> <b>management,</b> with identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and risks related to construction site documentation. The developed SWOT analysis was assessed by the external evaluators from construction sector: site managers, designers, investors, surveyors and inspectors.

Beside that the situation regarding the construction site <b>documentation</b> <b>management</b> in other countries is assessed. The overview shows the obstacles the site <b>documentation</b> <b>management</b> are construction site managers in other countries faced with and what are the reasons for it. Comparison of national reality and the international overview identifies that the challenges identified are almost completely the same. On the academic level are being developed several technologies aiming to address some of these challenges. These technologies consist mainly of various computer tools (BIM, GIS, DW, OLAP, etc.) that try to collect all the documents, create a database and enable search and share of information between the various participants in the project. Finally, I have analysed on limited scale the technologies used on construction sites in Slovenia for <b>documentation</b> <b>management</b> and performed a final assessment of the state of construction site documentation in Slovenia...|$|E

With this study, we are seeking for the answers to how information and <b>documentation</b> <b>management</b> can be utilized in a maximum efficiency, how the working conditions of the personnel can be improved and how much productivity can be gained through different organizations of the personnel. As the technology advances, different crimes have emerged in the recent years.

We are in need of personnel who have the knowledge of current technological advancements and who can recognize the different aspects of society that has the people who are interacting with the police force.
