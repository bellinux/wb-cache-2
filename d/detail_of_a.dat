In contemporary reviews, The New York Times described Power as [...] "Constantly menacing, the album affords no breathing room." [...] The review noted: [...] "Ice-T makes the claustrophobia work by spinning ever denser rhymes and more concrete images, remaining {{as intense as}} his subject. Power has the oppressive <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novel. Though Ice-T indulges in gallows humor... he allows no release. If this is {{the life of a}} gangster, it is also hell." [...] The review commented that along with Eazy-E's album Eazy-Duz-It, the rappers come off as [...] "unenlightened when it comes to women. Whatever their rough spots, Power and Eazy-Duz-It represent the makings of a brutal new music scene." [...] Robert Christgau, writing for the Village Voice, gave the album a B+ rating, noting that Ice-T had [...] "his own sound—flat, clipped, quick-lipped. And when he sticks to his subject, his narrative style is as gripping and understated as Islam's samples." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald opined that Ice-T's [...] "odd attempts at making a moral point become lost amidst the nauseating imagery, though the music's malevolent power is impossible to deny".|$|E

On the occasion of her death in 1891, he referred to their first meeting in her rooms in January 1875. He wrote:"It was her eye that attracted me, the eye of one whom I must have known in lives long passed away. She looked at me in recognition for that first hour, and never since has that look changed. Not as a questioner of philosophies did I come before her, not as one groping in the dark for lights that schools and fanciful theories had obscured, but as one who, wandering through the corridors of life, was seeking the friends who could show where the designs for the work had been hidden. And, true to the call, she responded, revealing plans once again, and speaking no words to explain, simply pointed them out and went on with the task. It was as if but the evening before we had parted, leaving yet to be done some <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> task taken up with one common end; it was teacher and pupil, elder brother and younger, both bent on the one single end, but she with the power and knowledge that belong but to lions and sages." ...|$|E

60|$|So Mary Louise told it, {{with a few}} {{comments}} from her grandfather.

Alora had often talked freely to Mary Louise, venting in her presence much bitterness and resentment over her cruel fate--as she deemed it.
