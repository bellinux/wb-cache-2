40|$|The fine {{structure}} of <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> RNase was studied with 1 H NMR spectroscopy, using the 4 -protein system consisting of dimeric <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> RNase, its catalytically active monomeric bis-(S-carboxymethyl- 31, 32) deriv., the naturally monomeric RNase A from the pancreas {{of the same}} species, and dimerized RNase A. Only 4 histidine (His) C- 2 H resonances were obsd. in the arom. spectrum of <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> RNase, which belong to the 4 His residues present in the sequence of <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> RNase subunits at positions identical {{with those of the}} histidines of RNase A. This indicates identical environments for the individual His residues in both subunits. These resonances were assigned (1) by comparing their titrn. curves with the corresponding curves obtained with RNase A and with monomeric <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> RNase and (2) by evaluating the effects on their titrn. curves of nucleotide binding. Very similar NMR parameters were measured for His- 105 and for His- 119 of seminal and pancreatic RNase, whereas His- 12 was found to have different environments in the 2 proteins. The distinctive NMR features of His- 48 in <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> RNase confirmed the role of the hinge regions of the subunits in maintaining the dimeric structure of the protein. Although monomerization of the semen enzyme reduced the differences between the His C- 2 H resonances of RNase A and <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> RNase, dimerization of RNase A did not affect the NMR spectrum of this protein, thus indicating that {{it is unlikely that the}} quaternary structure of <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> RNase resembles that of dimerized RNase A...|$|R

However, the abilities of SBV molecular detection methods used at European laboratories have not yet been assessed, to our knowledge.

Electrophoretic profile analysis of spermatozoa and bovine seminal plasma proteins (total and membrane) revealed qualitative and quantitative differences among bulls. Variations in PLA 2 and seminal plasma calcium concentration indicated genetic diversity among individuals. A 15. 7 -kDa membrane protein was significantly correlated (r = 0. 71) with acrosome reaction, which in turn has been associated with in vivo fertility...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>semen</b> {{experimentally}} {{contaminated with}} Leptospira santarosai serovar Guaricura was {{submitted to the}} modified EMJH medium with 5 -fluorouracil (300 mg/L) and nalidixic acid (20 mg/L), named as "selective medium" and using the serial dilution technique, in order to evaluate the percentage of recovery of the added microorganism. The selective EMJH medium was found with higher percentage of recovery of leptospiras and minor losses of samples due to contamination with opportunistic microorganisms than the non-selective EMJH medium: 151 / 376 (40. 0 %) of positive growth; and 38 / 376 (10. 0 %) contamination and 58 / 376 (15 %) and 129 / 376 (34. 0 %), respectively. These results were statistically significant (p< 0. 0001; Fisher). Differences were found when the frequencies of positive leptospires recovery have been compared in the serial dilution technique (10 - 1 to 10 - 4) between the selective and non-selective media at different dilution factors. At 1 / 10 th dilution the percentages found were (0 %, 0 / 80) and (38 %, 30 / 80), at 1 / 100 th dilution, (3 %, 2 / 80) and (49 %, 39 / 80) and at 1 / 1, 000 th dilution, (25 %, 20 / 80) and (50 %, 40 / 80), respectively. The percentage of recovery of leptospires {{was found to be}} directly proportional to the dilution used. The methodology of the serial dilution technique (setting at least three dilutions) and the use of selective EMJH medium {{have been found to be}} efficient for the isolation of leptospires from the <b>bovine</b> <b>semen</b> samples...|$|R
40|$|Fatty acids {{play a major}} rł=o^ the {{metabolism}} of spermatozoa. The endo-genous respiration {{of these}} cells depends largely on the oxidation of hydrolysed acyl groups of plasmalogens (Hartree & Mann, 1961); endogenous fatty acids may also be utilized and are readily incorporated into the lipids ofspermatozoa(Payne & Masters, 1968; Mills & Scott, 1969). This communication was initiated {{in order to provide}} further data on the turnover of individual phospho-lipids, and constitutes a preliminary report on the rate and specificity of incor-poration of palmitic acid into the phosphatides of <b>bovine</b> <b>semen.</b> Samples (1 -ml) of freshly ejaculated semen were incubated under aerobic conditions at 32 =deg with [U- 14 C]palmitic acid (0 =. =m) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7 =. containing 1 =. ml of 3...|$|R
