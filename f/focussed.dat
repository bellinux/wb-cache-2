Her work in the military hospitals fuelled her interest in the topic, which she <b>focussed</b> on during the following years. In 1919, Mackinnon joined King's College, London as a lecturer and became Chair of Zoology in 1927, the first female Chair at the college. She remained in the role as Chair and professor for 22 years. Her research work <b>focussed</b> on parasitic protozoa, and she gave many lectures on the subject over the period of 30 years.

40|$|In Korean, <b>focus</b> is {{expressed}} in accentual phrasing. To ascertain whether words <b>focused</b> in this manner enjoy a processing advantage analogous to that conferred by <b>focus</b> as expressed in, e. g, English and Dutch, we devised sentences with target words in one of four conditions: prosodic <b>focus,</b> syntactic <b>focus,</b> prosodic + syntactic <b>focus,</b> and no <b>focus</b> as a control. 32 native speakers of Korean listened to blocks of 10 sentences, then were presented visually with words and asked {{whether or not they}} had heard them. Overall, words with <b>focus</b> were recognised significantly faster and more accurately than unfocused words. In addition, words with syntactic <b>focus</b> or syntactic + prosodic <b>focus</b> were recognised faster than words with prosodic <b>focus</b> alone.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{acoustic}} realization of single vs. double <b>focus</b> in statements and yes/no questions in General American English. Four speakers produced {{four sets of}} utterances of different lengths with alternating <b>focus</b> and sentence type conditions. Results indicate that double <b>focus</b> increases max F 0 and duration of the <b>focused</b> word to a similar degree as single <b>focus</b> in both statements and yes/no questions. Furthermore, post-focus pitch range suppression occurs in both single- and double-focused statements. However, in yes/no questions, post-focus pitch range compression and raising occur only after single <b>focus</b> and <b>focus</b> 2 of double <b>focus.</b> In contrast, F 0 after <b>focus</b> 1 of double <b>focus</b> falls gradually until the stressed syllable in <b>focus</b> 2 in yes/no questions. These findings suggest that double <b>focus</b> interacts with sentence type in a more complicated way than single <b>focus</b> in shaping F 0 contours of English sentences...|$|R

5|$|A third recension was {{probably}} compiled {{during the reign}} of HenryI and was used at the coronation of his successor, Stephen, in 1135. While retaining the most important elements of the Anglo-Saxon rite, it borrowed heavily from the consecration of the Holy Roman Emperor from the Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a book of German liturgy compiled in Mainz in 961, thus bringing the English tradition into line with continental practice. It remained in use until the coronation of EdwardII in 1308 when the fourth recension was first used, having been compiled over several preceding decades. Although influenced by its French counterpart, the new ordo <b>focussed</b> on the balance between the monarch and his nobles and on the oath, neither of which concerned the absolutist French kings. One manuscript of this recension is the Liber Regalis at Westminster Abbey which has come to be regarded as the definitive version.|$|E

40|$|Hydrodynamic <b>focusing</b> of {{particles}} is numerically studied by the immersed boundary – lattice Boltzmann method. Particle <b>focusing</b> entropy is proposed to quantitatively characterize processing performance and final results of hydrodynamic <b>focusing.</b> Simulations of hydrodynamic <b>focusing</b> in several straight microchannels {{are carried out}} to evaluate versatility of the <b>focusing</b> entropy. Time evolutions of <b>focusing</b> entropies and particle trajectories are analyzed contrastively. The results demonstrate that the <b>focusing</b> entropy is an effective scale to measure particles ordering degree and hydrodynamic <b>focusing</b> performance. Higher ordering degree determines lower <b>focusing</b> entropy, which indicates better <b>focusing</b> performance. Channel cross section, particle rigidness and channel Reynolds number are three major factors influencing <b>focusing</b> dynamics and final results. Rectangular microchannel is more advantageous than circular and square ones in hydrodynamic <b>focusing.</b> Particles of different rigidness in rectangular microchannel can be separated significantly with the flow mediation. Increasing channel Reynolds numbers can lead to higher efficiency and better <b>focusing</b> performance...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{word order}} and {{intonation}} to mark <b>focus</b> in child speech has received some attention.

An answer-reconstruction task was used to elicit syntactic (word order) and intonational <b>focus</b> marking of subject and objects (locus of <b>focus)</b> in three <b>focus</b> types (broad, narrow, and contrastive <b>focus).</b> The results indicate that both children and adults used intonation to distinguish broad from contrastive <b>focus</b> but they differed in the marking of narrow <b>focus.</b> Further, both groups preferred intonation to word order as device for <b>focus</b> marking.

This is done by using AF to detect but not set <b>focus</b> - using manual <b>focus</b> to set <b>focus</b> (or switching to manual after <b>focus</b> has been set) but then using <b>focus</b> priority to detect <b>focus</b> and only release the shutter when an object is in <b>focus.</b> The technique works by choosing the <b>focus</b> adjustment (turning AF off), then setting the shooting mode to [...] "Single" [...] (AF-S), or more specifically <b>focus</b> priority, then depressing the shutter - when the subject moves into <b>focus,</b> the AF detects this (though it does not change the <b>focus),</b> and a shot is taken.|$|R
