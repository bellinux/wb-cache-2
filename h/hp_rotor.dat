40|$|The design, {{modelling}} {{and testing}} of a film cooling system intended for the casing of an unshrouded HP turbine rotor is described in this thesis. Due to the dense network of small film cooling holes employed in such a system, this {{is often referred to}} as a casing effusion cooling scheme. Though there are patent references to such systems, there is as yet very limited published material on the aero thermal performance of such film cooling schemes. The casing of an unshrouded <b>HP</b> <b>rotor</b> is an incredibly hostile environment, witnessing the periodic passing of the <b>HP</b> <b>rotor</b> tips within close proximity at a frequency of ∼ 10 kHz. These blade passing events subject the casing to extremely large amplitude fluctuations of pressure and heat load, which may at first seem to preclude the use of a film cooling scheme. This thesis details many theoretical, computational and experimental advancements related to the research topic. Highlights include: The introduction of a new fundamental mechanism to the field of film cooling, the propagation and reflection of pressure waves within film cooling holes and the impact on film cooling performance. The development of new miniature thin film heat flux gauges manufactured using a new process. Sensor resolution is improved by a factor of seven. The first published computational model reporting heat transfer data on a film cooled rotor casing. Improvements to heat transfer data processing techniques and theory. These are applied to experimental work to produce the highest resolution heat transfer data obtained on the casing of a scaled rotating transonic <b>HP</b> <b>rotor</b> for both uncooled and cooled geometries. Computational models are used to demonstrate that coolant injection on the rotor casing reduces the over-tip leakage mass flow, offsetting the spoiling and mixing losses that film cooling schemes introduce.

Unsteady interactions arising from the relative motions of vane/blade rows are examined. The IP vane was of structural type, and was designed with a vane count of 26. Measurements of time-mean heat transfer and aerodynamics are seldom performed in 1. 5 stage turbines, because of the necessary complexity of the experimental setup required for such investigations. This paper presents both steady and unsteady measurements conducted in an engine-size research turbine, operated at engine-representative non-dimensional conditions. Measurements are compared to the predictions from a three-dimensional, viscous, non-linear, time accurate flow solver. An unstructured grid was used, and, by using the Erdos direct storage technique, the code was extended to allow for non-integer vane/blade pitch ratios.

The test setup consists of a high pressure (HP) stage, a diffusing mid turbine frame with turning struts (TMTF) and a shrouded low pressure (LP) rotor. The two rotors are mounted on mechanically independent shafts {{in order to provide}} engine-representative operating conditions. The rig was designed in cooperation with MTU Aero Engines and Volvo Aero within the EU project DREAM (ValiDation of Radical Engine Architecture SysteMs). A two-sensor fast response aerodynamic pressure probe (2 S-FRAP) has been employed to provide time-resolved aerodynamic area traverses downstream of the LP turbine. Such measurement allows estimating the total deterministic unsteadiness transported through the duct. In particular, it has been possible to isolate the structures induced by each rotor by means of the encoders mounted on the two shafts. A global ensemble averaged field, which takes into account the rotor-rotor interactions, is also provided. The time resolved distributions of the flow quantities are then discussed in details. The perturbations due to the <b>HP</b> <b>rotor</b> in terms of velocity and flow angle are negligible in this downstream plane.

Square-sectioned, equally spaced ribs, oriented perpendicular to the flow direction, are mounted {{on one of the}} walls. The bulk Reynolds number is 15, 000 and the Prandtl number 0. 7. This configuration is analysed in a rotating configuration aiming increasing turbulence on the ribbed surface (i. e. destabilizing configuration). Comparisons with non-rotating configuration are carried out to investigate influence of Coriolis Force. Such configuration mimics the flow in internal cooling channels in the high pressure (<b>HP)</b> <b>rotor</b> and vane blade. The bottom walls are uniformly heated, except the rib walls. The turbulent flow field is modelled by the elliptic-relaxation-type k- ε-ζ-f model. This model was modified by the authors, to take in account the turbulence anisotropy derived by the Coriolis force through the sensitizing of turbulent viscosity to angular velocity vector. Results demonstrate heat transfer enhancement due to the rib induced secondary flows. The ribs cause an increase of turbulence, thus increasing heat transfer. In addition to it, rotation promotes turbulence close to the heated wall. Consequently, the heat transfer is found to be higher in the rotating case than in a non-rotating case.

In particular, the high and low pressure turbine components have a great impact into the engine overall performance, and improvements in the turbine efficiencies can only be achieved through detailed research on the three-dimensional unsteady aerodynamics and heat transfer. The present thesis presents an experimental study of the aerothermodynamics in one and a half turbine stage, focusing on: the aero-thermal flow in the overtip region of a transonic highly loaded high pressure (<b>HP)</b> <b>rotor,</b> and the aerodynamics and heat transfer of an innovative low pressure (LP) stator with a multi-profile configuration placed downstream of the high pressure turbine, within an s-shaped duct. Advanced instrumentation and measurement techniques were used and developed to perform the experimental investigation in a short-duration turbine test rig where both high spatial and time accuracy is indispensable. The flow field at the rotor shroud was investigated with simultaneous measurements of heat transfer, static pressure and blade tip clearance by using fast response pressure, wall temperature and capacitance probes. Through repeat experiments at the same turbine operating point, the time-averaged and time-resolved adiabatic wall temperature and convective heat transfer coefficient were evaluated. In the frame of new engine architectures, a novel stator for an LP turbine is proposed with a multi-splitter layout that represents a new design solution towards compact, lighter and performing aero-engine turbomachinery.

Two approaches in the numerical modelling of the flow have been considered. One is to use 3 D, unsteady CFD to model a single inter-disc cavity with axial throughflow.

40|$|For gas turbines, {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} the external heat transfer coefficient on the high pressure (<b>HP)</b> turbine <b>rotor</b> blades is of immense importance, as this component is critical and operates at material limits. Furthermore the external heat load is the governing boundary condition {{for the design of}} the internal cooling system of the blade. There is a continuous drive to increase the turbine entry temperature to increase the cycle efficiency, whilst developing blade cooling systems with higher efficiency (i. e. using less cooling air). A new systematic procedure has been developed and validated to predict the external heat transfer to a blade surface. The procedure allows for the unsteady effects caused by the passing of upstream nozzle guide vane (NGV) wakes. The early part of the suction surface was shown to have a pessimistic prediction of external heat transfer coefficient which resulted in unnecessary overcooling of the blade in this region. The heat transfer aspect is found from the well-known TEXSTAN differential boundary layer method, developed by Mike Crawford at Texas University from the original approach of Spalding and Patankar.

40|$|Boresonic {{examinations}} of older vintage steam turbine rotor forgings typically {{result in a}} large number of ultrasonic beam signals or “hits ” from inclusions and porosities (lack of ingot consolidation) associated with steel making practices of the late 40 ’s and early 50 ’s. This makes the task of processing and evaluating the data extremely difficult, often leading to very pessimistic estimates of final flaw size after “linkup ” which results in a recommendation to retire the rotor from service. An alternate flaw-tolerance approach to evaluation and processing of a large amount of boresonic data for a 50 ’s vintage LP rotor which was condemned by an OEM, was developed and utilized to justify continued operation of this rotor. Tolerable flaw sizes were calculated for a number of flaw shapes (aspect ratios) and distances from the bore surface {{along the length of the}} rotor. Boresonic data was then screened to identify critical locations in the rotor with potentially rejectable flaws. These locations were further characterized using ASME Code Inservice Inspection techniques employed in the commercial nuclear industry. This technique was used to analyze and disposition all significant ultrasonic and magnetic particle indications. A review of prior metallurgical examination results for near-bore indications was also performed, indicating no evidence of linkup or growth of these small flaws. It was therefore concluded that the rotor could be returned to service as-is for 10 additional years based on a conservatively estimated number of operating cycles and overspeed tests during that period.
