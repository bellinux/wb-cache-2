5|$|Magnetic brakes {{were first}} used on Nitro at Six Flags <b>Great</b> <b>Adventure</b> in 2001. Magnetic brakes slow down trains {{much faster than}} {{friction}} brakes; most B roller coasters built in or after 2001 {{have at least one}} set of magnetic brakes. Magnetic brakes do not make contact with the train. Fins that run parallel to the train are fitted beneath the seats. As the fins pass through the brakes, the magnetic field created by the brakes slows the train. Magnetic brakes have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B roller coasters such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland.|$|E
