5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis makes it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> the navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the night}} sky, Betelgeuse is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> {{with the naked}} eye owing to its {{distinctive}} orange-red color. In the Northern Hemisphere, beginning in January of each year, it can be seen rising in the east just after sunset. By mid-September to mid-March (best in mid-December), it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe, except for a few research stations in Antarctica at latitudes south of 82°. In May (moderate northern latitudes) or June (southern latitudes), the red supergiant can be seen briefly on the western horizon after sunset, reappearing again a few months later on the eastern horizon before sunrise. In the intermediate period (June–July) it is invisible to the naked eye (visible only with a telescope in daylight), unless around midday (when the Sun is below horizon) on Antarctic regions between 70° and 80° south latitude.|$|E
25|$|Also, graduating seniors {{find a way}} to adorn their beer jackets {{with the}} plaid in some fashion, making alums of the band <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1975, {{lamination}} {{over the}} bearer's photograph {{was introduced to}} make alteration harder. Overprinting of the laminate was added in 1981 <b>to</b> make removal <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b>|$|R
50|$|Though bear populations {{may not be}} increasing, human-bear {{encounters}} are on the rise. As Anchorage's {{population has}} increased and urbanization has removed forest, bears have become <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b>|$|R
25|$|Scientists {{announce}} {{they can}} now illuminate up to 100 biomarkers, ten {{times more than the}} previous standard. This breakthrough may make it much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> proteins in cancer cells – a vital diagnostic technique.|$|R
25|$|Wiesn Guglhupf Café-Dreh-Bar – A Guglhupf is a German cake, like an English bundt cake, {{and this}} slowly moving {{carousel}} bar is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> because it's shaped like one.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{reduction}} in their numbers in recent years, the traditional British red telephone kiosk can still be seen in many places throughout the UK, and in current or former British colonies around the world. The colour red was chosen to make them <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Normal {{phishing}} attempts can be <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> {{because the}} malicious page's URL will usually {{be different from}} the real site link. For covert redirect, an attacker could use a real website instead by corrupting the site with a malicious login popup dialogue box. This makes covert redirect different from others.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, the {{strategy}} of looking for double letters in the word being searched for (if a word list is provided) proves helpful, because it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> two identical side-by-side letters among a large grid of random letters.|$|R
50|$|Jerry Seltzer {{also changed}} {{some of the}} rules. For the first time, skaters were {{required}} to wear helmets, and, {{at the behest of}} KTVU television announcer Walt Harris, he made the game more TV-friendly by making jammers' helmets <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b>|$|R
50|$|Juice-marked cards - The marks {{are only}} visible {{when a person}} is trained to read the marks. No {{filtered}} sunglasses are required, but some practice is required to read the marks. Glasses can be used <b>to</b> make it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> these marks.|$|R
25|$|DNT also mark {{trails in}} the Park, with red Ts that are <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b> The T-trails {{lead the way}} cabin-to-cabin, as well as marking the path {{to some of the}} peaks close to Rondvatnet. Recently, some of the trails have moved {{slightly}} to avoid the core areas of the wild reindeer.|$|E
25|$|Covert Redirection takes {{advantage}} of third-party clients susceptible to XSS or Open Redirect attacks. Normal phishing attempts can be <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot,</b> because the malicious page's URL will usually be off {{by a couple of}} letters from that of the real site. The difference with Covert Redirection is that an attacker could use the real website instead by corrupting the site with a malicious login pop-up dialogue box.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{cessation}} of respiration, an obvious sign of sudden death, the {{cessation of}} circulation, and particularly {{the rhythm of the}} heart, is not as <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> for a lay observer, although a trained eye now can see signs such as lack of perfusion. Perhaps {{as a result of this}} being less obvious, the appreciation of artificial circulation as a key factor in resuscitation lagged considerably behind the obvious need for artificial respirations.|$|E
50|$|Overwatch {{tactics and}} firing at the short halt were {{especially}} important in armoured warfare before modern tank gun stabilizers were developed, since moving tanks were unlikely to hit any target. Even in modern tanks, however, it is much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> enemies at a halt.|$|R
500|$|The {{asymmetric}} sporophytes of Buxbaumia aphylla develop so {{that the}} opening is oriented towards the strongest source of light, usually towards the south. [...] The species often grows together with the diminutive liverwort Cephaloziella, which forms a blackish crust that is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> than Buxbaumia itself.|$|R
50|$|The {{footprints}} can {{be difficult}} to see. Many are covered at high tide so it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> see them after high tide when the tracks may retain small puddles of water. It is also <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> the footprints when the sun is low in the sky as longer shadows will help throw the footprints into relief.|$|R
25|$|Karnaugh {{maps are}} useful for {{detecting}} and eliminating race conditions. Race hazards are very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> using a Karnaugh map, because a race condition may exist when moving between any pair of adjacent, but disjoint, regions circumscribed on the map. However, {{because of the nature}} of Gray coding, adjacent has a special definition explained above - we're in fact moving on a torus, rather than a rectangle, wrapping around the top, bottom, and the sides.|$|E
25|$|Although ground sloths were {{relatively}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot,</b> {{this did not}} make hunting them easy. Big game hunters' weapons were useless if ground sloths were further than thirty feet away. Additionally, the ground sloths' already thick hide consisted of osteoderms, which made it exceptionally thick. It was difficult to take down a ground sloth with a spear-thrower; killing a ground sloth required extensive knowledge of the species. Ground sloths' size and claws were strong enough to tear apart tree branches, making it dangerous for hunters to approach these animals.|$|E
25|$|Ground sloths often fed in open fields. Recent {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to discover the diet of ground sloths through fossils of their dung. Analysis of these coproliths have found that ground sloths often ate the foliage of trees, hard grasses, shrubs, and yucca; these plants were located in areas that exposed them. Feeding in open areas made them susceptible to human interaction. Ground sloths were not only <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot,</b> but also had never interacted with humans before. They {{did not know how}} to react to these new beings. Additionally, these large mammals waddled on their hind legs and front knuckles, keeping their claws turned in. Their movement and massive build (some weighed up to 3,000 kilograms) imply they were relatively slow mammals. These constitute intuitive reasons why ground sloths would have been easy prey for hunters.|$|E
50|$|Another {{strategy}} {{is to look for}} 'outstanding' letters within the word one is searching for (if a word list is provided). Since most word searches use capital letters, it is <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> the letters that stand out from others. These letters are Q, O, U, X, and Z.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{high-level}} programming languages, such as Java, make debugging easier, {{because they}} have features such as exception handling that make real sources of erratic behaviour <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b> In programming languages such as C or assembly, bugs may cause silent problems such as memory corruption, and {{it is often difficult}} to see where the initial problem happened. In those cases, memory debugger tools may be needed.|$|R
5000|$|It {{also has}} {{free of charge}} turn-by-turn voice guided navigation, Here Drive 3.0 (earlier Nokia Drive), which {{can also be used}} without {{internet}} connection using preloaded maps. It is also possible to de-clutter the surroundings: version 1.5 has a [...] "Sightline" [...] feature where users can narrow their view to just what is in the direct line of sight, making it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> interesting places.|$|R
25|$|The {{formulation}} of glasses using lead, alumina, and thallium to increase RI and dispersion {{began in the}} late Baroque period. These glasses are fashioned into brilliants, and when freshly cut they can be surprisingly effective diamond simulants. Known as rhinestones, pastes, or strass, glass simulants are a common feature of antique jewelry; in such cases, rhinestones can be valuable historical artifacts in their own right. The great softness (below hardness 6) imparted by the lead means a rhinestone's facet edges and faces will quickly become rounded and scratched. Together with conchoidal fractures, and air bubbles or flow lines within the stone, these features make glass imitations <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> under only moderate magnification. In contemporary production it is more common for glass to be molded rather than cut into shape: in these stones the facets will be concave and facet edges rounded, and mold marks or seams may also be present. Glass has also been combined with other materials to produce composites.|$|E
25|$|The Maoz {{released}} its five boats at 21:10, and by 22:00, the boats were {{in close proximity}} to the Egyptian vessels. Two of the boats, manned by Ya'akov Vardi and Zalman Abramov, were intended for the actual sabotage, one as a reserve, manned by the commander Yohai Bin-Nun, and one to collect the commandos after the operation, manned by Yitzhak Brockman and Ya'akov Reitov. The Israeli sailors used helmets with infrared lights to ease the extraction process. The Egyptian ships, believing that a ceasefire was already in effect, had their lights on and were <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b> Despite this, according to a later Israeli estimate, they had been on full alert. Because the Egyptian ships were facing one another, Bin-Nun decided that Abramov and Vardi would attack the bows of the Emir Farouk and the minesweeper, respectively. This would {{make it more difficult for}} the Egyptians to fire at the boats should they have spotted them, because they could hit each other.|$|E
25|$|The ship left Danzig at 12:30 pm on 30 January 1945, {{accompanied}} by the passenger liner Hansa, also filled with civilians and military personnel, and two torpedo boats. Hansa and one torpedo boat developed mechanical problems and could not continue, leaving Wilhelm Gustloff with one torpedo boat escort, Löwe. The ship had four captains (Wilhelm Gustloffs captain, two merchant marine captains and {{the captain of the}} U-Boat complement housed on the vessel) on board, and they could not agree on the best course of action to guard against submarine attacks. Against the advice of the military commander, Lieutenant Commander Wilhelm Zahn (a submariner who argued for a course in shallow waters close to shore and without lights), Wilhelm Gustloffs captain—Friedrich Petersen—decided to head for deep water which was known to have been cleared of mines. When he was informed by a mysterious radio message of an oncoming German minesweeper convoy, he decided to activate his ship's red and green navigation lights so as to avoid a collision in the dark, making Wilhelm Gustloff <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> in the night.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{high-level}} programming languages, such as Java, make debugging easier, {{because they}} have features such as exception handling and type checking that make real sources of erratic behaviour <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b> In programming languages such as C or assembly, bugs may cause silent problems such as memory corruption, and {{it is often difficult}} to see where the initial problem happened. In those cases, memory debugger tools may be needed.|$|R

5000|$|The Legible London system {{comprises}} three {{sizes of}} sign, the [...] "Monolith", [...] "Midilith", and [...] "Minilith", {{made of a}} mixture of vitreous enamel and vinyl printed glass materials within a stainless steel frame. The signs have a bright yellow stripe {{on top of the}} panels with the walking person icon, intended <b>to</b> make them <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> within the urban environment and when viewed from a distance.|$|R
25|$|While market {{saturation}} was {{one reason}} for the fall in YAG production levels, another was the recent introduction of the other artificial garnet important as a diamond simulant, gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG; Gd3Ga5O12). Produced in much the same manner as YAG (but with a lower melting point of 1750nbsp&°C), GGG had an RI (1.97) close to, and a dispersion (0.045) nearly identical to diamond. GGG was also hard enough (hardness 7) and tough enough to be an effective gemstone, but its ingredients were also much more expensive than YAG's. Equally hindering was GGG's tendency to turn dark brown upon exposure to sunlight or other ultraviolet source: this was {{due to the fact that}} most GGG gems were fashioned from impure material that was rejected for technological use. The SG of GGG (7.02) is also the highest of all diamond simulants and amongst the highest of all gemstones, which makes loose GGG gems <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> by comparing their dimensions with their expected and actual weights. Relative to its predecessors, GGG was never produced in significant quantities; it became more or less unheard of by the close of the 1970s. Commercial names for GGG included Diamonique II and Galliant.|$|E
500|$|Bowfin prefer vegetated sloughs, lowland {{rivers and}} lakes, swamps, {{backwater}} areas, and are occasionally found in brackish water. They are well camouflaged, and not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> in slow water with abundant vegetation. [...] They often seek shelter under roots, and submerged logs. Oxygen-poor environments can be tolerated {{because of their}} ability to breathe air.|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} rubber-skinned T-600 and T-700 robots. McG interpreted Kyle Reese's {{description in}} the original film of the T-600 as being <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> by making them tall and bulky. For scenes of humans fighting with Terminators, the actors interacted with stuntmen wearing motion capture suits, later replaced by digital robots. For the Moto-Terminators, Ducati designers were hired to create the robots, and the on-screen robot {{was a combination of}} stuntmen driving actual Ducatis and a Moto-Terminator mock-up, as well as a digital Moto-Terminator. Visual effects studio Imaginary Forces created the Terminator point-of-view sequences, and tried to depict a simple interface, [...] "free of the frills—anything that a machine would not purely need", and with more software bugs and anomalies since the robots of Salvation were not as advanced as the Terminators from the previous films.|$|E
25|$|Bugs usually appear {{when the}} {{programmer}} makes a logic error. Various innovations in programming style and defensive programming {{are designed to}} make these bugs less likely, or <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b> Some typos, especially of symbols or logical/mathematical operators, allow the program to operate incorrectly, while others such as a missing symbol or misspelled name may prevent the program from operating. Compiled languages can reveal some typos when the source code is compiled.|$|R
50|$|The {{addresses}} {{found in}} the header fields of an email message are not directly used by mail exchangers to deliver the message. An email message also contains a message envelope that contains the information for mail routing. While envelope and header addresses may be equal, forged email addresses are often seen in spam, phishing, and many other Internet-based scams. This has led to several initiatives which aim to make such forgeries <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot.</b>|$|R
50|$|Upgrades can be {{purchased}} at stations throughout the game. Upgrades cost grub energy that has been collected throughout Zero's journey. Grubs are small parasite-like creatures that cling to objects and give off a purple glow. This glow makes them <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>spot,</b> although many of these grubs are located in hard to reach places and require extra skill or more powers to reach. Once a grub is found, Zero consumes it and absorbs its energy.|$|R
