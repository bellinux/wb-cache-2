5|$|Alchemical {{magic was}} used to create or alter potions to achieve more {{powerful}} effects, repair or enchant items, identify unknown items or creatures, and combine different Order or Chaos spells to create spells with multiple elements (such as earth and fire spells creating a molten metal spell). Alchemical magic could also imbue a target with elemental attributes; for example, a warrior <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> the Water element would deal extra cold-type damage but receive additional heat-type damage.|$|E

5|$|In a Christianized version, the duel {{involves}} the Christian St.Elijah and the ala, {{but there is}} a belief that the saint and the dragons in fact cooperate: as soon as St.Elijah spots an ala, he summons the dragons, either takes them aboard his chariot or harnesses them to it, and they jointly shoot the ala with lightning. Arrow-shaped stones, like belemnites or stone-age arrowheads, are regarded as materialized lightning bolts <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> a beneficial magical power, and finding one is a good omen.|$|E
5|$|The fictional {{character}} Spider-Man, a {{comic book}} superhero created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and featured in Marvel Comics publications, has currently appeared in ten live-action films since his inception, not including fan made shorts. Spider-Man is the alter-ego of Peter Parker, a talented young freelance photographer and aspiring scientist, and Miles Morales, a high school student, both <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> superhuman abilities after being bitten by radioactive/genetically-altered spiders.|$|E
5|$|The {{illustrations}} and ornamentation of the Book of Kells surpass that {{of other}} Insular Gospel books in extravagance and complexity. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, together with Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements are <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations.|$|E

Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> virtue. However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room. Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at the doorway to gain entrance.|$|E

The recipient is either killed or <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> the powerful darkspawn essence, the Taint, granting them {{the ability to}} sense Darkspawn and a rudimentary connection into their hive mind. Afterwards, the player and fellow Grey Warden, Alistair, are tasked with lighting a beacon {{at the top of}} the fortress to signal Loghain's men into charging the horde's flank. However, upon arriving, Loghain abandons the battlefield with his army, leaving Cailan, Duncan, and their army to be overwhelmed and slain by the Darkspawn, who seize control of Ostagar and begin advancing into southern Ferelden.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{primarily}} at Langley Field, Virginia, Olds virtually made daily {{contact with the}} small group of officers who would lead the US Army Air Forces in World War II (one neighbor was Major Carl Spaatz, destined to become the first Chief of Staff of the USAF), and as a result was <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> an unusually strong dedication to the air service, and conversely, with a low tolerance for officers who did not exhibit the same. On November 10, 1925, his father appeared as a witness on behalf of Billy Mitchell during Mitchell's court-martial in Washington, D.C.. He brought three-year-old Robin with him to court, dressed in an Air Service uniform, and posed with him for newspaper photographers before testifying.|$|E

5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> strength of character and depth of personality, which has been {{compared with that of}} the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E

According to the American historian Edmund Burke, al-Qassam was:An individual deeply <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> the Islamic social gospel and who was struck by the plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants. Al-Qassam's pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at {{the ways in which the}} old implicit social compact was being violated in the circumstances of British mandatory Palestine. This anger fueled a political radicalism that drove him eventually to take up arms and marks him off from the Palestinian notable politicians.|$|E

The tactic is successful until Admiral Pellaeon and the smuggler Talon Karrde—on opposing sides but desiring peace—expose Flim. Meanwhile, at a fortress called the Hand of Thrawn, Luke and Mara discover a gestating and near-complete clone of Thrawn, which is killed during their escape.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light.

5|$|Like many of Verne's novels, {{the play}} is deeply <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> themes of initiation, echoing the {{traditional}} mythic pattern of a young hero coming of age and reaching maturity through a dangerous and transformative journey. In Journey Through the Impossible, the young Georges, initially trapped by obsessions {{similar to those that}} drove his father mad, resolves his inner torments during a harrowing series of experiences in which Ox and Volsius compete as substitute father-figures. Both father-figures are highly symbolic: Ox is a sinister tempter representing knowledge and science, balancing the Guardian Angel Volsius.|$|E
5|$|After Andrianampoinimerina reunited {{the divided}} and warring Kingdom of Imerina, he {{successfully}} pursued an expansionist policy that saw his authority extended {{over a large}} portion of Madagascar by {{the time of his death}} in 1810. Having captured Antananarivo by 1793 and transferred his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo the following year, Andrianampoinimerina established new structures on the Rova grounds that would become <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> the political and historic significance of his reign. In keeping with the tradition of Merina sovereigns before him, each building was assigned a name by which it could be distinguished. Several of the buildings were used interchangeably by the king as personal residences, including Manjakamiadana ("Where It is Pleasant to Rule"), Besakana, Manatsaralehibe ("Vast Improvement", also called Manatsara)—which he alone was authorised to enter—and Marivolanitra ("Beneath the Heavens"), a building reportedly designed with a staircase leading to a rooftop observation deck from which the king could observe the town and plains below.|$|E

5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Soul Reaver, 1500 years later, Kain is a despotic emperor, his vampires {{dominate}} the land, and Nosgoth hinges {{on the brink of}} collapse. The Elder God, a demiurge-like entity, lurks beneath Nosgoth and controls the cycle of reincarnation; the vampires, whose biological immortality opposes his doctrine, are his enemies. In Soul Reaver, Raziel—Kain's lieutenant—is executed by Kain, but The Elder God resurrects him and encourages him to exact revenge. Traversing the wasteland and murdering the vampires, Raziel confronts Kain, who attacks him with the Soul Reaver sword, <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> a spirit which absorbs its victims' souls. The Soul Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and the blade's spirit binds itself to his arm. His motives still mysterious, Kain lures Raziel through a time portal into Nosgoth's past.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{compounds}} built within the rova by successive Merina rulers bears distinct architectural styles that reflect the dramatic changes experienced in Imerina over {{the reign of the}} 19th century Kingdom of Madagascar, which saw the arrival and rapid expansion of European influence at the royal court. The site contains a blend of traditional Merina and European styles and construction methods. The predominant architectural features and layout of the royal city follow the traditional model of rova construction that predominated in the Highlands from the 15th century. Following tradition, the homes of the living are constructed of wood and vegetation (living materials), while the tombs of the dead are built in stone (cold, inert material). The selection of specific wood and plant materials used in construction, each of which were <b>imbued</b> <b>with</b> distinct symbolic meaning, reflected traditional social norms and spiritual beliefs. Since 1996, many of the buildings have undergone restoration using traditional materials and construction practices appropriate to the era in which the buildings were first erected.|$|E
