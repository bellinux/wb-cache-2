5|$|Fifty-six {{games into}} his 2001–02 {{season with the}} Rangers, Sather dealt Malhotra to the Dallas Stars at the trade deadline, along with winger Barrett Heisten, in {{exchange}} for forwards Martin Rucinsky and Roman Lyashenko. Although he had established himself as an effective forechecker and defensive forward, Malhotra did not materialize into the offensive player the Rangers <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be.|$|E
5|$|In 1163, a {{conflict}} arose between {{the king and}} the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, over {{the rights of the}} king in the English church. At a council held at Westminster in October 1163, the king and Becket contended over the question, with the bishops supporting Becket against the king. Robert was involved in the conflict not only as a bishop-elect, but as an envoy to Becket from the pope, as he accompanied Philip of Aumone, a French abbot, who was sent by Alexander to Becket in after the Council of Westminster to urge Becket not to inflame the situation. Robert went with Philip, probably because it was <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to influence Becket.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, Taylor's {{offensive}} scrambling, while effective, was not Virginia Tech's primary rushing weapon. Running back Brandon Ore, Virginia Tech's starter at the position, {{would need}} to have a good game, analysts predicted, if the Hokies wanted to win the game. Ore, who suffered several injuries during the 2006 season, failed to produce meaningful offensive yardage until late in the season, disappointing many fans who <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> repeat his excellent 2006performance on the field. With a 146-yard performance against Virginia in the final game of the regular season, Ore seemed to have regained his 2006form and promised success in the ACC Championship Game.|$|E

5|$|De Ferran was {{confident}} {{that he could be}} competitive and achieve a good result without having to worry about the championship. Da Matta felt his team had learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed would help him in California where he wanted to win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana and hoped that he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{member and}} lead singer Peter Gabriel {{decided to leave}} Genesis in late 1974, midway through the tour for the album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The other members <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> reconsider, as {{they were still in}} debt and felt his {{departure}} could destroy the band's future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members felt they still wanted to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Keyboardist Tony Banks had been close to Gabriel personally, and did not want the band to split up on top of seeing less of one of his best friends. He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.|$|E
5|$|Romesha {{was born}} in August 1981 in Lake City, California, to a family with a strong {{military}} background. His grandfather, Aury Smith, is a World War II veteran who fought in the Battle of Normandy. His father is a Vietnam War veteran who later became a church leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Romesha is the fourth of five siblings, including two brothers who also joined the military. He {{is a member of}} the LDS Church and attended seminary for four years during high school but ultimately decided not to become a missionary for the church as his family had <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> Romesha grew up in Lake City, where he developed an avid love of hockey.|$|E

5|$|Banister {{attended}} La Marque High School in La Marque, Texas. At La Marque, Banister {{played for}} the school's baseball, basketball, and American football teams. During his sophomore year of high school, Banister injured his right ankle while playing baseball. During an examination of his ankle, which was slow to heal, {{he was diagnosed with}} bone cancer. He had developed cysts that required skin grafting to treat. An infection in his leg {{led to the development of}} osteomyelitis, which spread from his right ankle to just below his knee. Doctors recommended amputation in order to save the rest of his leg, but Banister refused, as he <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to continue his baseball career. Doctors performed seven operations on his leg, which saved it from being amputated. In his senior year, Banister suffered a knee injury playing American football, which nearly led to him being cut from the baseball team due to his decreased mobility. His father suggested he change positions and become a catcher, which allowed him to remain on the baseball team.|$|E

Obviously upset that Constantine had {{neglected}} them {{in his efforts to}} establish his own empire and had failed to defend them against the assaults they had <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> prevent, the Roman inhabitants of Britain and Armorica rebelled against Constantine's authority and expelled his officials.|$|E

25|$|Anti-lynching advocates such as Mary McLeod Bethune and Walter Francis White {{campaigned for}} presidential {{candidate}} Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. They <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> lend public support to their efforts against lynching. Senators Robert F. Wagner and Edward P. Costigan drafted the Costigan-Wagner bill in 1934 to require local authorities to protect prisoners from lynch mobs. Like the Dyer bill, it made lynching a Federal crime {{in order to}} take it out of state administration.|$|E
25|$|Bunche {{resigned}} {{from his position}} at the UN due to ill health, {{but this was not}} announced as Secretary-General U Thant <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to return soon. His health did not improve, and Bunche died December 9, 1971, at age 68, from complications of diabetes mellitus. He was survived by his wife, daughter Joan, son Ralph, and the three Pierce grandchildren. His wife later enjoyed three additional grandchildren and several great-grandchildren. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1945, McBride named 36-year-old Ohio State Buckeyes coach Paul Brown as the team's {{head coach}} and general manager {{and gave him a}} share in its profits. The move {{surprised}} and upset Buckeye fans, who had <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> resume his successful run at the school after the war. Brown, who had built an impressive record as coach of a Massillon, Ohio, high school team and brought the Buckeyes their first national championship, at the time was serving in the U.S. Navy and coached the football team at Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago.|$|E

25|$|At the 2013 NHL trade deadline, Redden {{was traded}} to the Boston Bruins in {{exchange}} for a conditional seventh-round pick in 2014 on April 3, 2013. The Bruins <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> rediscover the chemistry he had with former Senators teammate Zdeno Chára and return to elite form, though he was a non-factor for the Bruins. In six regular-season games with the Bruins, Redden scored one goal and had one assist. In Game 1 of the 2013 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals series, Redden scored a goal and added an assist in the Bruins' 4–1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
25|$|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin died in New York City, {{where he}} was in {{residence}} at the Jesuit Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, Park Avenue. On March 15, 1955, {{at the house of}} his diplomat cousin Jean de Lagarde, Teilhard told friends he <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> die on Easter Sunday. In the Easter Sunday evening of April 10, 1955, during an animated discussion at the apartment of Rhoda de Terra, his personal assistant since 1949, the 73-year-old priest suffered a heart attack; regaining consciousness for a moment, he died a few minutes later. He was buried in the cemetery for the New York Province of the Jesuits at the Jesuit novitiate, St. Andrew-on-Hudson in Hyde Park, New York.|$|E
25|$|Henry's {{primary concern}} during his reign was {{settling}} the Investiture Controversy, which had caused a serious dispute {{during the previous}} reign. The papal party who had supported Henry in his resistance to his father <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> assent to the papal decrees, which had been renewed by PaschalII at the synod of Guastalla in1106. The king, however, continued to invest the bishops, but wished the pope to hold a council in Germany to settle the question. After some hesitation, Paschal preferred France to Germany, and, after holding a council at Troyes, renewed his prohibition of lay investiture. The matter slumbered until1110, when, negotiations between king and pope having failed, Paschal renewed his decrees and Henry invaded Italy with a large army.|$|E

25|$|Bogart {{attended}} the private Delancey School until fifth grade, then the prestigious Trinity School. He was an indifferent, sullen student who showed {{no interest in}} after-school activities. Later {{he went to the}} equally elite boarding school Phillips Academy, where he was admitted based on family connections. His parents <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go on to Yale, but in 1918 Bogart was expelled. Several reasons have been given: one claims that it was for throwing the headmaster (or a groundskeeper) into Rabbit Pond on campus. Another cites smoking, drinking, poor academic performance, and possibly some inappropriate comments made to the staff. A third has him withdrawn by his father for failing to improve his grades. Whatever caused his premature departure, his parents were deeply dismayed and rued their failed plans for his future.|$|E
25|$|Vere {{decided on}} a plan to take {{advantage}} of the Spanish activity and this required the deployment of a body of English - 500 horse and 1,200 musketeers and pikemen, a force which was readily placed under his orders by Maurice. About two thirds of the way from the Anglo-Dutch camp there was a bridge over the broader road which Vere marched to early the next morning. He sent 200 light horse to attack the Spanish outposts and then retreat where they would be caught by the Spanish veterans. In the meantime he placed his infantry in ambush, one detachment close to the bridge, the other about a quarter of a mile further back, and the rest of his cavalry in the rear. Vere <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be able to lure Parma's seasoned veterans of Spaniards and Italian Tercios into a fight.|$|E
25|$|When Gonzalo {{arrived at}} the main bohío of Quemuenchatocha, he found the Muisca ruler sitting in his throne and {{surrounded}} by his closest companions. All men were dressed in expensive mantles and adorned with golden crowns. On August 20, 1537, the Spanish beat the zaque and the big and strong Muisca ruler was taken captive to Suesca. There he was tortured and the Spanish soldiers <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> reveal where he hid his precious properties. The absence of Quemuenchatocha paved the route for his nephew Aquiminzaque to succeed him as ruler of the northern Muisca, a practice common in Muisca traditions. When Quemuenchatocha was finally released from captivity in Suesca, he fled to Ramiriquí, where he died shortly after. The Spanish soldiers found gold, emeralds, silver, mantles and other valuables in Tunja. They {{were not able to}} take all the precious pieces and many were secretly taken away by the Muisca, using folded deer skins. They hid the valuables in nearby hills.|$|E
