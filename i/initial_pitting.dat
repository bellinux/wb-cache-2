40|$|Abstract: The {{application}} of gear fault prediction techniques to experimental data is examined. A single mesh spur gear fatigue rig {{was used to}} produce naturally occurring faults {{on a number of}} test gear sets. Gear tooth surface pitting was the primary failure mode for a majority of the test runs. The damage ranged from moderate pitting on two teeth in one test to spalling on several teeth in another test. Previously published failure prediction techniques were applied to the data as it was acquired to provide a means of monitoring tht. test and stopping it when a failure was suspected. A newly developed technique along with variations of published methods were also applied to the experimental data. The published methods experienced some success in detecting <b>initial</b> <b>pitting</b> before it progressed to affect the overall root-mean-square (RMS) vibration level. The new technique robustly detected the damage on all of the tests, and in most cases continued to react to the damage as it spread and increased in severity. Since no single method was able to consistently predict the damage first on all the runs, it was concluded that the best approach to reliably detect pitting damage is to use a combination of detection methods.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fieldwork was {{executed}} at the University of Oxford Botanic Garden located in central Oxford, UK {{in order to}} examine enlarged holes on the surface of a c. 380 -year-old border wall comprised of Headington stone. There are bee hotels located in the walled section within the Garden, where it is thought that red mason bees are responsible for the holes. Manual counts of the holes, however, revealed no clear spatial trend of an increasing frequency closer to the bee hotels. Supplementary research was conducted in order to ascertain the cause of these noticeable masonry holes. A digital pH meter was employed on-site with runoff collection of distilled water to measure surface acidity, which could be responsible for <b>initial</b> <b>pitting</b> on these limestone walls that could then be exploited (and enlarged) by bees. However, these large holes, measuring up to 23. 41 mm across, could not be the product of environmental acidity alone, as due to organic acids released by (climbing) plants also found in this area. This multivariate problem is considered from all biological angles, including consideration of the influence of acidity due to vegetation (climbing plants) and the influence of bees. Both may be required for the establishment of these weathering features and their enlargement to holes. Even though it is known that bees are capable of removing sand grains to enlarge concavities in walls, they are not known t...|$|E
40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) remains {{a problem in}} both Al-Li and conventional Al heat treatable alloys. It has recently been found that relatively small additions (less than or approximately 1 wt-percent) of Zn can dramatically improve the SCC performance of alloy 8090 (Al-Li-Cu-Mg-Zr). Constant load time to failure experiments using cylindrical tensile samples loaded between 30 and 85 percent of TYS indicate improvements of orders of magnitude over the baseline 8090 for the Zn-containing alloys under certain aging conditions. However, the toughnesses of the alloys were noticeably degraded due {{to the formation of}} second phase particles which primarily reside on grain and subgrain boundaries. EDS revealed that these intermetallic particles were Cu and Zn rich. The particles were present in the T 3 condition and were not found {{to be the result of}} quench rate, though their size and distribution were. At 5 hours at 160 C, the alloys displayed the greatest susceptibility to SCC but by 20 hours at 160 C the alloys demonstrated markedly improved TTF lifetimes. Aging past this time did not provide separable TTF results, however, the alloy toughnesses continued to worsen. Initial examination of the alloys microstructures at 5 and 20 hours indicated some changes most notably the S' and delta' distributions. A possible model by which this may occur will be explored. Polarization experiments indicated a change in the trend of E(sub BR) and passive current density at peak aging as compared to the baseline 8090. <b>Initial</b> <b>pitting</b> experiments indicated that the primary pitting mechanism in chloride environments is one occurring at constituent (Al-Fe-Cu) particles and that the Cu and Zn rich boundary precipitates posses a breakaway potential similar to that of the matrix acting neither anodic or cathodic in the first set of aerated 3. 5 w/o NaCl experiments. Future work will focus on the identification of the second phase particles, evaluation of K(sub 1 SCC) and plateau da/dt via both DCB and slow strain rate techniques.

30|$|As {{the actual}} shape of pits does {{influence}} {{the energy of}} the system and, more in general, island nucleation [26, 27], it is crucial to control their morphology.

30|$|In contrast, NEPL {{transfers}} {{the energy}} of the nanosecond electrical pulse discharges directly into the volume of the solid material by direct contact between the probe and the solid, where it creates a discharge plasma channel. A micro-explosion occurs during release of energy in the discharge channel in the solid resulting in formation of a crater and separation of a portion from the solid material. Microcracks caused by the electrical breakdown then begin to accumulate within the stone. After that, these microcracks combine and form a main crack connected with the <b>initial</b> <b>pitted</b> area between the electrodes and lead to the subsequent splitting of the stone (Semkin et al. 1995;Kurets et al. 2002;Martov et al. 2013).

Both materials were studied in as-received condition and also after heat-treatment at 1100 °C for two hours. This thermal process was performed to generate an alumina layer on the intermetallic surface {{with the purpose of}} improving its corrosion resistance. The polarization resistance method and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveal similar corrosion resistance values for all samples although the corrosion attack produced is different. This result indicates that for these intermetallic alloys the alumina layer generated after two hours heat treatment is a low protecting layer due to the presence of additional oxides.

40|$|Previously, {{researchers}} {{investigated the}} mechanism of surface defect evolution in rolling. It was highlighted how the lubricant plays an essential role for the final strip surface quality. In some cases the lubricant can be entrapped in pits or in other defects where hydrostatic pressure tends to prevent its elimination; however, when some favorable conditions are satisfied, the lubricant can be drawn out by hydrodynamic actions and defects can be recovered. This mechanism {{has been described as}} microplastohydrodynamic lubrication (MPHL) and recent studies report a suitable parameter (the ratio of the oil drawn out from the <b>pit</b> to the <b>initial</b> <b>pit</b> volume) as MPHL characterization coefficient. The present paper deals with the recovery of isolated surface defects in the Sendzimir rolling process of AISI 304 stainless steel; the analyses have been conducted on two rolling conditions, which although quite similar, regularly showed opposite capability of defect recovery, moreover, with a trend that is in contrast with the predictions made by standard MPHL. Two effects, which are usually ignored in literature modeling, have been considered in this work: The former is the back-tension, which has relevant outcome on the contact pressure and the latter is the position of the neutral point, which cannot be assumed to lie {{at the end of the}} roll bite. The analytical treatment was supported by FEM simulations, which permitted to put realistic data into the MPHL equations, thus, to explain the experimental behavior. The analysis was then validated with two further rolling schedules that seem to confirm the proposed approach. Copyright © 2011 by ASME...|$|R

The whole lifetime process of structural components was divided into four stages: coating failure, pit nucleation and growth, shortcrack growth, and long-crack expansion. The failure time of coating was assessed by way of formulation and implementation of accelerated environmental spectrum, and a four-stage model was established by analysis of pitting corrosion and derivation of the crack expansion equation. The assessment was virtually consistent with the stringer. Findings showed that pit nucleation and growth and short-crack growth account for approximately 75 % of the entire lifetime.

The exfoliation corrosion was a two-stage process: an <b>initial</b> stage of <b>pitting</b> corrosion starting at the material surface and a propagation stage of the corrosion process parallel to the surface along the extrusion direction.

The comparison of the morphology, specific surface area and apparent density of the <b>initial</b> and <b>pitting</b> corroded carbonyl iron microspheres demonstrate that the pitting corroded carbonyl iron has a hollow structure. The pitting corrosion process is uncovered through the concentration change of ferrous ion in the reaction solution and the TEM images with different pitting corrosion time. The formation mechanism of hollow microspheres via pitting corrosion is analyzed. Furthermore, this pitting corrosion method {{can also be used}} to prepare other hollow metal particles, such as Ni, Co, and Cu particles. The electromagnetic parameters of the samples before and after pitting corrosion are measured. The calculated reflection loss of the pitting corroded sample for single layer of 0. 5 mm or 1. 0 mm thickness at 2 - 18 GHz is much better than that of the initial one.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{evolution}} of cracks {{as a result}} of strain-assisted corrosion is presented. The considered cracks possess a realistic geometry, where the tip region {{is an integral part of}} the crack surface instead of being a singular point. This geometry is either implicitly defined or is a consequence of crack nucleation from surface irregularities. The evolution model poses a moving boundary value problem, where material dissolution advances the boundary exposed to the corrosive environment. A controlling mechanism for the boundary advancement is the rupture of a brittle corrosion-protective film, which is continually building-up along the corroding surface. The rate of boundary evolution is a function of the degree of the protective film damage, caused by mechanical straining. Thus, no crack growth criterion is needed for the analysis. A FEM based program with various procedures for tracking the moving boundary is used as a solution tool. A number of problems are considered – cracks with realistic geometries with tips embedded in a square-root singular stress field, and cracks nucleating from surface pits and propagating in either a homogeneous material or in a bi-material system. The presented results show the importance of the crack width, interpreted as grain boundaries inter-phase thickness, as well as the various shape parameters describing the crack tip region, for the stress corrosion crack growth rate. Further, the results clearly demonstrate that the interaction between the surface deformation and the protective film is primarily responsible for the dissolution localisation along a narrow surface region, such that a crack is formed from a pit and the crack shape is maintained during the evolution. The influence of the <b>initial</b> <b>pit</b> aspect ratio on the crack nucleation phase is investigated, as well as the competition of cracks evolving from closely situated pits. It is shown how these results could be used for estimation of the arrested cracks distribution along a corroding surface. In the cases of corrosion cracks growing across bi-material interfaces the numerical results for the crack morphology are shown to be in qualitative agreement with a real life example. In all these cases the cracks pass the interface being either accelerated or inhibited, depending on the elastic mismatch of the bi-material system. Design recommendations are proposed on the bases of the presented results. Finally, a perturbation model for a non-homogeneous material is proposed. The model is used in the analysis of an ideal crack with one tip interfering with an inclusion, introduced in a plane homogeneous elastic body, and having arbitrarily varying elastic characteristics. The solution is given in terms of an area integral and further specialised to an inclusion shaped as a layer stretching perpendicularly to the crack plane. A closed form result for this special case is derived and compared with numerical results obtained for finite variations of the elastic modulus. A wide range of validity of the perturbation solution is discovered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Postharvest fruit {{conservation}} {{relies on}} low temperatures and manipulations of hormone metabolism to maintain sensory properties. Peaches {{are susceptible to}} chilling injuries, such as ?woolliness? that is caused by juice loss leading to a ?wooly? fruit texture. Application of gibberellic acid at the <b>initial</b> stages of <b>pit</b> hardening impairs woolliness incidence, however the mechanisms controlling the response remain unknown. We have employed genome wide transcriptional profiling to investigate the effects of gibberellic acid application and cold storage on harvested peaches. Results: Approximately half of the investigated genes exhibited significant differential expression {{in response to the}} treatments. Cellular and developmental process gene ontologies were overrepresented among the differentially regulated genes, whereas sequences in cell death and immune response categories were underrepresented. Gene set enrichment demonstrated a predominant role of cold storage in repressing the transcription of genes associated to cell wall metabolism. In contrast, genes involved in hormone responses exhibited a more complex transcriptional response, indicating an extensive network of crosstalk between hormone signaling and low temperatures. Time course transcriptional analyses demonstrate the large contribution of gene expression regulation on the biochemical changes leading to woolliness in peach. Conclusion: Overall, our results provide insights on the mechanisms controlling the complex phenotypes associated to postharvest textural changes in peach and suggest that hormone mediated reprogramming previous to pit hardening affects the onset of chilling injuries.

40|$|Chinese strong-flavored liquor (CSFL) {{accounts}} for more than 70 % of all Chinese liquor production. Microbes in pit mud play key roles in the fermentation cellar for the CSFL production. However, microbial diversity, community structure, and cellar-age-related changes in pit mud are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prokaryotic community structure and diversity in pit-mud samples with different cellar ages (1, 10, 25, and 50 years) using the pyrosequencing technique. Results indicated that prokaryotic diversity increased with cellar age until the age reached 25 years and that prokaryotic community structure changed significantly between three cellar ages (1, 10, and 25 years). Significant correlations between prokaryotic communities and environmental variables (pH, NH 4 +, lactic acid, butyric acid, and caproic acid) were observed. Overall, our study results suggested that the long-term brewing operation shapes unique prokaryotic community structure and diversity as well as pit-mud chemistry. We have proposed a three-phase model to characterize the changes of pit-mud prokaryotic communities. (i) Phase I is an <b>initial</b> domestication period. <b>Pit</b> mud is characterized by abundant Lactobacillus and high lactic acid and low pH levels. (ii) Phase II is a transition period. While Lactobacillus abundance decreases dramatically, that of Bacteroidetes and methanogens increases. (iii) Phase III is a relative mature period. The prokaryotic community shows the highest diversity and capability to produce more caproic acid as a precursor for synthesis of ethyl caproate, the main flavor component in CSFL. This research provides scientific evidence to support the practical experience that old fermentation cellars produce high-quality liquor...|$|R
40|$|The {{predominant}} {{site for}} the initiation of pitting on austenitic stainless steel {{has been shown to}} be sulfide inclusions and notably the manganese types of sulfides. Dissolution of inclusions has been observed and suggested to be the <b>initial</b> step for <b>pit</b> initiation, though several explanations for the mechanisms causing initiation has been proposed. Regarding welded stainless steels, several microstructural changes have been described and suggested to contribute to the decreased corrosion resistance in the weld zone. An area which has not been investigated much is the contribution of inclusions, in particular MnS inclusions, to the reduced corrosion resistance and the initiation of pitting in the weld zone. In the present work a literature review of the investigations focusing on the initiation of pitting by sulfide inclusions in austenitic stainless steels has been provided. A literature review of investigations focusing on the effects of welding on the microstructure, inclusions and the corrosion properties in the weld zone of austenitic stainless steels has also been provided. Experimental work was performed to obtain results which could be compared to or verify findings and suggestions from the reviewed literature regarding the initiation of pitting by inclusions. Observations of MnS inclusions as the preferential site for pit initiation in austenitic stainless steel was tried recreated. The hypothesis saying that dissolution of MnS inclusions occur prior to the initiation of pitting was also tried verified. It was also performed experiments to obtain results which could give knowledge about the effects of MnS inclusions on the corrosion properties and the initiation of pitting in the weld zone of an austenitic stainless steel. Along with this, the corrosion behaviour and microstructural changes in the weld zone in general and compared with the base metal were studied. A part of the work was also to study the effect of a lacking inert shielding gas during welding. Samples of a 316 L stainless steel were first examined in SEM to study the microstructure and to identify inclusions. Then, some samples were welded, followed by SEM examination. Then all samples were polarized electrochemically in synthetic seawater with the purpose of initiating pitting. After the polarization, all samples were examined in SEM again to correlate pitting attack to inclusions and to compare microstructural changes and the corrosion behaviour in the base metal and the weld zone. It was verified that the main initiation site for pitting in the base metal was MnS inclusions. It was indicated that dissolution of the MnS inclusions started the pit initiation process, with the contribution of released compounds from the inclusions. An average percent of inclusions showing an inactive behavior regarding the initiation of pitting was 38 %, verifying similar observations reported in earlier investigations. A nitric acid treatment to remove MnS inclusions improved the pitting resistance significantly. The welding caused the initiation of corrosion at lower potentials when performing electrochemical polarization in synthetic seawater. The corrosion mechanism was probably grain boundary corrosion caused by precipitation of chromium carbides in the grain boundaries. A lacking inert shielding gas during welding did not have any effect on the potential for the initiation of corrosion when comparing two samples welded with and without shielding gas. It was indicated that compositional changes had occurred for MnS inclusions in a certain distance from the fusion line. These changes may have caused the inclusions to be more prone to initiate pitting. Further investigation should be performed to clarify the behaviour of such inclusions, and their susceptibility towards the initiation of corrosion. Grain boundary corrosion in various grades had occurred in the HAZ in certain distances from the fusion line. In a further distance from the fusion line pitting-like corrosion in clusters, possibly induced by chromium depletion after forming chromium oxides combined with a thin oxide film, had occurred. The grain boundary corrosion and the pitting cluster attack are from the experimental results believed to be more important for the failure of the welded stainless steel investigated in this work, than pitting initiated at MnS inclusions changed by the welding process. </p...|$|R
