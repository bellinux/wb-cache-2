40|$|Abstract—This paper, {{based on}} {{existing}} researches, taking journal articles on <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> trade as research object {{to explore the}} field’s research status, hot spots and novel direction by applying co-word clustering analysis and strategic diagram.

The study suggests that carbon emission <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> trade and <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> trade are the most novel research fields. In addition, the research on comparative advantage of environment has aroused much attention although neither its research direction nor research content is mature.

5|$|In 1974 and 1975 concern came {{to focus}} on uranium mining in Australia and several Friends of the Earth groups were formed. The Australian Conservation Foundation also began voicing concern about uranium mining and {{supporting}} {{the activities of the}} grass-roots organisations. Concern about the <b>environmental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> uranium mining was a significant factor and poor management of waste at an early uranium mine, Rum Jungle, led it to become a significant pollution problem in the 1970s. The Australian anti-nuclear movement also acquired initial impetus from notable individuals who publicly voiced nuclear concerns, such as nuclear scientists Richard Temple and Rob Robotham, and poets Dorothy Green and Judith Wright.|$|E

5|$|Industry representatives {{complained that}} the final rule overstated the <b>environmental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> corn ethanol, and also criticized the {{inclusion}} of ILUC as an unfair penalty to domestic corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} was being tied to U.S. ethanol production.

5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and <b>environmental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E
5|$|The Negative Declaration for the {{expansion}} of US 113 from {{the north end of the}} Frederica bypass to US 113 Alternate at Little Heaven was issued in 1975, and construction began that same year. The FredericaLittle Heaven divided highway was completed in 1977. Design work for the divided highway from Little Heaven to Dover Air Force Base began as early as 1964, and considerable planning and design work was done before that work came to a halt in the 1970s. In addition to the <b>environmental</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the highway crossing a large marsh, which required DelDOT to produce a draft environmental impact statement, DelDOT needed to coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard to construct a new bridge across the St. Jones River. US 113 was finally expanded to a divided highway, including a four-lane bridge across the St. Jones River, by 1985. The final stretch of two-lane US 113 in Delaware was eliminated when the second carriageway was added to the highway from Bedford Street in Georgetown to north of Lincoln in 1995 and 1996. This expansion, in particular a section near Ellendale, was included in a Federal Highway Administration pavement study.|$|E

40|$|Variance {{components}} for additive direct, additive maternal, permanent <b>environmental</b> maternal <b>effects,</b> the covariance between additive direct and maternal effects were estimated by restricted maximum likelihood, fitting four animal models from 1359 pedigree male birth weight records of Afrikaner cattle of Zimbabwe.

40|$|From the 1970 's, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) {{flowed into}} host countries. With the {{development}} of economy in host countries the environment deteriorated. The overall goal {{of this paper is}} to estimate whether the impacts of FDI positive or negative on environment in host countries. To meet this overall goal, it is constructed a simultaneous system with data of 28 provinces in China (1992 - 2008). This system supposes the pollution indicators to be determined by economic scale, industrial composition and pollution density of a province, in which pollution density is created to estimate the <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> FDI more exactly than traditional technological character. Also the domestic and foreign capital is tried to distinguish to make the pollution source clear. Based on a panel data of 28 provinces (1992 - 2008) with the three-stage least squares (3 sls) estimator, the results of the system show that with the domestic investment, the <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> is positive, which means that FDI increases pollution emission. The direct <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> FDI, which does not include domestic investment, is different decided by various pollution indicators.

40|$|Abstract. Biochar, a {{by-product}} of biomass pyrolysis, has been suggested {{as a mean to}} combat climate change by sequestering carbon, {{and at the same time}} to provide energy and increase crop yields. As one possible source of the components with high aromatic structure in soil humus, biochar is of great importance in increasing soil carbon storage and improving soil fertility, and in maintaining the balance of soil ecosystem. This paper briefly reviewed and synthesized recent findings and discussions regarding the production and characteristics <b>of</b> biochar, its <b>effects</b> on global climate change and particularly in relation to the <b>environmental</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> biochar in soil.
