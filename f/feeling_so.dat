5|$|I wish I could dissent {{from the}} general, though not universal, chorus of dispraise that has greeted this long-awaited and fairly long-delayed opera; but unless it has secrets to yield up – {{and one of}} the main reasons for <b>feeling</b> <b>so</b> dispirited as it went on was the sense that one might be even more bored, if possible, during a {{subsequent}} hearing than during the first – the majority verdict is all too depressingly right.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do or say will be good enough or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are <b>feeling</b> <b>so</b> angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E
25|$|Hershey {{lost their}} next three games, {{starting}} with a home-and-home series against the Penguins on November 1 and 2, dropping the first after winger Matt Watkins missed a penalty shot in overtime, and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton scored with 25 {{seconds left in the}} extra period. The Bears lost the second game despite Leggio making 38 saves and Hershey scoring twice in their first three shots, just two minutes apart. In their 4–3 loss against Norfolk on November 3, the Bears scored three goals in three minutes during regulation, but failed to connect on the shootout. Orlov, having just returned from Washington, scored a goal and assist, leaving him tied for eighth in the league for defensemen with eight points, and first for shooting at 40 percent. He was sent back to the Capitals after one day back with Hershey. The Bears were successful in all 10 penalty kills over their past two games, bringing it to sixth-best in the league at 85.7 percent, although their power play was ranked 27th of 30 at 12 percent. Having won only one of five home games so far, Mike Haviland believed the team needed to stop <b>feeling</b> <b>so</b> comfortable on home ice.|$|E

500|$|The most {{distinctive}} part of Raonic's game is his powerful and accurate serve, from which his [...] "Missile" [...] nickname is derived. He is frequently cited as {{having one of}} the best serves among his contemporaries, along with Karlović and Isner. Some consider Raonic's serve to be among the best of all time. Sampras, Raonic's childhood idol, describes the Canadian's serve as [...] "bigger than big." [...] After a match against Raonic, Djokovic commented [...] "I can't recall the last time I was <b>feeling</b> <b>so</b> helpless returning. Even his second serve." [...] Women's tennis player Serena Williams has said that [...] "If she could take one thing from another player, it would be Milos Raonic's serve." [...] Statistically, Raonic is among the strongest servers in the Open Era, winning 91% of service games to rank third all-time. Raonic has one of the fastest recorded serves of all time.|$|E

500|$|In retrospect, Corgan rued the {{decision}} to hire the two percussionists to play alongside Aronoff, instead of having the drummer play along with loops from the album. [...] "That drove Kenny up the wall because Kenny has perfect time and one guy played on top and the other behind. I remember Kenny saying, 'I feel like I'm tripping on LSD' because he kept hearing things that were not in time, and it drove him crazy," [...] said Corgan in the Adore reissue liner notes. Performing with Garson was also challenging because, according to Corgan, [...] "he made a decision 40 years ago that he would live in the intuitive flow {{of what he was}} <b>feeling,</b> <b>so</b> he literally cannot play the same thing twice. So we'd have gigs where he'd have that same magic as on Aladdin Sane and the next night he'd come and play the extreme opposite style—like honkytonk. I really respect Mike, but to play with him was always challenging; precisely because he is such a supreme musician." ...|$|E
500|$|The album sold {{a million}} copies in the United States, and five million worldwide. Taraborrelli felt that at that moment, riding on Madonna's coattails proved {{profitable}} for everyone involved, including Warner Bros. Records, which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists. But still they wanted to [...] "milk-in" [...] the success of Madonna, a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, executive producers of the film. Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do, since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film, as well as Madonna's successful third studio album True Blue, released the year before. As Madonna's first world tour, Who's That Girl ended up being a resounding success, although by its end, Madonna declared {{that she did not}} want to hear any of her songs again and she did not know whether she would ever write another one. [...] "I returned <b>feeling</b> <b>so</b> burned out and I was convinced that I wouldn't go near music for quite a while", she said.|$|E

It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless.

500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, {{what you see is}} what you get. He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't have much in common with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left <b>feeling</b> <b>so</b> ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would think of him.|$|E

While reviewing the deluxe edition of B'Day, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the song, calling it a [...] "surprise gem [...] sound downright subtle". BET included the song in its list of the [...] "Top 10 Feel Good R Songs", ranked at number nine.

[...] Bobby Reed of Chicago Sun-Times noted that the lyrics could also refer to [...] "the way fans worship Beyonce". Anthony Venutolo of New Jersey On-Line noted that the song talks about true love. Destiny's Child bandmate Kelly Rowland discussed the track during Billboard [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] spread for Beyoncé. She stated [...] "Beyoncé is a true artist who brings it every time.

500|$|Peters {{was born}} in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He began riding at age seven, and {{competing}} in weekend dressage shows. By 15, he was competing outside of Germany, at international competitions in Belgium and Denmark. He received his first horse, Udon, at age 16 as a gift from his father; this horse would carry him to a bronze medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1984, he spent the summer training in San Diego, California, before returning to Germany to perform his army service. In 1985, {{he returned to the}} United States with Udon. In 1991, he opened his own barn and acquired his first sponsor, Lila Kommerstad, who purchased Udon and as of 2012 owned a portion of Peters' Arroyo Del Mar training barn. Peters gained his US citizenship in 1992, saying, [...] "The whole idea of being so patriotic, of <b>feeling</b> <b>so</b> close to one's country makes a difference.

500|$|This Is What the Truth Feels Like {{begins with}} [...] "Misery". An electropop song with [...] "future-disco beats", the album's third single [...] "captures the {{highs and lows}} of being [...] in love". According to Nicki Gostin, writing for the New York Daily News, the song's lyrics are unclear and either detail Stefani's former {{relationship}} with Rossdale, or her current relationship with Shelton. The track makes several references to love and drugs {{through the use of}} hyperbole and cliches. [...] "You're My Favorite" [...] has [...] "Super Mario 64 cave synths and [...] tinny, trap-adjacent percussion". The song was dubbed [...] "the most 'Stefani-esque'" [...] by Nicholaus James Jodlowski of Reporter magazine, while Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media found it comparable to Top 40 music. It was compared to her earlier songs, [...] "Simple Kind of Life", [...] "Underneath It All" [...] and [...] "Serious" [...] by Theon Weber of Spin magazine. The third track, [...] "Where Would I Be?", [...] produced by Kurstin, is a reggae-flavored ska song. Its bridge has a [...] "cheerleader taunt" [...] and, according to Leonie Cooper of NME, it [...] "sounds like she doesn't give a shit". Lyrically it mentions the possibilities of finding love, particularly in the line [...] "Fill up my Solo Cup when I’m <b>feeling</b> <b>so</b> lonely." [...] Weber found similarities between [...] "Where Would I Be?" [...] and Kurstin's earlier work with Lily Allen. The album's second single, [...] "Make Me Like You", is a pop and disco song, written by Stefani, Tranter, Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Fredikkson. After the group completed the track, Stefani commented: [...] "We were losing our minds." [...] Its lyrics detail the [...] "complicated feeling of falling hard when [...] least expect", as well as reflecting Stefani's personal life.|$|E

2500|$|The literal {{meaning of}} the term [...] "schizoid" [...] is [...] "split type".
