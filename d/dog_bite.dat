25|$|Mixed law. {{many states}} take a mixed approach, passing {{statutes}} {{that are based}} upon the common law but that add additional elements that must be proved for a <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injury to succeed in an injury claim, or provide defenses not available at common law.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{three studies}} that have been {{conducted}} in Belgium on <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> on children. (1) A telephone study revealed that 22 / 1000 children < 15 years of age were victims of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> annually. (2) Data on the characteristics of <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> were collected prospectively over a period of 8. 5 months in six hospital emergency departments. "Dangerous dogs" were not responsible {{for the majority of the}} accidents. In 67 / 100, incidents documented, the bites appeared to be triggered by an interaction of the child. Education appeared to be the preventive measure with the highest priority. (3) Among 22 child victims of <b>dog</b> <b>bites,</b> 12 had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorders some seven months following the accident. Based on these local studies, several initiatives have been undertaken to favour both primary and secondary prevention measures. An appropriate psychological preventive intervention should be offered to all victims of <b>dog</b> <b>bites.</b> Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

25|$|A 2015 {{study in}} Ireland found that <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> {{injuries}} greatly increased since {{the introduction of}} legislation targeting specific dog breeds. This study also suggested that targeting dog breeds may actually contribute to increases in dog-bite hospitalisations through the reinforcing of incorrect stereotypes of risk being determined by breed. The study reported {{that as a result}} of targeting dog breeds, stereotypes of the dangerousness of certain breeds and assuming the safety of others simply due to their breed may result in people incorrectly interacting with dogs from both categories.|$|E
25|$|Strict {{liability}}. States that impose {{strict liability}} make {{the owner of}} a dog liable for injuries caused by a dog, without further consideration of the facts. Strict liability laws may require that the person seeking damages for a <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> prove that they were acting peacefully and lawfully {{at the time of the}} bite. The law may also recognize a limited range of defenses to liability, such as the dog owner's successfully proving that the injured person was trespassing at the time of the injury or had engaged in conduct that provoked the attack.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the effort}} to reduce the {{prevalence}} of <b>dog</b> <b>bite</b> injuries has involved the passage of breed-specific laws, intended to reduce the ownership of dog breeds that are considered more likely to bite or to cause serious injury {{in the event of a}} bite. Controversy exists on whether or not certain breeds of dogs are more prone to bite than others. Although some research suggests that breed-specific legislation is not completely effective in preventing dog bites, efforts to establish regulations limiting dogs that bite is ongoing. The rights of animals is often in question. The targeting of specific dog breed creates stereotypes. This influences the perceived risk of sustaining a bite from a dog of a particular breed.|$|E

The record reflected Mos Def's varied interests in jazz, poetry, Eastern rhythms, psychedelia, Spanish music, and the blues. The tracks on the first half, The Observers Ben Thompson wrote, were [...] "predominantly eastward-looking" [...] while the second half indulged more in Latin and reggae influences. Other sounds sampled or explored included Afrobeat ("Quiet <b>Dog</b> <b>Bite</b> Hard"), Eurodance ("Life in Marvelous Times"), Bollywood ("Supermagic"), and Philadelphia soul. [...] "Supermagic" [...] also drew on elements from Turkish acid rock and Mary Poppins, while on [...] "No Hay Nada Mas", Mos Def sang and rapped in Spanish over a flamenco-influenced production. He sang elsewhere on the album, often breaking into sing-song vamps during his raps. Along with Mos Def's singing, the predominantly sample-based music was unconventional in its use of what Preservation said were unusual time signatures and [...] "awkward" [...] breakdowns.|$|E

METHODS: The authors reviewed {{a random sample of}} reported <b>dog</b> <b>bites</b> and all reported cat bites in El Paso, Texas, in 1995 using existing animal control surveillance data. RESULTS: The majority of cat bites (89. 4 %) were provoked, with females (57. 5 %) and adults (68. 3 %) more likely to be victims than males or children.
