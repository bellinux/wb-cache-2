40|$|Organotin {{compounds}} are variously used industrial chemicals. One of {{the most}} toxicological relevant compounds is tributyltin (TBT). TBT {{has been used as}} an effective component in antifouling paints for decades. Thus, it is set free into the water column in considerable amounts and affects also non-target organismens in very low concentrations. Molluscs like snails and mussels are particularly sensitive and reproduction can be influenced significantly thereby. Once released into the water column, TBT accumulates in sediments and will remain there beyond years due to its high persistence. Several guideline values, target levels and quality standards were specified for TBT, its degradation products monobutyltin (MBT) and <b>dibutyltin</b> (<b>DBT)</b> as well as for other organotin compounds in sediments [...] ...|$|E

The concentrations of tributyltin (TBT) in the sediments ranged from 1. 7 to 379. 7 ng/g dry weight. Their spatial distribution suggested that shipping activities, especially shipyards were mostly responsible for the TBT contamination in the region. A good linear relationship was observed between the <b>DBT</b> (<b>dibutyltin)</b> /TBT and MBT (monobutyltin) /TBT ratios of the samples in the Pearl River, the Pearl River estuary and the West River, suggesting that TBT in these areas came from similar sources but had undergone a different extent of degradation.

This study explored whether tropical wood species could be treated successfully with newly synthesized organotin(IV) complexes as wood preservatives. Ten 19 x 19 x 19 mm sized wood cubes of each species {{were treated with}} three levels of concentration (0. 1, 0. 5 and 1 %) of monomethyltin(IV) (MMT) and monophenyltin(IV) (MPT) of monoseries and dimethyltin(IV) (DMT), diphenyltin(IV) (DPT) and <b>dibutyltin</b> (IV) (<b>DBT)</b> of diseries organotin(IV) complexes with 2 -acetylpyridine- N (4) -cyclohexyl thiosemicarbazone ligand. The treated wood species were evaluated by chemical retention values and characterized by FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy analysis. The highest retention (10. 59 kg m - 3) was found in Alstonia scholaris treated with 1 % DMT complexes and the lowest retention (0. 47 kg m - 3) was found in Hevea brasiliensis treated with 0. 1 % DMT complexes.

The speciation analysis involved off-line head-space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) -gas chromatography with pulsed-flame photometric detection (GC-PFPD) performed after three consecutive collections of five different fractions of interest from the As-Fl-FFF system and cross-flow part (assumed to {{be representative of the}} < 10 kDa phase). After 0. 45 ?m filtration and without preconcentration before fractionation and speciation analysis, limits of detection (LOD) were 4 - 45 ng (Sn) L- 1 in the sample, with relative standard deviations (RSD) of 3 - 23 %. The As-Fl-FFF fractionation of this sample enables characterization of two distinct populations-organic-rich and inorganic colloids with gyration radius up to 120 nm.

40|$|The biosorption and {{biodegradation}} of tributyltin (TBT) by free {{cells of}} a resistant microalgal species, Chlorella sorokiniana at two different densities, 1 × 10 6 cells ml - 1 (low) and 1 × 10 7 (high) were investigated. TBT in contaminated water was continuously removed by microalgal cells and reached a 54 % and 74 % removal {{at the end}} of 14 days treatment in low and high density cultures, respectively. The pattern of TBT removal in both densities was similar: with the decreases of TBT in water, TBT uptake by algal cells increased, reached a peak and declined to low levels {{towards the end of the}} treatment period. In the high density culture, total amounts of TBT uptake, including the adsorption on cell surface and absorption inside the cells, increased from 109 to 159 μg TBT +from days 1 to 7, then declined to 95 μg TBT + at day 14. The proportions of TBT adsorbed on the cell surface decreased while that in the intracellular fraction increased with time, suggesting that the adsorbed TBT moved gradually into the cells for stepwise debutylation. The two degradation products, <b>DBT</b> (<b>dibutyltin)</b> and MBT (monbutyltin), started to appear in the intracellular fraction from day 3 and day 7 onwards in high and low density cultures, respectively, with more MBT than that of DBT.

40|$|Evaluation of the {{assimilation}} pathway and depuration {{time of a}} given pollutant by aquatic species {{is important to understand}} the dynamics of this substance in the biota, and to search for potential ecological indicators. In the present study, the uptake pathway and depuration time and rate of the pollutant tributyltin (TBT) were investigated in the omnivorous hermit crab (Clibanarius vittatus). The assimilation and uptake pathway were investigated using hermit crabs collected in an area free of TBT. The crabs were held in the laboratory for 45 days, under one of four treatments: procedural control (PC) - water and food without TBT; T 1 - water with and food without TBT; 12 - water without and food with Tiff; and 13 water and food with TBT. To determine the depuration time, the crabs were collected in a contaminated area, maintained in the laboratory with clean water, and removed every 15 days for 120 days. The concentrations of TBT and <b>DBT</b> (<b>dibutyltin)</b> were determined by chromatographic analysis. The TBT was taken up by the crabs mainly via food, and the presence of DBT in crab tissues was hypothesized to result from internal TBT degradation. TBT (as well as DBT) was depurated rapidly by C. vittatus. After approximately 30 days, the initial concentration of 111 +/- 36 ng Sn g(- 1) w. w. decreased to 3 +/- 3 ng Sn g(- 1) w. w., and after 75 days the TBT concentration was below the detection limit. The same pattern was recorded for DBT, which showed a higher deputation rate than TBT. The rapid TBT and DBT deputation is useful information, since C. vittatus and possibly other hermit crabs may be used as indicators of recent or recycled environmental contamination.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} a {{comprehensive study of}} the persistence of butyltins and phenyltins in contaminated marine sediments and presents the first data on their degradation potentials in porewaters. The study's aim was to explain the different degradation efficiencies of organotin compounds (OTC) in contaminated sediments.

Whereas trimethyltin (TMT) is known to induce gliosis and triethyltin (TET) to cause demyelination and affect GABAergic neurons, DBT appeared to be more toxic than TMT, and to present a distinct toxicological pattern...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{comprehensive study of}} the persistence of butyltins and phenyltins in contaminated marine sediments and presents the first data on their degradation potentials in porewaters. The study’s aim was to explain the different degradation efficiencies of organotin compounds (OTC) in contaminated sediments. The transformation processes of OTC in sediments and porewaters were investigated in a field experiment using species-specific, isotopically enriched organotin tracers. Sediment characteristics (organic carbon content and grain size) were determined to elucidate their influence on the degradation processes. The {{results of this study}} strongly suggest that a limiting step in OTC degradation in marine sediments is their desorption into porewaters because their degradation in porewaters occurs notably fast with half-lives of 9. 2 days for tributyltin (TBT) in oxic porewaters and 2. 9 ± 0. 1 and 9. 1 ± 0. 9 days for <b>dibutyltin</b> (<b>DBT)</b> in oxic and anoxic porewaters, respectively. By controlling the desorption process, organic matter influences the TBT degradation efficiency and consequently defines its persistence in contaminated sediments, which thus increases in sediments rich in organic matter...|$|E
40|$|Tributyltin (TBT) {{has been}} widely {{employed}} in marine anti-fouling paints as a biocide, although it represents a serious risk, particularly in estuarine and coastal water/sediment ecosystems. In this study, the embryotoxic effects of TBT and its degradation products, <b>dibutyltin</b> (<b>DBT)</b> and monobutyltin (MBT), were analyzed during {{the development of the}} sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus from post-fertilization to the pluteus stage, to better clarify eco- toxicological impact. The embryotoxicity of butyltins is concentration-dependent and increases proportionally with number of butyl groups. Significant growth reduction was observed at TBT concentrations as low as 0. 01 µg l- 1; 1 µg l- 1 was the maximum concentration allowing embryos to reach the pluteus stage at 48 h post-fertilization. Development was blocked at the morula or blastula stage with higher TBT concentrations. DBT and MBT are less toxic: slowed development and a decrease in pluteus size occurred at 10 µg l- 1 DBT and 0. 5 µg l- 1 MBT. Effects on both skeletal deposition and blocked embryonic development are suggested to be due to the interference of organotin compounds with intracellular calcium homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Tributyltin (TBT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{deleterious}} compounds introduced into natural environment by humans. The ability of Cunninghamella echinulata to degrade tributyltin (TBT) (5 mg l- 1) as well as the effect of the xenobiotic on fungal amino acids composition and proteins profile were examined. C. echinulata removed 91 % of the initial biocide concentration and formed less hazardous compounds <b>dibutyltin</b> (<b>DBT)</b> and monobutyltin (MBT). Moreover, the fungus produced a hydroxylated metabolite (TBTOH), in which the hydroxyl group was bound directly to the tin atom. Proteomics analysis showed that in the presence of TBT, the abundances of 22 protein bands were changed and the unique overexpressions of peroxiredoxin and nuclease enzymes were observed. Determination of free amino acids showed significant changes in the amounts of 19 from 23 detected metabolites. A parallel increase in the level of selected amino acids such as betaine, alanine, aminoisobutyrate or proline and peroxiredoxin enzyme in TBT-containing cultures revealed that TBT induced oxidative stress in the examined fungus.

40|$|A new {{extraction}} {{method for}} {{the determination of}} tributyltin (TBT), <b>dibutyltin</b> (<b>DBT)</b> and monobutyltin (MBT) in sediments based on extraction with tartaric acid and methanol has been developed. Tin species were extracted from sediment samples using focused microwave technology, then ethylated with sodium tetraethylborate (NaBEt 4) and analyzed by isotope dilution (ID) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The advantages of such methodology in comparison with other established extraction methods for the routine speciation analysis of organotin compounds are discussed with respect to sulfur interferences co-extracted from complex matrices. Interferences from elemental sulfur are normally found with acetic acid extraction, but with tartaric acid extraction these interferences were eliminated, demonstrating selective extraction. The accuracy of the analytical procedure was established by analyzing a certified reference material (CRM) (PACS- 2, marine sediment) and comparing the results to the certified values. Good agreement between determined and certified values for butyltin compounds was obtained. Finally, some complex sediment samples collected from San Vicente's Bay, Chile, were analyzed with the proposed methodology, demonstrating its potential value for monitoring butyltins in environmental samples with high concentrations of sulfur compounds. 9 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Most {{analytical}} {{techniques used}} for the speciation analysis of butyltin compounds in biological tissues usually contain multiple procedures (e. g., extraction, derivatization, separation, preconcentration, determination) which may {{increase the risk of}} systematic errors. The use of reference materials (RM) makes it possible to correct most of these errors and improve the validity of quality control. In this study, a new candidate RM for butyltin compounds in mollusks was developed. It was prepared with a mollusk 'Mya arenaria' directly bought from the market. The preparation of this candidate RM, the homogeneity and stability studies, the value assignment and the evaluation of uncertainty were described. The certified values of 0. 33 +/- 0. 08, 0. 62 +/- 0. 09, 2. 64 +/- 0. 20 mu g Sn g(- 1) (based on dry mass) for monobutyltin (MBT, [Sn(C 4 H 9) (3 +) ]), <b>dibutyltin</b> (<b>DBT,</b> [Sn(C 4 H 9) (2) (2 +) ]) and tributyltin (TBT, [Sn(C 4 H 9) (3) (+) ]) respectively have been assigned by inter-laboratory comparison.

40|$|Organotin and organolead {{compounds}} {{were determined}} in sediments of the Suez Gulf The concentrations of Tributyltin (TBT) ranged from 0. 27 to 2. 77 {{with an average}} value of 1. 37 µgg- 1 ; dry wt. However, the concentrations of <b>dibutyltin</b> (<b>DBT)</b> ranged from 0. 07 to 2. 27 with an average value of 0. 58 µgg- 1 ; dry wt. A significant correlation was found between TBT and DBT with r = 0. 82, (p = 0. 05) indicating that the occurrence of DBT is mainly related to the degradation of TBT. Generally, the high concentration of TBT was attributed to shipping activity in harbours. In addition, Diphenyltin (DPhT) concentrations ranged from not detected to 2. 09 {{with an average of}} 1. 10 µgg- 1 dry wt. Antifouling agents, industrial discharge and the influence of sewage discharge are the main sources of pollution by DPhT compounds in Suez Gulf.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{extraction}} and determination of butyltin species in aqueous samples by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) {{combined with a}} capillary gas chromatography-flame photometric detector (GC-FPD) is described. The butyltin species was converted to its hydride form by sodium tetrahydroborate (NaBH 4) in a closed headspace vial prior to extraction. A laboratory-assembled SPME device including a fused-silica fiber and a modified microsyringe protection part was used throughout the experiment. The extraction was an equilibrium process that depended on the butyltin species partitioning between the liquid phase and the fiber. When the equilibrium was reached, the fiber was directly transferred to a GC column {{under the protection of}} a microsyringe, where the analyte was thermally desorbed inside the heated injector and subsequently, separated in a HP- 1 capillary column and detected by a laboratory-made flame photometric detector using quartz surface-induced tin emission. The detection limits based on the signal equal to 3 times of the base-line noise were 0. 2 mu g/L, 0. 2 mu g/L, 0. 1 mu g/L and 0. 02 mu g/L for monobutyltin (MBT), <b>dibutyltin</b> (<b>DBT),</b> tributyltin (TBT) and tetrabutyltin (TeBT), respectively.

Using gas chromatography (GC) for sample introduction and analyte separation, {{a performance comparison}} was made between sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) detection and quadrupole ICP-MS (qICP-MS) detection. Samples were extracted with acetic acid using open microwave digestion, derivatized with sodium tetraethylborate and extracted into isooctane.
