25|$|Ethylene can be <b>dimerized</b> to n-butenes using {{processes}} {{licensed by}} Lummus or IFP. The Lummus process produces mixed n-butenes (primarily 2-butenes) while the IFP process produces 1-butene.|$|E
25|$|DES {{belongs to}} the stilbestrol (4,4'-dihydroxystilbene) group of compounds. It is a nonsteroidal open-ring {{analogue}} of the steroidal estrogen estradiol. DES {{was derived from the}} naturally occurring compound anethole, a weakly estrogenic constituent of anise and fennel. Anethole was demethylated to form anol and anol then spontaneously <b>dimerized</b> into dianol and hexestrol, with DES subsequently being synthesized via structural modification of hexestrol. It has been determined via X-ray crystallography that the molecular dimensions of DES are almost identical to those of estradiol, particularly in regards to the distance between the hydroxyl groups {{at either end of the}} molecules.|$|E
25|$|Examination of <b>dimerized</b> and trimerized natural {{products}} {{has shown that}} an element of bilateral symmetry is often present. Bilateral symmetry refers to a molecule or system that contains a C2, Cs, or C2v point group identity. C2 symmetry tends {{to be much more}} abundant than other types of bilateral symmetry. This finding sheds light on how these compounds might be mechanistically created, as well as providing insight into the thermodynamic properties that make these compounds more favorable. Density functional theoretical (DFT), Hartree Fock, and semiempirical calculations also show some favorability for dimerization in {{natural products}} due to evolution of more energy per bond than the equivalent trimer or tetramer. This is proposed to be due to steric hindrance {{at the core of the}} molecule, as most natural products dimerize and trimerize in a head-to-head fashion rather than head-to-tail.|$|E

25|$|Too much vitamin A in retinoid form can {{be harmful}} or fatal, {{resulting}} {{in what is}} known as hypervitaminosis A. The body converts the <b>dimerized</b> form, carotene, into vitamin A as it is needed, therefore high levels of carotene are not toxic compared to the ester (animal) forms. The livers of certain animals, especially those adapted to polar environments such as polar bears and seals, often contain amounts of vitamin A that would be toxic to humans. Thus, vitamin A toxicity is typically reported in Arctic explorers and people taking large doses of synthetic vitamin A. The first documented death possibly caused by vitamin A poisoning was Xavier Mertz, a Swiss scientist who died in January 1913 on an Antarctic expedition that had lost its food supplies and fell to eating its sled dogs. Mertz may have consumed lethal amounts of vitamin A by eating the dogs' livers.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, <b>dimerized</b> λ gam binds to {{the host}} RecBCD and SbcCD nucleases, {{inhibiting}} all of their known activities, which prevents degradation of the linear foreign DNA. λ exo binds to double stranded linear transformed DNA and processively degrades it in a 5’ to 3’ direction. Exo is a globular, trimeric protein that forms a ring shape with a hollow center that positions the linear DNA for cleavage. One side of the ring {{is large enough to}} admit double stranded DNA, but the other end can only accommodate single stranded DNA, therefore providing details into the exo mechanism of action. This process results in single stranded 3’ overhangs on the linear DNA. Subsequently, λ beta, a member of a recombinase family, binds to the 3’ overhangs and mediates annealing to the complementary E. coli DNA. This process occurs through invasion of the single stranded 3’ overhang into the complementary target DNA on the lagging strand during DNA synthesis, allowing beta-facilitated annealing.|$|E

In this application, two independent CID systems, one based on plant proteins and one based on bacterial proteins are expressed in the same cell. Each set of proteins can be induced to <b>dimerize</b> by the addition of a separate chemical. By creating fusion proteins with the <b>dimerizing</b> proteins, membrane bound proteins and proteins that activate cell ruffling an AND gate and OR gate can be created that take chemical <b>dimerizing</b> agents as inputs and returns a ruffled or unruffled state as output.|$|R

2500|$|Mutations in the {{androgen}} receptor gene can cause problems {{with any of}} the steps involved in androgenization, from the synthesis of the {{androgen receptor}} protein itself, through the transcriptional ability of the <b>dimerized,</b> androgen-AR complex. [...] AIS can result if even one of these steps is significantly disrupted, as each step is required for androgens to activate the AR successfully and regulate gene expression. [...] Exactly which steps a particular mutation will impair can be predicted, to some extent, by identifying the area of the AR in which the mutation resides. [...] This predictive ability is primarily retrospective in origin; the different functional domains of the AR gene have been elucidated by analyzing the effects of specific mutations in different regions of the AR. [...] For example, mutations in the steroid binding domain have been known to affect androgen binding affinity or retention, mutations in the hinge region have been known to affect nuclear translocation, mutations in the DNA-binding domain have been known to affect dimerization and binding to target DNA, and mutations in the transactivation domain have been known to affect target gene transcription regulation. [...] Unfortunately, even when the affected functional domain is known, predicting the phenotypical consequences of a particular mutation (see Correlation of genotype and phenotype) is difficult.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{of these}} receptors will <b>dimerize</b> after binding with their ligands, {{in order to}} {{activate}} further signal transductions. For example, after the epidermal growth factor (EGF) [...] receptor binds with its ligand EGF, the two receptors <b>dimerize</b> and then undergo phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the enzyme portion of each receptor molecule.

50|$|CID {{has been}} used for a number of {{applications}} in biomedical research.
