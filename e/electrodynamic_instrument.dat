40|$|Cellular {{polypropylene}} (PP) ferroelectret is a {{thin and}} flexible cellular polymer foam that generates electrical power under mechanical force. This work investigates single and multilayer ferroelectret PP foams and their potential to supply energy for human-body-worn sensors. Human foot-fall is emulated using an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>instrument,</b> allowing applied compressive force and momentum to be correlated with energy output. Peak power, output pulse duration, and energy per strike is derived experimentally {{as a function of}} force and momentum, and shown to be a strong function of external load resistance, thus providing a clear maximum energy point. The possibility of increasing pulse time and reducing voltage to CMOS compatible levels at some expense of peak power is shown. To further increase the output power, multilayer ferroelectret is presented. The synchronized power generation of each layer is studied and illustrated using simulation, and results are supported by experiments. Finally, the energy output of single-layer and multi-layer ferroelectrets are compared by charging a capacitor via a rectifier. A ten-layer ferroelectret is shown to have charging ability 29. 1 times better than that of the single-layer ferroelectret. It demonstrates energy output that is capable of powering the start-up and transmission of a typical low-power wireless sensor chipse...|$|E
5000|$|Synchroscopes are <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>instruments,</b> which {{rely on the}} {{interaction}} of magnetic fields to rotate a pointer. In most types, unlike voltmeters and wattmeters, there is no restoring spring torque for the magnetically produced torques to overcome; the pointer system is free to rotate continually. Synchroscopes have a damping vane to smooth out vibration of the moving system.|$|R

The experiment will give attention to the electromagnetic interaction between the satellite/tether/orbiter system and the ambient space plasma, and should demonstrate the operation of both satellite- and Shuttle-borne <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>instruments</b> with a conductive tether...|$|R
40|$|The {{growing demand}} to {{construct}} long, slender floors with minimum supports for aesthetic and economic reasons especially in modern building developments {{has resulted in}} increased floor slenderness leading to vibration problems. As a result, vibration serviceability has become the governing design criterion {{for many of these}} new civil engineering structures. It is known that long span, slender floors possess lower natural frequencies and reduced damping leading to vibration serviceability problems. As vibration serviceability becomes a major concern in the design of concrete floors, investigations of the beneficial effects of non-structural elements to the vibration serviceability of floors are becoming increasingly important. The vibration serviceability of long span, slender concrete floors may be improved through the installation of non-structural elements such as partition walls and raised access floors. Little research exists into the quantification of the effects of various types of partitions on the vibration serviceability of concrete floors that support them. There are no guidelines available to designers which take into account the effects of partitions in the design of concrete floors for vibration serviceability besides the different damping ratios that are recommended in different codes for bare floors as well as floors with half- or full-height partitions. Therefore a research project was initiated with the objectives of investigating the effects of non-structural partitions on the vibration serviceability of concrete floors as well as proposing guidelines on how to account for partitions in the design of concrete floors for vibration serviceability. The research project consisted of modal testing on a prestressed pre-tensioned concrete floor slab. The excitation of the floor was generated by an <b>electrodynamic</b> shaker and <b>instrumented</b> impulse hammer. The electrodynamic shaker excitation was used mainly to extract the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the test floor. The instrumented impulse hammer excitation was used mainly for damping studies. Force-balanced QA 700 accelerometers with a sensitivity of 8 V/g mounted to base plates were used to measure the responses of the test floor. The Data Physics Signal Calc Mobilyser was used to acquire the data from the accelerometers. A personal computer was used to store, analyse and present the data. The curve fitting method in Vibrant Technologies ME'Scope was used to estimate the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the test floor. Modal 1. 20 by Brownjohn (2009) was used to estimate the damping ratios of the test floor. Modal 1. 20 uses the logarithmic decrement method to estimate damping. The tests investigated the effects of partitions on the vibration serviceability of concrete floors...|$|R
