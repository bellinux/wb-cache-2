5|$|Hohokam petroglyphs <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> large {{stones are}} easily {{accessible}} in the TMD. The Signal Hill Trail, which {{begins at the}} Signal Hill Picnic Area along the Bajada Loop Drive, leads to an area with dozens of examples of the 800-year-old rock art.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} statue {{was erected}} for Whale in 2002 {{on the grounds}} of a new multiplex cinema in his home town of Dudley. The statue, by Charles Hadcock, depicts a roll of film with the face of Frankenstein's monster engraved into the frames, and the names of his most famous films <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> a cast concrete base in the shape of film canisters.|$|E
5|$|The killer murders another woman, {{disposing}} {{of the body}} in a post office's dead letter office. Investigating, Black finds a human hair with a message <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> it—"hair today, gone tomorrow"—which he takes as an indication that the murderer is lashing out at a world that he feels has treated him as insignificant. Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E
50|$|Etch {{channels}} are created during a diamond's formation process {{deep in the}} Earth. In the journey of the rough diamond to the Earth's surface, the contact with high-temperature fluids <b>etches</b> <b>into</b> the diamond's crystalline structure which often leave parallel lines or irregularly shaped tunnel-like structures.|$|R
25|$|Differential {{weathering}} incised {{the northern}} {{side of the}} mountain, producing cavities underneath the granite dome. The abrupt dome itself {{is the result of}} the more durable granite having resisted the aforementioned weathering more so than the softer gneiss. Furthermore, erosion has worn <b>etches</b> <b>into</b> the mountain's sides.|$|R
5000|$|Sirtut (...) are {{straight}} lines that the sofer must, by Torah law, <b>etch</b> <b>into</b> the klaf. The obligation primarily pertains to Sifrei Torah, Mezuza, and Meggila, however {{there are those}} who are similarly accustomed to placing sirtut on the Arba Parshiyot for tefillin. This helps the sofer write in neat straight lines.|$|R
5|$|Cal also {{exhibits}} feminine characteristics, {{which allows}} Dr. Luce to classify her as possessing a female gender identity. In a home video taken when Cal was a child, his mother {{gives him a}} doll and he nurses it with a milk bottle. Luce carefully observes Callie's actions and diagnoses them as feminine, which causes him to determine that Callie has a feminine gender identity. Luce then concludes that gender identity is nurtured and <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> children at their young ages.|$|E
5|$|The front {{entrance}} of the 1931 office building, on {{the southeast corner of}} the block, faced south on John Street towards Downtown Seattle and had the newspaper's name <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> the stone above the main entrance; the sign was supplemented for several decades by an ornate golden sign with the newspaper's letterhead that was installed above the main entrance. The exterior of the office building had subtle details, including etched columns and aluminum grillwork on the windows, forgoing ornaments for a simpler design that emphasized its mass. The main entrance was behind an elaborate aluminum gate, decorated with octagons, spirals and floral patterns. At the sides of the entrance were limestone panels with floral patterns carved into relief.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell {{returned}} to Provincetown {{the following summer}} and requested that painting instructor, Oliver Chaffee, teach her the white-line woodcut technique innovated by B.J.O. Nordfeldt and adopted {{by a group of}} artists who had spent the previous winter in Provincetown. The white-line woodcuts were inspired by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, but only used a single block of wood. Designs were <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> the surface of woodblocks, with the incised lines separating sections of the blocks. The sections were individually painted and printed onto paper with the carved portions forming white lines. Lazzell and other artists specializing in the white-line technique formed the Provincetown Printers, an artist collective that later would earn national recognition. Toward the close of 1916 she traveled to Manhattan where she studied with Homer Boss and did an analysis of color with William E. Schumacher. Two of her pieces in the white-line style were exhibited in the Provincetown Art Association's annual show in 1917.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} LightScribe {{is to allow}} users to create direct-to-disc labels (as opposed to stick-on labels), using their optical disc writer. Special discs and a {{compatible}} disc writer are required. Before or after burning data to the read-side of the disc, the user turns the disc over and inserts it with the label side down. The drive's laser then <b>etches</b> <b>into</b> the label side {{in such a way}} that an image is produced.|$|R
500|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version is}} more of a hack and slash RPG, and is played from an {{isometric}} three-quarter top-down view. A major gameplay difference in this version is the addition of [...] "runes" [...] which players can <b>etch</b> <b>into</b> their weapons, granting them special abilities. The game also features co-op multiplayer through the Game Boy link function, and unlockable content when connected to the GameCube version via the Nintendo GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.|$|R
50|$|Currently, White's {{paintings}} are formed by layering oil paints and a wax - resin blend onto wood panels. Though similar to encaustic painting, White does not add pigments to the wax and resin blend. Instead, the unpigmented wax/resin blend is added in between layers of oil paint. During this process, White <b>etches</b> <b>into</b> {{the layers of}} paint and wax. This process allows White to create a depth and texture that adds to the feel and experience of the work.|$|R

50|$|Like etching, {{aquatint}} {{uses the}} application of a mordant to <b>etch</b> <b>into</b> the metal plate. Where the engraving technique uses a needle to make lines that print in black (or whatever colour ink is used), aquatint uses powdered rosin to create a tonal effect. The rosin is acid resistant and typically adhered to the plate by controlled heating. The tonal variation is controlled by the level of mordant exposure over large areas, and thus the image is shaped by large sections at a time.|$|R

25|$|Carved high in Mount Behistun of Kermanshah, one {{can find}} the Behistun inscription, a text <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> the stone of the {{mountain}} describing {{the manner in which}} Darius became the king of Persia, after the previous ruler (Cambyses II), and how he overthrew the magus usurper of the throne. In this inscription Darius also details his satraps and delineates his position as the king and emperor of the Persian empire.|$|E
25|$|The castle {{suffered}} {{considerable damage}} and dilapidation during the Commonwealth {{due to the}} abolition of the office of bishop whose residence it was. Cromwell confiscated the castle and sold it to the Lord Mayor of London shortly after taking it from the bishop. A similar fate befell the cathedral, it being closed in 1650 and used to incarcerate 3,000 Scottish prisoners. Graffiti left by them can still be seen today <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> the interior stone.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of Ferdowsi's tomb is {{also influenced by}} poet's own personal life, reflecting a constant struggle between the poor poet and the lazy king, and adversity and hope. The Society for National Heritage in 1930s drawing on poet's attempt to revitalize the Persian language, also attempted to revitalize Persian culture and Iranian identity through architecture. This {{was in many ways}} taken literary with Persian poems from Shahnameh <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> the white marble facets of the edifice of the poet's mausoleum.|$|E

50|$|A method pioneered in Seoul, South Korea uses a {{two-step process}} of 3D {{printing}}, using a 3D printing and laser etched plates. To {{be more precise}} at a nanoscale, the 3D printing process uses a laser etching machine, which <b>etches</b> <b>into</b> each plate the details needed for the segment of nanorobot. The plate is then transferred to the 3D printer, which fills the etched regions with the desired nanoparticle. The 3D printing process is repeated until the nanorobot is built from the bottom up. This 3D printing process has many benefits. First, it increases the overall accuracy of the printing process. Second, {{it has the potential}} to create functional segments of a nanorobot.|$|R
25|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} ancient city is its use of fired clay bricks for {{construction}} {{as opposed to the}} quarried limestone common {{in the vast majority of}} Classical Maya sites. The bricks are of irregular sizes and seem to have been made by cutting longer sections of clay rather than with moulds. Many have designs and inscriptions painted, printed or <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> them. The bricks were joined by mortar made of calcinated seashells and oysters possibly gathered at the nearby Mecoacan Lagoon.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 Plaxton {{responded to}} a request from the privatised National Express for a further version of Paramount III to be leased to its {{contractors}} by a joint venture of Plaxton, National Westminster Bank and National Express. The Paramount Expressliner was created from the Mark III Paramount on a Volvo chassis and was tailored to National Express' specific requirements which included a closed back with the double N logo <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> the fibre glass rear moulding. This period of coach design seemed to introduce the windowless rear as a design feature for most coaches.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} whiting's {{similarity to}} all other species in the genus Sillago has led to many less abundant species being confused with it. The species is known to grow to a maximum size of 31cm, however reports dating back to 1850 in Bengal suggest the species attains 3 feet (91cm), {{which would make it}} the largest species of sillaginid. These reports were never <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> the literature on the species, possibly because of presumed confusion with the similar but unrelated and larger milkfish and bonefish that inhabit the area. The species has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first made of feeble spines and the second of soft rays headed by a single feeble spine, while the ventral profile is straight.|$|E

50|$|PCB’s {{themselves}} are usually created {{by use of}} a phenolic resin, itself a corrosive, toxic substance completely removed from the Occam process. Also, the nitric acid or ferric chloride used to <b>etch</b> traces <b>into</b> the boards is also removed from the process.|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} modern renaissance style, with the outside being composed entirely of red brick. The front steps, the back steps, the columns, and the keystones are all constructed of stone, and the foundation is made of concrete and rubble sheathed with sandstone from the Calgary area. In the early years, {{the basement of the}} courthouse contained the jail cells, the caretaker’s residence, and the Northwest Mounted Police residence. The cells are in their original state, and still contain the original carvings prisoners <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> the brick walls. The caretaker looked after the building and the grounds while his wife looked after the family, as well as feeding the prisoners {{and the members of the}} Northwest Mounted Police housed there. In 1920, two German field cannons that were seized from Germany at the end of World War were placed on the front lawn of the Old Courthouse. These cannons, presented to the citizens of Wetaskiwin by the Dominion Government of Canada, served to honour the many men and women of this community who volunteered for active service.|$|E
25|$|Refurbishment {{projects}} {{were carried out}} on the remaining tower blocks and three-storey blocks of flats. The first of the refurbishments of the two tower blocks commenced in 2002 with Chivenor House. A subtle refurbishment was planned with the entire exterior being covered in an insulated render and painted a cream colour. The ground floor and basement were refurbished providing communal facilities for the local residents including a hairdressing salon, communal lounge, communal kitchen and television room. A concierge was located {{on the ground floor}} to ensure security of access and part of the basement was linked to the school. A crèche was also provided. The stairwells were reglazed with Reglit glazing and new windows were provided in powder-coated aluminium frames, which were of better quality than the previous window frames. The refurbishment was completed in 2006 at a cost of £3 million. The refurbishment of Topcliffe House commenced in November 2003 as the final refurbishment project by the HAT in the area. A design competition was held for a high-profile design for the building with BM3 Architecture, the architects of the Chivenor House refurbishment, winning the competition. Metal balconies and brightly coloured louvers were installed on the building to radically change the exterior. The crown of the building is surrounded by metal panels similar to those used on the balconies with the name 'Topcliffe' <b>etched</b> <b>into</b> it. These panels shield the antennas on the roof from view. The refurbishment was completed in May 2005 at a cost of £2.7 million.|$|E

40|$|This work {{reports on}} the results of two {{innovative}} designs for efficient silicon-based light emitting devices(LEDs). The two devices demonstrated improvement on the extraction efficiency of photons produced by electroluminescent porous silicon. With the previous structures, the produced luminescence was collected {{from the surface of the}} devices through the uses a redesigned top contact along with an <b>etch</b> <b>into</b> the active region of the device. The second type used an edge emitting arrangement. The new surface emitting device showed visible luminescence that was easily seen in a dim ambient. the edge emitting structure exhibited an increase in intensity of between two and three orders of magnitude. This paper will not discuss the physical device structures and the strategies by which the emitted photons are extracted...|$|R

50|$|A key to high growth yields is {{a proper}} {{introduction}} of oxidative agents under the gas ambient {{so that the}} catalyst particle surfaces remain active for the longest possible period, which is presumably achieved by balancing the competition between amorphous carbon growth and sp2 graphitic crystal formation on the catalyst particles. Oxidants can not only remove or prevent amorphous carbon growth, but may also <b>etch</b> <b>into</b> graphite layers when used at higher than favorable concentrations. Hata et al. reported millimeter-scale vertically aligned 2.5 mm long SWCNTs using the water assisted ethylene CVD process with Fe/Al or aluminum oxide multilayers on Si wafers. It was proposed that controlled supply of steam into the CVD reactor acted as a weak oxidizer and selectively removed amorphous carbon without damaging the growing CNTs.|$|R
