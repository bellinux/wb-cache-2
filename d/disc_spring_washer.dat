40|$|Electrical power {{generation}} {{is paid for}} {{on the basis of}} the marginal costs of generation, and supply is paid for at the marginal cost at the supply point. In the case where power lines form a loop and there is a limit on a line within the loop, the electrical requirements of providing supply force a reallocation of generation and a step change in the marginal costs. This is known as the <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> effect. In some cases the cost of supply can reach extreme levels. Transpower and its customers are interested in obtaining a better understanding of these events. Simplified equations determining {{power generation}} and pricing are derived. So-lutions for the supply costs are obtained for several simple cases. Numerical exam-ples and a graphical representation demonstrate the <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> effect and how a <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> responds to changes. Several possible changes that reduce the cost of supply are demonstrated. When a <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> comes active the marginal prices make a step change. This means that power costs can be be highly sensitive to the values of all the network parameters that affect the power flow in the power loop. Detecting when a large <b>spring</b> <b>washer</b> is likely to occur is of considerable interest. Suggestions on how this could be done are made. 1...|$|R

In this study, a load–displacement formula for the slotted <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> is newly developed in the form of energy method by considering both rigid and bending deflections of the two segments. This formula is developed with the aim to further improve the SAE formula which is limited to a straight slotted <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> The coned and the lever arm angles of the straight slotted <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> are the same.

40|$|The Minimally Invasive Manipulator (MIM) copies the {{movements}} of the hands of the surgeon to the tip of the instrument inside the operating area. The movement is mechanically copied using cables and pulleys. When the surgeon grasps and holds an object, the friction inside the MIM increases and distorts the force feedback in the remaining degrees of freedom. The increased friction {{is the result of the}} reaction forces on the cables and pulleys due to the required pinch force to hold the object. The goal of this report is to present two designs for a bi-stable compliant grasper. The grasper will have two stable positions: open and closed. In those positions there is no need for an actuation force from the surgeon. When the grasper is closed, it will produce enough pinch force to hold an object. The first design is a compliant grasper combined with bi-stable beam. Both the grasper and bi-stable element will be a planer design. A large scale prototype is presented and evaluated. The prototype showed bi-stable behavior over a range of 8 mm. Using finite element modeling, dimensions for a bi-stable beam suitable for the MIM are found. The second design uses a <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> as bi-stable element. This design is a 3 D design, and is on the scale of the MIM. An ANSYS model and a database were validated. Using the model and database <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> with suitable dimensions for the MIM scale was found. Two <b>disc</b> <b>springs</b> in parallel were needed to make a bi-stable compliant grasper. Both the bi-stable beam and the <b>disc</b> <b>spring</b> can be used in the design for a bi-stable grasper. The bi-stable beam is more effectively creating negative stiffness inside a circular space. As a result, it should be able to produce more force and/or stroke in the same volume as a <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> This makes the bi-stable beam more suitable for use in a bi-stable grasper than a <b>disc</b> <b>spring.</b> BMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
