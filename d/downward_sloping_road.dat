Throughout the book, Donna is {{restrictive}} {{about the details of}} the encounter when describing it to her psychiatrist. She eventually reveals that Bev was the driver. The vehicle experiences trouble and stalls on a <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> <b>road.</b> Two men stop by and instead of getting help, crush the car driving over it then cover the car with a gigantic tarp as a prelude to a sexual assault. Cindy get pinned trying to get out the rear window, her pants pulled down by one of the men with a knife. Marion, who takes a chance to save Cindy gets out of the car, and is attacked and raped. According to Donna, Bev locks the doors and won't let Marion back in, or let anyone out to help. However, a fight ensues and the two men are slain.|$|E

40|$|Minimizing {{costs is}} often cited as {{essential}} for optimizing service delivery. Roads are the oldest, most important infrastructure services provided by governments. They require construction, rehabilitation, maintenance, and administration. Various institutional arrangements affect {{the degree to which}} costs can be minimized. Drawing on analyses of experiences with decentralized road provision in eight countries, a longitudinal change analysis of Korea, and vertical and horizontal analysis across states and local governments in Germany, the authors found that the impact of decentralization varies depending on which aspect one is considering: the efficiency of producing road services or the impact on road users. Resources costs are concave, increasing first and decreasing at later stages of decentralization. Preference costs are <b>downward</b> <b>sloping,</b> suggesting that <b>road</b> conditions improve as decentralization advances. In short, decentralization entails initial costs, mostly as losses in economies of scale. But those losses can be outweighed by increases in efficiency when the locus of roadwork is closer to the people. The advantages or limitations of decentralization are function-specific: a) maintenance functions are best provided locally; b) to minimize resource costs, construction should be either completely centralized or completely decentralized; and c) administrative activities are more efficiently provided by local units similar to local maintenance units.

40|$|Many {{theoretical}} bond pricing models {{predict that}} the credit yield curve facing risky bond issuers is <b>downward</b> <b>sloping.</b> Previous empirical research (Sarig and Warga (1989) and Fons (1994)) supports these models. Our study examines sets of bonds issued by the same firm with equal priority in the liability structure, but with different maturities, thus holding credit quality constant. We find, counter to prior research, that risky bonds typically have upward-sloping credit yield curves. Moreover, when we combine our matched sets of bonds (no longer controlling credit quality), the estimated slope is negative, indicating a sample selection bias problem associated with maturity. The Slope of the Credit Yield Curve for Speculative-Grade Issuers Using option analysis, Merton (1974) shows that corporate bond spreads can either increase or decrease with maturity, depending on {{the risk of the}} firm: high-grade corporate issuers face upward-sloping credit yield curves while speculative-grade firms = credit yield curves are <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> or hump-shaped (i. e., mostly <b>downward</b> <b>sloping).</b> More recent theoretica...|$|R

40|$|Air-water flow is an {{undesired}} {{condition in}} many {{systems for the}} transportation of water or wastewater. Air in storm water tunnels may get trapped and negatively affect the system. Air pockets in hydropower tunnels or sewers may cause blow-back events and inadmissible pressure spikes. Water pipes and wastewater pressure mains in particular are subject to air pocket formation in downward-sloping reaches, such as inverted siphons or terrain slopes. Air pocket accumulation causes energy losses and an associated capacity reduction. Whereas in horizontal and in upward inclined pipes all entrained air is transported with the water flow, the air in <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipes can move in both directions. Knowledge on air pocket motion in <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipes {{is essential for the}} proper venting of pressurized pipes and for the prevention of severe blow-back events. The motion of air pockets in <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipes, is closely related to liquid slugs in inclined pipes carrying gas with a small fraction of liquids (i. e. water, oil and gas condensate). The bubble-shaped interface and gas entrainment at the slug front are two features that are similar with air pockets in <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipes. Existing two-phase flow models have been validated mainly on data in horizontal and vertical pipes in which the gas phase drives the liquid phase. The performance of these models in inclined pipes, in which the liquid phase drives the gas phase, is not yet known. Despite its practical relevance in a variety of engineering fields, the literature on air-water flows in <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipes is scarce. The fundamental momentum balance that predicts when an elongated air pocket becomes stagnant in a downward inclined pipe, is yet to be developed. Lubbers was the first to systematically investigate the co-current flow of air and water in <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipes over the complete range of possible air accumulations. Like this thesis, Lubbers’ experimental research was part of the CAPWAT project on capacity losses in pressurised wastewater mains. The main research question, addressed in this thesis, is the development and validation of a total air transport model by flowing water, including the influence of pipe angle, length of sloping section, pipe diameter, surface tension, absolute pressure, pipe friction factor and viscosity. Furthermore, the air discharge by flowing water and the gas pocket head loss in wastewater will be compared with those in clean water. In order to quantify scale effects new measurements have been performed in laboratory facilities with internal pipe diameters of 0. 08 m and 0. 15 m and in a large-scale facility at a wastewater treatment plant with internal pipe diameter D = 0. 192 m, a <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> length of L = 40 m (L/D = 209) and a downward pipe angle of 10 °. Three series of experiments on co-current air-water flow have been conducted in the large-scale facility, each with its own specific objective in addition to the purpose of model validation: 1 Experiments with clean water, which provided quantitative information on the influence of the length of the <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> reach on the air pocket head loss and net air discharge. 2 Experiments with surfactant-added water for the assessment of the influence of surface tension on the air pocket head loss and net air discharge. 3 Experiments with untreated wastewater {{in order to determine the}} air pocket head loss and net air discharge in pipelines carrying wastewater. Obviously, these results have been compared with the first experimental series on clean water. The following main conclusions are drawn from this thesis: 1 A physically-based predictive model has been developed for the net air discharge by flowing water in <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipes. The model parameters include the length of the <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> reach and total length of the air pockets, pipe angle, pipe diameter, water (or liquid) discharge, viscosity, surface tension and pipe friction factor. 2 The model has been calibrated to a unique dataset of co-current air-water flows in <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipes. 3 The composition of wastewater, i. e. lower surface tension and solids content, does not enhance the air transport in comparison with the air transport in clean water. 4 A new velocity criterion for the occurrence of multiple air pockets in a <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> reach has been developed. This criterion defines whether the maximum gas pocket head loss may occur in practice. 5 A new momentum balance for elongated air pockets in <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipes has been developed. This momentum balance defines the clearing flow number. It is useful in practice to predict the direction and velocity of an elongated air pocket in a <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipe. The momentum balance and velocity criterion support the design of storm water storage tunnels and bottom outlets of hydropower stations for the proper venting of pipes and tunnels and for the prevention of severe blow-back events. Furthermore, two-phase flow models for the prediction of the transition to slug flow and its properties may benefit from these developments. 6 The required water velocity to start the transport of an elongated gas pocket to the bottom of a <b>downward</b> <b>sloping</b> pipe reach is 0. 9 ?(gD) ^ 1 / 2 (or Fw = 0. 9) over a wide range of pipe angles (5 ° – 20 °). This statement has been substantiated with experimental data at D > 0. 19 m and the derived momentum balance. 7 A gas pocket detection method for the prediction of a gas pocket location has been extended with a total gas volume prediction. The detection method has been tested successfully in a field experiment. Sanitary EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
