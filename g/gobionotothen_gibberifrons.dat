40|$|Antarctic notothenioid fishes present specializations {{related to}} their chronically cold environment, such as high lipid content in tissues (predominantly triacylglycerols, TAG). When TAGs are mobilized, they yield fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids are the primary fuel of {{oxidative}} muscle tissues. Gluconeogenesis from glycerol has not been studied in Antarctic fishes despite the importance of glycerol as a breakdown product of TAGs. To assess the possible importance of glycerol as a substrate for gluconeogenesis and to determine whether this pathway and Krebs cycle are metabolically cold adapted, key hepatic enzyme activities were measured in Antarctic notothenioid fishes (Notothenia coriiceps, <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> and Chionodraco rastrospinosus) an...|$|E
40|$|Otolith {{growth and}} RNA/DNA ratios of larval stages of Notolepis coatsi, <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> and Trematomus scotti, three Antarctic fish, were studied during early 1998. RNA/DNA ratios were {{significantly}} different between the notothenioids and paralepidids (P 0. 05). The ratios were independent of larval total length and water temperature. Recent otolith growth (based on the last five increments) and biochemical indices correlated slightly, but not significantly. N. coatsi inhabited deeper and colder waters of the Weddell Sea and showed less growth than the other species, which {{are associated with the}} Antarctic Peninsula. In all three species, some larvae had very good growth rates though most were rather poor. Recent growth indices might allow the detection and back-dating of growth changes in Antarctic larvae, and provide insight into a crucial yet poorly understood life-phase of these fish.

40|$|Abstract A primary {{objective}} of the ICEFISH 2004 cruise was to collect and study notothenioid Wshes from remote localities in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Nearly 1 month was devoted to bottom trawling for Wshes on the shelf and upper slope (to 1, 000 m) areas around Shag Rocks, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvetøya. The focus was on the latter two locations, because their faunas are more poorly known. Eight species were collected at Shag Rocks with Patago-notothen guntheri most abundant; 17 at South Georgia with Lepidonotothen nudifrons, L. larseni and <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> most abundant; 13 at the South Sandwich Islands with L. larseni, L. nudifrons and G. gibberifrons most abundant; and 11 at Bouvetøya with L. larseni, Macrourus holotrachys and L. squamifrons most abundant.

40|$|Mechanisms {{responsive}} to hypercapnia (elevated CO 2 concentrations) and shaping branchial energy turnover were investigated in isolated perfused gills of two Antarctic Notothenioids (<b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons,</b> Notothenia coriiceps). Branchial oxygen consumption was measured under normo- versus hypercapnic conditions (10, 000 ppm CO 2) at high extracellular pH values. The fractional costs of ion regulation, protein and RNA synthesis {{in the energy}} budgets were determined using specific inhibitors. Overall gill energy turnover was maintained under pH compensated hypercapnia in both Antarctic species {{as well as in}} a temperate zoarcid (Zoarces viviparus). However, fractional energy consumption by the examined processes rose drastically in G. gibberifrons (100 - 180 %), {{and to a lesser extent}} in N. coriiceps gills (7 - 56 %). In conclusion, high CO 2 concentrations under conditions of compensated acidosis induce cost increments in epithelial processes, however, at maintained overall rates of branchial energy turnover...|$|E
40|$|Notothenioid fish of 3 species - 23 {{immature}} Notothenia coriiceps, 4 <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> and 11 Chaenocephalus aceratus, {{from the}} coastal zone at the South Orkney Islands were examined {{to determine their}} parasite infection. Five digenean species from the intestine, one monogenean species from the skin, two tetraphyllidean larval forms (cercoids) from the intestine, and diphyllobothriid plerocercoids from the stomach's wall, liver and body cavity are reported. Infections are {{compared with those of}} fish from adjacent island groups along the Scotia Arc. Parasite infections of the fish from the South Orkney Islands were more similar to those at the South Shetland Islands area than at South Georgia.

40|$|The summer diet of {{two species}} of {{icefishes}} (Channichthyidae) from the South Shetland Islands and Elephant Island, Champsocephalus gunnari and Chaenocephalus aceratus, was investigated from 2001 to 2003. Champsocephalus gunnari fed almost exclusively on krill (Euphausia superba) in all years. The importance of other taxa (Themisto gaudichaudii, mysids, myctophids) in the diet was negligible. The average feeding rate of Champsocephalus gunnari inferred from an exponential gastric evacuation model was between 1. 0 and 1. 5 % body weight per day. Most of the stomachs of Chaenocephalus aceratus were empty. Stomachs with food contained mainly krill, mysids and fish. Among the fish taken, locally abundant species formed {{the bulk of the}} diet: <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> in 2001, Lepidonotothen larseni and Champsocephalus gunnari in 2002 and L. larseni in 2003.

40|$|Various {{antarctic}} fish species, particularly Chaenocephalus aceratus, Champsocephalus gunnari and <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons,</b> from 1987 and 1991 were {{analysed for}} 10 nonpolar xenobiotic compounds. Concentrations expressed {{on the basis}} of extractable organic matter (EOM) were nearly identical in liver and adipose tissue. They were also independent of fish weight. Concentrations of HCB, which were as high as in Limanda limanda of the North Sea (20 ng/g EOM), are interpreted as results of cold condensation. p,p'-DDE, trans-nonachlor and PCB congeners 153, 138, 180 ranged one to two orders of magnitude lower than in North Sea fish. In addition, nonachlor III, octachlorobornane and mirex were roughly quantified. A residual compound comparable in concentration to octachlorobornane and not yet described in the literature was tentatively identified. From chromatographic and mass spectrometric data the elemental composition C sub(10) H sub(3) OCl sub(7) was derived. p,p'-DDE and the three PCB congeners increased in Antarctica between 1987 and 1991 due to global redistribution...|$|E
40|$|The diurnal {{vertical}} distribution and abundance of fish larvae was studied by net samples in the 265 m deep fjord of Cumberland East Bay, South Georgia. In early spring the six most abundant {{species of fish}} larvae in the upper 200 m of the water column were Champsocephalus gunnari, Lepidonotothen nudifrons, Pseudochaenichthys georgianus, Chaenocephalus aceratus, Parachaenichthys' georgianus and Electrona antarctica. In summer, the larvae of C. gunnari, <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons,</b> Lepidonotothen larseni and Trematomus hansoni were most abundant, and the majority {{were found in the}} upper 140 m of the water column, with greatest densities in the top 2 m. During both seasons most species showed some evidence of diurnal vertical migration. A distinct pattern was found for C. gunnari in summer; they were at 0 – 20 m during the day and 60 – 100 m at midnight. Net avoidance by the larvae of most species was greater before sunset in early spring, and during all periods of daylight in summer, than at other times of day...|$|E
40|$|Representatives of the Antarctic {{food web}} (krill, cephalopod, fish, penguin, seal) {{of the area}} around Elephant Island and from the Weddell Sea were {{analysed}} for the most recalcitrant organochlorine compounds. Due to sorption of the compounds to sinking particles and accumulation in sediments, two benthic fish species (<b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons,</b> Chaenocephalus aceratus) feeding on benthos invertebrates and fish reflected significantly increasing concentrations within a decade (1987 - 1996), while a benthopelagic species (Champsocephalus gunnari) feeding on krill did not. In the pelagic food chain, lipid normalised concentrations of all compounds increased from Antarctic krill to fish proving that biomagnification of highly lipophilic pollutants (log octanol-water partition coefficient > 5) occurs in water-breathing animals. As top predators Weddell and southern elephant seals (Leptonychotes weddellii, Mirounga leonina) biomagnified the POPs relative to krill 30 to 160 fold {{with the exception of}} hexachlorobenzene, the levels of which were lower than in fish indicating its intense specific elimination...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> < 1 year old, of the 1977, 1980, 1981, 1985, 1986, 1990 and 1995 cohorts, were sampled using nets, {{in various}} periods during summer (December to February) at South Georgia. Growth in {{standard}} length (Ls) was estimated using the exponential model. Among the seven cohorts, average growth rate varied between 0. 33 – 2. 1 % Lsd− 1, and predicted Ls for mid-January varied between 21. 6 – 29. 1 mm. Average growth rate was {{inversely related to}} mean date of sampling but was not significantly related to mean Ls. Mean sea surface temperatures were available for the 1981 – 95 cohorts. Average growth rate and predicted Ls for mid-January were both negatively conelated with mean December–January sea temperature, but were not significantly related to mean weekly sea surface temperature during the sampling periods. Greater average growth rate and greater Ls in cooler summers may be partly due to a large-scale pattern of environmental variability, indicated by sea temperature, that governs the timing and magnitude of the production cycle and food availability...|$|E
40|$|Histological {{characteristics}} of the gonads and the energy contents of axial muscle, liver and gonads of Antarctic notothenioid fish collected during the LAMPOS (Latin American Polarstern Study) survey in April 2002 were analysed. Ovaries and testes were staged following histological maturity criteria. Oocyte diameters frequency were established and fecundity values were estimated. The energetic values (kJ/g) of different organs were determined using a microcalorimetric bomb. Ovaries of Chaenocephalus aceratus showed a generalised atretic process. The gonadal histology of Champsocephalus gunnari, Pseudochaenichthys georgianus and Chionodracus rastrospinosus suggests that their spawnings take place in autumn. <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> and Lepidonotothen larseni females {{were in the process}} of maturation, with the ovaries of the former containing yolked and atretic oocytes together. Ovaries of Lepidonotothen kempi showed old postovulatory follicles, which provided evidence of previous spawning. Gonads from both sexes of Dissostichus eleginoides were immature. Absolute and relative fecundity were lower in Channichthyidae than in Nototheniidae. The energy contents of the different organs analysed were: liver > gonads > axial muscle. The highest energy density value (kJ/g wet body mass) was found in Dissostichus eleginoides...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Buoyancy was {{measured}} for 258 specimens representing 13 species of adult and sub-adult notothe-niids, bathydraconids, and channichthyids from the South Shetland Islands. Measurements were expressed as percentage buoyancy (%B) =Wwater/Wair· 102. There were no neutrally buoyant species and mean values for %B were 3. 07 – 6. 11 %, with channichthyids {{at the low}} end and benthic nototheniids and bathydraconids at the high end. All species showed an ontogenetic decrease in %B with increasing body weight. With the exception of Champsocephalus gunnari, there was no sexual dimor-phism in %B within this sample. With some exceptions, values for %B were consistent with life-history infor-mation. Sub-adult Dissostichus mawsoni were not neu-trally buoyant, as are large adults. Notothenia rossii had a significantly lower %B than closely related N. corii-ceps. Benthic <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> had a lower %B than semipelagic Lepidonotothen larseni. Although they exhibit some diversification in life history, the four channichthyids in the sample were similar in %B. Neu-tral buoyancy is rare in notothenioids and may be con-fined to a single nototheniid clade...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of photoperiod {{on the ability}} of Notothenia rossii Richardson, 1844 to detect prey was studied experimentally. In 12 L/ 12 D there was the highest number of individuals stimulated visually and chemically while in 24 D chemical perception was the same as that observed in 12 L/ 12 D, the latter being lower than in 24 L. The ultrastructure of chemo- and photo-sensory structures, involved in the detection of food, was studied. The photoreceptor cells of the retina are single and double cones, and rods. Taste buds were concentrated in the central part of upper and lower lips. Their shape is even, but the size is variable. The olfactory rosette has a sensory and a non-sensory epithelium, being rich in different mucosubstances. The conclusion was that in different photoperiods there is a difference in the response to visual and chemical stimulation for prey detection and that all sensory systems are more stimulated in periods of more luminosity, mainly when there is an alternation between light and dark periods. Sensory organs are complex when compared to some other Antarctic fish such as <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> Lönnberg, 1905 and Ophthalmolycus amberensis Tomo, Marshoff & Torno, 1977 but similar to those of N. coriiceps Rchardson, 1844. A capacidade de Notothenia rossii Richardson, 1844 detectar presas in diferentes fotoperíodos (24 L, 24 D e 12 L/ 12 D) foi estudada em tanques experimentais. Em 12 L/ 12 D houve um maior número de indivíduos estimulados visual e quimicamente enquanto que em 24 D a percepção química foi a mesma que a observada em 12 L/ 12 D, sendo este ultimo inferior a 24 L. A morfologia das estruturas quimio-foto sensoriais, envolvidas na detecção do alimento, foi estudada. As células fotorreceptoras da retina são os cones simples e duplos e os bastonetes. Os botões concentraram-se na região central dos lábios superior e inferior. Seu formato é constante, mas o tamanho é variável. A rosseta olfatória possui um epitélio sensorial e não sensorial rico mucosubstâncias de natureza diversa. Podemos concluir que em diferentes fotoperíodos existe uma diferença de resposta na estimulação visual e química para a detecção de persas e todo o sistema sensorial são mais estimulados em períodos de maior luminosidade, principalmente quando existe uma alternância entre períodos de luz e escuro. Os órgãos sensoriais são complexos quando comparados com outros peixes antárticos como <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> Lönnberg, 1905 e Ophthalmolycus amberensis Tomo, Marshoff & Torno, 1977) mas similar a Notothenia coriiceps Richardson, 1844...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{of fish in}} the diet of the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) at Bird Island, South Georgia was investigated by analysis of fish otoliths in scats (faeces) collected during late May to early November 1983. Of the 55 scats examined, 49 contained fish remains, and 45 contained fish otoliths. Ten fish species were represented by 415 otoliths, and 33 otoliths were too digested to be identified unequivocally. Fish size was estimated from otolith size based on published allometric equations. Four coastal notothenioid fishes dominated the fish component of the diet: Champsocephalus gunnari and <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> each comprised about 40 % of the total fish mass; Chaenocephalus aceratus was ranked third by mass and the smaller Lepidonotothen larseni occurred in {{one quarter of the}} scats but was of lower importance in terms of mass. The length-frequency distribution of C. gunnari landed by the commercial fishery in October 1982 to June 1983 is similar to that which comprised the bulk of the diet in the present study. Compared with recent studies on the fish component of the diet in the literature, the dominance of C. gunnari is generally similar, however, there was a greater proportion of G. gibberifrons during the 1983 winter and spring than reported for recent winters...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{anthropogenic}} pollution are of increasing concern {{in remote areas}} such as Antarctica. The evolutionary adaptation of Antarctic notothenioid fish to the cold and stable Southern Ocean led to a low plasticity of their physiological functions, what may limit their capacity to deal with altered temperature regimes and pollution in the Antarctic environment. Using a biochemical approach, we aimed to assess the hepatic biotransformation capacities of Antarctic fish species by determining (i) the activities of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and (ii) the metabolic clearance of benzo(a) pyrene by hepatic S 9 supernatants. In addition, we determined the thermal sensitivity of the xenobiotic biotransformation enzymes. We investigated the xenobiotic metabolism of the red-blooded <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> and Notothenia rossii, the hemoglobin-less Chaenocephalus aceratus and Champsocephalus gunnari, and the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss as a reference. Our results revealed similar metabolic enzyme activities and metabolic clearance rates between red- and white-blooded Antarctic fish, but significantly lower rates in comparison to rainbow trout. Therefore, bioaccumulation factors for metabolizable lipophilic contaminants may be higher in Antarctic than in temperate fish. Likewise, the thermal adaptive capacities and flexibilities of the EROD and GST activities in Antarctic fish were significantly lower than in rainbow trout. As a consequence, increasing water temperatures in the Southern Ocean will additionally compromise the already low detoxification capacities of Antarctic fish...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{the first evidence}} {{for the existence of}} two distinct types of fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) in cardiac tissue of vertebrates. Four species of Antarctic teleost fish (Chaenocephalus aceratus, Cryodraco antarcticus, <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> and Notothenia coriiceps) exhibited two FABP mRNAs of 1. 0 kb and 0. 8 kb, which we have termed Hh-FABP and Had-FABP (isolated from Heart tissue, with similarity to mammalian heart-type FABP or mammalian adipose-type FABP respectively). These FABP types appear to be products of distinct genes. Both FABP transcripts were abundant in cardiac and aerobic pectoral muscle. However, relative abundance of the two types varied distinctly among other tissues such as kidney, brain, spleen and white muscle. Neither FABP type was expressed in liver or intestine. The coding regions of Hh-FABP and Had-FABP cDNAs from the same species are only approximately 60 % identical with one another. However, homologues of each FABP species, which exhibit > 98 % identity to their respective types, were isolated from three other Antarctic teleosts. Phylogenetic analysis of aligned amino-acid sequences places Hh-FABP with other vertebrate heart-type FABPs, and Had with adipose/cutaneous FABPs. Expression of two distinct FABPs in cardiac tissue of Antarctic teleosts may be related to their ability to both utilize fatty acid as the primary metabolic fuel and to store lipid intracellularly...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversification}} of the teleost suborder Notothenioidei (Perciformes) in Antarctic waters provides {{one of the}} most striking examples of a marine adaptive radiation. Along with a number of adaptations to the cold environment, such as the evolution of antifreeze glycoproteins, notothenioids diversified into eight families and at least 130 species. Here, we investigate the genetic population structure of the humped rockcod (<b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons),</b> a benthic notothenioid fish. Six populations were sampled at different locations around the Scotia Sea, comprising a large part of the species ’ distribution range (N = 165). Our analyses based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data (352 bp) and eight microsatellite markers reveal a lack of genetic structuring over large geographic distances (ΦST £ 0. 058, FST £ 0. 005, P values nonsignificant). In order to test whether this was due to passive larval dispersal, we used GPS-tracked drifter trajectories, which approximate movement of passive surface particles with ocean currents. The drifter data indicate that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) connects the sampling locations in one direction only (west–east), and that passive transport is possible within the 4 -month larval period of G. gibberifrons. Indeed, when applying the isolation-with-migration model in IMA, strong unidirectional west-east migration rates are detected in the humped rockcod. This leads us to conclude that, in G. gibberifrons, genetic differentiation is prevented by gene flow via larval dispersal with the ACC...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotic ectotherms of the Southern Ocean face {{energetic}} {{challenges to}} protein folding assisted by the cytosolic chaperonin CCT. We hypothesize that CCT and its client proteins (CPs) have co-evolved molecular adaptations that facilitate CCT–CP interaction and the ATP-driven folding cycle at low temperature. To test this hypothesis, {{we compared the}} functional and structural properties of CCT–CP systems from testis tissues of an Antarctic fish, <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> (Lo¨nnberg) (habitat/body T=- 1. 9 to + 2 ˚C), and of the cow (body T= 37 ˚C). We examined the temperature dependence of the binding of denatured CPs (bactin, b-tubulin) by fish and bovine CCTs, both in homologous and heterologous combinations and at temperatures between 24 ˚C and 20 ˚C, in a buffer conducive to binding of the denatured CP to the open conformation of CCT. In homologous combination, the percentage of G. gibberifrons CCT bound to CP declined linearly with increasing temperature, whereas the converse was true for bovine CCT. Binding of CCT to heterologous CPs was low, irrespective of temperature. When reactions were supplemented with ATP, G. gibberifrons CCT catalyzed the folding and release of actin at 2 ˚C. The ATPase activity of apo-CCT from G. gibberifrons at 4 ˚C was, 2. 5 -fold {{greater than that of}} apo-bovine CCT, whereas equivalent activities were observed at 20 ˚C. Based on these results, we conclude that the catalytic folding cycle of CCT from Antarctic fishes is partially compensated at their habitat temperature, probably by means of enhanced CP-binding affinity and increased flexibility of the CCT subunits...|$|E
40|$|Organochlorine {{compounds}} were analysed {{in three}} fish species of different feeding types {{from the area}} of Elephant Island in the Antarctic. In 1996, HCB (means: 15 - 20 ng/g lipid), p,p'-DDE (5 - 13 ng/g lipid) and mirex (1 - 7 ng/g lipid) predominated, while PCBs were minor components (PCB 153 : 0. 4 - 2 ng/g lipid). Concentration patterns were species-dependent: PCB 180, PCB 153, mirex, nonachlor III, trans-nonachlor and the toxaphene compound B 8 - 1413 were highest in the bottom invertebrate feeder <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> and lowest in the krill feeder Champsocephalus gunnari. Levels of p,p'-DDE, PCB 138 and heptachloro- 1 '-methyl- 1, 2 '-bipyrrole (Q 1), a natural bioaccumulative product, were highest in the fish feeder Chaenocephalus aceratus, whereas HCB was present in about equal concentrations in all species. Most compounds were taken up preferentially via the benthic food chain, the chlorinated bipyrrole via the pelagic food chain and HCB from the water. In antarctic fish, biomagnification was generally more important than bioconcentration. Between 1987 and 1996, most POP levels showed significant increases in the benthos feeder and the fish feeder, while they remained nearly constant or increased less in the krill feeder. Hence, the former species represent indicator species for changing POP levels in Antarctica. Ratios (1996 / 1987) of average concentrations in G. gibberifrons were: PCB 138 0. 7, HCB 0. 8, B 8 - 1413 1. 5, PCB 180 1. 7, PCB 153 1. 8, p,p'-DDE 2. 0, nonachlor III 2. 9, trans-nonachlor 3. 3, mirex 6. 7. By comparison with trends in the northern hemisphere it is concluded that global distribution of HCB is close to equilibrium. Changing levels of other POPs reflect global redistribution and increasing transfer to antarctic waters probably due to recent usage in the southern hemisphere and climate changes...|$|E

Nearly 1 month was devoted to bottom trawling for fishes on the shelf and upper slope (to 1, 000 m) areas around Shag Rocks, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvetøya. The focus was on the latter two locations, because their faunas are more poorly known. Eight species were collected at Shag Rocks with Patagonotothen guntheri most abundant; 17 at South Georgia with Lepidonotothen nudifrons, L. larseni and <b>Gobionotothen</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> most abundant; 13 at the South Sandwich Islands with L. larseni, L. nudifrons and G. gibberifrons most abundant; and 11 at Bouvetøya with L. larseni, Macrourus holotrachys and L. squamifrons most abundant. Ten new locality records were established: Shag Rocks (1), South Georgia (1), South Sandwich Islands (5), South Sandwich Trench at 5, 350 m (1) and Bouvetøya (2). Total known demersal fish diversity on the shelf and upper slope at Shag Rocks/South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvetøya is 42, 31 and 17 species, respectively. To examine population structure in the four most abundant notothenioids at Bouvetøya (L. larseni, L. squamifrons, Notothenia coriiceps and Chaenocephalus aceratus), we examined the ND 2 portion of mitochondrial DNA. Chaenocephalus aceratus, N. coriiceps and L. larseni exhibited no significant genetic differentiation in comparison with samples from localities in the Scotia Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula. However, L. squamifrons showed significant genetic differentiation between the South Shetlands and Bouvetøya populations (F ST = 0. 189, P = 0. 015). Thus, these data combined with previous studies of two other notothenioids suggest that {{five of the six}} notothenioid species at Bouvetøya are not genetically differentiated from other localities in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The location of Bouvetøya within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the long (1 – 2 years) pelagic stages of the notothenioids at Bouvetøya may be at least partly responsible for this genetic homogeneit...|$|E
