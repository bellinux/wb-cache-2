The formed phosphates are highly insoluble and thermodynamically stable over almost entire pH and Eh range. In the presented study the efficiency and mechanism of cadmium uptake by synthetic hydroxylapatite and natural <b>fluoroapatite</b> was examined within the pH range of 3 - 7 for different reaction times (2 — 1440 hours). The solids after reactions were characterized by XRD and SEM-EDS. Percentage reduction of cadmium concentration in the experiments with <b>fluoroapatite</b> and hydroxylapatite, regardless of pH, did not exceed 17 % and 25 %, respectively. Cadmium uptake from the solution mainly resulted from the formation of cadmium phosphates and/or Ca-Cd phosphate solid solutions on the apatites surface. The release rate of phosphate ions by hydroxylapatite was relatively high. This promoted crystallization {{of a large number of}} small crystals. In turn dissolution of <b>fluoroapatite</b> was slower and thus the formation of large crystals was observed. There was no clear evidence for cadmium-calcium ion-exchange mechanism.

Conclusions There {{are a number}} of interesting facts which can be deduced from the data presented in the color mea-surements. First of all, the bluest phosphor is the pure fluorapatite. The addition of even a small amount of chloride serves to shift the color to a point much greener. Thus, it is essential to prevent any contamina-tion by chloride in order to produce the bluest phos-phor. It can also be noted that the color of the mixed apatites at zero manganese content is invariant at all F/C 1 ratios (see Fig. 4). (Note also that the min imum amount of chloride necessary to cause this shift has not been determined in this work). A second deduction indicates that the mixed apatites form a different set of loci than the pure <b>fluoroapatite.</b> Although the pure <b>fluoroapatite</b> is bluer than any of the mixed apatites, the addition of Mn + 2 to the fiuoro-apatite produces phosphors which are greener than any of the mixed phases.

After this, the early processes in the nucleation of hydroxyapatite at a DNA template {{have been investigated}} using molecular dynamics simulations. Results indicate that duplexes of DNA adopting a B double helix can be encapsulated inside nanopores of hydroxyapatite without undergoing significant distortions in the inter-strand hydrogen bonds and the intra-strand stacking. This ability of hydroxyapatite is practically independent of the DNA sequence, which {{has been attributed to}} the stabilizing role of the interactions between the calcium atoms of the mineral and the phosphate groups of the biomolecule. In contrast, the fluorine atoms of <b>fluoroapatite</b> induce pronounced structural distortions in the double helix when embedded in a pore of the same dimensions, resulting in the loss of its most relevant characteristics. On the other hand, molecular dynamics simulations have allowed us to observe the formation of calcium phosphate clusters at the surface of the B-DNA template.
