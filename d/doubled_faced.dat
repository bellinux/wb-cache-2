40|$|Aesculus hippocastanum L, {{known as}} horse chestnut, is {{generally}} used for therapeutic, medicinal and pharmaceutical applications and has large seed shells containing aesculin {{which is responsible}} for the dyeing property. Due to the lack of information on dyeing characteristics of horse chestnut extracts in leather and also textile engineering field, ecofriendly dyeing process of leathers with the extracts of horse chestnut seed shells has gained an interest. Therefore, in the study the dyeing properties of <b>double</b> <b>face</b> leathers with extracts of Aesculus hippocastanum L were investigated. Seed shells of A. hippocastanum were extracted with sodium hydroxide in different concentrations and the extraction yields were determined. In accordance with extraction results, the horse chestnut extracts were used for the dyeing process of <b>double</b> <b>face</b> leathers. To evaluate the effect of A. hippocastanum extract on dyeing properties of <b>double</b> <b>face</b> leathers, the proportions of the extracts were differentiated. The quality performance of dyed leathers was investigated in terms of colour measurements and to-and-fro rubbing fastness characteristics. The colour measurements were determined with Minolta CM- 3600 A spectrophotometer and to-and-fro rubbing fastness was examined in accordance with TS EN ISO 11640 standard. The results revealed that A. hippocastanum extract could be used as newly adapted natural dye stuff in eco-friendly <b>double</b> <b>face</b> production...|$|R

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>face</b> fabrics {{are used}} to ensure better {{clothing}} comfort in sports and active wears. High moisture transfer properties of these fabrics affect their comfort properties and make them more functional. In this study, in order to investigate the moisture management properties of the <b>double</b> <b>face</b> fabrics, a special knitting structure, which has different or same yarn combinations {{in the face and}} back sides, was used. The selected yarns were cotton–cotton, cotton–polypropylene, polypropylene–cotton and polypropylene–polypropylene for face and back sides respectively. Moisture management properties and the changes of the thermal absorptivity values, which determine the warm-cool feeling, of the produced fabrics were determined and statistically analyzed. All measurements were done both in dry and wet conditions. The results indicate that, the polypropylene (inner) -cotton (outer) fabric has better moisture manage-ment property, provides high levels of comfort and can be preferred for summer, active and sports wear.
