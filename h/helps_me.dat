By February 1888 he had [...] "learnt English wonderfully" [...] according to Victoria. After he complained to the Queen that he had been a clerk in India and thus menial work as a waiter was beneath him, he was promoted to the position of [...] "Munshi" [...] in August 1888. In her journal, the Queen writes that she made this change so that he would stay: [...] "I particularly wish to retain his services as he <b>helps</b> <b>me</b> in studying Hindustani, which interests me very much, & he is very intelligent & useful." [...] Photographs of him waiting at table were destroyed and he became the first personal Indian clerk to the Queen. Buksh remained in the Queen's service, but only as a khidmatgar or table servant, until his death at Windsor in 1899.|$|E

Many thanks to Dr. Dallas for <b>helping</b> <b>me</b> break-down the overall thesis project to smaller manageable sub-projects. Thanks to Dr. Nutter for his assistance in <b>helping</b> <b>me</b> experiment the project using Xilinx. Dr. Karp always made herself available to <b>help</b> <b>me</b> decipher signal processing attributes included in the many IEEE papers I had to read for deeper understanding of the issues.

2500|$|Wen {{has been}} {{described}} as a populist by most observers. His quick responses and visits to the scenes of various disasters, including the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, has earned him a considerable reputation as an approachable leader in touch with the experiences of the masses.

[...] "Whether taking a stroll or swimming, it puts me at ease both mentally and physically and <b>helps</b> <b>me</b> handle my heavy workload," [...] Wen had remarked.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, {{the site}} of the Le Rosey campus was chosen by the school's founder, Paul-Emile Carnal, [...] "a lover of nature, history and the countryside". The Le Rosey campus at Rolle is {{situated}} adjacent to the famous Lake Geneva. In 1911, the founder passed the ownership of Le Rosey to his son, Henri-Paul Carnal. In 1917, the school began to go to Gstaad in the German-speaking Canton of Berne for the winter months to escape the dense fog that settles in on Lake Geneva. In 1947, the third generation of directors, Louis Johannot and Helen Schaub, assumed ownership of Le Rosey. Under the same ownership, in 1967, Le Rosey admitted girls {{for the first time and}} opened a separate girls' campus. In 1980, the current owners, Philippe and Anne Gudin de la Sablonnière, became the fourth generation of Directors at Le Rosey. Louis Johannot, in an interview with Life Magazine in 1965, made a comment that received considerable attention: [...] "The only reason I always try to meet and know the parents better is because it <b>helps</b> <b>me</b> to forgive their children." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Robert Christgau was more {{enthusiastic}} {{in his column}} for Billboard, impressed by Derulo's [...] "command of contemporary hookcraft", even though the songs were about sex gratifying enough to prompt marriage: [...] "I value both sex and matrimony too much to recommend this life strategy. But compared to the predatory Chris Brown of 'Loyal' or the chauvinistic Trey Songz of 'Foreign', he's so exuberant and playful he <b>helps</b> <b>me</b> get why guys and dolls fall for it—even share their thrills some, vicariously." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said that the album appears to be [...] "some post-traumatic stress therapy session mixed with a banging, ultra after-party." [...] Jeffries praised the album's repacking and total repurposing of Tattoos commending the new production on the album stating [...] " [...] gives the album a stripclub number in Ying Yang Twins style where everyone sounds like they're having the proper amount of fun". Christgau named it the sixth best album of 2014 in his year-end list for The Barnes & Noble Review.|$|E
