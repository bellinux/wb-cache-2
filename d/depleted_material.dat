Six Egyptian mummies held at the Musée des Confluences in Lyon (France) have been radiocarbon dated, among which two embalmed mummies have given results older than expected, both on textile and organic material (flesh/skin). Radiocarbon dates’ ageing relates {{to the use of}} a radiocarbon <b>depleted</b> <b>material</b> that is not extracted by classical radiocarbon chemical pre-treatment. In this study, the presence of bitumen is corroborated by infrared spectroscopy analyses. The present paper describes the research we employed to extract bitumen from mummies’ linen wrappings. An experimental protocol has been developed and tested on modern linen textiles; it divides into four steps: textile soaking in bitumen – linen samples thermal degradation – extraction protocol – infrared analyses and radiocarbon dating at each step. Test-samples show that bitumen has been correctly extracted only on samples that have not been artificially aged, others remain radiocarbon depleted. Presently, the protocol is not efficient enough to be applied on archaeological samples. The difficulty does not rely on the bitumen present, but on the interactions developed between bitumen and linen fibres over time.

This picture was entirely different from that seen with monoclonal antibodies to the leukocyte common (LC) antigen, where 100 % of all the above-mentioned leukocyte populations were positive. Biochemical studies using detergent solubilized membranes labeled with 3 H at the sialic acid residues showed that the molecule bearing the F 8 - 11 - 13 determinant was a glycoprotein of 215, 000 mol wt, and that the peak depleted by F 8 - 11 - 13 monoclonal antibody affinity columns corresponded to the high molecular weight region of a broad peak previously shown to be completely depleted by monoclonal antibody (F 10 - 89 - 4) affinity columns directed at the LC antigen.

40|$|On {{a global}} scale basalts from mid-ocean ridges are strikingly more {{homogeneous}} than basalts from intraplate volcanism. The observed geochemical heterogeneity argues strongly {{for the existence of}} distinct reservoirs in the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s mantle. It is an unresolved problem of Geodynamics as to how these findings can be reconciled with large-scale convection. We review observational constraints, and investigate stirring properties of numerical models of mantle convection. Conditions in the early Earth may have supported layered convection with rapid stirring in the upper layers. Material that has been altered near the surface is transported downwards by small-scale convection. Thereby a layer of homogeneous <b>depleted</b> <b>material</b> develops above pristine mantle. As the mantle cools over Earth history, the effects leading to layering become reduced and models show the large-scale convection favoured for the Earth today. Laterally averaged, the upper mantle below the lithosphere is least affected by material that has experienced near-surface differentiation. The geochemical signature obtained during the previous episode of small-scale convection may be preserved there for the longest time. Additionally, stirring is less effective in the high viscosity layer of the central lower mantle [1, 2], supporting the survival of medium-scale heterogeneities there. These models are the first, using 3 -d spherical geometry and mostly Earth-like parameters, to address the suggested change of convective style. Although the models are still far from reproducing our planet, we find that proposal might be helpful towards reconciling geochemical and geophysical constraints...|$|E

However, female P. protodice {{have been seen}} to actively approach and chase both conspecific males and females. When directed at other females, interactions last only a few seconds; however, when directed at males, this behavior is most likely an attempt to solicit male courtship. As a female flies about feeding and searching for oviposition sites, {{the contents of the}} spermatophore decreases in size, and the female becomes interested in re-mating. On average females <b>deplete</b> <b>material</b> received from males in 5 to 7 days. Thus, females who try to solicit courtship only do so when their spermatophore is emptying and they want to receive a fresh batch. Both virgin and previously mated females have been seen to initiate courtships, with various underlying reasons. Virgin females approach males possibly because they are cryptic while perched and must become more conspicuous in their pursuit. However, previously mated females are driven by a different reason, {{the fact that they are}} less likely to be attractive to males. As a result, they must attempt to elicit courtships to maximize their reproductive options. Another reason encompassing both virgin and previously mated females is that females leave areas of high population density due to male harassment and must actively seek males and adapt to a new environment.|$|R
40|$|We present Os {{data for}} axial {{high-temperature}} and off-axial low-temperature hydrothermal solutions from the Juan de Fuca Ridge. The high-temperature, H₂S-bearing axial fluids have unradiogenic Os isotopes {{pointing to a}} nearly complete domination of osmium isotopes from the basalts during hydrothermal circulation. The ridge axis fluids typically do not show large enrichment in osmium concentration over seawater although one high-temperature fluid has an Os concentration enhanced {{by a factor of}} 4 above seawater. It appears that the Os concentration of high-temperature hydrothermal fluids is typically buffered at roughly the seawater concentration. We suggest that subseafloor precipitation of pyrite from the high-temperature hydrothermal fluids controls the osmium transportation. The axial hydrothermal activity does not supply significant amounts of unradiogenic osmium to the deep oceans. In contrast, a low-temperature off-axis fluid is enriched in non-radiogenic osmium over seawater by a factor of 9, showing much less precipitation of osmium at low temperature. Because a large fraction of the cooling of oceanic lithosphere occurs on ridge flanks, Os from low-temperature, ridge-flank hydrothermal circulation may be a significant contributor to the balance of Os in the oceans. A detailed balance between Os contributions from dissolution of cosmic dust and hydrothermal fluids is still not possible. The low-temperature hydrothermal sample gives ¹⁸⁷Os/¹⁸⁸Os = 0. 110 ± 0. 001. This extremely unradiogenic osmium can only come from a source that underwent depletion of Re over 2. 6 Ga ago. Assuming no contamination during sample collection, this result suggests that the convecting upper mantle contains ancient <b>depleted</b> <b>material</b> that imparted unradiogenic osmium to intruding basaltic melts. ...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{dissolved}} {{organic carbon}} (DOC) is a large (660 Pg C) reactive carbon reservoir that mediates the oceanic microbial food web and interacts with climate on both short and long timescales. Carbon isotopic content provides information on the DOC source via δ[superscript 13]C and age via Δ[superscript 14]C. Bulk isotope measurements suggest a microbially sourced DOC reservoir with two distinct components of differing radiocarbon age. However, such measurements cannot determine internal dynamics and fluxes. Here we analyze serial oxidation experiments to quantify the isotopic diversity of DOC at an oligotrophic site in the central Pacific Ocean. Our results show diversity in both stable and radio isotopes at all depths, confirming DOC cycling hidden within bulk analyses. We confirm the presence of isotopically enriched, modern DOC cocycling with an isotopically depleted older fraction in the upper ocean. However, our results show that up to 30 % of the deep DOC reservoir is modern and supported by a 1 Pg/y carbon flux, which is 10 times higher than inferred from bulk isotope measurements.

The landslide was measured by means of terrestrial laser-scanner techniques and, because of the zone morphology, the used methodology involved scanning the mobilized zone from different stations with several captures from each point. Two scanning campaigns were carried out in a time interval of 14 days. The antenna phase centers were determined by GPS techniques and incorporated to the point clouds as an additional point in the TLS reference system; next, the relative orientation of the different point clouds of each scan station is made, adjusting and merging them in a single point cloud; finally, we proceed to data transformation to a reference system global and common to both campaigns, in which surface and terrain models can be compared.

40|$|New Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf data {{require the}} {{existence}} of at least four mantle components in the genesis of basalts from the the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) : (1) one (or more likely a small range of) enriched component(s) within the Iceland plume, (2) a depleted component within the Iceland plume (distinct from the shallow N-MORB source), (3) a depleted sheath surrounding the plume and (4) shallow N-MORB source mantle. These components have been available since the major phase of igneous activity associated with plume head impact during Paleogene times. In Hf-Nd isotope space, samples from Iceland, DSDP Leg 49 (Sites 407, 408 and 409), ODP Legs 152 and 163 (southeast Greenland margin), the Reykjanes Ridge, Kolbeinsey Ridge and DSDP Leg 38 (Site 348) define fields that are oblique to the main ocean island basalt array and extend toward a component with higher 176 Hf/ 177 Hf than the N-MORB source available prior to arrival of the plume, {{as indicated by the}} compositions of Cretaceous basalts from Goban Spur (~ 95 Ma). Aside from Goban Spur, only basalts from Hatton Bank on the oceanward side of the Rockall Plateau (DSDP Leg 81) lie consistently within the field of N-MORB, which indicates that the compositional influence of the plume did not reach this far south and east ~ 55 Ma ago. Thus, Hf-Nd isotope systematics are consistent with previous studies which indicate that shallow MORB-source mantle does not represent the depleted component within the Iceland plume (Thirlwall, J. Geol. Soc. London 152 (1995) 991 - 996; Hards et al., J. Geol. Soc. London 152 (1995) 1003 - 1009; Fitton et al., 1997 doi: 10. 1016 /S 0012 - 821 X(97) 00170 - 2). They also indicate that the depleted component is a long-lived and intrinsic feature of the Iceland plume, generated during an ancient melting event in which a mineral (such as garnet) with a high Lu/Hf was a residual phase. Collectively, these data suggest a model for the Iceland plume in which a heterogeneous core, derived from the lower mantle, consists of 'enriched' streaks or blobs dispersed in a more depleted matrix. A distinguishing feature of both the enriched and depleted components is high Nb/Y for a given Zr/Y (i. e. positive DeltaNb), but the enriched component has higher Sr and Pb isotope ratios, combined with lower epsilon-Nd and epsilon-Hf. This heterogeneous core is surrounded by a sheath of <b>depleted</b> <b>material,</b> similar to the depleted component of the Iceland plume in its epsilon-Nd and epsilon-Hf, but with lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb and negative DeltaNb; this material was probably entrained from near the 670 km discontinuity when the plume stalled at the boundary between the upper and lower mantle. The plume sheath displaced more normal MORB asthenosphere (distinguished by its lower epsilon-Hf for a given epsilon-Nd or Zr/Nb ratio), which existed in the North Atlantic prior to plume impact. Preliminary data on MORBs from near the Azores plume suggest that much of the North Atlantic may be 'polluted' not only by enriched plume material but also by <b>depleted</b> <b>material</b> similar to the Iceland plume sheath. If this hypothesis is correct, it may provide a general explanation for some of the compositional diversity and variations in inferred depth of melting (Klein and Langmuir, 1987 doi: 10. 1029 /JB 092 iB 08 p 08089) along the MAR in the North Atlantic...|$|E

Various models have been proposed to jointly interpret the evidence, including that of G. F. Davies [J. Geophys. Res. 89 (1984) 6017 [...] 6040] in which the author suggested that lumps of primitive material may exist in the lower mantle, representing reservoirs for undepleted basalts. Mixing calculations have suggested, however, that such blobs could not survive 4 Ga of convection. Calculations by M. Manga [Geophys. Res.

We investigate a blob model of convection based on these ideas and consider dynamical, thermal, geochemical and rheological consequences. The radiogenic heat production in the primitive blobs would lead to higher temperatures. However, these would be modest (1 T < 300 K) for sufficiently small blobs (radius < 800 km). The resulting thermal buoyancy can be offset by a small intrinsic density excess (< 1 %) so that blob material is hidden from the ridges but sampled by rising plumes.

Further, land disturbance has led to considerable losses of nutrients from terrestrial ecosystems. This investigation aims to explore and address several barriers to understanding natural organic matter cycling across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Soil organic matter (SOM) turnover models are often constrained by C and N, while data on organic P is lacking. Twenty UK soils were used to provide the first investigation of organic P in density fractionated SOM pools. Organic matter in the mineral fraction was considerably more enriched in oP. Stoichiometric ratios agreed with a new classification model, which provides important constraints for models of nutrient cycles. Radiocarbon (14 C) measurements of aquatic OM indicates sources and turnover on different timescales.

Radiogenic isotope variations are interpreted as {{evidence for the}} declining rates of continental crustal growth over time 3, 4, 5, with some estimates suggesting that over 70 % of the present continental crustal reservoir was extracted {{by the end of}} the Archaean eon 3, 5. Patterns of crustal growth and reworking in rocks younger than three billion years (Gyr) are thought to reflect the assembly and break-up of supercontinents by Wilson cycle processes and mark an important change in lithosphere dynamics 6. In southern West Greenland numerous studies have, however, argued for subduction settings and crust growth by arc accretion back to 3. 8 [*]Gyr ago 7, 8, 9, suggesting that modern-day tectonic regimes operated during the formation of the earliest crustal rock record. Here we report in situ uranium–lead, hafnium and oxygen isotope data from zircons of basement rocks in southern West Greenland across the critical time period during which modern-like tectonic regimes could have initiated. Our data show pronounced differences in the hafnium isotope–time patterns across this interval, requiring changes in the characteristics of the magmatic protolith. The observations suggest that 3. 9 – 3. 5 -Gyr-old rocks differentiated from a > 3. 9 -Gyr-old source reservoir with a chondritic to slightly depleted hafnium isotope composition. In contrast, rocks formed after 3. 2 [*]Gyr ago register the first additions of juvenile <b>depleted</b> <b>material</b> (that is, new mantle-derived crust) since 3. 9 [*]Gyr ago, and are characterized by striking shifts in hafnium isotope ratios similar to those shown by Phanerozoic subduction-related orogens 10, 11, 12. These data suggest a transitional period 3. 5 – 3. 2 [*]Gyr ago from an ancient (3. 9 – 3. 5 [*]Gyr old) crustal evolutionary regime unlike that of modern plate tectonics to a geodynamic setting after 3. 2 [*]Gyr ago that involved juvenile crust generation by plate tectonic processes...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{interstellar}} absorption observed towards two subdwarf O stars, JL 9 and LSS 1274, using spectra {{taken by}} the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). Column densities are measured for many atomic and molecular species (H I, D I, C I, N I, O I, P II, Ar I, Fe II, and H 2), but our main focus is on measuring the D/H ratios for these extended lines of sight, as D/H is an important diagnostic for both cosmology and Galactic chemical evolution. We find D/H=(1. 00 +/- 0. 37) e- 5 towards JL 9, and D/H=(0. 76 +/- 0. 36) e- 5 towards LSS 1274 (2 sigma uncertainties). With distances of 590 +/- 160 pc and 580 +/- 100 pc, respectively, these two lines of sight are currently among the longest Galactic lines of sight with measured D/H. With the addition of these measurements, we see a significant tendency for longer Galactic lines of sight to yield low D/H values, consistent with previous inferences about the deuterium abundance from D/O and D/N measurements. Short lines of sight with H I column densities of log N(H I) 500 pc and log N(H I) > 20. 5, suggest a significantly lower value for the true local-disk gas-phase D/H value, (D/H) _LDg=(0. 85 +/- 0. 09) e- 5. One interpretation of these results is that D is preferentially depleted onto dust grains relative to H and that longer lines of sight that extend beyond the Local Bubble sample more <b>depleted</b> <b>material.</b> In this scenario, the higher Local Bubble D/H ratio is actually a better estimate than (D/H) _LDg for the true local-disk D/H, D/H) _LD. However, if (D/H) _LDg is different from (D/H) _LBg simply because of variable astration and incomplete ISM mixing, then (D/H) _LD=(D/H) _LDg.

40|$|We explore {{condensation}} temperature Tc {{trends in}} the unique binary system Zet 1 Ret - Zet 2 Ret, {{to determine whether there}} is a depletion of refractories, which could be related to the planet formation process. The star Zet 2 Ret hosts a debris disk which was detected by an IR excess and confirmed by direct imaging and numerical simulations, while Zet 1 Ret does not present IR excess nor planets. We carried out a high-precision abundance determination in both components of the binary system via a line-by-line, strictly differential approach. The stellar parameters Teff, log g, [Fe/H] and vturb were determined by imposing differential ionization and excitation equilibrium of Fe I and Fe II lines, with an updated version of the program FUNDPAR. The star Zet 1 Ret resulted slightly more metal rich than Zet 2 Ret by 0. 02 dex. In the differential calculation of Zet 1 Ret using Zet 2 Ret as reference, the abundances of the refractory elements resulted higher than the volatile elements, and the trend of the refractory elements with Tc showed a positive slope. These facts together show a lack of refractory elements in Zet 2 Ret (a debris-disk host) relative to Zet 1 Ret. The Tc trend would be in agreement with the proposed signature of planet formation (Melendez et al. 2009) rather than possible Galactic Chemical Evolution or age effects, which are largely diminished here. Then, following the interpretation of Melendez et al. (2009), we propose an scenario in which the refractory elements depleted in Zet 2 Ret are possibly locked-up in the rocky material that orbits this star and produce the debris disk observed around this object. We estimated a lower limit of Mrock = 3 Me for the rocky mass of <b>depleted</b> <b>material,</b> which is compatible with a rough estimation of 3 - 50 Me of a debris disk mass around a solar-type star (Krivov et al. 2008).

40|$|We report new Hf isotopic {{data for}} basaltic glasses from seamounts {{flanking}} the East Pacific Rise (EPR) between 5 ° and 15 °N {{that have been}} previously analyzed for Sr–Nd–Pb isotopes as well as major and trace elements. The Hf isotopic data offer new perspectives on the petrogenesis of these samples in a broader context on mantle dynamics. The Hf isotope compositions show significant correlations with Sr–Nd–Pb isotopes and with both abundances and ratios of incompatible elements. The seamount lavas are thus best interpreted as products of melting-induced mixing in a two-component mantle. The range in composition of EPR seamount lavas cannot be generated by simple mixing of melt and melting of variably heterogeneous mantle in which enriched and <b>depleted</b> <b>materials</b> contribute equally to melting (source mixing). Instead, the trace element and isotope compositions of seamount lavas can be reproduced by melting models in which more enriched, fertile mantle component are preferentially melted during mantle upwelling. At progressively lower degrees of melting, erupted lavas are thus more enriched in incompatible trace elements, have higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios and lower 143 Nd/ 144 Nd, 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios. The “EM 1 ” and “pyroxenite” endmember might be the suitable enriched component. The Hf–Nd isotopic variations on global scale might result from the variations in amounts of residual continental lithospheric mantle that detached into upper mantle during continental rifting. The significant correlations of Rb/Sr vs 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, Sm/Nd vs 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and Lu/Hf vs 176 Hf/ 177 Hf give pseudochron ages of 182 ± 33 Ma, 276 ± 50 Ma and 387 ± 93 Ma, respectively. These different “ages” have no significance, but result from melting-induced mixing with the pseudochron slopes controlled by the compositions of enriched component and depleted end-membe...|$|R
