It starts moving along {{one of the six}} gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a new point.

If the worm has not encountered this exact distribution before it may leave along any untraversed <b>gridline.</b> From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it must move in the same way. If there are no untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends.|$|E

Adaptive <b>gridlines</b> are particularly useful for drawing {{the attention of}} users who are not trained graphic designers to the alignment in their designs. 1. Introduction Graphic design is becoming an increasingly common day-to-day task. Word processor users designing documents, systems analysts designing software diagrams, and software developers designing user interfaces are routinely required to produce graphic designs, but are almost uniformly without specialised training. In this paper we describe adaptive <b>gridlines,</b> a novel technique for visualising rectilinear alignment, {{one of the most}} important aspects of graphic design [8]. Graphic designers are trained to "see" the alignments in their designs, and so graphic design texts make alignment explicit. For example, Figure 1. Visualising Alignment in GUI Design alignment lines are often drawn on illustrations, and novice designers a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Perturbation is an {{operation}} defined on the simplex {{and can be}} used for centering compositional data in a ternary diagram, applying objective criteria. Because a straight line in the original diagram is still a straight line in the perturbed diagram, <b>gridlines</b> or compositional fields defined by straight lines can easily be included in the operation. Simultaneous perturbation of data, <b>gridlines,</b> and/or compositional fields is shown to improve both visualization and graphical interpretation of compositions in ternary diagrams. This is illustrated by some examples using simulated as well as real data. KEY WORDS: compositional fields, geometric mean, metric center, rescaling...|$|R
