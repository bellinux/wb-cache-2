25|$|A {{symmetric}} balanced <b>incomplete</b> <b>block</b> {{design or}} SBIBD is a BIBD in which v = b (the {{number of points}} equals the number of blocks). They are {{the single most important}} and well studied subclass of BIBDs. Projective planes, biplanes and Hadamard 2-designs are all SBIBDs. They are of particular interest since they are the extremal examples of Fisher's inequality (b ≥ v).|$|E

40|$|AbstractLiking {{studies are}} {{designed}} to ascertain consumers likes and dislikes {{on a variety of}} products. However, it can be undesirable to construct liking studies where each panelist evaluates every target product. In such cases, an incomplete-block design, where each panelist evaluates only a subset of the target products, can be used. These <b>incomplete</b> <b>blocks</b> are often balanced, so that all pairs occur the same number of times. While desirable in many situations, balanced <b>incomplete</b> <b>blocks</b> have the disadvantage that, by their nature, they cannot favor placing dissimilar products next to one another. A novel incomplete-block design is introduced that utilizes the target product’s sensory profile to allocate products to each panelist so that they are, in general, as dissimilar as possible while also ensuring position balance. The resulting design is called a sensory informed design (SID). Herein, details on the formulation of SIDs are given. Data arising from these SIDs are analyzed using a simultaneous clustering and imputation approach, and the results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{external}} Cd++ and Hg++ {{on the early}} outward current (IEO) in myocardial mouse cells were studied using voltage clamp with one suction pipette. Both Cd++ in the millimolar and Hg++ in the micromolar range shifted the half time to peak IEO to positive potentials more than the current amplitude after 50 ms. <b>Incomplete</b> <b>blocking</b> of IEO could be obtained by Cd++ concentrations between 10 (- 3) and 2 x 10 (- 2) mol/l and by Hg++ concentrations between 10 (- 6) and 5 x 10 (- 5) mol/l. The current-voltage relationships of IEO at peak time and at 50 ms were mainly shifted to the right by Cd++ whereas Hg++ mainly decreased the slope. At <b>incomplete</b> <b>blocking</b> concentrations Cd++ slowed down IEO activation more strongly than did Hg++. All Cd++ effects were completely reversible. The action of Hg++ was irreversible. It is concluded that both ions act directly on the gating machinery of the channels rather than simply binding to homogenous surface charges. status: publishe...|$|R
