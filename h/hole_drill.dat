40|$|Drilling is a {{standard}} process for producing holes in metal materials. With an increased hole depth the demands increase on both machine and tool. Deep hole drilling is a complex process which ischaracterized by a high metal removal rate and hole accuracy. A hole deeper than ten times the diameter {{can be considered a}} deep hole which requires a specialized drilling technique. During adeep hole drilling process, the forces generated on the deep <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> give a rise to a resultant radial force. The resultant radial force pushes the drill in a radial direction during a drilling operation. The radial force direction is of crucial importance in regard of tool guidance, stability and hole size accuracy. This force affects tool performance, reduces tool life and has an impact on the bore surface. Due to the complex nature of deep hole drilling, Sandvik Coromant wishes to get {{a better understanding of how}} their current deep hole drilling tools are balanced. The purpose of this study is to conduct a survey of a number of drills of Sandvik Coromant deep <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> assortment. The main aim of this study is to calculate and measure the resultant radial force generated during a deep hole drilling operation. The forces are calculated with the aid of a calculation program and test-runs on a number of drills. This report presents the calculated magnitude and direction of the resultant radial force duringentrance, full intersection and at the exit of the workpiece. In addition to the measured values of theresultant radial force during entry and full intersection. Four different drill geometries are evaluated which of two are competitor drills. A deep <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> geometry is re-modified in aspect to drill stability based on the outcome of the measured and calculated results. The results acquired from the performed calculation and measurements of the resultant showed that the resultant radial force acts in an angular direction that was outside the range between the support pads. This true for three of the four evaluated drill geometries. There were minor differences between the measured and calculated forces which enforce the reliability of the used calculation program. The modified drill geometry of a deep <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> gave an indication of which geometry variables have impact on the resultant radial force magnitude and angular direction. The data presented in this report can be a base for future development of a deep <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> toolgeometry in regard to the resultant radial force.

40|$|Combining several {{different}} investigation methods within one project {{is something that}} is done on a daily basis. This master thesis analyses results from a project where methods that are relatively unusually within the geotechnical society are combined. The sounding program was also almost entirely executed on water. In the thesis geotechnical investigations performed by Vectura Consulting for the City Link project are evaluated. The City Link project is a TBM driven tunnel under the city of Stockholm, and the investigations was performed on the behalf of “Svenska kraftnät”. The thesis is performed on behalf of Vectura in Sundsvall where Per Nilsson has driven the issues which are the subject of this thesis. The methods used in the project has been soil-rock sounding, reflection- and refraction seismic, MWD-guided down the <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> (DTH) and core drilling sampling. Every sounding except the core drilling sampling has been conducted on water. The core drilling sampling has in this thesis been infringed for the other methods. Complications and solutions regarding the performed sounding on water were found during the project, which resulted in a list of recommendations for performing sounding on water. Soil-rock sounding has been linked to the performed refraction seismic to investigate whether the seismic inferred rock quality could be shown in the soil-rock sounding. The analysis shows that it strongly tends to be possible, although more studies have to be done to confirm this theory. The study also shows the importance of having a seismic survey within a large scale geotechnical investigation where the bedrock level is of interest. MWD-guided down the <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> is, within the geotechnical society, an uncommon method for rock-sounding. In this project the DTH were carried out on the sounding points where soil-rock sounding was estimated not to be possible to use, because of too large sounding depths. The aim of the investigations where to find the bedrock surface, which it also did. Further analysis also indicates that the rock quality in relation to all executed DTH soundings within the project could be distinguished. For both soil-rock sounding and DTH the method to integrate the sink rate and to form an index has given a simpler graphical interpretation of the soundings. The index which is formed by the driving force and the sink rate has also, and can be used to interpret the rock quality. The study also showed some significance regarding the weight of the sounding rods, especially for rock-soil sounding. Validerat; 20130609 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} assess the whole-body {{vibration}} (WBV) exposure among large blast <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> machine operators {{with regard to the}} International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recommended threshold values and its association with machine- and rock-related factors and workers' individual characteristics. Methods: The study population included 28 drill machine operators who had worked in four opencast iron ore mines in eastern India. The study protocol comprised the following: measurements of WBV exposure [frequency weighted root mean square (RMS) acceleration (m/s 2) ], machine-related data (manufacturer of machine, age of machine, seat height, thickness, and rest height) collected from mine management offices, measurements of rock hardness, uniaxial compressive strength and density, and workers' characteristics via face-to-face interviews. Results: More than 90 % of the operators were exposed to a higher level WBV than the ISO upper limit and only 3. 6 % between the lower and upper limits, mainly in the vertical axis. Bivariate correlations revealed that potential predictors of total WBV exposure were: machine manufacturer (r =  0. 453, p =  0. 015), age of drill (r =  0. 533, p =  0. 003), and hardness of rock (r =  0. 561, p =  0. 002). The stepwise multiple regression model revealed that the potential predictors are age of operator (regression coefficient β = − 0. 052, standard error SE =  0. 023), manufacturer (β =  1. 093, SE =  0. 227), rock hardness (β =  0. 045, SE =  0. 018), uniaxial compressive strength (β =  0. 027, SE =  0. 009), and density (β = – 1. 135, SE =  0. 235).

40|$|We {{present a}} thermo-rheological {{study of the}} Adriatic crust in the central Po plain (Northern Italy), which records the {{convergence}} of the Alpine and Apennine external fronts. The present thermal regime of the crust is inferred from geological and geophysical data from oil exploration. A set of temperature data from 37 deep bore- holes (bottom <b>hole,</b> <b>drill</b> stem, and production test temperatures) is used to estimate undisturbed formation temperatures down to 6 - 7 km of depth. Best quality data are used to estimate upper crustal geo- therms, which are subdivided into four groups taking into considera- tions the following factors: i) presence/absence of relevant fluid cir- culation; ii) conductive thermal refraction; iii) recent sedimentation, and iv) other disturbing tectonothermal processes (e. g., recent tectonics). Assuming average corrections for temperature data affected by recent sedimentation effects, geotherms fall within the same range and provide a homogeneous thermal signal. Tempera- ture measurements in the upper ~ 7 km are used to constrain a 1 -D thermal model at the crustal scale. The best fitting geotherm gives a thermal gradient of ~ 23 ± 5 mK m- 1 (over 7 km of depth), a surface heat flow of ~ 46 ± 9 mW m- 2, and an estimated Moho temperature of 620 ± 80 °C. Using the estimated crustal structure and composition and the best-fitting geotherm, a representative strength envelope is obtained. For hydrostatic and supra-hydrostatic pore pressures, the calculated total crustal strength of this sector of the Adria microplate (not including the upper mantle contribution) is in the 1. 8 - 2. 5 TN m- 1 range.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. In {{order to}} develop {{surfaces}} that have the proper curvature for aerospace structures, it is sometimes necessary to use shot peen forming, also known as contour forming, to create the desired shape {{in a piece of}} metal. Since the preferred metal in aerospace continues to be aluminum and its alloys, this study will concentrate on the effects of shot peening on aluminum. Typically, shot intensity is measured using standard Almen strips made from cold rolled SAE 1070 spring steel. Since the effects of the shot on aluminum is the chief concern of this study, aluminum strips of the same size and thickness will be used to determine the intensity of the shot on aluminum parts. These strips will be exposed for different amounts of time to different intensities, measured using the steel Almen strips, and then the intensity (or arc height) will be measured on the aluminum strips. The residual stresses in these strips will then be measured using the <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> method (ASTM E 837). The stresses from the residual stress test will then be used to develop a finite element model that simulates the aluminum strips and the deformation in them. The model will then be calibrated with the empirical data. From there, it will be the goal of this study to be able to predict the deformation of aluminum parts when exposed to certain shot peen intensities. This will enable more efficient contour forming processes with less rework. Furthermore, the trial and error of a manual process can be avoided with the use of robotics. Robotics/Automation can also help in creating more consistent results...|$|E
30|$|In 1999, Gruenhagen {{invented the}} use of mud as a medium that {{will be sent to}} the {{underground}} command, to complete the pressure pulse modulation in the ground, the pressure pulse in the underground by the pressure or flow sensor sensitive, by the microprocessor decoding and the command sent to the controller [3]. During drilling, a constant flow rate of mud is pumped from the mud pool with a main pump. Most of the mud into the mine, to maintain the mud circulation, bypass valve equipment controlled by the electronic controller. When the valve was opened and closed, a flow pulse was generated. The amplitude and time of such a pulse could be controlled. The speed of these pulses can be detected by suitable underground equipment, such as flow meters, pressure gauges, and turbines. Data transmission is based on binary modulation pulse. In 2005, Halliburton, as the representative of the downlink channel remote transmission system invented by Finke et al., provides improved equipment and method for remote command transmission. By the pressure pulse from the ground equipment, it sent instructions to the bottom hole assembly [4]. The utility model is composed of a ground transmitter which generates a pressure pulse signal, a control system, and an underground receiver which is used for receiving and decoding the pulse signal. When the bypass valve was opened and closed at work, a series of pressure pulse signals which could be received and decoded by the underground receiver could be generated. This method reduced the time spent in the downlink channel transmission without interrupting the drilling. If the upward and downward channel signals were transmitted at different frequencies, the bidirectional transmission could be realized. The remote transmission scheme and software program provided an innovative method for the filtering and decoding of downlink channel signals. The software program determined the time interval between the peak values of the pulse and decoded them into commands. The software program also included an error check that was completely received. The utility model was characterized in that the utility model related to a pressure pulse which was generated by the ground equipment to transmit the instruction to the down <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> assembly without interrupting the drilling. The pressure pulse signal was detected using a down hole receiver, and the pressure pulse signal was decoded by a software program. It could also achieve a two-way communication between the ground equipment and the bottom hole assembly at a relatively fast transfer rate; so, this method was particularly practical.|$|E
40|$|The Galileo Europa {{data set}} served to {{revolutionize}} {{our view of}} Europa. In particular the strong evidence of a large, cold, salty Ocean beneath 5 - 30 km of ice has profoundly altered the significance of Europa in our thinking, especially of context of habitability in the solar system. While {{much remains to be}} learned from spacecraft observations of several sorts, there are significant questions answerable only by in-situ techniques; these relate to the formation of Europa, the nature of its ocean, and the prospects for life in its ocean, sediments, and ice. We feel that wide-ranging discussion of an in-situ subsurface mission to Europa, as part of JIMO, should proceed. The science objective of the mission is to characterize the icy shell of Europa to resolve its provenance, estimate the composition of brine of the Europa ocean, and search for evidence of Earth-like life. Probably anyone would agree that an in-situ mission to Europa would be of great value, but he or she would also immediately take the position that such a mission is utterly impractical. We take the position here of defining the least complex mission that can nonetheless justify its cost and to argue that such a mission is realistic enough that it should be seriously considered. Our mission thinking has been: 1) Soft landing. A soft lander is required on a site sufficiently flat to offer a stable platform; no further site selectivity is required. 2) Subsurface exploration. The Europa subsurface must be examined. Surficial processes on Europa arguably have exposed the upper 200 m of shell to chemical effects from the Jovian radiation belts as well as cometary infall, etc; to examine native ice we must descend below that point to, for discussion, 300 m. At that depth we argue that the ice is characteristic of ice at depth and possibly is effectively sea ice. 3) Science data. A few simple measurements at various depths and at 300 m constitute a scientifically successful mission. Measurements would include analysis of meltwater for a few inorganic ions and amino acids and an optical examination of the borehole wall. 4) Communication. Transmission of data to an orbiter is essential, but we will constrain the landed mission to a daily communication over a few days. 5) Subsurface access. Drilling to 300 m is a significant challenge; it can be addressed by several means: Thermal Probe (Cryobot) which permits water to refreeze above the vehicle. This is our tentative choice with plutonium as the fuel to generate thermal energy for drilling and electrical power for operations. Open <b>Hole</b> <b>Drill,</b> a thermal system in which the meltwater is removed for greater thermal efficiency. Meltwater removal on Europa is both a complexity and a risk, but analysis is improved. Mechanical Drilling in which cutting or grinding generates ice chips which are removed. This is too complex at Europa temperatures. The measurement objectives for the mission will be: Obj. 1 : Determine the concentration of simple inorganic salts in the Europa Ice Shell and, by extrapolation, of the ocean. These data will also validate spaceborne sensors. Obj. 2 : Determine the nature and abundance of amino acids in the ice such that cometary infall material in the upper ice can be compared to material at depth. Obj. 3 : Optically examine the ice to resolve inclusion structure, particulate content, and stratification. Access to 300 m depth is a significant if not audacious plan; we are aware that this has not been done on any planetary body. Our approach is the use of a plutonium heat source; to overcome Europa's surface temperature and to melt ice a significant amount of plutonium is needed, and significant shielding and other protective steps will be required. The quantity of plutonium is a key concern. The mission will require subsurface collection and processing of samples for in situ analysis, calling for a miniature, high pressure micro-sampling system designed to meet needs of instruments that require low presses for operation. The inlet system itself collects a micro-sample in the external high pressure environment, then transfers it into a protected low pressure environment for analysis...|$|E
