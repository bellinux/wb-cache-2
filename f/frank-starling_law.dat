50|$|The {{heart of}} a person with heart failure may have a reduced force of {{contraction}} due to overloading of the ventricle. In a healthy heart, increased filling of the ventricle results in increased contraction force (by the <b>Frank-Starling</b> <b>law</b> of the heart) and thus a rise in cardiac output.

This is in accordance with the <b>Frank-Starling</b> <b>law</b> of the heart, which explains that as the ventricles fill with larger volumes of blood, they stretch further, and their contractile force increases, thus causing a related increase in systolic blood pressure.|$|E

50|$|As a {{mathematical}} term, ejection fraction {{is an extension}} of well documented work by Adolph Fick entitled cardiac output. Fick's theory gradually merged to fit the precision of wall motion mathematics first defined by Laplace. This led to the application of compliance or delta V (volume)/ delta P (pressure) to the required mathematics. Myocardial compliance represents a variable ratio between pressure and volume. Applied to the heart, this appreciation led to further progress represented by length-tension constructs I.e. the <b>Frank-Starling</b> <b>law</b> of the heart. Youngs' Modulus lent itself to elasticity, another important ratio of stress and strain. The gathered mathematics eventually birthed medical imaging, gradually followed by cardiac imaging.|$|E

Healthy patients should be able to compensate for lower volumes to some extent, but patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease limiting myocardial function (such as angina pectoris) may not.

Due to the <b>Frank-Starling</b> <b>law</b> of the heart, the contraction of the left ventricle (and pressure generated by the left ventricle) will be greater on the subsequent beat (beat #4 in this picture). Because of the dynamic nature of the outflow obstruction in HCM, the obstruction increases more than the left ventricular pressure increase. This causes a fall in the aortic pressure as the left ventricular pressure rises (seen as the yellow shaded area in the picture).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Frank-Starling</b> <b>law</b> of {{the heart}} (also known as Starling's law and the Frank-Starling mechanism) {{represents}} the relationship between stroke volume and end diastolic volume. The law states that the stroke volume {{of the heart}} increases {{in response to an}} increase in the volume of blood in the ventricles, before contraction (the end diastolic volume), when all other factors remain constant. As a larger volume of blood flows into the ventricle, the blood stretches the cardiac muscle fibers, leading to an increase in the force of contraction. The Frank-Starling mechanism allows the cardiac output to be synchronized with the venous return, arterial blood supply and humoral length, without depending upon external regulation to make alterations. The physiological importance of the mechanism lies mainly in maintaining left and right ventricular output equality.|$|E
50|$|The {{physiological}} discovery {{most often}} associated with Starling is the Law of the Heart.

For this work he made use of the anesthetized dog, in an experimental arrangement known as the heart-lung preparation. This {{played an important role in}} subsequent experiments, when he was not primarily interested in blood flow. Starling was unaware of previous work by a German physiologist, Otto Frank, using the isolated frog heart. Frank showed that the longer the heart-muscle fibers were stretched the stronger the contraction. He did this with no interest in the circulation as a whole, so his finding have to be taken in parallel with Starling's, so it became the <b>Frank-Starling</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

50|$|The blood {{composition}} of the species Octopus vulgaris differs from humans in two main ways: the binding agent is not iron that is found in hemoglobin, but copper found in hemocyanin which is not found within the blood cells as hemoglobin is, but within the blood's plasma. Since the binding agent is found within the plasma and not the blood cells {{there is a limit}} to the oxygen up take that the octopus can experience. If it were to increase the hemocyanin within its blood stream, the fluid would become too viscous for the myogenic hearts to pump. Poiseuille's Law explains the rate of flow of the bulk fluid throughout the entire circulatory system through the differences of blood pressure and vascular resistance. The three hearts are also temperature and oxygen depended and the beat rhythm of the three hearts are generally in phase with the two branchial hearts beating together followed by the systemic heart. The <b>Frank-Starling</b> <b>Law</b> also contributes to overall heart function, through contractility and stroke volume, since the total volume of blood vessels must be maintained, and must be kept relatively constant within the system for the heart to function properly.|$|E

Frank also undertook important work into the physiological basis of the arterial pulse waveform and may have coined the term essential hypertension in 1911. His work on the Windkessel extended the original ideas of Stephen Hales and provided a sound mathematical framework for this approach. Frank also published on waves in the arterial system but his attempts to produce a theory that incorporated waves and the Windkessel are not considered to have been successful.

40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The heart has an intrinsic ability to increase systolic force {{in response to}} a rise in ventricular filling (the <b>Frank–Starling</b> <b>law</b> of the heart). It is widely accepted that the length dependence of myocardial activation underlies the <b>Frank–Starling</b> <b>law</b> of the heart. Recent advances in muscle physiology have enabled the identification of the factors involved in length-dependent activation, viz., titin (connectin) -based interfilament lattice spacing reduction and thin filament ‘‘on–off’ ’ regulation, with the former triggering length-dependent activation and the latter determining the number of myosin molecules recruited to thin filaments. Patients with a failing heart have demon-strated reduced exercise tolerance at least in part via depression of the Frank–Starling mechanism. Recent studies revealed that various mutations occur in the thin filament regulatory proteins, such as troponin, in the ven-tricular muscle of failing hearts, which consequently alter the Frank–Starling mechanism.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>Frank-Starling</b> <b>law</b> is an {{important}} regulatory mechanism of the heart that links the end-diastolic volume with the systolic ejection fraction. This beat-to-beat regulation of the heart, underlined at the cellular level by higher myofilament calcium sensitivity at longer sarcomere length, is known as length-dependent activation or stretch sensitization of activation. However, the heart is structurally and functionally heterogeneous and asymmetrical. Specifically, contractile properties are not uniform within the left ventricle partly due to transmural differences in action potential waveforms and calcium homeostasis. The present review {{will focus on the}} role of the contractile machinery in the transmural contractile heterogeneity and its adaptation to changes in muscle strain. The expression of different myosin isoforms, the level of titin-based passive tension, and thin and thick sarcomeric regulatory proteins are considered to explain the regional cellular contractile properties. Finally, the importance of transmural heterogeneity of length-dependent activation and the consequences of its modification on the heart mechanics are discussed.
