40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Experiments were {{conducted}} under controlled environments {{to investigate the}} influence of nutrient supply and panicle removal on tiller and panicle production in orchardgrass. Propagules of two clones, MID- 5 (Clone 0), from the synthetic variety Pennlate, and Clone B, a locally adapted clone, were utilized for these studies. Tiller production was decreased when nitrogen or phosphorus deficient nutrient solutions were applied <b>during</b> <b>the</b> inductive and initiation period. Tiller production was primarily dependent on <b>the</b> nitrogen supply <b>during</b> <b>the</b> initiation <b>period</b> and, to a lesser extent, on <b>the</b> nitrogen level <b>during</b> <b>the</b> inductive <b>period.</b> Phosphorus supply appeared {{to be more important}} to tiller production <b>during</b> <b>the</b> inductive <b>period</b> than <b>the</b> initiation <b>period.</b> Potassium deficient nutrient solution did not appear to decrease tiller production <b>during</b> <b>the</b> inductive <b>period,</b> but reduced tiller production <b>during</b> <b>the</b> subsequent initiation <b>period.</b> <b>The</b> potassium level in the plant appeared to be sufficiently high to maintain vigorous growth <b>during</b> <b>the</b> inductive <b>period.</b> When nutrient solutions deficient in nitrogen or phosphorus were applied <b>during</b> <b>the</b> inductive <b>period,</b> none of <b>the</b> plants flowered unless high levels of the nutrients were supplied <b>during</b> <b>the</b> initiation <b>period.</b> When <b>the</b> nitrogen or phosphorus supply was high <b>during</b> <b>the</b> inductive <b>period,</b> deficiencies <b>during</b> <b>the</b> initiation <b>period</b> did not influence the number of panicles. Potassium supply <b>during</b> <b>the</b> inductive <b>period</b> did not significantly influence the number of panicles produced, but low potassium <b>during</b> <b>the</b> initiation <b>period</b> appeared to reduce panicle production. When plants were grown under low light energy <b>during</b> <b>the</b> initiation <b>period,</b> only tillers that had emerged <b>during</b> <b>the</b> inductive <b>period</b> became reproductive. When <b>the</b> light energy <b>during</b> <b>the</b> initiation <b>period</b> was high, over 85 percent of the panicles were produced from tillers that emerged <b>during</b> <b>the</b> initiation <b>period.</b> Tiller production in orchardgrass <b>during</b> <b>the</b> initiation <b>period</b> appeared to be a cyclic phenomenon with a lower percentage of tillers becoming reproductive with each cycle. When the panicles were removed, more tillers became reproductive after the first cycle compared to plants in which the panicles were not removed. Tiller production in the second cycle was greatest if the panicles were removed. Panicle removal did not increase dry matter production of the plants...|$|R

In this study, we aimed to reveal the developmental process of sand bars by observations, which are velocity observation, water level observation, bed material investigation and video monitoring. Followings were major accomplishments of this study. (1) The maximum magnitude of reverse velocity at St. 400 in <b>the</b> entrance channel <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>periods</b> of flood-tide was faster than that of normal velocity <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>periods</b> of ebb-tide.
