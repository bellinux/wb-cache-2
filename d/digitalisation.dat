500|$|With an {{estimated}} <b>digitalisation</b> budget of 75million (valued at about US$1.7 million in 2010), Mayabazar {{was released in}} colour on 30 January 2010 in 45 Andhra Pradesh theatres. The colourised version was distributed by R. B. Choudary under his production banner, Super Good Films. Nageswara Rao, Gummadi Venkateswara Rao, Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy and Sita were the only cast members still alive {{for the release of}} the digitally remastered version. The colour version received positive reviews and was commercially successful. M.L. Narasimham of The Hindu called the new version [...] "laudable, but the soul was missing", adding, [...] "Get a DVD of the original (Black & White) movie, watch it and you will agree with ANR [...] who while talking about Mayabazar once exclaimed, 'What a picture it was!'".|$|E
2500|$|Above all, Birt is {{credited}} with preparing the organisation for the new landscape shaped by <b>digitalisation</b> – preparations that were “far {{in advance of the}} BBC’s terrestrial rivals”, according to the academic Georgina Born. At the 1996 Edinburgh Television Festival, Birt said that without the resources to prepare for the digital age, the BBC would be [...] "history". [...] Birt asserted that the changes made the BBC more agile, more competitive and allowed it to expand beyond its traditional broadcasting services, but remaining licence-fee funded. He was one of the driving forces behind the launch of continuous news output and he took much money from traditional services to fund the 24-hour news channel and advance on the internet. However, such ventures were criticised by many as being clearly detrimental to BBC core programming.|$|E
2500|$|Some authors, like Yochai Benkler, {{say that}} {{with the rise of}} the Internet and <b>digitalisation,</b> an {{economics}} system based on commons becomes possible again. He wrote in his book The Wealth of Networks in 2006 that cheap computing power plus networks enable people to produce valuable products through non-commercial processes of interaction: [...] "as human beings and as social beings, rather than as market actors through the price system". He uses the term 'networked information economy' to describe a [...] "system of production, distribution, and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed, nonmarket means that do not depend on market strategies." [...] He also coined the term 'commons-based peer production' to describe collaborative efforts based on sharing information. Examples of commons-based peer production are free and open source software and open-source hardware.|$|E
