500|$|Despite the self-imposed {{restrictions}} of secrecy {{placed on the}} small circle inside Gruner + Jahr, Heidemann could not resist showing one of the volumes to Mohnke, as the entry referred to the SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, Mohnke's former regiment. Heidemann read out three entries from the diaries—from 15, 17 and 18 March—which concerned visits made by Hitler to the regiment while in the Lichterfelde and Friesenstraße barracks. Mohnke informed him that the entries were inaccurate, saying that the Lichterfelde barracks were not occupied by the troops on that date, that the regimental name used in the diary was introduced much later, and that so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> Hitler never visited the Friesenstraße barracks. Heidemann was unmoved by his friend's revelations, and posited that Hitler had probably written what {{he was planning to}} do, not what he had done. Harris suggests that this showed that the journalist [...] "had long ceased operating on a rational wavelength about the diaries".|$|E
500|$|As Companies D and E {{moved in}} C's direction, both {{encountered}} large concentrations of Shōji's soldiers and, by 12:30, {{were involved in}} intense firefights. At 15:00, Company D commander Captain Charles McAuliffe—with nine of his men—unexpectedly marched into the Binu base camp. McAuliffe reported to Carlson that soon after he had made contact with the Japanese forces, he {{and one of his}} squads had become cut {{off from the rest of}} his company. After extricating themselves with difficulty, McAuliffe and the men with him had decided to retreat back to the base camp. McAuliffe reported that, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew,</b> the rest of his company had been annihilated. A short time later, however, the rest of D Company arrived at the base camp, led by Gunnery Sergeant George Schrier, after successfully disengaging from the firefight. Carlson summarily relieved McAuliffe for what he later described as [...] "total ineptitude for leadership in battle" [...] and placed Captain Joe Griffith in command of Company D.|$|E

What was their authority to tax and how much money did the state contribute to them? In his native Virginia, Justice Lewis Powell noted, school board members were [...] "constitutional officers."

The repayments must have taken place outside the period of review." [...] Van Zyl produced a written revolving credit agreement between Shaik and Zuma of which, he said, Parliament was informed.

2500|$|While {{performing}} at the Montreal Just for Laughs festival in 2008, Burnham met with director and producer Judd Apatow. That September, Burnham negotiated with Universal Pictures {{to write and}} create the music for an Apatow-produced comedy film which he describes as the [...] "anti-High School Musical", although Burnham insists the script is not a parody of the Disney musicals, but an attempt to emulate the high school he attended. Hoping to star in the film he was writing, Burnham told Wired magazine that he named the star [...] "Bo" [...] in a [...] "not-so-subtle hint [...] {{want to be in}} it". In a March 2009 interview with Boston's Weekly Dig, Burnham elaborated on his work with the film. When he is not performing, Burnham spends eight hours a day writing the music, and his nights writing the script, of which he has finished the first draft. Co-writing the screenplay with Burnham was his high school friend Luke Liacos. [...] In an October 2010 interview with MTV, Burnham admitted {{that he did not know}} anything about the future of the project, and that it was all effectively up in the air as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew.</b>|$|E

When Shum was hired, he had been through the {{audition}} process, but as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> [...] "it {{was just like a}} regular acting gig where you go on for a day." [...] In an interview with the New York Post, he elaborated, [...] "I got hired as a day player and it turned into a week, and then a month and so on. I was just rolling with it—I mean, who would say no to that?" [...] Mike performed in the glee club's production numbers, but was given very little dialogue, staying mostly [...] "in the background, doing some facial expressions." [...] Shum noted, [...] "It wasn’t until I came on the [...] tour and had this crazy reaction from the audience, and the producers were like, 'Wow, how do they know him? Mike is a senior in the third season of the show. Glee co-creator Ryan Murphy has stated that, due to graduation, [...] "more characters are leaving than are staying" [...] {{at the end of the}} season. Mike's parents are dealing with his college plans and appear on the show in [...] "Asian F" [...] to this end, and may be recurring characters.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, {{common law}} used {{to allow a}} claim from anybody who had money, but had lost it or had been {{deprived}} of it, from {{a person who had}} received the money without payment, as of right. This action for [...] "money had and received" [...] was, however, limited to money, and was said to be limited to money in physical form. In equity, an action could be brought for return of any property that could be traced, but the courts said liability was limited to people who in some sense had [...] "knowledge" [...] of a breach of trust. In 2001, the Court of Appeal in Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele stated that the touchstone of liability is that a defendant acted [...] "unconscionably". In that case, Akindele, a Nigerian businessman, was sued by the liquidators of the disgraced and insolvent bank, BCCI to return over $6.6m. Akindele said he received this payment, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew,</b> as part of a legitimate fixed return deal, when in fact BCCI was engaging in a fraudulent scheme to buy its own shares, and thus inflate its share price. Nourse LJ held that on these facts, Akindele had done nothing [...] "unconscionable" [...] and was not liable to return the money. In other cases, however, it is apparent that the standard has been less lenient, and set at negligence. In 1980 in Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd Goff LJ held that if one [...] "ought to know, that it was a breach of trust" [...] when property is received then liability will follow. Accordingly, different courts have differed on the requisite threshold of liability. Some have thought liability for receipt should be limited to [...] "wilfully and recklessly failing to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make", while others have favoured a simple negligence standard, when a breach of trust would have been obvious to an honest, reasonable person. The latter view is consistent with an unjust enrichment analysis, favoured by the late Peter Birks and Lord Nicholls in extrajudicial writing. This favours strict liability upon receipt of any property, unless it is paid for. If the recipient is not a bona fide purchaser, they must make restitution of the property to the former owner to avoid unjust enrichment. This was an approach adopted by the House of Lords in Re Diplock. However, unlike Re Diplock the modern unjust enrichment analysis would allow a defence, if the recipient had changed her position, for instance by spending money that would not otherwise have been spent, a defence recognised in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale. This approach ends by suggesting that even if the property is paid for, yet the recipient ought to have known that it came from a breach of trust, they will be deemed to have committed an equitable wrong (i.e. like a tort) and must restore the property to the previous owner anyway. It {{remains to be seen whether}} equity's understanding of conscience will align with the standard test for the duty of care in tort.|$|E
