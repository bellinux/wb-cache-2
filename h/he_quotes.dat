5|$|In a {{footnote}} to Chapter XIII, Poe {{refers to the}} Polly, a wreck which drifted for six months across the Atlantic Ocean in 1811-1812. Poe probably read this history in an 1836 book by R. Thomas, Remarkable Events and Remarkable Shipwrecks, from which <b>he</b> <b>quotes</b> verbatim.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} option, <b>he</b> <b>quotes</b> Panyasis, who states that King Theias of Assyria had a {{daughter}} called Smyrna. Smyrna failed to honor Aphrodite, incurring {{the wrath of the}} goddess, by whom was made {{to fall in love with}} her father; and with the aid of her nurse she deceived him for twelve nights until her identity was discovered. Smyrna fled, but her father later caught up with her. Smyrna then prayed that the gods would make her invisible, prompting them to turn her into a tree, which was named the Smyrna. Ten months later the tree cracked and Adonis was born from it.|$|E
5|$|Giraldus Cambrensis wrote a Life of St Æthelberht, {{probably}} at Hereford during the 1190s. <b>He</b> <b>quotes</b> an incident from Asser {{that occurred during}} the reign of Offa of Mercia, who died in 796. This incident is not in the surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work. It is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or even that Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a modern}} Platonist. <b>He</b> <b>quoted</b> Porphyry, Iamblicus, Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.|$|R
50|$|When US President Ronald Reagan visited Ireland in 1984, <b>he</b> <b>quoted</b> {{the first}} verse to rousing applause.|$|R
5|$|The white {{supremacist}} scientist Robert Wilson Shufeldt reviewed Animal Coloration in Science in 1892, praising it as a concise and useful {{summary of the}} subject. He admires Macmillan Publishers' handling of the book with its attractive wood-cuts and coloured lithographic plates. He is pleased to find many Americans in the index. <b>He</b> <b>quotes</b> Beddard's distinction between colour and coloration. He considers that the book brings readers fully up to date and even adds a few new ideas. He recommends the book to all working American naturalists.|$|E
5|$|Historian Tim Newark unraveled {{the myth}} {{in his book}} Mafia Allies. A version that is {{probably}} {{closer to the truth}} is that Vizzini simply led a delegation of locals to meet an Allied patrol whose commander had asked to speak to whoever was in charge. <b>He</b> <b>quotes</b> local historian, Luigi Lumia, who described how a procession of people with Calogero Vizzini at the helm made its way towards the tanks chanting: 'Long Live America', 'Long Live the Mafia', 'Long Live Don Calo'. Vizzini was taken to a command post outside Villalba and was interrogated about a recent firefight involving an American jeep on patrol. When Vizzini {{made it clear that the}} Italian soldiers had fled and the firefight had been caused by exploding ammunition, the frustrated US army official took his rage out in a stream of obscenities. Vizzini was utterly embarrassed by the incident and ordered his interpreter not to tell anybody what had happened.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release from Görlitz in May 1941, Messiaen was {{appointed}} a professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire, where he taught {{until his retirement in}} 1978. He compiled his Technique de mon langage musical ("Technique of my musical language") published in 1944, in which <b>he</b> <b>quotes</b> many examples from his music, particularly the Quartet. Although only in his mid-thirties, his students described him as an outstanding teacher. Among his early students were the composers Pierre Boulez and Karel Goeyvaerts. Other pupils included Karlheinz Stockhausen in 1952, Alexander Goehr in 1956–57, Tristan Murail in 1967–72 and George Benjamin during the late 1970s. The Greek composer Iannis Xenakis was referred to him in 1951; Messiaen urged Xenakis to take advantage of his background in mathematics and architecture in his music.|$|E
5000|$|Roberts {{loved the}} sea so, that <b>he's</b> <b>quoted</b> as saying [...] "..I'd {{go to sea}} in a bath tubwashing-tub".|$|R
50|$|The {{works of}} Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche had a {{profound}} effect on Campbell's thinking; <b>he</b> <b>quoted</b> their writing frequently.|$|R

25|$|In 2015 the TV show Backstrom, the {{character}} Sgt. Peter Niedermayer quotes religious {{figures in the}} show - <b>he</b> <b>quotes</b> Bahá'u'llah in the premiere episode at about 17:22-17:32 into the show.|$|E
25|$|The Baker Street Irregulars believe Sherlock Holmes's {{birthday}} to be January 6 {{due to the}} fact that Holmes quotes twice from Twelfth Night whereas <b>he</b> <b>quotes</b> only once from other Shakespeare plays.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>quotes</b> St. Ambrose: the Communion bread “is not a {{prize for}} the perfect but a {{powerful}} medicine and nourishment for the weak” (EG 47). Such talk led a few cardinals in the church to speak of an impending schism.|$|E
2500|$|Al-Utbi narrated {{from his}} father that when Muawiya was dying <b>he</b> <b>quoted</b> the {{following}} verses to those present (in at-Taweel poetry) ...|$|R
50|$|His Kavyanuprakasha {{follows the}} model of Kashmiri rhetorician Mammata's Kavya-prakasha. <b>He</b> <b>quoted</b> other {{scholars}} like Anandavardhana and Abhinavagupta in his works.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few other}} of Boccaccio's works by {{serendipity}} {{would have to}} have fallen into Chaucer's hands and <b>he</b> <b>quoted</b> from them.|$|R
25|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Stoltzer's early life, though he {{is thought to have}} come from the same family as Clemens Stoltzer, who was a town clerk in Schweidnitz, and to have been born in Schweidnitz, Silesia. Stoltzer may have studied with Heinrich Finck; while no {{concrete}} evidence of this association exists, he was at the least intimately familiar with Finck's work since <b>he</b> <b>quotes</b> from Finck's music copiously.|$|E
25|$|James Anderson {{had access}} to the Cooke {{manuscript}} when he produced his 1723 Constitutions. <b>He</b> <b>quotes</b> the final sixty lines in a footnote to his description of the York assembly. The Woodford manuscript, which is a copy of the Cooke, has a note explaining that it was made in 1728 by the Grand Secretary of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, William Reid, for William Cowper, Clerk of the Parliaments, who had also been Grand Secretary.|$|E
25|$|Poliakov {{writes that}} various {{examples}} of medieval Muslim literature portray Judaism as an exemplary pinnacle of faith, and Israel being destined by this virtue. <b>He</b> <b>quotes</b> stories from The Book of One Thousand and One Nights that portray Jews as pious, virtuous and devoted to God, {{and seem to}} borrow plots from midrashim. However, Poliakov writes that treatment of Jews in Muslim literature varies, and the tales are meant for pure entertainment, with no didactic aim.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the matter}} of student protests, <b>he</b> <b>quoted</b> William Allen White (a {{university}} alum), as {{he had in his}} earlier speech: ...|$|R
6000|$|There was a human-perfectibility man. <b>He</b> <b>quoted</b> Turgot, Price, Priestly, Condorcet, De Stael, and the [...] "Ambitious Student in Ill Health." ...|$|R

25|$|Wilson, whilst not {{providing}} references {{to his own}} research, reports that the Hearth Tax Returns for Whitefield in 1666 show that there were 135 hearths. Further, that the population numbered in 1714 a total of 740; that in 1789 it was 2,455; and in 1793 that it was 2,780. Some of the population statistics which <b>he</b> <b>quotes</b> subsequently in his book, and presumably based upon the Official Census returns since 1901, do on occasion differ very slightly from those quoted below.|$|E
25|$|He omitted, as Derosier {{pointed out}} in the Nova documentary, that Derosier wrote that {{bacterial}} flagellum looked like it was designed by a human. Derosier went on to add that in fact, the evidence pointed to evolution. That is not explicit in the article, but Derosier is known as an evolution proponent, so Behe should have known, since <b>he</b> <b>quotes</b> Derosier seemingly as in agreement, that Derosier disagreed with him regarding whether the bacterial flagellum points to evolution or Intelligent Design.|$|E
25|$|Oral {{tradition}} in Sierra Mojada, Coahuila, documented by a priest named James Lienert, states that Bierce was executed by firing squad {{in the town}} cemetery there. However, Nickell finds this story to be unreliable. <b>He</b> <b>quotes</b> Bierce's friend and biographer Walter Neale as saying that Bierce had not ridden for quite some time, was suffering from serious asthma, and had been severely critical of Pancho Villa. Neale concludes {{that it would have}} been highly unlikely for Bierce to have gone to Mexico and joined Villa.|$|E
25|$|This {{sculpture}} group comprises eight statues {{which represent}} {{the fields of}} human endeavor that shaped civilization, and was commissioned as a set by the Indiana State House Board of Commissions in June 1887. Alexander Doyle proposed to furnish eight statues in either plaster, for which <b>he</b> <b>quoted</b> a price of $5,000, or in marble, for which <b>he</b> <b>quoted</b> a price of $9,000. As he was based in New York at the time, all correspondence was addressed to him there.|$|R
50|$|His last {{publication}} was a booklet, Local Government Councillors: their Motives and Manners (1976), {{in which}} <b>he</b> <b>quoted</b> Charles Lamb and Samuel Johnson.|$|R
60|$|Mr Bickersdyke {{left the}} Navy, {{and went on}} to more general topics. But he was not interesting. <b>He</b> <b>quoted</b> figures, saw a moment later that <b>he</b> had not <b>quoted</b> them accurately, and instead of {{carrying}} on boldly, went back and corrected himself.|$|R
25|$|According to Gray, {{this plan}} was first put into action {{when he had}} a meeting with Vernon Walters, then deputy {{director}} of the CIA, in which <b>he</b> <b>quotes</b> Walters as falsely saying, “If the investigation gets pushed further south of the border… it could trespass onto some of our covert projects. Since you’ve got these five men under arrest, it will be best to taper the matter off here.” This conversation implicitly stated that the FBI should not interview Manuel Ogarrio and Kenneth Dahlberg, individuals connected with the money used to fund the Watergate burglars.|$|E
25|$|Hai ben Sherira's chief {{claim to}} {{recognition}} rests on his numerous responsa, {{in which he}} gives decisions affecting the social and religious life of the Diaspora. Questions reached him from Germany, France, Iberia, Anatolia, the Maghreb, and even India and Ethiopia. His responsa, more than eight hundred in number, deal with civil law, especially laws concerning women, with ritual, holidays, etc. Many of them contain explanations of certain halakhot, aggadot, and Talmudic matters. In halakhic decisions <b>he</b> <b>quotes</b> the Jerusalem Talmud, but without ascribing any authority to it. Many of his responsa may have been written in Arabic; {{only a few of}} them have been preserved.|$|E
25|$|The writer, {{it will be}} seen, makes free use of the New Testament. He {{seems to}} have used all the four Gospels, but that of which he makes most use is St. John's. <b>He</b> <b>quotes</b> from Paul's epistles to the Romans, Corinthians (both letters), Galatians, and Ephesians. There is a copious use also of the Old Testament; and besides we are told there is a use of the Gospel {{according}} to the Egyptians, and that of Thomas. But what most characterizes the document under consideration is the abundant use of pagan writings. For the author's method of exegesis enables him to find his system in Homer with as much ease as in the Bible.|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary {{critical}} {{reactions to}} Verdi's first effort were mixed, {{as noted by}} scholar Francis Toye, writing in 1931, when <b>he</b> <b>quoted</b> two Milanese critics: ...|$|R
