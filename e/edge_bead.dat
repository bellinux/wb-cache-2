40|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>bead</b> {{formation}} {{is a well-known}} phenomenon typically happening in the lamination due to the physics of this process. It causes the defect of high edge observed in the carton roll after the laminated carton sheets are wrapped around the roller in Company X; the affected carton sheets {{can no longer be}} fed into customers ' filling machines due to the uneven surface. To address this problem, a model with process parameters and quality characteristics was built to define the lamination. Based on this model, the capability of measurement system was verified and current process capability was calculated. After that, Shewhart control charts were employed to identify the assignable causes and to bring the process to in-control state. Then, a designed experiment was conducted to find the optimal operating conditions.

The thermal cycles used for simulation had peak temperatures of 1275 °C, 930 °C, 7650 C and 6500 C and corresponded to those experienced in the parent material during the submerged arc welding of 1. 5 in. thick plate using a nominal heat input of 54 kJ. in and a preheat temperature of 120 °C. Double cycling utilized specific combinations of these thermal cycles. Half {{the total number of}} simulated specimens received post cycle heat treatment at 650 °C. Charpy V-notch impact transition curves and tensile and hardness data have been obtained for each condition studied and structural examination has employed the carbon extraction replica technique in the electron microscope. The results indicate that the properties of the weld heat affected zone in HY- 80 steel are superior to those obtained for QT- 35 steel but inferior to those of the HY- 80 parent material. The tempering bead technique has been shown to have, at best, only a limited tempering effect on the grain coarsened region of an <b>edge</b> <b>bead</b> heat affected zone and can also cause an increase in the susceptibility of this region to brittle fracture. Post weld heat treatment at 6500 C is recommended, wherever possible, for HY- 80 weldments.

40|$|AbstractSilicon wafers with {{standard}} {{sizes and shapes}} have served as the batch fabrication platform for microfabrication of micro/nano devices for decades. However, {{there is a strong}} demand to batch fabricate micro/nano devices on other engineering materials (e. g. titanium, stainless steel, diamond, and ceramics) of complicate shapes and sizes designed for important applications. Unfortunately it is extremely difficult to meet the demand due to various challenges involved during microfabrication. Here we present a novel batch fabrication platform which can be used to facilitate the batch fabrication of thin film devices on substrates with arbitrary shapes and sizes. This platform will eliminate photolithography related defects such as <b>edge</b> <b>bead</b> formation, which will enable fabrication of thin film devices at the edges/corners of arbitrary shaped and sized substrates. At the same time it will enable uniform and bulk polishing of these substrates.

40|$|At DSM, a new polymer shaping process, termed Geltrusion, {{is being}} commercially exploited. Geltrusion is the {{production}} of thin (= 10 pm), unfilled and ceramically-filled ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene films. These films are made by extruding and subsequent stretching of a coniinüoüs îape. The ~liain pïûbleril faced dmirig prodwiiûn is {{the existence of a}} non-uniform thickness profile after stretching: a uniform centre of the film surrounded by thick edges termed edge beads. Edge beads are caused by the edge stress effect: a difference in stress condition between the edge and centre of the tape, caused by the free-surface boundary condition during stretching. To meet the customers’ demands for uniform thickness, the edge beads are cut off, which makes the production process inefficient. To solve the <b>edge</b> <b>bead</b> problem, a methodology based on modelling and simulation has to be used. The strength of this methodology is demonstrated by the simulation of the stretching step in the film casting process. Stretching in the film casting process takes place under the same free surface boundary conditions as in Geltrusion. It also results in the formation of edge beads. Simulation of this stretching process shows that it is possibl...|$|E

As a result, {{there has been}} a focus on developing methods for single cell analysis. µCP represents a cheap, simple and versatile method for producing microarrays across a substrate surfaces. The microarrays can be utilized for cell immobilization, which can be coupled to microscopy techniques. There is also an increased interest in using AFM for cell studies, which requires immobilization The focus of this thesis was to develop a method for µCP of PLL to facilitate immobilization of S. cerevisiae on a glass substrate. The idea is to create a pattern that enables immobilization of single cells of S. cerevisiae to achieve SCA. A photolithography procedure was developed to create a master mould for replica moulding. An even film thickness was achieved, but there were persistent problems with <b>edge</b> <b>bead</b> and cracks in the resist due to thermal stress. Replica moulding was used to make PDMS stamps on the created master mould. AFM analysis showed irregularities in the stamps corresponding to the cracks observed in the resist, which resulted in poor conformal contact between the stamp and the substrate surface. The parameters of the replica moulding method were verified using a pre-made master mould to create stamps. This showed that the process was suitable for creating PDMS stamps with micrometre scale features. The stamps were used to demonstrate that PDMS stamps could be used to print PLL in a micrometre scale pattern.

40|$|In {{the present}} the spin coating has been broadly {{used for the}} VLSI fabrication. Although this process {{can be applied to}} produce an organic film for the micro-lithography, a useful area on the {{substrate}} is significantly reduced by the problem of <b>edge</b> <b>bead.</b> To realize this situation, we propose an analytical method for studying the uniformity of spin coating according to the commercial machine. We begin with solving the continuity and Navier-stoke's equations in the cylinder coordinate by Fluent code to obtain the pressure profile and velocity field directly. The deviation of pressure is then calculated to quantify the uniformity of spin coating in the radial direction. Finally, the dynamic Taguchi Method is utilized to search the optimum condition of spin coating and a correlation of the substrate size and the uniformity of thin film. As shown in the results, we have a smooth flow pattern through the space of top-buffer to the substrate, in which top-buffer is spun with 1000 rpm opposite to the substrate spinning by 1500 rpm; the flow rate of air out from the bottom part of spin part of spin coater is 500 fpm; the difference of size between the substrate and top-buffer is 1 cm; and the space from the edge of substrate to the side wall of spin coater is 3 cm. Additionally, as known from the variation of pressure profile with respect to the substrate size, the uniformity of spin coating can be obviously improved by using the optimum conditions when the substrate size is enlarged. These information can be provide to process engineer for trouble-shooting and scale up on the spin casting. 旋轉塗佈技術現正廣泛的運用於半導體製程中的薄膜製造，雖然其所製作的薄膜均勻度佳，卻會在基材板邊產生突起物，造成基材可用區域減小。為改善此現象，本文根據商用大型旋轉塗佈機台提出一套新解析方法探討薄膜均勻性與晶圓尺寸大小之關係。首先利用Fluent code直接求解圓柱座標系統之連續方程式及Navier stoke 動量傳送方程式，以獲得壓力分佈及流力場；其次，計算徑向相對壓力偏差值，即薄膜均勻性；最後，使用田口品質工程之零點比例式動態分析方法，尋找能夠使旋轉塗佈製程之薄膜均勻性與晶圓尺寸大小達到匹配之最適化條件。根據本文所得到最適化旋轉塗佈製程﹕當檔板旋轉方向與轉盤相反且分別為 1000 rpm與 1500 rpm，抽氣速率為 500 fpm，轉盤與檔板的距離為 1 cm，及轉盤邊緣與室壁間距為 3 cm的條件時，流體於檔板與轉盤之間形成一順暢流場通過轉盤表面，且使得轉盤表面的壓力分佈更為均勻，而當旋轉塗佈機台轉盤尺寸變大時壓力分佈的動態特性顯示與現行條件相比有顯著的改善，亦即壓力分佈更為均勻，揭示出依據本文所探討之解析方法對於提昇薄膜均勻度與避免板邊突起物具有良好效果，且最適化的動態特性可以提供予製程工程師用以製造均勻薄膜。中文摘要…………………………………………………………I 英文摘要…………………………………………………………II 目錄………………………………………………………………III 圖目錄……………………………………………………………V 表目錄……………………………………………………………VIII 符號說明…………………………………………………………IX 第一章緒論 1 - 1 前言 [...] - 1 1 - 2 研究方法 [...] - 5 1 - 3 本論文架構 [...] - 5 第二章文獻回顧與研究動機 2 - 1 文獻回顧 [...] - 7 2 - 2 研究動機 [...] - 10 第三章物理系統與數學模式 3 - 1 物理系統 [...] - 12 3 - 2 統治方程式 [...] - 13 第四章解析方法 4 - 1 前言 [...] - 18 4 - 2 FLUENT簡介 [...] - 19 4 - 3 FLUENT數值方法 [...] 21 4 - 3 - 1 離散方法 [...] 21 4 - 3 - 2 時間項的離散 [...] 22 4 - 3 - 3 離散方程式的線性化形式 [...] 23 4 - 3 - 4 Under-Relaxation [...] - 23 4 - 3 - 5 速度與壓力的連結 [...] 24 4 - 3 - 6 FLUENT數值求解流程 [...] - 26 4 - 4 塗佈均勻度計算 [...] - 27 4 - 5 製程最適化設計 [...] - 28 第五章結果與討論 5 - 1 前言 [...] - 36 5 - 2 旋轉塗佈流場 [...] - 36 5 - 3 網格精確度分析 [...] - 37 5 - 4 旋轉塗佈製程最適化之田口實驗 [...] - 38 5 - 4 - 1 控制因素探討 [...] - 38 5 - 4 - 2 最適化結果分析 [...] - 41 第六章綜合結論與未來展望 6 - 1 綜合結論 [...] - 71 6 - 2 未來展望 [...] - 72 參考文獻 [...] 73 附錄田口實驗流場示意...|$|E

5000|$|The Psathyrellaceae are {{a family}} of dark-spored agarics that {{generally}} have rather soft, fragile fruiting bodies, and are characterized by black, dark brown, rarely reddish, or even pastel-colored spore prints. About 50% of species produce fruiting bodies that dissolve into ink-like ooze when the spores are mature via autodigestion. Prior to phylogenetic research based upon DNA comparisons, most of the species that autodigested were classified as Coprinaceae, which contained all of the inky-cap mushrooms. However, the type species of Coprinus, Coprinus comatus, {{and a few other}} species, were found to be more closely related to Agaricaceae. The former genus Coprinus was split between two families, and the name [...] "Coprinaceae" [...] became a synonym of Agaricaceae in its 21st-century phylogenetic redefinition. Note that in the 19th and early 20th centuries the family name Agaricaceae had far broader application, while in the late 20th century it had a narrower application. The family name Psathyrellaceae is based on the former Coprinaceae subfamily name Psathyrelloideae. The type genus Psathyrella consists of species that produce fruiting bodies which do not liquify via autodigestion. Psathyrella remained a polyphyletic genus until it was split into several genera including 3 new ones in 2015. Lacrymaria is another genus that does not autodigest its fruiting bodies.

40|$|This report {{studies the}} effect of the local spatial density of {{monoclonal}} antibody (mAb) immobilized within a low-solids content, large-particle diameter cellulose support. A novel epoxide-gradient activation method (epoxy-GAM) for creating a gradient of support activation was compared to classical bulk activation/bulk coupling (BA/BC) methods using different coupling chemistries. In addition to using epoxy-GAM, a two-step coupling (TSC) sequence comprised of mAb permeation under slow coupling conditions followed by conditions having fast coupling reaction kinetics was used to further assist in the goal of distributing the mAb within the matrix. Immunosorbents containing volume-averaged mAb densities of 1 – 12 mg/ml of support were studied. A gradient of immobilized fluorescein label and fluorescein-labeled mAb was observed by fluorescent imaging within 10 µm thick cross-sections of the epoxy-GAM supports. The antigen-binding efficiency (ηeff) of an immunosorbent is defined in this study as the experimentally observed binding capacity of an antigen (mg antigen (Ag) /ml support) divided by the maximum theoretical antigen-binding capacity based upon a 2 : 1, Ag: mAb stoichiometric ratio and is expressed as a percentage. The ηeff of immunosorbents obtained using epoxy-GAM/TSC contained a more uniform spatial distribution of immobilized mAb and were significantly more active (ηeff = 30 – 50 %) relative to those immunosorbents made using epoxy-BA/BC methods that contained locally high mAb densities that were immobilized only near the <b>bead</b> <b>edge</b> (ηeff = 1 – 10 %).

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} a detailed investigation of volatiles within subglacially erupted rhyolites from Torfajokull and Krafla, Iceland. Thermogravimetric, FTIR and XRD analyses have been combined with field observations and thin section obser- vations {{to investigate the}} coupling between fracturing and hydration resulting {{in the formation of}} perlite. The dominant volatiles in perlites are shown to be water. Perlites are enriched in water with respect to obsidians and total volatile contents vary between litho- facies. More-perlitised obsidians are found to be enriched in water compared to less-perlitised obsidians. Water is shown to decrease with distance inwards from the margin of lava lobes and the assumed external water source present during formation. Water also decreases inwards from the <b>edges</b> of perlitic <b>beads</b> (away from the perlitic fracture). The variations in water content are shown to be due to changes in water species indicative of external hydration. An inverse relationship exists between total volatile content and the temperature of maximum degassing. Hydration is shown to be stronger when grainsizes are smaller due to a greater surface area to volume ratio. Fracturing and volatile contents are strongly coupled with the extent of hydration related to the locations of fractures. The distance of water enrichment either side of major and perlitic fractures corre- lates well with theoretical diffusion distances of water at < 400 °C suggesting that perlitisation occurs once the obsidian is below the glass transition temperature and responds to stress in a brittle fashion. The extensive perlitisation seen in Iceland is dependent on initial planar (major) fracture formation through cooling contraction. Water exploits these fractures and diffuses into the matrix glass via the major fracture-glass interface. Perlitic fracture formation can occur via stress relief and/or stress corrosion. Once perlite has formed the fractures are shown to facilitate further hydration/alteration which is likely to proceed until a soil is formed.

The archaic coin is sharp and hard; every line decisive and numbered, set unhesitatingly in its place; nothing is wrong, though everything incomplete, and, to us who have seen finer art, ugly. The central coin is as decisive and clear in arrangement of masses, but its contours are completely rounded and finished. There is no character in its execution so prominent that you can give an epithet to the style. It is not hard, it is not soft, it is not delicate, it is not coarse, it is not grotesque, it is not beautiful; and I am convinced, unless you {{had been told that}} this is fine central Greek art, you would have seen nothing at all in it to interest you. Do not let yourselves be anywise forced into admiring it; there is, indeed, nothing more here than an approximately true rendering of a healthy youthful face, without the slightest attempt to give an expression of activity, cunning, nobility, or any other attribute of the Mercurial mind. Extreme simplicity, unpretending vigor of work, which claims no admiration either for minuteness or dexterity, and suggests no idea of effort at all; refusal of extraneous ornament, and perfectly arranged disposition of counted masses in a sequent order, whether in the beads, or the ringlets of hair; this is all you have to be pleased with; neither will you ever find, in the best Greek Art, more. You might at first suppose that the chain of beads round the cap was an extraneous ornament; but I have little doubt that it is as definitely the proper fillet for the head of Hermes, as the olive for Zeus, or corn for Triptolemus. The cap or petasus cannot have expanded edges; {{there is no room for}} them on the coin; these must be understood, therefore; but the nature of the cloud-petasus is explained by <b>edging</b> it with <b>beads,</b> representing either dew or hail. The shield of Athena often bears white pellets for hail, in like manner.|$|R
