5|$|Dromaeosaurids {{share many}} {{features}} with early birds (clade Avialae or Aves). The precise {{nature of their}} relationship to birds has undergone {{a great deal of}} study, and hypotheses about that relationship have changed as large amounts of new evidence became available. As late as 2001, Mark Norell and colleagues analyzed a large survey of coelurosaur fossils and produced the tentative result that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to birds, with troodontids as a more distant outgroup. They even suggested that Dromaeosauridae could be paraphyletic relative to Avialae. In 2002, Hwang and colleagues utilized the work of Norell et al., including new characters and better fossil <b>evidence,</b> <b>to</b> determine that birds (avialans) were better thought of as cousins to the dromaeosaurids and troodontids. A consensus of paleontologists has concluded that there is not yet enough <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> determine whether any dromaeosaurids could fly or glide, or whether they evolved from ancestors that could.|$|E
