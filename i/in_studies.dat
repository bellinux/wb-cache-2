Preventive {{efficacy of}} lotilaner tablets (Credelio™, Elanco) against Babesia canis was evaluated <b>in</b> two <b>studies.</b> Methods Sixteen dogs <b>in</b> <b>Study</b> 1 and 12 dogs <b>in</b> <b>Study</b> 2, all seronegative and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative for B. canis, were randomized to a sham-treated control group or a lotilaner (20 – 43  mg/kg) treatment group, administered on Day 0 (Study 1 : n =  8 /group; Study 2 : n =  6 /group). Dogs were each infested with 50 Dermacentor reticulatus, a percentage of which (Study 1 : 8. 0 – 30. 0 %; Study 2 : 12. 2 %) were infected with B. canis, <b>in</b> <b>Study</b> 1 on Days 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28, and <b>in</b> <b>Study</b> 2 on Day 28. Ticks were removed and counted on Day 30 <b>in</b> <b>Study</b> 1, and Day 34 <b>in</b> <b>Study</b> 2. Blood was collected for Babesia detection via smear, PCR and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) <b>in</b> <b>Study</b> 1 on Day 2, then approximately weekly through Day 56, and <b>in</b> <b>Study</b> 2 at weekly intervals between Days 28 to 49, and on Days 63 and 91.

Dogs with confirmed infections were rescue-treated, removed from the <b>study</b> and, <b>in</b> <b>Study</b> 1, replaced. Results Across both studies B. canis infection of ticks ranged between 8. 0 – 30. 0 %. <b>In</b> <b>Study</b> 1, all control dogs were positive for B. canis on blood smear and PCR on Day 10 and IFA on Day 21; on Day 21 seven of eight replacement control dogs were B. canis-positive; no replacement dogs were B. canis-positive following tick removal on Day 30. <b>In</b> <b>Study</b> 2, all control dogs were B. canis-positive on Day 56. All lotilaner-treated dogs remained B. canis-negative at all assessments <b>in</b> both <b>studies.</b> Conclusion Lotilaner efficacy was 100 % in preventing establishment of B. canis infection, despite post-treatment challenge with infected ticks on Days 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28...|$|R
