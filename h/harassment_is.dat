25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the EEOC and some federal courts began holding that sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> also {{prohibited}} under the Act. In 1986, the Supreme Court held in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, , that sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> sex discrimination and is prohibited by Title VII. Same-sex sexual harassment {{has also been}} held in a unanimous decision written by Justice Scalia to be prohibited by Title VII (Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., , 118 S.Ct. 998).|$|E

25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{organizational}} climate (an organization's tolerance, policy, procedure etc.) and workplace environment {{are essential for}} understanding {{the conditions in which}} sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> likely to occur, and the way its victims will be affected (yet, research on specific policy and procedure, and awareness strategies is lacking). Another element which increases the risk for sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> the job’s gender context (having few women in the close working environment or practicing in a field which is atypical for women).|$|E
25|$|In 2016 a stricter law proscribing sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>was</b> {{proposed}} in Morocco specifying fines {{and a possible}} jail sentence of up to 6 months.

25|$|Women {{are more}} likely than men to {{experience}} sexual harassment, especially for those working in traditionally masculine occupations. In addition, a study indicated that sexual harassment negatively affects workers' psychological well-being. Another study found that level of harassment at workplaces lead to differences in performance of work related tasks. High levels of <b>harassment</b> <b>were</b> related to the worst outcomes, and no <b>harassment</b> <b>was</b> related to least negative outcomes. In other words, women who had experienced a higher level of <b>harassment</b> <b>were</b> more likely to perform poorly at workplaces.|$|R

Sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> defined as unwelcome conduct {{of a sexual}} nature that interferes with a student’s ability to learn, work, achieve or participate in activities. This can include unwanted sexual advances, sexual touching, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal, nonverbal,and physical actions of a sexual nature.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{on sexual harassment}} has focused almost exclusively on harassment by co-workers and supervisors, ignoring extra-organizational sources of harassment. Given that women are spending an increasing amount of time with clients, the current research does not adequately represent women&# 8217;s experiences. This thesis expands harassment research in two ways. First, a measure of sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>was</b> created for the client context. The current measure of harassment, the Sexual Experiences Questionnaire, was adapted to measure client <b>harassment.</b> It <b>was</b> then administered {{to a sample of}} 346 professional women, and its structure determined. Second, a model of the antecedents and consequences of client <b>harassment</b> <b>was</b> tested. Antecedents and outcomes previously linked to <b>harassment</b> <b>were</b> examined in the client context, and found to be similarly related. By examining the structure of client harassment, and its antecedents and outcomes, this research has begun to address an important source of harassment for women in organizations...|$|R

25|$|Sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> illegal {{but remains}} widespread. The law {{requires}} that suspected victims be informed {{of their right to}} assistance.

25|$|Though {{the phrase}} sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} acknowledged to include clearly damaging and morally deplorable behavior, its boundaries can be broad and controversial.

25|$|While such conduct can <b>be</b> <b>harassment</b> {{of women}} by men, many laws {{around the world}} which {{prohibit}} sexual harassment recognize that {{both men and women}} may be harassers or victims of sexual harassment.

Sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> a form of illegal employment discrimination in many countries, and {{is a form of}} abuse (sexual and psychological) and bullying.

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in understanding sexual <b>harassment,</b> <b>is</b> that it involves a range of behaviors. In most cases (although not in all cases) {{it is difficult for}} the victim to describe what they experienced. This can be related to difficulty classifying the situation or could be related to stress and humiliation experienced by the recipient. Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the EU Directive 2002/73/EC, Greece enacted Law 3488/2006 (O.G.A.'.191).

Prior to this law, the policy on sexual harassment in Greece was very weak. Sexual harassment was not defined by any law, and victims could only use general laws, which were very poor in addressing the issue.|$|E

25|$|Sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> a {{criminal}} offense, punishable {{by up to}} two years in jail. The law encompasses sexual advances in the workplace or in educational institutions and between service providers or clients.

Although the legislation exists and was enforced, accusations remained rare, and the extent of the problem was not documented.|$|E
25|$|Research {{is ongoing}} into {{occupational}} hazards {{that may be}} specific to women. Of particular interest are potential environmental causes of breast cancer and cervical cancer.

25|$|<b>Harassment</b> <b>is</b> a {{technique}} used by males of many species to force females {{to submit to}} mating. It has been observed in numerous species, including mammals, birds, insects and fish. Aggression and harassment have been documented in the males of guppies (Poecilia reticulata), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), botos (Inia geoffrensis), dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori), grizzly bears, polar bears, and ungulates. It is also seen in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens), and seed-eating true bugs (Neacoryphus spp.). Furthermore, it is prevalent in spider monkeys, wild Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus) and many other primates.|$|E

25|$|Sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> defined as, {{when any}} verbal, non-verbal or {{physical}} action {{is used to}} change a victim's sexual status against {{the will of the}} victim and resulting in the victim feeling inferior or hurting the victim's dignity. Man and woman are looked upon as equal, and any action trying to change the balance in status with the differences in sex as a tool, is also sexual harassment. In the workplace, jokes, remarks, etc., are only deemed discriminatory if the employer has stated so in their written policy. Law number 1385 of December 21, 2005 regulates this area.|$|E
25|$|Peer-to-peer sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> {{three times}} more likely than perpetration by {{teachers}} or other school faculty. Sexual harassment between peers may also be a result of students trying to conform to expected gender norms created by society. It can also be used as a tool for gender policing. For example, this could be seen if a male is exhibiting behavior not seen to peers as being masculine, so others may label him with homophobic slurs in order to reinforce gender conformity through a form of nonphysical sexual harassment. Students may exhibit, accept, or tolerate this conforming behavior as to not cause rifts in peer groups.|$|E
25|$|A ban on {{discrimination}} {{was included}} in the Federal Constitution (Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the old Federal Constitution) in 1981 and adopted in Article 8, paragraph 2 of the revised Constitution. The ban on sexual harassment in the workplace forms part of the Federal Act on Gender Equality (GEA) of 24 March 1995, where it is one of several provisions which prohibit discrimination in employment and which are intended to promote equality. Article 4 of the GEA defines the circumstances, Article 5 legal rights and Article 10 protection against dismissal during the complaints procedure. Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR), Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Employment Act (ArG) contain further statutory provisions on the ban on sexual harassment. The ban on sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>is</b> intended exclusively for employers, within the scope of their responsibility for protection of legal personality, mental and physical well-being and health.|$|E
