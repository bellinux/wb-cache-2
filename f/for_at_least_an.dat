5|$|Although {{onset of}} DCS can occur rapidly after a dive, {{in more than}} half of all cases {{symptoms}} do not begin to appear <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> hour. In extreme cases, symptoms may occur before the dive has been completed. The U.S. Navy and Technical Diving International, a leading technical diver training organization, have published a table that documents time to onset of first symptoms. The table does not differentiate between types of DCS, or types of symptom.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{wanted to}} power the Q-12 with a ramjet engine built by the Marquardt Corporation for the Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc {{long-range}} surface-to-air missile. Marquardt and Lockheed had already collaborated on several programs and had a close working relationship. The engine, the RJ43-MA-11, required modification, since it was only designed to burn {{as long as the}} missile needed to hit a target, while the Q-12's engine needed to operate at high temperatures <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> hour and a half at high altitudes. The modified engine was designated RJ43-MA20S-4.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, the sacraments {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive the sacraments. Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> hour before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E

5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned {{to the front desk}} after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E
5|$|Intense Confederate and {{especially}} Union artillery fire continued <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> hour, slackening at about 2:30pm. At about 3:30pm, Lewis Armistead noticed Union skirmishers creeping towards his men where the grand battery on the Confederate right flank was, nearly within rifle range of them. Armistead sent three regiments (about {{half of his}} brigade) from his command to push back the skirmishers, thus beginning the infantry part of the battle. The skirmishers were repelled quickly, but Armistead's men found themselves {{in the midst of}} an intense Union barrage. The Confederates decided to nestle themselves in a ravine along the hill's slant. This position protected them from the fire, but pinned them down on the slopes of Malvern Hill, unsupported by either infantry or artillery. They did not have enough men to advance any further and retreating would have put them back into the crossfire.|$|E
25|$|Horses needed attendants: {{hitching}} a six-horse {{field artillery}} team, for example, required six men working <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> hour. Horse health deteriorated after only ten days of even moderate load, requiring frequent refits; recuperation took months and the replacement horses, in turn, {{needed time to}} get along with their teammates and handlers. Good stables around the front line were scarce, makeshift lodgings caused premature wear and disease. Refit of front-line horse units consumed eight to ten days, slowing down operations.|$|E

500|$|Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw, who {{had been}} chairing COBRA during the siege, was rushed back to Whitehall from a {{function}} he had been attending in Slough, roughly [...] away, arriving 19 minutes after the shots had been reported. He was briefed on the SAS plan by de la Billière, who told him to expect that up to 40 percent of the hostages would be killed in an assault. After deliberations, Whitelaw instructed the SAS to prepare to assault the building at short notice, an order that was received by Mike Rose at 15:50. By 17:00, the SAS were {{in a position to}} assault the embassy at ten minutes' notice. The police negotiators recruited the imam from a local mosque at 18:20, fearing that a [...] "crisis point" [...] had been reached, and asked him to talk to the gunmen. Three further shots were fired {{during the course of the}} imam's conversation with Oan. Oan announced that a hostage had been killed, and the rest would die in 30minutes unless his demands were met. A few minutes later, Lavasani's body was dumped out of the front door. Upon a preliminary examination, conducted at the scene, a forensic pathologist estimated that Lavasani had been dead <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> hour, meaning he could not have been killed by the three most recent shots, and leading the police to believe that two hostages had been killed. In fact, only Lavasani had been shot.|$|E

2500|$|The directors, however, {{petitioned the}} {{government}} <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> approval of their limited {{presence in the}} Hawaii, which was granted in August 1818. In the same month Kotzebue returned to Saint Petersburg, bringing bad news {{of the events that}} happened more than a year before; the directors received letters from Schäffer himself, the most recent dated April 1818, from Rio de Janeiro. In a memorandum to the Minister of the Interior in 1818, Schäffer stressed the importance of controlling the profitable Hawaiian markets. The Board of Directors was requested its opinion of pursuing such a project, agreeing that Hawaiian supplies would be of critical use to settlements in Russian America, Okhotsk and on the Kamchatka Peninsula. As before, the RAC refused to act on the proposal until authorized by the Imperial government. Tsar Alexander approved the company efforts to develop commercial relations with the Kingdom, but again demurred from erecting a Russian protectorate over the Hawaiian islands, finding [...] "the hope of the establishment of the Russians on one of the Sandwich Islands has very little foundation..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The defense {{attorneys}} began preparing Alexander <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> insanity plea, {{if not a}} second-degree murder defense, in order to stave off a possible death sentence if he were convicted; they introduced excerpts of the [...] "harassing" [...] e-mails and official letters made by the inspectors in hopes to show that his act of murder was out of [...] "blind rage". Alexander, who had been held without bail {{since the time of}} the shootings, had pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges. His public defender, Michael Ogul, said Alexander lost his temper and killed the inspectors after months of harassment. [...] "Stuart Alexander committed terrible crimes. There's no question of that", Ogul said. [...] "There's no question he did a terrible thing that can't be excused, that can't be forgiven." [...] Ogul said the inspectors [...] "taunted, [...] "pushed, and [...] "provoked" [...] Alexander until he was [...] "blind with rage". Said Ogul: [...] "They knew he was volatile. They (the inspectors) knew he was upset, they knew he was on the edge", Ogul continued. [...] "Stuart Alexander killed them. He hated them, plain and simple." ...|$|E
2500|$|My next {{visit was}} to Pohick Church, in the {{vicinity}} of Mt. Vernon, the seat of General Washington. It was still raining when I approached the house, and found no one there. The wide open doors invited me to enter, as they do invite, day and night through the year, not only the passing traveller, but every beast of the field and fowl of the air. These latter however seemed to have reverenced the house of God, since few marks of their pollution were to be seen throughout it. The interior of the house, having been well built, is still good. The chancel, Communion table and tables of the law [...] are still there and in good order. The roof only is decaying; and at the time I was there the rain was dropping on these sacred places and on other parts of the house. On the doors of the pews, in gilt letters, are still to be seen the names of the principal Families which once occupied them. How could I, while <b>for</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> hour traversing those long aisles, ascending the lofty pulpit, entering the sacred chancel, forbear to ask, And is this the House of God which was built by the Washingtons, the Mc.Cartys, the Lewises, the Fairfaxes?-the house in which they used to worship the God of our fathers according to the venerable forms of the Episcopal Church, and some of whose names are still to be seen on the doors of those now deserted pews? Is this also destined to moulder piecemeal away, or, when some signal is given, to become the prey of spoilers, and to be carried hither and thither and applied to every purpose under heaven? ...|$|E

2500|$|From George Wilkins Kendall's {{account of}} the Texan Santa Fe Expedition: [...] "In their habits, they are clannish, social, and {{extremely}} convivial, never living alone like other animals, but, on the contrary, always found in villages or large settlements. They are a wild, frolicsome, madcap set of fellows when undisturbed, uneasy and ever on the move, and appear to take especial delight in chattering away the time, and visiting from hole to hole to gossip and talk over each other's affairs—at least so their actions would indicate. On several occasions I crept close to their villages, without being observed, to watch their movements. Directly in the centre {{of one of them}} I particularly noticed a very large dog, {{sitting in front of the}} door or entrance to his burrow, and by his own actions and those of his neighbors it really seemed as though he was the president, mayor, or chief—at all events, he was the 'big dog' of the place. <b>For</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>an</b> hour I secretly watched the operations in this community. During that time the large dog I have mentioned received at least a dozen visits from his fellow-dogs, which would stop and chat with him a few moments, and then run off to their domiciles. All this while he never left his post for a moment, and I thought I could discover a gravity in his deportment not discernible in those by which he was surrounded. Far is it from me to say that the visits he received were upon business, or had anything to do with the local government of the village; but it certainly appeared so. If any animal has a system of laws regulating the body politic, it is certainly the prairie dog." ...|$|E
