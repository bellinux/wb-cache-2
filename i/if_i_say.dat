5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E

If others are in there, deal me a hand and let me see what I can make of it, even though I know some in there are dealing from the bottom and cheating like hell in other ways.|$|E
25|$|Heinz Hopf, who {{had been}} in Berlin before his {{appointment}} to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held - as is clear from oral statements and also from letters - Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya {{on the occasion of the}} re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. - If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him.|$|E

500|$|I think that's bullshit. The word {{police can}} fuck off. I don't {{want to be}} policed! I'm not {{interested}} in political correctness. The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word [...] "cunt", I was horrified. People were calling each other cunts! And then I realized that, in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the back and said, [...] "Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!" [...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to fuck with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to you, [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me." [...] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Why are you being such a bitch to me?," [...] well, that means something else.|$|E
500|$|Both {{newspapers}} {{went into}} gradual decline under their new proprietors. James Gordon Bennett, Jr.—"a swaggering, precociously dissolute lout who rarely stifled an impulse"—had a mercurial reign. He launched the New York Telegram, an evening paper, {{in the late}} 1860s and kept the Herald the most comprehensive source of news among the city's newspapers. [...] Bennett also bankrolled Henry Morton Stanley's trek through Africa to find David Livingstone, and scooped the competition on the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Bennett ruled his paper with a heavy hand, telling his executives {{at one point that}} he was the [...] "only reader of this paper": [...] "I am the only one to be pleased. [...] If I want it turned upside down, it must be turned upside down. [...] I want one feature article a day. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> the feature is black beetles, black beetles it's going to be." [...] In 1874, the Herald ran the infamous New York Zoo hoax, where {{the front page of the}} newspaper was devoted entirely to fabricated story of animals getting loose at the Central Park Zoo.|$|E
500|$|In April, the Whigs {{used the}} House of Representatives {{for an attack}} on President Van Buren. Charles Ogle of Pennsylvania, a law student and {{political}} disciple of Thaddeus Stevens, utilized a debate on White House renovations to spend three days accusing Van Buren of living in luxury at considerable public expense, asking, [...] "If he is vain enough to spend his money in the purchase of rubies for his neck, diamond rings for his fingers, Brussels lace for his breast, filet gloves for his hands, and fabrique de broderies de bougram à Nancy handkerchiefs for his pocket—if he chooses to lay out hundreds of dollars in supplying his toilet with 'Double Extract of Queen Victoria', Eau de Cologne, Corinthian Oil of Cream ... <b>if,</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> Mr. Van Buren sees fit to spend his cash in buying these and other perfumes and cosmetics for his toilet, it can constitute no valid reason for charging the farmers, laborers and mechanics of this country with bills for HEMMING HIS DISH RAGS, FOR HIS LARDING NEEDLES, LIQUOR STANDS, AND FOREIGN CUT WINE COOLERS". Democrats called Ogle's address the [...] "Omnibus of Lies"; Whigs called it the [...] "Gold Spoons speech" [...] and reprinted it in large numbers, attempting to paint Van Buren, who was in fact of far more humble birth than Harrison, as an aristocratic dandy being challenged by {{a man of the}} people.|$|E

500|$|... "Do or Die" [...] is 1 {{minute and}} 59 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of A major. The {{instruments}} used on the track are tuned slightly sharper than standard. The song begins with an intro featuring a lead guitar and keyboard melody, which plays twice, accompanied by a rhythm guitar riff alternating between A and D chords, drums and bass. The track breaks down to just rhythm guitar, drums and bass for the first verse which begins after 13 seconds. The first chorus begins after 23 seconds with a distorted guitar playing the chord sequence D5, C5, B5 and A5 twice while Rhys sings [...] "If we do or die we should try, if we don't try I say bye-bye, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> bye-bye, I'll wonder why we didn't try to do or die" [...] backed by high harmony backing vocals and occasional keyboard noises. The song breaks down again for a second verse before the second chorus enters at 46 seconds. An instrumental passage follows with the lead guitar and keyboard reprising the melody which plays during the intro. The instrumental leads into a double chorus. At the end of the final chorus the track crescendos, with Rhys singing [...] "yeah, yeah, yeah" [...] and all instruments {{with the exception of the}} keyboard coming to an abrupt silence after 1 minute and 43 seconds. Keyboard noises continue and gradually fade out until the track ends.|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leitch {{argued that}} Bevin tended {{to make a}} bad {{situation}} worse by making ill-chosen abrasive remarks. Bevin was undeniably a plain-spoken man, some of whose remarks struck many as insensitive. Critics have {{accused him of being}} anti-Semitic. One remark which caused particular anger was made when President Truman was pressing Britain to immediately admit 100,000 Jewish refugees, survivors of the Holocaust who wanted to immigrate to Palestine. Bevin told a Labour Party meeting that American pressure to admit Jews was being applied because [...] "There has been agitation in the United States, and particularly in New York, for 100,000 Jews to be put in Palestine.

She owned a racehorse named Weep No More. Her name was linked to politicians, including Labour Minister John Stonehouse (whose secretary and mistress Sheila Buckley named her as one of his lovers) and future Conservative Prime Minister John Major. MacDonald has denied relationships with either man, or ever having met [...] "poor John Major", though she did recall Stonehouse as [...] "tall, dark" [...] and [...] "very attractive to women".

In late 2009, Hudgens sued [...] "www.moejackson.com" [...] for posting nude [...] "self-portrait photographs" [...] of her taken on a mobile phone in a private home. Hudgens later commented on the photos' impact on her career in the October issue of Allure with, [...] "Whenever anybody asks me, would I do nudity in a film, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> that it's something I'm not comfortable with, they're like, 'Bullshit, you've already done it.'

I never thought it would be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> I just can't do this right now. But it made me laugh out loud and it made me just literally cry. It was just funny."
