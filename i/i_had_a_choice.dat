500|$|Trump University was {{incorporated}} in 2004 by Trump, Sexton, and Spitalny, as a New York limited liability company. Donald Trump owned 93% of the company. On May 23, 2005, Trump University formally launched its education program. At the opening presentation, Trump said: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> of making {{lots of money}} or imparting lots of knowledge, I think I'd be as happy to impart knowledge as to make money". The company's original business plan focused on online education, but quickly expanded to include live, in-person instruction as well. The focus of the instruction was real estate investing, with Trump claiming in advertisements, [...] "I can turn anyone into a successful real estate investor, including you." [...] Typically the instruction began with an introductory seminar in rented space such as a hotel ballroom. At the introductory seminar, students were urged {{to sign up for}} additional classes, ranging from $1495 seminars to a $35,000 [...] "Gold Elite" [...] program. Records produced indicate 7611 tickets in total were sold to customers attending courses. Approximately 6000 of these tickets were for a $1,500 3-day course and 1000 tickets were for silver, gold or elite mentored courses ranging in price from $10,000 to $35,000.|$|E
500|$|In Russell's {{penultimate}} season, the 1967–68 season, {{his numbers}} slowly declined, but at age 34, he still tallied 12.5 {{points per game}} and 18.6 rebounds per game (the latter good for the third highest average in the league). In the Eastern Division Finals, the 76ers had the better record than the Celtics and were slightly favored. But then, national tragedy struck as Martin Luther King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. With eight of the ten starting players on Sixers and Celtics being African American, both teams were in deep shock, and there were calls to cancel the series. In a game called as [...] "unreal" [...] and [...] "devoid of emotion", the Sixers lost 127–118 on April 5. In Game 2, Philadelphia evened the series with a 115–106 win, and in Games 3 and 4, the Sixers won, with Chamberlain suspiciously often defended by Celtics backup center Wayne Embry, causing the press to speculate Russell was worn down. Prior to Game 5, the Celtics seemed dead: no NBA team had ever {{come back from a}} 3–1 deficit. However, the Celtics rallied back, winning Game 5 122–104 and Game 6 114–106, powered by a spirited Havlicek and helped by a terrible Sixers shooting slump. In Game 7, 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100–96 defeat, making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading 3–1. Russell limited Chamberlain to only two shot attempts in the second half. Despite this, the Celtics were leading only 97–95 with 34 seconds left when Russell closed out the game with several consecutive clutch plays. He made a free throw, blocked a shot by Sixers player Chet Walker, grabbed a rebound off a miss by Sixers player Hal Greer, and finally passed the ball to teammate Sam Jones, who scored to clinch the win. Boston then beat the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2 in the NBA Finals, giving Russell his tenth title in 12 years. For his efforts Russell was named Sports Illustrateds Sportsman of the Year. After losing for the fifth straight time against Russell and his Celtics, Hall-of-Fame Lakers guard Jerry West stated, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> of any basketball player in the league, my No.1 choice has to be Bill Russell. Bill Russell never ceases to amaze me." ...|$|E

40|$|In my thesis, I {{would like}} to {{introduce}} two prominent characters of the romantic period and through their work to introduce the romantic period. Poetry {{is one way to}} express somebody’s feelings and thoughts about the world, beauty, truth, and nature. It is perhaps the most subjective way to share your thoughts with other people and the world. Makes you think about values, the real, the transcendence. In my case, poetry is a tool to relax, suggests tranquillity, and means another world, where <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> to distinguish real and unreal. In Poetry, formal elements give a base for a subjective relationship between the reader and the writer, despite their huge temporal difference. régi képzésangol nyelv és irodalom szakos tanár (kiegészítő levelező képzés...|$|R
50|$|In {{sentence}} number 1, {{the doctor}} is a man, so the masculine pronoun is used. In sentence number 2, {{the doctor is}} a woman, so the noun is referred back with a feminine pronoun. But in sentence number 3, even though I know if the doctor is {{a man or a}} woman, it is perfectly possible to still dodge the definition by using the always available gender-neutral pronoun lu. Notice however that doktoro is never marked for gender in these sentences, since the doctor will be called in his/her professional capacity, and not for being a man or a woman. Actually, saying Me advokos mea doktorino (or mea doktorulo) implies <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> between <b>a</b> male and a female doctor, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> decided on either of them.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} damning thing ever said against the present system, damning {{because of its}} empty absurdity, was uttered by Sir Thomas Whittaker. He was making the usual exaggerations of the {{supposed}} difficulties of the method. He said English people didn't like such [...] "complications." [...] They like a [...] "straight fight between two men." [...] Think of it! A straight fight! For more than a quarter-century I have been a voter, usually with votes {{in two or three}} constituencies, and never in all that long political life have I seen a single straight fight in an election, but only the dismallest sham fights it is possible to conceive. Thrice only in all that time have I cast a vote for a man whom I respected. On all other occasions the election that mocked my citizenship was either an arranged walk-over for one party or the other, or <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> between two unknown persons, mysteriously selected as candidates by obscure busy people with local interests in the constituency.

40|$|Objectives: To explore pupils’ and teachers’ {{experiences}} of P. E. Study Design: A qualitative investigation employing semi-structured interviews. Self Determination Theory {{was used as}} a guiding theory and Template Analysis was used to analyse the data. Setting: A secondary school in the North East of England. Participants: 14 pupils (aged 13 and 14, boys and girls) with a range of self-perceived competencies regarding P. E. and 4 P. E. teachers of the pupils (3 male, 1 female). Primary and secondary outcomes: (1) Attitudes and perceptions of P. E. pupils regarding their {{experiences of}} compulsory school P. E. lessons. (2) P. E. teachers experiences of teaching P. E. Results: Key results from pupils and teachers suggest pupils enjoy participation in P. E. when they feel competent, in control and supported by others. Feeling competent depended on i) the activity within P. E. and ii) the pupils perceived physical capabilities/aptitude. Feeling in control related to <b>i)</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> of activities, ii) being able to set exertion levels and iii) control over clothes worn whilst taking part. Relationships within pupil groups and between pupils and teachers were perceived as important. Teachers could positively influence their pupils’ enjoyment by understanding and supporting their personal goals, as opposed to dictating and controlling what they did and for how long, and by promoting a non-threatening atmosphere between pupils. Conclusions: Rising obesity levels and concerns over the fitness of children and young people has returned the focus of P. E. to its potential as a vehicle for promoting health. This study suggests schools and P. E. teachers in particular can positively influence the P. E. experience of both boys and girls by providing more choice of activities and letting pupils make their own decisions based on their personal needs...|$|R
