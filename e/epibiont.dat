5000|$|An <b>epibiont</b> (from the Ancient Greek meaning {{living on}} top of) is an {{organism}} that {{lives on the}} surface of another living organism. An <b>epibiont</b> is, by definition, harmless to its host and in this sense, {{the relationship between the two}} organisms can be considered neutralistic or commensalistic (as opposed to, for example, parasitic, in which case one organism benefits at the expense of the other, or mutualistic, in which both organisms obtain some explicit benefit from their coexistence). Although there is no direct effect of the <b>epibiont</b> to the host, there are often indirect effects resulting from this interaction and change in the surface of the host. This has been found to be especially important to marine organisms and aquatic ecosystems as surface qualities do impact necessary ecological functions such as drag, radiation absorption, nutrient uptake etc. [...] Examples of common epibionts are barnacles, remoras and algae, many of which live on the surfaces of larger marine organisms such as whales, sharks, sea turtles and mangrove trees. The host of the <b>epibiont</b> is typically referred to as the basibiont (living underneath).|$|E
40|$|In many benthic {{communities}} predators play {{a crucial}} role in the population dynamics of their prey. Surface characteristics of the prey are important for recognition and handling by the predator. Because the establishment of an epibiotic assemblage on the surface of a basibiont species creates a new interface between the epibiotized organism and its environment, we hypothesised that epibiosis should have an impact on consumer-prey interactions. In separate investigations, we assessed how <b>epibionts</b> on macroalgae affected the susceptibility of the latter to herbivory by the urchin Arbacia punctulata and how <b>epibionts</b> on the blue mussel Mytilus edulis affected its susceptibility to predation by the shore crab Carcinus maenas. Some <b>epibionts</b> strongly affected consumer feeding behavior. When <b>epibionts</b> were more attractive than their host, consumer pressure increased. When <b>epibionts</b> were less attractive than their host or when they were repellent, consumer pressure decreased. In systems that are controlled from the top-down, epibiosis can strongly influence community dynamics. For the Carcinus/Mytilus system that we studied, the insitu distribution of <b>epibionts</b> on mussels reflected the epibiosis-determined preferences of the predator. Both direct and indirect effects are involved in determining these epibiont-prey-consumer interactions...|$|R

These <b>epibionts</b> were analyzed during the clinical inspection and the tissue changes related to its settlement, with filamentous algae around, were observed. Subsequently, the <b>epibionts</b> were identified by morphological observation. The knowledge about theses <b>epibionts</b> in Chile is reviewed and the potential occurrence of Debilitated Turtle Syndrome (DTS) in these turtles is discussed. The presence of sea turtles in the Chilean coast is considered a casual event, so there is little information on this issue. We propose it is necessary to carry out more studies on the association between turtles and <b>epibionts</b> because their identification, colonizing reptiles’ surface may give relevant information to a better understanding of different diseases, including DTS, that affect these marine reptiles and facilitates the development of strategies intended to recover their populations...|$|R
40|$|A {{distinct}} {{subgroup of}} euglenozoans, {{referred to as}} the ‘Symbiontida,' has been described from oxygen-depleted and sulfidic marine environments. By definition, all members of this group carry <b>epibionts</b> that are intimately associated with underlying mitochondrion-derived organelles {{beneath the surface of the}} hosts. We have used molecular phylogenetic and ultrastructural evidence to identify the rod-shaped <b>epibionts</b> of the two members of this group, Calkinsia aureus and B. bacati, hand-picked from the sediments of two separate oxygen-depleted, sulfidic environments. We identify their <b>epibionts</b> as closely related sulfur or sulfide-oxidizing members of the epsilon proteobacteria. The epsilon proteobacteria generally have a significant role in deep-sea habitats as primary colonizers, primary producers and/or in symbiotic associations. The <b>epibionts</b> likely fulfill a role in detoxifying the immediate surrounding environment for these two different hosts. The nearly identical rod-shaped <b>epibionts</b> on these two symbiontid hosts provides evidence for a co-evolutionary history between these two sets of partners. This hypothesis is supported by congruent tree topologies inferred from 18 S and 16 S rDNA from the hosts and bacterial <b>epibionts,</b> respectively. The eukaryotic hosts likely serve as a motile substrate that delivers the <b>epibionts</b> to the ideal locations with respect to the oxic/anoxic interface, whereby their growth rates can be maximized, perhaps also allowing the host to cultivate a food source. Because symbiontid isolates and additional small subunit rDNA gene sequences from this clade have now been recovered from many locations worldwide, the Symbiontida are likely more widespread and diverse than presently known...|$|R

In 2014, Álvarez-Campos et al. discovered the first epibiotic relationship between Cothurnia and a syllid polychaete that has not previously been observed before. This discovery leads them to suggest that Cothurnia maintained the epibiotic relationship on the motile substratum as an advantageous adaptation towards increasing food availability - as Cothurnia spends most of its life stage as a sessile organism.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUnder {{circumstances}} in which area for settlement is limited, the colonization of living substrata may become a highly valuable strategy for survival of marine invertebrates. This phenomenon, termed epibiosis, results in spatially close associations between two or more living organisms. Pelamis platurus, the yellow-bellied sea snake, is the only exclusively pelagic marine snake and its propensity for foraging along ocean slicks facilitates its colonization by pelagic <b>epibionts.</b> Herein, we report <b>epibionts</b> associated with P. platurus inhabiting the waters off the northwestern Pacific coast of Costa Rica. These associations include the first records of decapod <b>epibionts</b> from any marine snake. Decapod <b>epibionts</b> were found on 18. 9 % of P. platurus, and size of snake (total length) had a significant {{positive effect on the}} frequency and intensity of epibiosis. We discuss the spatial and ecological mechanisms that facilitate these interactions, as well as the suite of factors that either promote or deter epibiosis and ultimately dictate the frequency and intensity of these interactions. Finally, we provide a review of marine snake epibiosis.

However, the magnitude of interspecific competition for food in bivalve aquaculture settings remains inconclusive, especially in tropical areas. We investigated the interactions for food between the farmed pearl oyster Pinctada margaritiferaand its <b>epibionts,</b> using stable isotope analysis and feeding experiments. Inter- and intraspecificvariations of δ 13 C and δ 15 N stable isotope ratios (SIRs) were determined for oysters in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>epibionts.</b> The diet of the most abundant <b>epibionts,</b> Herdmania momus and Didemnum sp., was specified using isotope measurements and flow cytometry during feeding experiments, to determine the main phytoplankton groups consumed by these ascidians in naturalconditions. The absence of intraspecific variation in SIRs among oysters with or without <b>epibionts</b> suggested that the diet of P. margaritifera was not affected by the presence of <b>epibionts,</b> indicating a reduced diet overlap and no food limitation. The δ 13 C signature of ascidians (− 21 ‰) was lower than that of oysters (− 18 ‰), indicating a difference in organic matter sources ingested by thesefilter feeders despite receiving the same food mixture. While the main carbon source of oysters came from large particulate organic matter (POM) > 20 μm, our results showed that the diet of ascidians mainly came from smaller particles (POM < 20 μm) and reflects the composition of ambientwater (mainly picophytoplankton < 2 μm), which confirmed their lack of food selectivity. In the studied conditions, food competition between oysters and <b>epibionts,</b> specifically ascidians, was not a limiting factor, in spite of a diet overlap for nanophytoplankton...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{adaptation}} to novel biotic interactions and abiotic factors in introduced ranges can {{be critical to}} invasion success of both exotic terrestrial and aquatic plants. Seaweeds are extremely successful biological invaders in marine environments. Along with herbivores, foulers − ubiquitous enemies in the marine environment − {{have the potential to}} determine {{the success or failure of}} invasive seaweeds. However, research on the topic of rapid adaptation of seaweeds to biotic challenges is still in its nascent stages and rapid adaptation of seaweeds to fouling is unexplored. We tested whether the impressive invasion success of the red macroalga Gracilaria vermiculophylla may be enhanced by the rapid adaptation of chemical control (defence) of new bacterial <b>epibionts</b> in the invaded range. The native and invasive G. vermiculophylla populations investigated were equally well defended against currently co-occurring bacterial <b>epibionts</b> isolated from their respective ranges. In contrast, the native populations were weakly defended against bacterial <b>epibionts</b> from the invaded range, whereas the invasive populations were weakly defended against bacterial <b>epibionts</b> from their native range.

These results provide the first evidence that a change in habitat and, thus, confrontation by new enemies, may trigger rapid defence adaptation of seaweeds, which could be necessary for invasiveness. Such adaptation dynamics as found in the current study could be also applicable to other types of host plant – enemy interaction e. g. plant root – microbe interactions, freshwater plant – fouler interactions in general and for cases of shifting plant – enemy interactions in course of climate change...|$|R

50|$|Vampirococcus is a predatory prokaryotic genus {{that lives}} in anaerobic, aquatic conditions. This {{bacterium}} is distinguished from other predatory prokaryotes because it feeds upon its prey using epibiosis (also see <b>epibiont).</b> Vampirococcus cells are small and ovoid, being only 0.6μm wide. This small size is characteristic of prokaryotes - as they are smaller than eukaryotic cells - and is beneficial for predatory species, as discussed in the Prey and Predation section below. In addition, Vampirococcus specifically preys upon various species within the bacterial genus, Chromatium, a freshwater purple sulfur bacteria. Because Chromatium is a primary producer as a phototroph, {{it has been suggested}} that Vampirococcus could be considered a primary consumer as a predator of photosynthetic bacteria.|$|E

It attempts to avoid being eaten by sticking unpalatable seaweeds and invertebrates onto its carapace. These include the brown alga, Dictyota menstrualis and the sun sponge (Hymeniacidon heliophila). Along the East Coast of the US, where Dictyota menstrualis is present, these crabs recognize and preferentially select this chemically noxious algae. However, in places where the D. menstrualis is absent, L. dubia has an alternative camouflage method and {{does not appear to}} recognize the D. menstrualis.

50|$|An epiphyte is an {{organism}} that grows {{on the surface}} of a plant and derives its moisture and nutrients from the air, rain, water (in marine environments) or from debris accumulating around it.

Typically, the older parts of a plant will have more epiphytes growing on them. Epiphytes differ from parasites in that epiphytes grow on other plants for physical support and do not necessarily negatively affect the host. An epiphytic organism that is not a plant is sometimes called an <b>epibiont.</b> Epiphytes are usually found in the temperate zone (e.g., many mosses, liverworts, lichens, and algae) or in the tropics (e.g., many ferns, cacti, orchids, and bromeliads).
