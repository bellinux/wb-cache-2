40|$|Gifts of food were an {{integral}} part of late medieval culture. Small items, such as fruit, might be given by anyone. As part of commensality, sociability, hospitality and charity, food gifts underpinned customary patterns of life; they developed networks of relationships, establishing good lordship, and {{played an important role in}} negotiations. Patterns of giving demonstrate the distinctiveness and appropriateness of some categories of foodstuff, and illuminate the purposes of donors. Changes over time can be identified: indiscriminate hospitality or large-scale food alms fell out of common practice after the Black <b>Death</b> <b>and</b> <b>gifts</b> of money were preferred in some circumstances.

40|$|Data was {{collected}} from one hundred goats’ owners from peri- urban areas in Khartoum state and {{were used to}} study the characteristics of dairy goat production. Reproduction traits, diseases prevalence, breeding objectives, feeding, housing and constraints were investigated. Crossbred flocks had the highest flock size, followed by flocks made up of Nubian goats and pure Saanen flocks recorded the lowest herd size. The main reasons for males to exit the flock were sales, slaughter and gifts. The main reasons for females’ disposal were sales, <b>death</b> <b>and</b> <b>gifts.</b> 33. 0 % of owners constructed goat pens using untreated wood, 32. 0 % of owners used plastic sheets and scrap iron, 19. 0 % used iron sheets, and 11. 0 % used mud and a few used bricks and concrete for construction. A Few owners had clear ideas about the long-term aims of their goat enterprise.

40|$|Three primary {{categories}} of legislation pertaining to transfer taxes {{have been introduced}} in the 110 th Congress.

In her collection of nonfiction essays, Coming Home, Catherine Doucette explores themes of space, loneliness, community, and relationship. Landscape and setting play essential roles as Doucette struggles to fit in and find where she belongs. From the Swiss Alps, Guatemala, New York, and Oregon, to her childhood home in New Hampshire, she grapples with ideas of place, family, and connection. Often Doucette best understands her relationships when entwined {{with the experience of}} the outdoors, the brutal realities of nature, and breathtaking mountain experiences. Doucette also seeks to root herself in the midst of shifting contexts from new dynamics in friendships, to births, <b>deaths,</b> <b>and</b> unexpected <b>gifts...</b>|$|R

(John 6, Gal 1:4, 1 Tim 2:6, Matt 20:28) These gifts, as he offered them up at the demand of justice on Mount Calvary for us, so now he is in heaven he presenteth them continually before God, as <b>gifts</b> <b>and</b> sacrifice valuable for the sins, for all the sins that we, through infirmity, do commit, from the day of our conversion to the day of our <b>death.</b> <b>And</b> these <b>gifts</b> are so satisfactory, so prevalent with God, that they always prevail for a continual remission of our sins with him. Yea, they prevail with him for more than for the remission of sins; we have, through their procurement, our graces often renewed, the devil often rebuked, the snare often broken, guilt often taken away from the conscience, and many a blessed smile from God, and love-look from his life-creating countenance.

Inciting global panic with a virus {{featuring}} a video of Light as Kira, Shien then makes contact with Light's girlfriend and former ally, Misa Amane. After restoring her memories of <b>Death</b> Notes <b>and</b> <b>gifting</b> her with his, Shien asks Misa to disclose information which he believes will reveal where Light is hiding; she refuses, having watched Light seemingly die ten years ago. Undaunted, Shien uses his exceptional hacking abilities to locate three Death Notes, killing their owners in the process. He then impersonates Kira via another virus, threatening a killing spree unless L's successor reveals his name and face. In response, Ryuzaki spreads a CGI video of the original L, inviting Kira to a website intended to trick him into revealing his location. Anticipating this, Shien escapes before killing one of the original Kira investigators - Touta Matsuda.

40|$|Following {{the near}} death {{experience}} of the federal <b>gift</b> <b>and</b> estate tax in 2010, the hundredth anniversary of the tax represents an ideal moment {{to reflect on the}} role of this tax and whether an alternative approach might be more desirable and sustainable. This Article examines four prominent alternatives to the current tax: an annual wealth tax, taxing unrealized gains at <b>death,</b> including <b>gifts</b> <b>and</b> inheritances in income, and a lifetime accessions tax that would apply to the cumulative value of <b>gifts</b> <b>and</b> inheritances received by individuals over their lifetimes. In order to assess these alternatives, the Article reconsiders the reasons for taxing wealth transfers, arguing that the primary purpose of a wealth transfer tax is not to raise revenue or enhance progressivity, but to regulate intergenerational transfers of wealth in order to reduce unearned concentrations of wealth and power and promote fair equality of opportunity. On this basis, it argues that a lifetime accessions tax is an attractive alternative to the current tax...|$|R
