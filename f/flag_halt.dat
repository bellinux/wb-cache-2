60|$|Four {{hours later}} {{they passed through}} Conkanelly, and crossed the bridge over {{a branch of the}} Cauvery. Here Dick felt that his horse was <b>flagging.</b> <b>Halting,</b> he dismounted, and lifted Annie down. This time the {{movement}} woke her; she gave a little cry.|$|R
50|$|The race {{started with}} a long green flag run of 149 laps. Charlie Kimball and Scott Dixon {{suffered}} single-car crashes, then James Hinchcliffe and Ed Carpenter tangled on a restart. The red <b>flag</b> <b>halted</b> the race with 9 laps {{to go for a}} crash involving Townsend Bell. After the restart, Ryan Hunter-Reay and Hélio Castroneves dueled for the win, followed closely Marco Andretti. Hunter-Reay won the race by 0.06 seconds, the second closest finish in Indy 500 history.|$|R
5|$|Vettel {{was again}} fastest in third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, narrowly ahead of Hamilton's Mercedes. Before all drivers {{were able to}} set times on the super-soft tyres, Fernando Alonso coming to {{a stop on the}} start/finish straight brought out a red <b>flag,</b> <b>halting</b> the session. When practice resumed, rain had started to fall, preventing the drivers from improving on their times. Only Force India driver Sergio Pérez set a lap on the faster tyre compound, ending up fourth in the session.|$|R
2500|$|... 1980: Heavy winds during Daytona 500 pole {{qualifying}} {{delayed the}} proceedings and the ARCA 200 began 90 minutes later than scheduled. As 3pm approached, the ARCA race was red <b>flagged</b> and <b>halted</b> {{so that the}} Busch Clash could be held as scheduled and be shown on live television. After the Clash was finished, the ARCA race resumed.|$|R
60|$|The night passed quietly. Just as the {{sun rose}} a trumpet sounded, calling for a truce; and two knights in armour rode forward, {{followed}} by an esquire carrying a white <b>flag.</b> They <b>halted</b> thirty or forty yards from the gate; and the countess herself came up on to the wall, when the knight raised his vizor.|$|R
50|$|Merhi {{then set}} his sights on Nasr, trying on two {{successive}} laps at Lisboa, before yellow <b>flags</b> <b>halted</b> his challenge for a time as Félix da Costa's car was recovered, and also due to the debris from the Bradley-Evans collision. The race's overtaking was curtailed on the eighth lap, as Eriksson put his Motopark car into the barriers at Police, and as such, the race ended under the safety car. Wittmann thus took victory and pole position for the Grand Prix itself, and would be joined on the front row by Nasr after holding off Merhi's advances. Merhi completed the podium, ahead of Bottas, who finished fourth ahead of Huertas, Juncadella, Vanthoor, Abt, Sato and van Asseldonk, the last quartet gaining positions after Asmer slowed. Outside the top ten, Yamauchi finished eleventh ahead of Sekiguchi, Buller, Foresti, Stanaway, Lloyd, Jaafar, Asmer, Magnussen, Sainz, Rosenqvist and Evans rounded out the 22 classified finishers.|$|R
50|$|The green {{came out}} on lap 180, with Ryan Hunter-Reay leading. The lead shuffled quickly between Marco Andretti, Hélio Castroneves, {{and then back to}} Hunter-Reay. Then on lap 191, Townsend Bell crashed hard into the outside wall at the exit of turn two. With less than nine laps remaining, {{officials}} elected to put out the red <b>flag</b> and <b>halted</b> the race to allow workers to clean up the incident, and allow the opportunity for a green flag finish. Considerable debris, along with damage to the SAFER Barrier and catchfence, required a red flag of nearly 11 minutes.|$|R
50|$|On {{the final}} pace lap, Tom Sneva veered {{off-course}} {{at the exit}} of turn 2. Further down the backstretch, a massive smoke bomb was set off by some unruly spectators. The yellow flag was displayed, and the start was waved off. The next time by, the field was red <b>flagged,</b> and <b>halted</b> on the frontstretch. Sneva's crash was cleaned up, but {{it was determined that}} the field had burned an unnecessary four laps of fuel. A decision was made to replenish each of the 32 remaining cars' pitside fuel tanks with 3 gallons of methanol. The red flag wound up delaying the start by over a half-hour.|$|R
50|$|Jerry Grant {{ran out of}} fuel on lap 91, {{bringing}} out the yellow. The green came back out on lap 95 with Rutherford first and Foyt second. Rain was quickly approaching. The yellow came out for drizzle on lap 100. On lap 103, the rain began to fall harder, and the red <b>flag</b> was displayed, <b>halting</b> the race. The race was stopped at approximately 12:42 p.m. local time.|$|R
5000|$|A marker near titled [...] "Lee's Last Attack" [...] says: At a last {{council of}} war held on Saturday, April 8, Lee ordered Gordon's {{infantry}} and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry {{to clear the}} stage road of Union cavalry. The Union horsemen were pushed back but arrival of bluecoated infantry again blocked the escape route. A <b>flag</b> of truce <b>halted</b> the fighting while General Lee negotiated the surrender of his army.|$|R
5000|$|A {{controversial}} finish to the 2004 Aaron's 499 at Talladega {{occurred as}} Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. were racing {{for the lead}} with five laps remaining. The field was working Lap 184 of 188, beyond the point of when a red <b>flag</b> could <b>halt</b> the race (the last red flag lap was 184). As Earnhardt, Jr. was passing Gordon for the lead, Brian Vickers spun in turn three. When the caution was displayed, freezing the field, {{it was determined that}} Gordon's car was just ahead of Earnhardt's, and Gordon was scored as the leader, and thus, the winner. On the final lap, some angry fans again threw debris (seat cushions, alcoholic beverage bottles) on the track at Gordon's car, which angered many observers, including Fox commentators Chris Myers and Jeff Hammond.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was opened}} as <b>Flag</b> Station <b>Halt</b> in 1868, a private station built for Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 6th Baronet but {{which could be}} used by the public by his consent. It was officially advertised as Flag Station from 14 September 1931, the name given as Sir Watkin or his staff would stop the train by raising a flag. It gained the 'Halt' suffix from 4 July 1938 and finally became Glan Llyn Halt on 25 September 1950. There was never a signal box, passing place nor freight {{facilities}} here. It closed in 1965. The Bala Lake Railway opened in 1972, but did not reach Glan Llyn until the following year. The station here remained closed, and was not re-opened until {{the early part of the}} twenty-first century when the station was chosen to play a role in special [...] "Santa Special" [...] trains.|$|R
5000|$|Truex got a {{superior}} restart to Johnson on the lap 252 restart. As {{with the previous}} run, this settled into a green <b>flag</b> run, <b>halted</b> when Larson suffered a right-front tire blowout and slammed the wall in Turn 1 on lap 292, bringing out the seventh caution. Larson said he was [...] "really loose" [...] entering (Turn) 3, [...] "hit the wall" [...] earlier in the stage, sustained [...] "a lot of damage and the tire started {{to go down and}} then exploded in (Turn) 1. I just hate it that I made a mistake there in Turn 3 and got in the wall. I was not even running hard up there. I just got loose and then I hit it and it ruined our day.” Ricky Stenhouse Jr. elected not to pit and assumed the race lead.|$|R
50|$|The {{qualifying}} {{sessions for}} both the GT and Prototype categories were marked by several red <b>flag</b> periods which <b>halted</b> the sessions. These were caused by several accidents and car failures on circuit, which left five cars unable to complete a flying lap time. Peugeot was able to lock out the first row by margin of over a second from the leading Aston Martin, while the returning Team Essex Porsche RS Spyder secured pole position in LMP2. Jetalliance Racing gave Aston Martin a pole in GT1 and championship leaders Team Felbermayr-Proton led GT2.|$|R
2500|$|The race {{started at}} 15:30 local time. The {{conditions}} on the grid {{at the beginning of}} the race were dry and sunny with an air temperature of [...] and a track temperature at [...] Juncadella failed to start the event after his crash during the qualification race which damaged the tub of his car. When the Grand Prix began from its standing start, Rosenqvist led the field going into Lisboa corner but Leclerc challenged him. Leclerc steered onto the outside line and overtook Rosenqvist under braking at Lisboa corner for the lead. A slow exit from Leclerc leaving the final turn as he was completing the final lap allowed Rosenqvist to draw close. Rosenqvist passed Leclerc by running in his slipstream and turning onto the inside line to reclaim first place. Leclerc then moved into Rosenqvist's slipstream and executed a carbon-copy move of his first lap overtake with the latter overtaking Rosenqvist around the outside for the lead. Shortly after a large crash involving the Carlin duo of Menezes and Tveter and Takaboshi caused the race to be red <b>flagged</b> to a <b>halt</b> since there was debris littered across the track. All three drivers were unhurt.|$|R
