Solvents like diethyl ether and chloroform have been used in medicine as anesthetics, sedatives, and hypnotics for a long time. Ethanol (grain alcohol) is a widely used and abused psychoactive drug.

5000|$|One of {{the early}} musical {{references}} to inhalant use occurs in the 1974 Elton John song [...] "The Bitch Is Back", in the line [...] "I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue." [...] Inhalant use, especially <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing,</b> is widely associated with the late-1970s punk youth subculture in the UK and North America. Raymond Cochrane and Douglas Carroll claim that when <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing</b> became widespread in the late 1970s, it was [...] "adopted by punks because public negative perceptions of sniffing fitted in with their self-image" [...] as rebels against societal values. While punks at first used inhalants [...] "experimentally and as a cheap high, adult disgust and hostility the practice encouraged punks to use <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing</b> {{as a way of}} shocking society." [...] As well, using inhalants was a way of expressing their anti-corporatist DIY (do it yourself) credo; by using inexpensive household products as inhalants, punks did not have to purchase industrially manufactured liquor or beer.One history of the punk subculture argues that [...] "substance abuse was often referred to in the music and did become synonymous with the genre, <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing</b> especially" [...] because the youths' [...] "faith in the future had died and that the youth just didn't care anymore" [...] due to the [...] "awareness of the threat of nuclear war and a pervasive sense of doom." [...] In a BBC interview with a person who was a punk in the late 1970s, they said that [...] "there was a real fear of imminent nuclear war—people were sniffing glue knowing that it could kill them, but they didn't care because they believed that very soon everybody would be dead anyway." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1984, Rick Dees, a disc jockey, {{sought and}} was refused {{permission}} to use Marvin Fisher’s song [...] "When Sunny Gets Blue", {{with the intention of}} creating a [...] "comedic and inoffensive" [...] version. Although the request was rejected, Dees released an album, Put It Where the Moon Don’t Shine, with a song entitled When Sunny <b>Sniffs</b> <b>Glue.</b> It sampled from the very recognizable main theme, along with recognizably altered song lyrics: [...] "When Sunny gets blue, her eyes get gray and cloudy, then the rain begins to fall" [...] was changed to"When Sunny <b>sniffs</b> <b>glue,</b> her eyes get red and bulgy, then her hair begins to fall." [...] The parody used 29 seconds of the song. Fisher and his affiliated parties filed a complaint on the grounds of unfair competition, defamation and copyright infringement.|$|R

5000|$|Similar {{incidents}} of <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing</b> among destitute {{youth in the}} Philippines have also been reported, most commonly from groups of street children and teenagers collectively known as [...] "Rugby" [...] boys, which were named after a brand of toluene-laden contact cement. Other toluene-containing substances have also been subject to abuse, most notably the Vulca Seal brand of roof sealants. Bostik Philippines, which currently owns the Rugby and Vulca Seal brands, has since responded to the issue by adding bitterants such as mustard oil to their Rugby line, as well as reformulating it by replacing toluene with xylene. Several other manufacturers have also followed suit.|$|E

At Westminster, he co-sponsored the Commons motion against narcotic <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing,</b> a problem then growing in schools, attacked “diktats” from Whitehall which he said were destroying local government, and repeatedly criticised the Conservative government’s “squeeze” on education funding.|$|E

50|$|Interest {{in model}} car kits began to wane in the mid-1970s, {{and while the}} precise causes are not {{perfectly}} clear, some factors were a sharp rise {{in the price of}} plastics, parents becoming cautious of <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing</b> and, later, the rise of video gaming (Miller 2011). A revival of sorts was seen in the late 1980s, especially among adults, as Monogram introduced a series of replicas of NASCAR race cars, as did AMT with a kit of the 1966 Chevrolet Nova, which American modelers had been requesting for years. New model specific magazines sprang up, such as Scale Auto Enthusiast, (now simply Scale Auto) and Model Cars Magazine!. These magazines spread the word, helped advertisers, and brought a new generation of modelers together from all across the country.|$|E

Originally used experimentally and as a cheap high, adult disgust and hostility encouraged punks to use <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing</b> {{as a way of}} shocking society." [...] Model airplane glue and contact cement were among the numerous solvents and inhalants used by punks for the euphoria and intoxication that inhaling the products created. Glue was typically inhaled by placing a quantity of glue in a bag and [...] "huffing" [...] (inhaling) the vapour. Liquid solvents were typically inhaled by soaking a rag with the solvent and inhaling the vapour. While users inhale solvents for the intoxicating effects, the solvents can be harmful or fatal, with asphyxiation by the plastic bags used being one of the causes of death.|$|E
50|$|In the US, ether {{was used}} as a {{recreational}} drug during the 1930s Prohibition era, when alcohol was made illegal. Ether was either sniffed or drunk and, in some towns, replaced alcohol entirely. However, the risk of death from excessive sedation or overdose is greater than that with alcohol, and ether drinking is associated with damage to the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Use of glue, paint and gasoline became more common after the 1950s. Abuse of aerosol sprays became more common in the 1980s, as older propellants such as CFCs were phased out and replaced by more environmentally friendly compounds such as propane and butane. Most inhalant solvents and gases are not regulated under drug laws such as the United States' Controlled Substances Act. However, many US states and Canadian cities have placed restrictions on the sale of some solvent-containing products to minors, particularly for products widely associated with sniffing, such as model cement. The practice of inhaling such substances is sometimes colloquially referred to as huffing, sniffing (or <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing),</b> dusting, or chroming.|$|E

5000|$|Even though solvent glue is {{normally}} a legal product, {{there is a}} case where a court has ruled that supplying glue to children is illegal. Khaliq v HM Advocate was a Scottish criminal case decided by the High Court of Justiciary on appeal, in which it was decided that it was an offence at common law to supply <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing</b> materials that were otherwise legal in the knowledge that they would be used recreationally by children. Two shopkeepers in Glasgow were arrested and charged with supplying to children [...] "glue-sniffing kits" [...] consisting of a quantity of petroleum-based glue in a plastic bag. They argued there was nothing illegal about the items that they had supplied. On appeal, the High Court took the view that, even though glue and plastic bags might be perfectly legal, everyday items, the two shopkeepers knew perfectly well that the children were going to use the articles as inhalants and the charge on the indictment should stand. When the case came to trial at Glasgow High Court the two were sentenced to three years' imprisonment.|$|E
50|$|Ali Zaoua is a Moroccan film which {{reflects}} {{the beliefs of}} the people that how they are sticking with their faith blindly based on their pre-conception. The conception is just fake idea but believed to be as reality. The film has been described as magical realism, in the sense of how the stark reality of the children’s lives interweaves with their rich fantasy life. The contrast between real life and fantasy life shows the strong part of their beliefs. In their feeling and practice they are very different from each other. In this film Ali, Kwita, Omar and Boubker are street kids. The daily dose of <b>glue</b> <b>sniffing</b> represents their only escape from reality. Ali wants to become a sailor - when he was living with his mother, a prostitute, he used to listen to a fairy tale about the sailor who discovered the miracle island with two suns. Instead of finding his island in the dream, Ali and his friends are confronted with Dib’s gang. Matters are getting serious; the four kids separated themselves from Dib’s gang. As a result, Ali Zaoua is killed by Dib’s gang when he is hit by a stone. Omar and Baker wanted to bury him as king but circumstances do not support them.|$|E
