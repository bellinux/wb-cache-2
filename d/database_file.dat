25|$|Media {{files are}} stored on an iPod in a hidden folder, {{along with a}} {{proprietary}} <b>database</b> <b>file.</b> The hidden content can be accessed on the host operating system by enabling hidden files to be shown. The media files can then be recovered manually by copying the files or folders off the iPod. Many third-party applications also allow easy copying of media files off of an iPod.|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} some {{peculiar}} issues. If Btrieve uses Windows file sharing {{and has the}} database engine open files directly on a file share, for instance, and there is network instability (e.g. a network cable is disconnected) during an update the fields used to link one Btrieve file to another can become unsynchronized (to {{all intents and purposes}} the data loses its relationships or links to other data) and the <b>database</b> <b>file</b> itself can get corrupted (though the chance of this is reduced due to pre-image paging).|$|E

Each process has within its address space all the logic needed to manage the database, and processes cooperate with one another to manage database files. When a <b>database</b> <b>file</b> is journaled, updates are written to journal files before being written to database files, and {{in the event of a}} system crash, database files can be recovered from journal files.|$|E
