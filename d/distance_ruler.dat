Transverse decay channels, full retardation and graphene-field coupling to all orders are included, extending previous instantaneous results. For neutral graphene, a virtually exact analytical expression for the fluorescence yield is derived, valid for arbitrary distances and only based on the fine structure constant α, the fluorescent wavelength λ, and distance z.

It {{is capable of}} crosslinking membranes and has recently been speculated to trigger fusion by decreasing the gap between them. As quantitative information on membrane gaps is key to understanding general cellular mechanisms, including the role of ​syt- 1, we developed a fluorescence-lifetime based inter-membrane <b>distance</b> <b>ruler</b> using membrane-anchored DNAs of various lengths as calibration standards. Wild-type and mutant data provide evidence that full-length ​syt- 1 indeed regulates membrane gaps: without Ca 2 +, ​syt- 1 maintains membranes at distances of ~ 7 – 8 [*]nm. Activation with 100 [*]μM Ca 2 + decreases the distance to ~ 5 [*]nm by binding the C 2 domains to opposing membranes, respectively. These values reveal that activated ​syt- 1 adjusts membrane distances to the level that promotes SNARE complex assembly...|$|E

5000|$|Historically, {{tropical}} cyclone tracking charts {{were used to}} include the past track and prepare future forecasts at Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers. The need for a more modernized method for forecasting {{tropical cyclone}}s had become apparent to operational weather forecasters by the mid-1980s. At that time the United States Department of Defense was using paper maps, acetate, grease pencils, and disparate computer programs to forecast tropical cyclones. [...] The Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF) software {{was developed by the}} Naval Research Laboratory for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) beginning in 1986, and used since 1988. During 1990 the system was adapted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for use at the NHC, National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. This provided the NHC with a multitasking software environment which allowed them to improve efficiency and cut the time required to make a forecast by 25% or 1 hour. ATCF was originally developed for use within DOS, before later being adapted to Unix and Linux.

He stressed that the rhumb line distance is an acceptable approximation for true great circle distance for courses of short or moderate distance, particularly at lower latitudes. He even quantifies his statement: [...] "When the great circle distances which are to be measured {{in the vicinity of}} the equator do not exceed 20 degrees of a great circle, or 15 degrees near Spain and France, or 8 and even 10 degrees in northern parts it is convenient to use rhumb line distances".|$|R
40|$|Homologous {{series of}} solvatochromic {{surfactants}} have been synthesized to study polarity at liquid/liquid interfaces. Each surfactant series consists of hydrophobic, para-nitroanisole-based chromophores attached to ionic headgroups by n-alkyl spacers. By incorporating these components these molecules {{have the capability}} of functioning as molecular rulers: probes of molecular-scale variation in solvation forces across liquid/liquid interfaces. Changing the chromophore-headgroup separation should enable different members of a homologous series to span different interfacial widths, thus exposing the chromophore to different chemical environments. This idea is explored by using surface-specific, non-linear optical spectroscopy. Resonance-enhanced second harmonic generation spectra of molecular rulers have been collected at weakly and strongly associating liquid/liquid interfaces. At weakly associating interfaces between water and four alkanes (cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, octane, and hexadecane), data suggest that all four water/alkane interfaces are molecularly sharp (< 9 Å), but that differences in the solvent molecular structure alter the transition from aqueous to organic solvation across the interface. Polarity across two interfaces (cyclohexane and hexadecane) changes gradually over the <b>distance</b> spanned by <b>ruler</b> surfactants. In contrast, the transitions at the interfaces between water and both methylcyclohexane and octane appear much more abrupt. These findings appear to correlate with each organic solvent's ability to pack and associated free volume. More free volume in the organic phase leads to a more abrupt water/alkane interface. At strongly associating interfaces between water and four alcohols (1 -octanol, 1 &# 64979;decanol, 3 -octanol, and 2, 6 -dimethyl- 4 -heptanol), data suggest that all four water/alcohol interfaces contain a region of reduced polarity between the polar water phase and the bulk alcohol. We attribute this region to the alignment of the alkyl chains of the interfacial alcohol molecules. Polarity across the two interfaces with linear alcohols changes gradually over the <b>distances</b> spanned by <b>ruler</b> surfactants. In contrast, transitions at the interfaces between water and the two branched alcohols appear much more abrupt.

In spite of being a significant indicator of function, behavior, and performance, MCPS is rarely used in clinics and schools to identify kids with slowed motor cognitive processing. The reason behind this {{is the lack of}} availability of convenient formula to estimate MCPS. Thereby, the aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the MCPS in the primary schoolchildren. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and four primary schoolchildren, aged 6 – 12 years, were recruited by the cluster sampling method for this cross-sectional study. MCPS was estimated by the ruler drop method (RDM). By this method, a metallic stainless steel ruler was suspended vertically such that 5 cm graduation of the lower was aligned between the web space of the child's hand, and the child was asked to catch the moving ruler as quickly as possible, once released from the examiner's hand. <b>Distance</b> the <b>ruler</b> traveled was recorded and converted into time, which is the MCPS. Multiple regression analysis of variables was performed to determine the influence of independent variables on MCPS. Results: Mean MCPS of the entire sample of 204 primary schoolchildren is 230. 01 ms ± 26. 5 standard deviation (95 % confidence interval; 226. 4 – 233. 7 ms) that ranged from 162. 9 to 321. 6 ms.

40|$|Working {{from the}} {{perspective}} of possessive individualism (without implying that the author believes this is the compass of human nature), this thesis challenges the widely held liberal belief that possessive individualists need states to restrain them from trespassing on the natural rights of others (and harming themselves). Hobbes argues, in his answer to the Foole, that it is rational to co-operate voluntarily in a state of nature and consistent with natural rights to prefer (under certain conditions) the state of nature to the commonwealth. Hobbes thus presents political options: archy or anarchy. But can anarchy be sufficiently sustained to accommodate the long-term self-interests of possessive individualists? The question is tested against one form of libertarian anarchism which, however, is found to be vulnerable to decay into self-defeating anarchy. Another libertarian approach to anarchy implies that anarchy will always degenerate and that a minimal state will have to be created to protect natural rights holders. However, it is argued against that view this, given a certain social structure, natural rights can be protected in a state of nature. It follows that anarchy will not always degenerate into self-defeating anarchy. In the general field of possessive individualism Hobbes proves to be more far-sighted than those theorists who insist that only the state or only anarchy is both viable and legitimate. He saw a case for both. The second half of the thesis expands on the idea used as a counter-example to the inevitability of (at least) a minimal state. The expansion exercise is intended to show how an anarchic community can be designed to protect itself from degeneration into self-defeating anarchy and the need for a state. Firstly the putatively utopian idea of unanimous direct democracy is modified slightly to show how, in practical terms, when members of the community obey its laws they are obeying their own wills. That reduces the <b>distance</b> between <b>rulers</b> and ruled to vanishing point. But the practical solution is short of the utopian ideal. The community still has to reckon on the presence of free riders and requires means to preserve itself from the damage they bring about. This is managed through a socio-legal system which, in the first place, makes free riding itself a costly and unattractive proposition. Secondly, when it occurs, in spite of being so risky, the acephalous community has very efficient means to rid itself of transgressors. The final matter discussed here is tactics to avoid large wealth differentials creating internal conflicts in the community without having to use centralised coercive methods to redistribute wealth. Two approaches are discussed. The former is rejected in favour of the latter on the grounds of empirical feasibility. Anarchism, it is concluded, is a viable option for possessive individualists which, moreover, does not require them to compromise their natural rights as the state, even a minimal state, will. Though modern liberal democratic states are sometimes held up as paradigm custodians of natural rights, and therefore legitimated on that ground, yet they are {{by no means the only}} legitimate form of polity (on those terms).

40|$|The {{present study}} tries {{to explore the}} {{dynamics}} of, and identify a possible pattern to, {{the relationship between the}} Chishti Sufi Silsilah and the Sultanate of Delhi in India during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The available literature studying the relationship between the Chishti Silsilah and the Sultanate of Delhi deals primarily with the relationship between the individual Chishti Sufis and their contemporary Sultans. In such studies, however, the institutional landscape of the Silsilah and the Sultanate is missing. On the contrary, if a study focuses merely on the interaction between the two institutions, the role of the personalities and the significance of the personal factors are overlooked. The present study, therefore, tries to concurrently address the roles of Chishti Sufis and the Sultans of Delhi in their individual as well as institutional contexts. Soon after the inception of the ChishtI Silsilah in India in {{the last decade of the}} twelfth century, Khwajah Mu'in aI-Din Chishti of Ajmer, along with his contemporary Chishti Shaykhs, laid down the principles of the Silsilah. They also carved out a space, an environment for independent action and practice of Chishti principles, free from the interference of the state, for their Silsilah in the Sultanate of Delhi. In fact, from the very beginning, the Chishtis made it a definite policy to keep a <b>distance</b> from the <b>rulers</b> for which the Chishtis practiced the following principles: first, not accepting services under the Sultans; secondly, not accepting lands or jagirs from the Sultans, the ruling elite and other influential people; thirdly, not agreeing to visit of their khanqahs by the Sultans; and lastly, not visiting the 'Court' of the Sultans'' Of Delhi. In addition, the Chishti Shaykhs used their individual judgment in regard to three things: first, the acceptance or rejection of the cash grants or futuh items offered by the Sultans and the umara', secondly, avoiding or admitting the umara' in their company, and lastly, extending help to the Sultans or the Sultanate of Delhi. During the ensuing decades, the Chishtts expanded the space of their Silsilah by further dissemination of the Chishti principles and more pronounced practice of them in the Sultanate. However, during the fourteenth century the state attempted to encroach on the space of the Silsilah by pressurizing the Chishtis to compromise the extent of the practice of the principles of the Silsilah. In response, the Chis'hti Shaykhs tried to defend and preserve the space of the SilsiIah. Nonetheless, the descendants of the -Chishti Shaykhs, who had by now assumed the status of sajjadah-nashins, or the hereditary guardians of the Chishtt shrines, tried to negotiate the space with the state by adjusting or redefining the limits of the independent space of the Silsilah in view of the state demands. Thus, in the Sultanate of Delhi during the two centuries, the official attitude towards the Silsilah witnessed considerable shifts a number of times. One may discern varied types of responses and interaction between them ranging from mutual respect, despite differences, to stresses and strains. In studying the relationship between the Chishti Silsilah and the Sultanate of Delhi, the argument is that the relationship between these two institutions can be understood by taking 'space' as central to their interaction. The space was important for both the Silsilah and the Sultanate; for the adherents of the Silsilah to freely practice the Chishti principles, and for the Sultanate for reasons of the perceived political importance of the space, and/or personal and religious/spiritual considerations of the Sultans. The study brings out that there is a discernable pattern to the interaction between the two. The Chishtt Shaykhs maintained a safe distance from the Sultans and the Delhi court, and also tried not to antagonize the political authorities by minimizing any chances of overt conflict with and open defiance of the state. in order to keep a distance from the state and politics, and maintain the space of the Chshti Silsilah, -the Chishtis acted upon the above mentioned principles, and at the same time used their individual judgment in some matters as well. For arrangement of data, the present study employs a chronological scheme for studying the relationship between, the Chishti Silsilah and the Delhi Sultanate, though it periodizes their relationship in various phases in a thematic manner. After the first two introductory chapters on Sufism and the Delhi Sultanate, the third chapter investigates how the Chishtl Sufis carved out an independent space for their Silsilah in the Sultanate. The fourth chapter explores how the eminent ChishtI Shaykhs, including Baba Farid and Shaykh Nizam aI-Din Awliya', expanded the space of their Silsilah. The fifth chapter analyzes the shift in the state policy towards the Sufi 'under Sultan Muhammad ibn Tughluq, when the state tried to encroach on the space of the Silsilah, and the Chisti Shaykhs tried to defend it. The sixth and the last chapter examines the attitude of the descendants of the Chishti Shaykhs towards the state and political power, as some of them negotiated the autonomous space of the Silsilah with the sta...|$|R
