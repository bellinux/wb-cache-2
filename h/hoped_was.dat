5|$|The oldest {{team member}} was Amanda Carter, aged 48, who {{was coming back}} for a fourth Paralympic games having competed in the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona, the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta and the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, at which she had been sidelined by a {{crippling}} elbow injury. She returned to the Gliders' lineup in 2009. The youngest, who had not even been born when Carter had played in Barcelona, was 19-year-old Amber Merritt. British-born Merritt was originally a swimmer, but had been recruited into basketball by the Paralympic Hall of Fame coach Frank Ponta. Merritt had averaged 20 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in the Gliders' World Challenge series against Japan, Germany and China in Sydney in July 2012, including a game against Germany in which she scored 21 points and eight rebounds. Another young player from whom much was <b>hoped</b> <b>was</b> Cobi Crispin, who had been named Australian Women’s Wheelchair Basketball International Player of the Year in 2011, and had since posted impressive performances in the May 2012 Paralympic World Cup in Manchester and the Gliders World Challenge.|$|E
25|$|Hindus, like Muslims, Sikhs, {{and members}} of other {{religious}} groups, experienced severe dislocation and violence during the massive population exchanges associated with the partition of India, as members of various communities moved to what they <b>hoped</b> <b>was</b> the relative safety of an area {{where they would be}} a religious majority. Hindus were among the between 200,000 and a million who died during the rioting and other violence associated with the partition.|$|E
500|$|The {{legislature}} {{elected in}} the Know Nothing sweep was unlike any that preceded it: {{almost all of}} its members were new to elected office. [...] The 1855 session {{was one of the}} most productive in the state's history, with about 600 bills and resolutions passed. [...] In his inaugural address, Gardner set what he <b>hoped</b> <b>was</b> a tone that would solidify his position has the party leader. [...] The speech focused almost to exclusion on nativist issues, and included hyperbolic claims that the level of immigration was reaching crisis proportions. Gardner notably omitted popular substantive reform issues such as the ten-hour workday, and also avoided the contentious subject of slavery.|$|E
40|$|Hope {{plays an}} {{important}} role in all individuals’ lives both today and in the future. While <b>hope</b> and hopelessness <b>are</b> important concepts and the subjects of much theorizing in psychology, theology, philosophy, political science, nursing, as well as in literature and the arts, it is absent from economics. This silence on <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> notable since <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> fundamentally at the centre of choice, especially intertemporal choice, which is at the centre of economic analysis. To place hope at the centre of intertemporal choice, it is important to clearly define what <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> and what it <b>is</b> not. What <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not <b>is</b> constant. <b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> not optimism; <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not unfounded dreams divorced from reality; <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not irrational. I distil what <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> from its characterization in a number of different disciplines. A comparison of characterizations identifies a number of commonalities and common definitions. Using the derived set of definitions, I incorporate hope into economic analysis, consider what implications hope has for the modelling of choice and for economic behaviour, and discuss whether <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> implicitly imbedded in or has been abandoned, to our eternal cost, by economics.

500|$|Matheson's script freely devised an {{elaborate}} narrative that barely resembled Poe, {{with only the}} finale having any similarity {{at all to the}} original short story on which the film was based. [...] Corman noted, [...] "The method we adopted on The Pit and the Pendulum was to use the Poe short story as the climax for a third act to the motion picture... because a two-page short story is not about to give you a ninety-minute motion picture. [...] We then constructed the first two acts in what we <b>hoped</b> <b>was</b> a manner faithful to Poe, as his climax would run only a short time on the screen." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1957 to 1962 Kerst was {{employed}} at the General Atomics division of General Dynamics's John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science in La Jolla, California, {{where he worked}} on plasma physics, which it was <b>hoped</b> <b>was</b> {{the doorway to the}} control of thermonuclear energy. With Tihiro Ohkawa he invented toroidal devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields. The two completed this work at the University of Wisconsin, where Kerst was a professor from 1962 until his retirement in 1980. Their devices were the first to contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs, and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit. [...] From 1972 to 1973 he was also chairman of the Plasma Physics Division of the American Physical Society.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} {{libretto}} that Illica produced for Puccini resurfaced in 2000 after being lost for many years. It contains considerable differences {{from the final}} libretto, relatively minor {{in the first two}} acts but much more appreciable in the third, where the description of the Roman dawn that opens the third act is much longer, and Cavaradossi's tragic aria, the eventual [...] "E lucevan le stelle", has different words. The 1896 libretto also offers a different ending, in which Tosca does not die but instead goes mad. In the final scene, she cradles her lover's head in her lap and hallucinates that she and her Mario are on a gondola, and that she is asking the gondolier for silence. Sardou refused to consider this change, insisting that as in the play, Tosca must throw herself from the parapet to her death. Puccini agreed with Sardou, telling him that the mad scene would have the audiences anticipate the ending and start moving towards the cloakrooms. Puccini pressed his librettists hard, and Giacosa issued a series of melodramatic threats to abandon the work. The two librettists were finally able to give Puccini what they <b>hoped</b> <b>was</b> a final version of the libretto in 1898.|$|E

The team raises the wreck and discovers that eight of the 36 shells are missing, apparently salvaged by local divers and sold to the Phalanx Arms Company. Pitt follows the trail and is able to recover six of the eight shells, but discovers that the last two were mistakenly sold as part of a large shipment to the African Army of Revolution.|$|E
2500|$|Mad Max: Fury Road {{became a}} {{moderate}} {{box office success}} theatrically. When comparing the final theatrical gross to its $200 million budget (including production, marketing and distribution costs), it was an average hit, with Forbes comparing the box office figures of the film to Edge of Tomorrow, calling it [...] "too expensive, but not really a flop." [...] The Hollywood Reporter calculated that the loss incurred by the film was around $20–40 million. According to Forbes, {{one of the reasons}} the film emerged less successful than <b>hoped</b> <b>was</b> its cancelled release in China; success there could have aided the film in at least passing $400 million. It grossed $153.6 million in North America and $224.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $378.4 million. It had a worldwide opening weekend total of $109 million, and went on to become the second highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 2015 (behind San Andreas), and the nineteenth highest-grossing film of 2015 worldwide overall.|$|E
2500|$|Massive {{population}} exchanges {{occurred between}} the two newly formed states in the months immediately following the Partition. [...] "The population of undivided India in 1947 was approx 390 million. After partition, there were 330 million people in India, 30 million in West Pakistan, and 30 million people in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)." [...] Once the lines were established, about 14.5 million people crossed the borders to what they <b>hoped</b> <b>was</b> the relative safety of religious majority. The 1951 Census of Pakistan identified the number of displaced persons in Pakistan at 7,226,600, presumably all Muslims who had entered Pakistan from India. Similarly, the 1951 Census of India enumerated 7,295,870 displaced persons, apparently all Hindus and Sikhs who had moved to India from Pakistan immediately after the Partition. The two numbers add up to 14.5 million. Since both censuses were held about 3.6 years after the Partition, the enumeration included net population increase after the mass migration.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, he was {{involved}} in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as Frankie Howerd Reveals All for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was famous for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii!, which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as [...] "Oooh, no missus" [...] and [...] "Titter ye not". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: [...] "What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written – what you <b>hoped</b> <b>was</b> in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but when you heard him do it, my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle – he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. He {{knew exactly what he was}} doing." [...] Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and [...] double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny.|$|E
