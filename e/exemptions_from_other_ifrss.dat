50|$|Individual {{states and}} localities offer nonprofits <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> taxes such as sales tax or {{property}} tax. Federal tax-exempt status does not guarantee <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> {{state and local taxes}} and vice versa. These exemptions generally have separate applications, and their requirements may differ from the IRS requirements. Furthermore, even a tax-exempt organization may be required to file annual financial reports (IRS Form 990) at the state and federal levels. A tax-exempt organization's 990 forms are required to be available for public scrutiny. An example of a nonprofit organization in the US is Project Vote Smart.|$|R

Even when a landholder was granted <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> royal services, these three duties were reserved. An {{example of this is}} in a charter of 858 where Æthelberht of Kent made an exchange of land with his thegn Wulflaf.

They were ordered to ignore commercial and military traffic, to concentrate on more elusive transmissions. Each VI was given a minimum number of intercepts to make each month.

40|$|Many {{countries}} treat income generated via exports favourably, {{especially when}} production takes places in special zones known as export processing zones (EPZs). EPZs {{can be defined}} as specific, geographically defined zones or areas that are subject to special administration and that generally offer tax incentives, such as duty‐free imports when producing for export, <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> regulatory constraints linked to import for the domestic market, sometimes favourable treatment in terms of industrial regulation, and the streamlining of border clearing procedures. We describe a database of WTO Members that employ special economic zones as part of their industrial policy mix. This is based on WTO notification and monitoring through the WTO’s trade policy review mechanism (TPRM), supplemented with information from the ILO, World Bank, and primary sources.

2500|$|While {{the federal}} {{government}} has never collected a church tax or mandatory tithe on its citizens, states [...] collected a tithe into the early 19th century. Today, such a tax is prohibited by the First Amendment (specifically the Establishment Clause) to the US Constitution. The United States and its governmental subdivisions also exempt most churches from payment of income tax (under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state statutes, which also allows donors to claim the donations as an income tax itemized deduction). Also, churches may be permitted <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> state and local taxes such as sales and property taxes, either in whole or in part. Clergy, such as ministers and members of religious orders (who have taken a vow of poverty) are exempt from federal income tax on income from ministerial services. Income from non-ministerial services are taxable and churches are required to withhold Federal and state income tax from this non-exempt income. They are also required to withhold employee's share of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, and pay the employer's share for the non-exempt income.|$|R

50|$|Kokumen-shō (国免荘) is shōen allowed <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> so or <b>other</b> tribute in bempo or binho (便補) system. At {{that time}} kuni had an {{obligation}} to pay to shōen owner the benefits the amount of which was determined as to his dignity by the central government. Bempo system is a means usually used when kuni could not prepare the benefits since the taxation from peasants cultivating public fields did not function well; kuni transferred shōen owner its right of taxation from fields the dimensions of which was corresponding to the amount of the benefits. This field was usually selected, according to shōen owner's request, from fields which shōen owner had received from peasants as kishinchi, and this means practical <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> tax. This system was not admitted by the central government and a contract of bempo became invalid when the term of tenure of the kokushi who contracted was over. However, in most case the new kokushi could not refuse shōen owner's request of continuation of a contract because they felt sorry for accumulated debt of the delinquent benefits, which had not paid while bempo was performed as substitution of payment. Consequently, these fields were established as an area exempt <b>from</b> so or <b>other</b> tribute imposed by the central government.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Leibzoll may {{be traced to the}} {{political}} position of the Jews in Germany, where they were considered crown property and, therefore, under the king's protection. In his capacity as Holy Roman emperor the king claimed the exclusive rights of the jurisdiction and taxation of the Jews, and retained responsibility for the protection of their lives and their property. He granted them protection either by a guard or by safe-conduct; chiefly by the latter, for the Jews, being extensive travelers, when they went on long business trips could not always be accompanied by imperial guards. The first instance of the granting of one of these safe-conducts occurred under Louis le Débonnaire (814-840), and a specimen of it may be found among the documents preserved in the [...] "Liber Formularum" [...] of that period. According to this document the king grants freedom of travel and <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> all taxes to three Jews of Lyons [...] "neque teloneum, neque paravereda aut mansionaticum, aut pulveraticum, aut cespitaticum, aut ripaticum, aut rotaticum, aut portaticum, aut herbaticum prædictis Hebræis exigere præsumant" [...] (De Rozières, [...] "Recueil Général des Formules Usitées dans l'Empire des Francs," [...] i. 41-43, Paris, 1859-1871; Simson, [...] "Jahrbücher des Fränkischen Reiches Unter Ludwig, dem Frommen," [...] i. 393-396, Leipsic, 1874-76). For such a safe-conduct the Jews were required to pay a certain fee; but this, being understood, is not stated anywhere, as the payment constitutes the only reason for the <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> taxes. The stipulations regulating the tolls of Raffelstetten, , issued between 904-906, are to be interpreted in the same manner—the Jews, as privileged merchants, shall not pay more than the regular toll ("justum theloneum"). The law expressly states this conforms with the ancient custom (Pertz, [...] "Mon. Germaniæ Leges," [...] iii. 480; Georg Waitz, [...] "Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte", iv. 1, 70, Kiel, 1884; Scherer, [...] "Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden," [...] p. 110, Leipsic, 1901); the same is stated in the charter granted to the Jews of Worms, 1090 ("Zeitschrift für die Gesch. der Juden in Deutschland," [...] i. 139). When the Jews passed {{under the jurisdiction of the}} territorial rulers, this principle was acknowledged. Frederick II of Austria, in his law on the Jews, issued 1244, decreed that within the limits of his state they should not pay more than the legal rate of toll—the same rate that all other citizens had to pay (Scherer, l.c. p. 181). As in the stipulations regulating the , and as in the law of Frederick II, only customs duties for goods or slaves were mentioned: therefore a personal tax was unknown.|$|R
50|$|A new {{immigration}} policy promulgated in 1948 permitted entrance and temporary residence, {{in the form}} of <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> immigration restrictions, to Chinese engaged in overseas trade of a minimum volume of £1,000 per year.
