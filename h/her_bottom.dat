5|$|HMS Agamemnon {{commissioned}} on 25 June 1908 at Chatham Dockyard {{for service}} in the Nore Division of the Home Fleet. On 11 February 1911, she grazed an uncharted rock in the harbour at Ferrol, Spain, and damaged <b>her</b> <b>bottom.</b> She was temporarily attached in September 1913 to the 4th Battle Squadron.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{the crew}} {{numbered}} between 651 and 674 officers and enlisted men. She {{was considered to}} handle well by her captains and was a good sea-boat. In view of her intended duties abroad, <b>her</b> <b>bottom</b> was coppered to reduce biofouling.|$|E
5|$|HMS Audacious {{was ordered}} on 29 April 1867 from Robert Napier in Govan, Glasgow. She was laid down on 26 June 1867 and {{launched}} on 27 February 1869 in a gale. The winds caught {{the rear of}} the ship as she was about halfway down the slipway and twisted her enough that some plates and frames of <b>her</b> <b>bottom</b> were damaged. The ship was completed on 10 September 1870 and commissioned the following month. She cost £256,291 to build.|$|E

2500|$|With her liner route linking Southampton and South America, Andes {{was built}} to cover long {{distances}} without resupply. Her fuel capacity was specified to be [...] "not less than 4,950 tons", and she had bunker oil tanks in <b>her</b> double <b>bottom,</b> aft peak, and between her machinery space and No. 3 hold. Her original fresh water capacity was nearly 2,500 tons, with tanks in <b>her</b> double <b>bottom,</b> forepeak, No. 1 hold, and between and beside her propeller shaft tunnels.|$|R

5|$|Szent István {{was based}} at Pola (Pula) for the {{duration}} of her career. In fact she rarely left port except for gunnery practice in the nearby Fažana Strait. She only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single, two-day, trip to Pag Island. Only 5.7% of her life was spent at sea; {{for the rest of the}} time she swung at anchor in Pola Harbour. She was never even drydocked to get <b>her</b> <b>bottom</b> cleaned.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the first impact, the engines still turning astern, the ship struck again beneath the engine room, tearing open <b>her</b> <b>bottom.</b> She {{instantly}} broke in two just aft of the mainmast. The funnel went over the side and the forepart of the ship sank at once. The stern section, now crowded with men, floated {{for a few minutes}} before sinking.|$|E
5|$|Asama made a {{training}} cruise in 1921 before her armament was modified in 1922. All of her main deck guns, six 6-inch and four 12-pounder guns, were removed and their casemates plated over. In addition {{all of her}} QF 2.5-pounder guns were removed and a single 8cm/40 3rd Year Type AA gun was added. After the refit, she resumed her training cruises, generally at two-year intervals, until she ran aground in 1935. The damage to <b>her</b> <b>bottom</b> was severe enough that the IJN decided make her a stationary training ship in 1938.|$|E

5|$|Beginning on 26 June 1922, Asama resumed making {{training}} cruises, {{usually at}} two-year intervals, that {{took her to}} Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Sea among other places. They {{came to an end}} after she ran aground on the night of 13 October 1935 north north-west of the Kurushima Strait in the Inland Sea. <b>Her</b> <b>bottom</b> was badly damaged and she was deemed no longer seaworthy after repairs were completed at Kure Naval Arsenal. The ship was then assigned as a stationary training ship for the Kure Naval Corps on 5 July 1938.|$|E
5|$|HMS Neptune {{was laid}} down in 1873 for the Brazilian Navy {{under the name of}} Independencia by J & W Dudgeon in Cubitt Town, London. The {{shipyard}} attempted to launch her on 16 July 1874, but she stuck fast and did not budge. A second attempt was made on 30 July during which the ship got about one-third down the slipway and stuck, extensively damaging <b>her</b> <b>bottom</b> plating. She was finally launched on 10 September, after she had been lightened, and she was towed to Samuda Brothers for repairs and fitting out. The cost of the accident resulted in the bankruptcy of Dudgeons in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{was bombed}} and sunk in a German air raid on Liverpool {{during the night}} of 7/8 May 1941. She {{was struck by a}} bomb that passed through the hull and detonated {{underneath}} her. The explosion blew a large hole in <b>her</b> <b>bottom</b> and flooded her engine room and oil tanks. The ship's structure was badly damaged enough that her stern began to sag downwards and Hurricane was moved to Bidston Dock lest she sink and block traffic in the harbour. No one was killed in the attack, although a few crewmen received minor injuries.|$|E
50|$|At the Siege of Nice, in {{the summer}} of 1543, Catherine Ségurane, a common washerwoman, led the townspeople into battle. Legend has it that she took the lead in {{defending}} the city by standing before the invading forces and exposing <b>her</b> bare <b>bottom.</b>|$|R

5|$|In November 1884, Parker conspired with a {{group of}} Boston shippers, who filled Mary Celeste with a largely {{worthless}} cargo, misrepresented on the ship's manifest as valuable goods and insured for US$30,000 ($ today). On December 16, Parker set out for Port-au-Prince, the capital and chief port of Haiti. On January 3, 1885, Mary Celeste approached the port via the channel between Gonâve Island and the mainland, in which lay a large and well-charted coral reef, the Rochelois Bank. Parker deliberately ran the ship on to this reef, ripping out <b>her</b> <b>bottom</b> and wrecking her beyond repair. He and the crew then rowed themselves ashore, where Parker sold the salvageable cargo for $500 to the American consul, and instituted insurance claims for the alleged value.|$|E
5|$|Rusalka, {{named after}} the mythological creature, was ordered on 25 January 1865 and {{construction}} began on 10 June at the Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying was not until 6 June 1866. She was launched on 12 September 1867 and completed in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 762,000 rubles. Construction was considerably delayed by late deliveries of drawings, material, and the death of her original builder. The ship struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast in June 1869 and damaged <b>her</b> <b>bottom</b> plating badly enough that she had to be run aground to prevent her from sinking. Rusalka served her entire career with the Baltic Fleet and was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870. The ship had her boilers replaced in 1878 and 1891 and she was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892.|$|E
5|$|The BPF was tasked {{to attack}} Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands and Formosa {{before and during}} {{the early stages of the}} {{invasion}} of Okinawa. Unicorn was primarily engaged in preparing aircraft for issue to the operational squadrons aboard the fleet carriers during this time, rather than repair them, but she did repair, modify or service 105 aircraft in March–May 1945. The ship sailed for Australia on 22 May and arrived in Sydney on 1 June. She sailed for Brisbane on 6 June to have <b>her</b> <b>bottom</b> cleaned at the Cairncross Dockyard and to load more replacement aircraft. Unicorn arrived at Manus on 22 July to prepare for operations off Japan. She was still there when Japan surrendered on 15 August. The ship began to ferry aircraft, equipment and men back to Australia after the surrender, a task which ended on 6 November, when she arrived at Sydney. Unicorn departed for home in December 1945 and arrived in Plymouth in January 1946. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve.|$|E

Dimitra was eliminated after <b>her</b> fourth <b>bottom</b> two appearance.|$|R
5|$|The British {{garrison}} at Diego Garcia {{had not yet}} {{learned of}} the state of war between Britain and Germany, and so treated Emden to a warm reception. She remained there until 10 October, during which time <b>her</b> <b>bottom</b> was cleaned of fouling. She then resumed searching for merchant ships in the area west of Colombo. While operating there, Emden picked up Hampshires wireless signals again, and so departed for the Chagos Archipelago on 13 October. Meanwhile, the British had captured Markomannia on 12 October, depriving Emden of one of her colliers. On 15 October, Emden captured a British steamer off Minikoi and sank her the next day. Over the next five days, she captured five more vessels; one was used as a collier, three were sunk, and the fifth was sent to port with the crews of the other vessels. On 20 October, Müller {{decided it was time to}} move to a new area of operations.|$|E
5|$|The Prison in Space by Dick Sharples, {{originally}} titled The Amazons, {{returned to}} the idea of a female-dominated planet last attempted with The Hidden Planet. The Doctor and Jamie were to be imprisoned, and Zoe was to start a sexual revolution and then be brainwashed. The four-part story was commissioned on 4 June 1968 and was intended to inject humour into the show. It was to feature Jamie in drag and end with Jamie deprogramming Zoe by smacking <b>her</b> <b>bottom.</b> The serial was rewritten to accommodate Frazer Hines' desire to leave by introducing a new companion named Nik, and again when he later decided to stay. Scripts for the first two episodes were delivered on 27 August 1968. The production team became unhappy with the serial, and when Sharples refused to perform further rewrites, the serial was dropped. The story was replaced by The Krotons. It was later adapted as Prison in Space by Simon Guerrier for Big Finish's The Lost Stories series in December 2010. In 2011, an illustrated scriptbook was released by Nothing at the End of the Lane.|$|E
