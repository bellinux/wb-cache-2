And, indeed, when the lady obtained the first commanding view of the Castle, with its stately towers rising from within a long, sweeping line of outward walls, ornamented with battlements and turrets and platforms at every point of defence, with many a banner streaming from its walls, and such a bustle of gay crests and waving plumes disposed on the terraces and battlements, and all the gay and gorgeous scene, her heart, unaccustomed to such splendour, sank as if it died within her, {{and for a moment she}} asked herself what she had offered up to Leicester to deserve to become the partner of this princely splendour.

Unlike her social betters, who have all fraternized with the enemy, and had them as guests in their homes, Elizabeth is a simple patriot, and will not eat or consort with the invaders of her country, so the coach cannot go on. The group finally convinces her that it would be best for France for them to get on with their business, and she concedes.

5000|$|Chelsea's {{first ever}} league {{campaign}} began on 2 September with {{a trip to}} Cheshire to face Lancashire Combination champions Stockport County at Edgeley Park. The match was a tight affair against a side with previous experience in the second tier, with County having an Ashton Schofield penalty saved by Chelsea goalkeeper Bill Foulke only for George Dodd to put the ball in from the rebound with {{half an hour to}} play to give the hosts 2 points. For their following match on 9 September, The Pensioners once again travelled up north, this time to Lancashire to play Blackpool at Bloomfield Road, gaining their first two points of the season in another close <b>encounter</b> <b>through</b> a late winner from player-manager Jacky Roberston in the 80th minute, who gained the distinction of being Chelsea's first ever league goalscorer.

Two days later, Chelsea played their first ever home league match against newly elected Hull City, with the Blues romping to a 5-1 win.

5000|$|Poems. By Thomas Carew, Esquire is a {{collection}} of lyrics, songs, pastorals, poetic dialogues, elegies, addresses, and occasional poems. Most of the pieces are fairly short—the longest, [...] "A Rapture," [...] is 166 lines, and well over half are under 50 lines. The subjects are various: a number of poems treat love, lovemaking, and feminine beauty. Several of the poems, including [...] "An Elegie upon the death of the Deane of Pauls, Dr. Iohn Donne" [...] are memorial tributes; others, notably [...] "To Saxham," [...] celebrate country-house life; and a few record such events as the successful production of a play ("To my worthy Friend, M. D’Avenant, upon his Excellent Play, The Iust Italian") or the marriage of friends ("On the Marriage of T. K. and C. C. the Morning Stormie"). Many of the songs and love poems are addressed to the still-unidentified [...] "Celia," [...] a woman who was evidently Carew's lover for years. The poems to Celia treat the urgency of courtship, making much of the carpe diem theme. Others commend Celia through simile, conceit, and cliché. The physical pleasures of love are likewise celebrated: [...] "A Rapture" [...] graphically documents a sexual <b>encounter</b> <b>through</b> analogy, euphemism, and paradox, while [...] "Loves Courtship" [...] responds to the early passing of virginity. A number of Carew's poems are concerned with the nature of poetry itself. His elegy on John Donne has been praised as both a masterpiece of criticism and a remarkably perceptive analysis of the metaphysical qualities of Donne's literary work. English poet and playwright Ben Jonson is the subject of another piece of critical verse, [...] "To Ben. Iohnson, Upon Occasion of His Ode of Defiance Annext to His Play of The New Inne." [...] This poem, like the elegy on Donne, is concerned with both the style and substance of the author's literary works as well as with personal qualities of the author himself. Among Carew's occasional, public verse are his addresses to ladies of fashion, commendations of the nobility, and laments for the passing of friends or public figures, such as Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden.|$|E
