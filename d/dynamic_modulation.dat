Behavioral flexibility {{depends on a}} number of brain areas that send convergent projections to the medial striatum, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex, and amygdala. Here, we tested the hypothesis that neurons in the medial striatum are involved in flexible action selection, by representing changes in stimulus–reward contingencies. Using a novel Go/No-go reaction-time task, we changed the reward value of individual stimuli within single experimental sessions. We simultaneously recorded neuronal activity in the medial and ventral parts of the striatum of rats. The rats modified their actions in the task after the changes in stimulus–reward contingencies. This was preceded by <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulations</b> of spike activity in the medial, but not the ventral, striatum.

40|$|An {{interaction}} between orofacial somatosensation {{and the perception}} of speech was demonstrated in recent psychophysical studies (Ito et al. 2009; Ito and Ostry 2009). To explore further the neural mechanisms of the speech-related somatosensory-auditory interaction, we assessed to what extent multisensory evoked potentials reflect multisensory interaction during speech perception. We also examined the <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulation</b> of multisensory integration resulting from relative timing differences between the onsets of the two sensory stimuli. We recorded event-related potentials from 64 scalp sites in response to somatosensory stimulation alone, auditory stimulation alone, and combined somatosensory and auditory stimulation. In the multisensory condition, the timing of the two stimuli was either simultaneous or offset by 90 ms (lead and lag). We found evidence of multisensory interaction with the amplitude of the multisensory evoked potential reliably different than the sum of the two unisensory potentials around the first peak of multisensory response (100 – 200 ms). The magnitude of the evoked potential difference varied {{as a function of the}} relative timing between the stimuli in the interval from 170 to 200 ms following somatosensory stimulation.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{recent studies have}} {{indicated}} that ensembles of neurones, distributed within the neural structures that form the primary thalamocortical loop (TCL) of the trigeminal component of the rat somatosensory system, change the way they respond to similar tactile stimuli, according to both the behavioural strategy employed by animals to gather information and the animal's internal brain states. These findings suggest that top-down influences, which are more likely to play a role during active discrimination than during passive whisker stimulation, may alter the pattern of neuronal firing within both the distinct layers of the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) and the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM). We propose that through this physiological process, which involves concurrent <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulations</b> at both cellular and circuit levels in the TCL, rats can either optimize the detection of novel or hard to sense stimuli or they can analyse complex patterns of multiwhisker stimulation, during natural exploration of their surrounding environment...|$|R

The influences of the disk thickness and Nd 2 O 3 doping level on gain performance are also studied with the modeling program.

This article looks at the distributional aspects of including the CEC into <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulation.</b> Under the current accession proposal the CEC would account for only 18 % of the rural development budget by 2006. If modulation would be realised with the CEC being excluded this share would drop to 14 % by 2010. According to the criteria proposed by the Commission for the distribution of the modulation budget the CEC would get a higher share of the modulation budget if they were included as they account for high shares in agricultural area and employment, and their GDP per capita is relatively low. Based on the assumptions made for this article they would be eligible for about 66 % of the modulation budget. As a result of their participation in the modulation mechanism their share in the rural development budget would be at 30 % by 2010.

40|$|Integrin {{dependent}} adhesion and <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulations</b> of the actin network are {{prerequisites for}} normal cell locomotion. To investigate whether the actin microfilamentous system does {{play a role}} in regulation of β 2 -integrin-induced signalling, we pretreated granulocytes with staurosporine, a well-known protein kinase inhibitor that has also been shown to disrupt the cytoskeleton of intact cells. Pretreatment with staurosporine completely inhibited the β 2 -integrin-induced Ca 2 + signal and also its ability to trigger actin polymerisation. This inhibition was not related to phosphorylation of the CD 18 -chain of the β 2 -integrin, nor to inhibition of protein kinases. Instead, association of β 2 -integrins with the cortical cytoskeleton, which was observed in untreated cells, was abolished after exposure to staurosporine, indicating that β 2 -integrin signalling depends on integrin-cytoskeleton interaction. These results suggest not only that the actin network provides an adhesive link to the extracellular matrix and a driving force for the locomotory response, but also that it participates in regulation of β 2 -integrin signalling during granulocyte locomotion...|$|R

40|$|Microprocessor {{performance}} has been improved {{by increasing the}} capacity of on-chip caches. However, the performance gain comes {{at the price of}} increased static energy consumption due to subthreshold leakage current. This paper compares three techniques for reducing static energy consumption in on-chip level- 1 and level- 2 caches. One technique employs low-leakage transistors in the memory cell. Another technique, power supply switching, can be used to turn off memory cells and discard their contents. A third alternative is <b>dynamic</b> threshold <b>modulation,</b> which places memory cells in a standby state that preserves cell contents. In our experiments, we explore the energy/performance trade-offs of these techniques and find that <b>dynamic</b> threshold <b>modulation</b> achieves the best results for level- 1 caches, improving the energy-delay product by 2 % in a level- 1 instruction cache and 7 % in a level- 1 data cache.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that when we observe somebody else executing an action many areas of our own motor systems are active. It has been argued that these motor activations are evidence that we motorically simulate observed actions; this motoric simulation may support various functions such as imitation and action understanding. However, whether motoric simulation is indeed the function of motor activations during action observation is controversial, due to inconsistency in findings. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulations</b> in motor activity when we execute actions. Therefore, if we do motorically simulate observed actions, our motor systems should also be modulated dynamically, and in a corresponding fashion, during action observation. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded the cortical activity of human participants while they observed actions performed by another person. Here, we show that activity in the human motor system is indeed modulated dynamically during action observation. The finding that activity in the motor system is modulated dynamically when observing actions can explain why studies of action observation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have reported conflicting results, and is consistent with the hypothesis that we motorically simulate observed actions...|$|R
