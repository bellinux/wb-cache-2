40|$|Abstract. In this paper, Experimental {{results on}} the {{measurement}} of mechanical properties of fine patterns in the MEMS structure are described. The mechanical properties of <b>embossing</b> <b>patterns</b> on metallic thin foil is measured using the nano indentation system, that is developed by Korea Institute of Industrial Technology(KITECH). These micro <b>embossing</b> <b>patterns</b> are fabricated using CIP(Cold Isostatic Press) process on micro metallic thin foils(Al- 1100) that are made by rolling process. These <b>embossing</b> <b>patterned</b> metallic thin foils(Al- 1100) {{are used in the}} reflecting plate of BLU(Back Light Unit) and electrical/mechanical MEMS components. If these mechanical properties of fine patterns are utilized in a design procedure, the optimal design can be achieved in aspects of reliability as well as economy...|$|R

30|$|A {{white paint}} layer, 0.1 – 0.2  mm thick, is noticed {{right on the}} top of the thin blue layer. It is {{composed}} of whitish materials that created the embossed dragon and cloud patterns on golden-dragon Hexi painting. Therefore, the shape and <b>embossed</b> height of <b>patterns</b> determines the white paint layer’s thickness. Raman spectrum of the white color, as shown in Fig.  5 b, demonstrates three instantly noticeable Raman peaks at 284, 717, and 1091  cm− 1, all of which have been confirmed as characteristic of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) [26]. The source of calcium carbonate can be attributable to chalk, a very finely grained limestone deposit. Chalk has been used to paint white for quite a good long time (from Neolithic to modern China), and its application on Neolithic dwellings as well as on modern architecture have been widely reported within and beyond China. In traditional Chinese architecture painting and decoration, chalk is often referred to as baitu (literally translated as white clay, 白土) and used for the preparation of the ground coat layer or for decoration purpose [13]. Textual researches and analytical studies that aim to reconstruct architectural painting and decoration techniques in the Qing period have confirmed that chalk was usually not used alone, but mixed with China wood oil (桐油, a drying oil extracted from seeds of tung tree, Vernicia fordii) or sometimes with plant or animal glue instead. Such a practice is the core of lifen tiejin (沥粉贴金, <b>embossed</b> <b>patterning</b> and gilding), a technique during which chalk and drying oils are mixed in a certain ratio and filled into a container (such as pig’s bladder), and then squeezed out for embossing through a small opening [27, 28]. When wet and mixed with China wood oil, chalk is turned into soft paste that can be easily (re)shaped and (re)coated, which is very important for creating <b>embossed</b> <b>patterns</b> (such as the dragon and cloud patterns on golden-dragon Hexi painting). Therefore, while organic materials such as China wood oil awaits confirmation in future studies, the identification of chalk in the white paint layer suggests that lifen tiejin might have been used for embossing the dragon and cloud patterns on Hexi painting.|$|R

As part of this inquiry Rowley presented a map of the Middle East with a superimposed outline based on the <b>embossed</b> <b>pattern</b> of a contemporary 10 agorot coin. In the text Rowley surmised: [...] Whereas Israel has never formally defined its borders one possible indication of Israel's broader territorial ambitions might be seen in the Israeli ten agorot coin which carries a map, seemingly depicting an area that would extend over to encompass present-day Amman, Beirut, Baghdad, Damascus and the N parts of Saudi Arabia. This same territorial depiction was carried on the earlier one sheqal coin.|$|E

40|$|Capacitive micromachined {{ultrasonic}} transducers (CMUTs) {{have emerged}} as a competitive alternative to piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, especially in medical ultrasound imaging and therapeutic ultrasound applications, which require high output pressure. However, as compared with piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, the output pressure capability of CMUTs remains to be improved. In this paper, a novel structure is proposed by forming an embossed vibrating membrane on a CMUT cell operating in the collapse mode to increase the maximum output pressure. By using a beam model in undamped conditions and finite-element analysis simulations, the proposed embossed structure showed improvement on the maximum output pressure of the CMUT cell when the <b>embossed</b> <b>pattern</b> {{was placed on the}} estimated location of the peak deflection. As compared with a uniform membrane CMUT cell worked in the collapse mode, the proposed CMUT cell can yield the maximum output pressure by 51. 1 % and 88. 1 % enhancement with a single <b>embossed</b> <b>pattern</b> made of Si 3 N 4 and nickel, respectively. The maximum output pressures were improved by 34. 9 % (a single Si 3 N 4 <b>embossed</b> <b>pattern)</b> and 46. 7 % (a single nickel <b>embossed</b> <b>pattern)</b> with the uniform membrane when the center frequencies of both original and embossed CMUT designs were similar.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new roll-to-roll {{embossing}} process allowing the replication of micro patterns with feature sizes down to 0. 5 m. The embossing process is suitable for the continuous output of micro patterned structures and is not accompanied by waste produced during the initial hot embossing phase. This {{is due to the}} fact that the foil is not moved during the time needed to reach a thermal steady state. A new type of embossing master is used which is based on flexible silicon substrates. The <b>embossing</b> <b>pattern</b> with sub-m topographic resolution is prepared on silicon wafers by state of the art lithography and dry etching techniques. The wafers are thinned down to a thickness of 40 m, which guarantees the mechanical flexibility of the embossing masters. Up to 20 individual chips with a size of 20 × 20 mm 2 were assembled on a roller. Embossing experiments with COC foils showed a good replication of the silicon master structures in the foil.

The transition temperature in embossed depth increased linearly with norbornene content for both 35 and 70 ?m deep structures. At temperatures above this transition, the dimensions of the <b>embossed</b> <b>patterns</b> were essentially independent of the COC grade, the applied pressure and duration of loading.
