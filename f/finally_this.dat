5|$|The largest Maya sculptures {{consisted}} of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough form {{was laid out}} on a plain plaster base coating on the wall, and the three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. <b>Finally,</b> <b>this</b> was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted. Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|This {{inequality}} further offended {{the smaller}} countries. <b>Finally,</b> <b>this</b> inequality {{also meant that}} the minority rights were not seen as a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had no state to back up their claims were relatively disadvantaged when compared to ones backed up by a powerful state or group of interests.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August, Godwin-Austen {{realized}} the peril of his situation, with XV Brigade nearly {{able to cut}} him off from behind, his troops exhausted, and his artillery completely deficient and running low on ammunition, and informed General Henry Maitland Wilson, who was in command at Cairo while Wavell was absent in England, that retreat from Tug Argan and evacuation from British Somaliland was now a necessity. If his forces could be evacuated, perhaps 70 percent of them might be removed. Otherwise, he {{would be forced to}} fight to the death, with his entire command destroyed. Wilson agreed to Godwin-Austen's request the next day, and preparations were made to flee after dark on 15 August. During that day, Observation Hill was attacked for the final time by De Simone's forces. De Simone had decided to doggedly press his attack in the gap, in lieu of completing the flanking maneuver, and <b>finally</b> <b>this</b> proved successful. By 7:00pm XIII Brigade had seized Observation Hill, and the British retreated from it in disarray. After sundown, the defenders of the remaining hills were withdrawn, along with the Punjab troops, who departed just as II Brigade was able to make inroads through their abandoned positions. British resistance had collapsed, and as Godwin-Austen and his forces fled towards Berbera, the Italians were in control of Tug Argan.|$|E

The fact that the α-value remains unchanged explains the linearity of Brønsted plots for such a reaction.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, Stewart began {{hanging around}} folk singer Wizz Jones, busking at Leicester Square and other London spots. Stewart took up playing the then-fashionable harmonica. On several trips {{over the next}} 18 months Jones and Stewart took their act to Brighton and then to Paris, {{sleeping}} under bridges over the River Seine, and then finally to Barcelona. <b>Finally</b> <b>this</b> resulted in Stewart being rounded up and deported from Spain for vagrancy during 1963. At this time, Stewart, who had been at William Grimshaw School with three of their members, was briefly considered as singer for the embryonic Kinks.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1999, President Zedillo officially {{started the}} flag program by issuing a decree that was {{published}} in the government register Official Journal of the Federation. While the formation of the flag project was one aspect of the decree, the overall aims of the law were to promote the flag, the Coat of Arms and the national anthem to instill a sense of patriotism into the Mexican population. Zedillo also used the timeframe of 1995 until 2000 to promote Mexican culture and history. <b>Finally,</b> <b>this</b> decree allowed the governors of each state to display more conspicuously the national symbols (Símbolos Patrios) throughout their state.|$|E

25|$|The GPALS system {{provided}} a major {{adjustment to the}} United States’ military strategy in several ways. First, it shifted the United States away from fighting an all-out war with the Soviet Union. Instead, the GPALS system prompted the United States military to begin fighting smaller battles with various opponents all around the globe. These other opponents included nations who might have acquired nuclear weapons or broken-up sections of the Soviet Union. Second, the GPALS system focused more heavily on protecting the United States from limited nuclear attacks that involved smaller numbers of warheads. Third, and <b>finally,</b> <b>this</b> system was introduced to protect not just the United States, but also its military forces {{around the world and}} its allies.|$|E
25|$|The {{multiplex}} {{consists of}} 10 cinema rooms with between 68 and 404 seats, spread over two levels {{with a total}} of 1580 seats opened in November 2013. Double access (next to the Giratoire de l'Europe and Avenue Victor-Hugo). A fast food area as well as a night beerhouse are integrated {{within the confines of the}} cinema centre having also two other shops. This cinema complex with of entertainment and exhibition spaces has the distinction of offering, in all of its rooms, entirely to digital broadcasts and is equipped to watch movies in 3D. Cultural or sports broadcasts on the other side of the world are proposed. <b>Finally,</b> <b>this</b> complex has the distinction of being used for conferences or congresses through the audio-visual and videoconferencing facilities which it offers and the available gauge in terms of seating capacity. The creation of a new square in front of the multiplex highlighting the continuing interdependence of the festival hall, cinema complex and, in the wider spectrum, the amphitheatre will allow cultural or economic events.|$|E
500|$|Historical and anecdotal {{evidence}} {{strongly suggest that}} the once-abundant estuary stingray has declined substantially across its range. Although it is not commercially utilized, it faces {{a number of other}} threats. This species is captured incidentally by commercial bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries; bycatch mortality is exacerbated by the practice of [...] "spiking", in which the ray's cranium is pierced with a metal bar or sharpened stick so as to move it. It is also readily caught, and often killed, by recreational anglers. Surveys in Moreton Bay have found fishing-related effects, such as embedded hooks and mutilated tails, in over 10% of the population. Habitat degradation is another major threat to the estuary stingray, especially given its habitat specificity. Its range encompasses some of the most urbanized areas in Australia, where there is extensive land reclamation, water pollution, and construction of flood mitigation barriers on rivers. <b>Finally,</b> <b>this</b> ray's reputation for damaging shellfish has led to persecution by commercial shellfish farmers.|$|E

In an expanded two-part structure, the organ is both an instrumental soloist in the two sinfonias and a partner for the singer in all three arias. The musicologist Laurence Dreyfus distinguished Bach's use of the organ as [...] "sacred icon" [...] versus [...] "galant conversationalist", writing on Bach's [...] "assimilation of the secular solo concerto into his church cantatas and his adjustment of the normal concerto principle, that of soloist-versus-orchestra, through subtle shifts in role playing, the instrument now posing as a soloist, now retreating into the background." ...|$|E
500|$|Vavilovian mimicry can be {{classified}} as defensive mimicry, in that the weed mimics a protected species. This bears strong similarity to Batesian mimicry in that the weed does not share the properties that give the model its protection, and both the model and the dupe (in this case people) are harmed by its presence. There are some key differences, though; in Batesian mimicry, the model and signal receiver are enemies (the predator would eat the protected species if it could), whereas here the crop and its human growers are in a mutualistic relationship: the crop benefits from being dispersed and protected by people, despite being eaten by them. In fact, the crop's only [...] "protection" [...] relevant here is its usefulness to humans. Secondly, the weed is not eaten, but simply destroyed. The only motivation for killing the weed is its effect on crop yields. <b>Finally,</b> <b>this</b> type of mimicry does not occur in ecosystems unaltered by humans.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} detect weakly {{electric}} fields, animals must possess electroreceptors (receptive organs) that detect electric potential differences. For electric fishes, receptive organs are groups of sensory cells rooted in epidermal pits, which look like small {{spots on the}} skin. In each receptive organ, there are sensory cells embedded {{in the bottom of}} the opened [...] "pit" [...] that faces outside. Electroreceptors detect electric signals by building up a potential difference between the outside environment and the fish body's internal environment. Current flow due to such potential difference further results in a receptor potential that is presynaptic to the sensory fibers. <b>Finally,</b> <b>this</b> receptor potential leads to action potential fired by sensory cells.|$|E
