25|$|Barges {{were pulled}} by mules along the {{adjacent}} towpath, a power source employed {{even after the}} development of steam engines, since the bow wave from a faster steamboat would have damaged the channel. Children were often hired to lead the mules at first; in the canal's later years <b>grown</b> <b>men</b> were employed. They had to walk 15–20 miles (24–32km) a day, pump out the barges and tend the animals. For this they were paid about $3 a month.|$|E
25|$|During the siege, the Mafeking Cadet Corps {{of white}} boys below {{fighting}} age stood guard, carried messages, assisted in hospitals, and so on, freeing <b>grown</b> <b>men</b> to fight.

But he was sufficiently impressed with both their courage and the equanimity with which they performed their tasks to use them later as an object lesson in the first chapter of Scouting for Boys.|$|E
25|$|Egil (Egill)'s boyhood foreshadowed {{his future}} rebelliousness and poetic prowess. His {{unbridled}} behavior and strength beyond his age {{earned him a}} stay at home when a feast was held by Yngvar (Egil's maternal grandfather). Egil defiantly rode a horse to attend, and composed his first skaldic verse at age three. At {{the age of seven}} while playing in the ball games, he committed his first murder (axe-killing an older boy who outclassed him in the sport). By the time Egil was twelve very few <b>grown</b> <b>men</b> could compete with him in games, but when he and his friend challenged his father one day, Skallagrim manifested such strength at nightfall that he slammed the friend dead against the ground. Egil was so upset he killed one of his father's favorite workers, and the two were not on speaking terms.|$|E

Reid calculated that the amount requested was [...] "amply sufficient to kill 12,000 to 15,000 full <b>grown</b> <b>men</b> or an enormously large number of children" [...] and consequently refused. Instead, Reid persuaded the Queen that the chemicals should be obtained at her expense by the appropriate authorities in India. In June 1892, Waziruddin visited Britain and stayed at both Balmoral and Windsor Castles.

500|$|Following {{a scratch}} match {{at the start}} of the 1859 {{football}} season, the Melbourne Football Club officially came into being on 14 May. Three days later, Wills and three other members—Hammersley, journalist J. B. Thompson and teacher Thomas H. Smith—met near the MCG at the Parade Hotel, owned by Bryant, to devise and codify the club's rules. The men went over the rules of four English schools; Hammersley recalled Wills' preference for the Rugby game, but it was found to be confusing and too violent. Subsequently, they rejected common features such as [...] "hacking" [...] (shin-kicking) and produced a signed document listing ten simple rules suited to <b>grown</b> <b>men</b> and Australian conditions. Heading the list of signatories, Wills, too, saw the need for compromise. He wrote to his brother Horace: [...] "Rugby was not a game for us, we wanted a winter pastime but men could be harmed if thrown on the ground so we thought differently." [...] Thompson and Hammersley's promotion of the new code, together with Wills' star power, encouraged the spread of football throughout Victoria.|$|E

A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration, however Idolator's Christina Lee was critical of the remix, writing [...] "Two of them don’t sound like <b>grown</b> <b>men</b> — and they get the longer verses. French’s loopy rapping and off-key warbling is incoherent. Justin’s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny."

500|$|Though {{the initial}} {{growth of the}} fandom {{may have come from}} 4chan {{participants}} enjoying the ironic nature of <b>grown</b> <b>men</b> enjoying a show for girls, the fandom continues to grow based on sincere appreciation of the work. Robert Thompson, a professor of media studies at Syracuse University, stated that [...] "It's one thing for guys to like motorcycles and muscle cars and soccer. For a guy to like My Little Pony, it's so out there that it becomes almost avant garde. It has a hip quality to it." [...] According to Angela Watchcutter of Wired, the fandom is an example of internet neo-sincerity, where these older viewers watch the show [...] "un-ironically" [...] and [...] "without guilt" [...] breaking gender stereotypes, furthermore creating new material around it. Prof. Roberta Pearson of the University of Nottingham in film and television studies stated that [...] "This is a level of fan devotion I've not seen before," [...] while Prof. Charles Soukup of the University of Northern Colorado in communication studies suggested that this effort is an indication of the [...] "ultra-cult era" [...] that bronies exhibit, where [...] "media consumers discover extremely unexpected and obscure media texts to cultivate uniqueness and distinctiveness for their mediated identities".|$|E
