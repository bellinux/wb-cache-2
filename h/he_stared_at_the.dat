60|$|Komba {{was much}} impressed. He returned; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead {{rhinoceros}} {{and at the}} hole in its throat; he stared at me; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> still smoking rifle.|$|E
60|$|James {{scarcely}} heard; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floor, brooding sorrowfully.|$|E
60|$|Sir Oliver's brows went up, and <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> row of solemn faces.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is Mary," [...] the {{botanist}} whispers {{with white}} lips, but <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{form of the}} man. His face whitens, it becomes so transfigured with emotion {{that for a moment}} it does not look weak. Then I see that his thin hand is clenched.|$|R
60|$|He stopped suddenly, {{rose and}} went white. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man, open-mouthed; he trembled visibly.|$|E
60|$|THE rain {{trickled down}} his back, and {{for nearly an}} hour <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> float.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{pictures}} on the wall, and a tide of disgust surged up in him.|$|E
60|$|After <b>he</b> had <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> smoke {{for some}} time, he mounted the white horse.|$|R

5000|$|The episode {{ends with}} Isaac saying to Jake {{that he has}} no idea what he just did because as he said: [...] "Cassie Blake is not the only child of Blackwell in the Circle".

60|$|The noise had aroused {{the sick}} man, and, opening his eyes, <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two boys.|$|E

60|$|ANDERSON (quaintly). Then I shall go in my best coat, dear. (He {{turns to}} the press, {{beginning}} {{to take off his}} coat.) Where--?

Why, my dear, it seems that he has gone in my best coat.|$|R

50|$|Femi and Mona (Omoni Oboli) meet <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{car park}} - She has been posted to Araromire as well; it is {{revealed}} here {{that they were}} once close friends.

While in the bus, Mona is asleep and Femi brings out a ring; <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ring and cuddles it while <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> sleeping Mona. <b>He</b> is also seen cuddling <b>the</b> ring later <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camp.|$|R
60|$|Grandfather Frog {{shook his}} head. His big goggly eyes seemed more goggly than ever, as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new pond in the Green Forest.|$|E
60|$|At {{this sudden}} {{announcement}} his partner became exceedingly interested. Leaning {{back in the}} chair <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> decorated ceiling, and uttered his favourite wind-in-the-wires whistle.|$|E
6000|$|A dull scowl {{appeared}} on Cranly's forehead. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table where Moynihan had bent {{to write his}} name on the roll, and then said flatly: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window-sill {{overhead}} and measured {{the size of}} the room with his eye.|$|R

60|$|Hickory at once {{recognized}} the battered doll under the aristocratic title which Polly {{had long ago}} bestowed upon it. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bald and battered head.|$|E

60|$|Sydney Barnes did not answer, but {{his cheeks}} were like chalk. His mouth {{was a little}} open, {{disclosing}} his yellow teeth. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Colonel with frightened, fascinated eyes.|$|E
60|$|The captain {{leaned back}} in his arm-chair, and turned his {{toothpick}} between his lips, as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl.|$|R

50|$|Discovering the {{incident}} in the bar, Renard, Hank, Monroe, Rosalee and Juliette head to the bar to find Nick. Renard, Hank and Monroe enter the bar but Nick {{is nowhere to be}} found.

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{letter for}} a moment after he had {{finished}} it, and his face grew a dark red. Then he seized the paper and tore it slowly, deliberately, into bits.|$|E
6000|$|The dying Zulu's spear struck Ishmael, who {{had turned}} his head away, upon the cheek, just {{pricking}} it and causing the blood to flow, no more. Ishmael was still also, paralysed almost, or so he seemed, for even {{the pain of the}} cut did not make him move. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bodies of Mr. and Mrs. Dove; <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead Zulu, and in his heart a voice cried: [...] "You have murdered them. By now they are pleading to God for vengeance on you, Ishmael, the outcast. You will never dare to be alone again, for they will haunt you." ...|$|E
60|$|Disko's jaw fell,--Long Jack always {{vowed that}} he heard the click of it,--and <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> {{alternately}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man and the woman.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a note}} in French, in thin, flimsy foreign {{handwriting}} {{that the}} boy could not decipher. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> blankly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> paper.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subsequent}} title card reads [...] "Sixteen years ago."

A group of men come and carry his corpse away.|$|R
