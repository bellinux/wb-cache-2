2500|$|Medical {{contributions}} made by medieval Islam {{included the}} use of plants {{as a type of}} remedy or medicine. [...] Medieval Islamic physicians used natural substances as a source of medicinal drugs—including Papaver somniferum Linnaeus, poppy, and Cannabis sativa Linnaeus, hemp. In pre-Islamic Arabia, neither poppy nor hemp was known. Hemp was introduced into the Islamic countries in the ninth century from India through Persia and Greek culture and medical literature. The Greek, Dioscorides, who according to the Arabs is the greatest botanist of antiquity, recommended hemp seeds to [...] "quench geniture" [...] and its juice for earaches. Beginning in 800 and lasting for over two centuries, poppy use was restricted to the therapeutic realm. However, the dosages often exceeded medical need and was used repeatedly despite what was originally recommended. [...] Poppy was prescribed by Yuhanna b. Masawayh to relieve pain from attacks of gallbladder stones, for fevers, indigestion, <b>eye,</b> <b>head</b> and tooth aches, pleurisy, and to induce sleep. Although poppy had medicinal benefits, Ali al-Tabari explained that the extract of poppy leaves was lethal, and that the extracts and opium should be considered poisons.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} whether wearing different presbyopic refractive corrections alters {{the pattern of}} <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> movements when searching for dynamic targets in driving-related traffic scenes. Methods: <b>Eye</b> and <b>head</b> movements of 20 presbyopes (mean age = 56. 2 ± 5. 7 years), who had no experience of wearing presbyopic corrections or were unadapted wearers were recorded using the faceLABTM <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> tracker, while wearing five different corrections: single vision lenses (SV), progressive addition lenses (PALs), bifocal spectacles (BIF), monovision and multifocal contact lenses (MTF CLs) in random order (within-subjects comparison). Recorded traffic scenes of suburban roads and expressways with edited targets were viewed as dynamic stimuli. Results: The magnitude of <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> movements was significantly greater for SV, BIF and PALs than monovision and MTF CLs (p < 0. 001). In addition, BIF wear led to more eye movements than PAL wear (p = 0. 017), while PAL wear resulted in greater head movements than SV wear (p = 0. 018). The ratio of <b>eye</b> to <b>head</b> movement was smaller for PALs than all other groups (p < 0. 001). The number of saccades made to fixate a target was significantly higher for BIF and PALs than monovision or MTF CLs (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Different presbyopic corrections can alter <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> movement patterns. Wearing spectacles such as BIF and PALs produced relatively greater <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> movements and saccades when viewing dynamic targets. The impact of these changes in <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> movement patterns may have implications for driving performance under real world driving conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{measured}} perceived motion smear when retinal image {{motion was}} created either by a physically moving object or by {{movement of the}} <b>eyes</b> or <b>head.</b> Consistent with previous reports, the extent of perceived motion smear during an <b>eye</b> or <b>head</b> movement is less than that produced by physical object motion when the eyes are stationary. Moreover, perceived smear is substantially smaller when {{the motion of the}} retinal image is {{in the same direction as}} the <b>eye</b> or <b>head</b> movement compared to when image motion is in the opposite direction. These results imply that extra-retinal signals associated with <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> movements contribute to a reduction of perceived motion smear, thereby fostering perceptual clarity. We hypothesize that the visual system uses a simple dichotomous strategy in applying these extra-retinal signals, based only on the direction of retinal image motion with respect to the ongoing <b>eye</b> or <b>head</b> movement...|$|R

40|$|Rotations of {{the line}} of sight are mainly {{implemented}} by coordinated motion of the <b>eyes</b> and <b>head.</b> Here, we propose a model for the kinematics of three-dimensional (3 -D) head-unrestrained gaze-shifts. The model was designed to account for major principles in the known behavior, such as gaze accuracy, spatiotemporal coordination of saccades with vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), relative <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> contributions, the non-commutativity of rotations, and Listing’s and Fick constraints for the <b>eyes</b> and <b>head</b> respectively. The internal design of the model was inspired by known and hypothesized elements of gaze control physiology. Inputs included retinocentric location of the visual target and internal representations of initial 3 -D <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> orientation, whereas outputs were 3 -D displacements of eye relative to the head and head relative to shoulder. Internal transformations decomposed the 2 -D gaze command into 3 -D <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> commands with the use of three coordinated circuits: 1) a saccade generator, 2) a head rotation generator, 3) a VOR predictor. Simulations illustrate that the model can implement: 1) the correct 3 -D reference frame transformations to generate accurate gaze shifts (despite variability in other parameters), 2) the experimentally verified constraints on static <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> orientations during fixation, and 3) the experimentally observed 3 -D trajectories of <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> motion during gaze-shifts. We then use this model to simulate how 2 -D eye-head coordination strategies interact with 3 -D constraints to influence 3 -D orientations of the eye-in-space, and the implications of this for spatial vision...|$|R

50|$|When the flb gene is mutated, several {{phenotypic}} abnormalities during {{development can}} be viewed. The {{first is that}} the embryo will form a ball of dorsal hypoderm.

Since flb plays a role {{in the formation of the}} CNS and the <b>eye,</b> <b>head</b> structures will be underdeveloped or not present at all. Another function of the gene is to retract the germ band. This will not occur if the flb is mutated. There are other hypomorphic alleles that also contribute to the retraction of the germ-band, which allow for a spectrum of severity in the phenotype of embryos but they will not recover the Wild Type phenotype completely. This gene is necessary for the development of embryos and if it is not expressed in the appropriate way, it is lethal to the embryo.|$|E

40|$|When {{the head}} is unrestrained, the large {{amplitude}} gaze shifts are composed of coordinated <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> movements. The position of the eyes {{at the onset of}} the gaze shift can alter the <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> contributions to the movement. The movements of the <b>eyes</b> and <b>head</b> during the unrestrained-head gaze shift follow well-defined relationships. It is possible to predict the displacement of the <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> components of the gaze shift, if the position of the target signal in the retina and the initial eye position in the orbit are known. In the present study we provide a quantitative analysis for decomposing the gaze displacement signal and propose a mathematical model to predict the displacement of the <b>eye</b> and <b>head</b> components of the gaze shift. We conclude that the displacements of the <b>eye</b> and the <b>head</b> components are determined by five factors: the current gaze displacement, the initial eye position, the upper limit of the range in which the eyes move freely without head contribution, the lower limit of the range in which the head moves only, and the maximal displacement of the visual target (maximal initial retinal error).
