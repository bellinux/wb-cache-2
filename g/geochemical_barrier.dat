A determining role has been {{revealed in the}} distribution of heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Cd and As) in the soil continuum of the granulometric texture, content of humic substances, namely, the mass ratio of humic and fulvic acids, pH and redox potential of the soil environment. Based on the experimental data, it has been shown the availability of opportunity for using the mixtures of humic acids, calcium peroxide and bentonite to detoxify soils contaminated with heavy metals. In this case, the mixture acts both as ameliorant and <b>geochemical</b> <b>barrier</b> preventing the heavy metals translocation process in soil-plant system.

An ammonium smectite was prepared by cation exchange from a natural montmorillonite (Wyoming). The samples were characterized and their properties were compared by the use of a set of complementary techniques (X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, N 2 adsorption-desorption BET technique, thermal analysis, and percolation experiments). The main effect was a modification of the porosity and its network, and reduced crystalline swelling. These effects changed the hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic swelling of the clay. The oedometer experiments, which allow simulating the pressure on small amounts of samples, proved the strong increase of the permeability of NH 4 -smectite.

40|$|Microelement {{composition}} {{is an important}} condition of edaphotopes as the major, summarizing parts of any biogeocenosis. Microelements in ultra-microquantity are necessary for vital functions of all organisms, but their anthropogenic accumulation and transformation in soil environment represents a real threat for living organisms’ health and stability of the biosphere as a whole. <b>Geochemical</b> <b>barriers</b> are local zones where the conditions of elemental migration are significantly different, resulting in accumulation of some chemical elements. The relevance of geochemical barriers’ study consists in the prospective possibility of artificial limitation of the migration of polluting elements in the environment. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine the role of <b>geochemical</b> <b>barriers</b> in distribution and migration of manganese in edaphotopes of Dnieper Prysamarye. Content of manganese in soils, regularity of its distribution and relationship between a number of physical and chemical properties of soils were considered in the course of investigation. Besides, this paper summarizes the main features and regularities of the different geochemical barriers’ formation. Manganese content in soils was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The objects of the research are edaphotopes of the biogeocenoses of Dnieper Prisamarye situated in steppe zone of Ukraine, subzone of forb-fescue-stipa steppe. According to our data, the average concentrations of manganese in the horizons of 0 – 50 cm of ordinary chernozem, alkaline-saline meadow-forest soil, floodplain meadow-forest and sod upland soils are 495 ± 24, 610 ± 223, 810 ± 220, 51 ± 11 mg/kg of ovendry weight soil, respectively. Furthermore, the authors investigated the correlation between the content of manganese and absorption capacity, humus content, composition of exchange cations, pH and dry residue of soils under study. The results obtained demonstrate that specific soil horizons can be regarded as <b>geochemical</b> <b>barriers</b> in the dissemination of manganese. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} greatest impact on the distribution of manganese was exerted by pH (and, consequently, the carbonate content) and amount of humus in soil. This fact allows to consider pH and humus content as the <b>geochemical</b> and biological <b>barriers</b> for migration of manganese, respectively. It has been also concluded that establishing of the relation between physical and chemical properties of soil and its microelement composition could give an opportunity to regulate the content of microelements in edaphotopes of different biogeocenoses and to improve their living conditions thereby...|$|R

In this study, three cover layers were tested to minimize As, Fe and S mobilization from a substrate from former gold mining, containing pyrite and arsenopyrite. For this purpose, different layers (capillary break, sealant and cover layer) above the substrate and the induction of a <b>geochemical</b> <b>barrier</b> (GB) were used to provide suitable conditions for adsorption and co-precipitation of the mobilized As. Thirteen treatments were established to evaluate the leaching of As, Fe and S from a substrate in lysimeters. The pH, As, Fe, S, Na, and K concentrations and total volume of the leachates were determined. Mineralogical analyses were realized in the substrate {{at the end of the}} experimental period. Lowest amounts of As, Fe and S (average values of 5. 47, 48. 59 and 132. 89 g/lysimeter) were leached in the treatments that received Na and K to induce GB formation. Mineralogical analyses indicated jarosite formation in the control treatment and in treatments that received Na and K salts. However, the jarosite amounts in these treatments were higher than in the control, suggesting that these salts accelerated the GB formation.

40|$|Ochtiná Aragonite Cave is a 300 m long cryptokarstic cavity {{with simple}} linear {{sections}} {{linked to a}} geometrically irregular spongework labyrinth. The limestones, partly metasomatically altered to ankerite and siderite, occur as lenses in insoluble rocks. Oxygen-enriched meteoric water seeping along the faults caused siderite/ankerite weathering and transformation to ochres that were later removed by mechanical erosion. Corrosion was enhanced by sulphide weathering of gangue minerals and by carbon dioxide released from decomposition of siderite/ankerite. The initial phreatic speleogens, older than 780 ka, were created by dissolution in density-derived convectional cellular circulation conditions of very slow flow. Thermohaline convection cells operating in the flooded cave might also have influenced its morphology. Later vadose corrosional events have altered the original form to a large extent.

It is shown that surface modification of glauconite by a mixed nickel-potassium ferrocyanide phase allows it to considerably increase its specificity (caesium distribution coefficients (2. 9 ± 0. 8) Ч 103 mL g- 1 for natural and (4. 5 ± 0. 5) Ч 105 mL g- 1 for modified glauconite) as well as making it selective to caesium in the presence of other alkaline ions and also provides irreversible caesium sorption. CONCLUSIONS: Due to improved features, modified aluminosilicates can be more successful than natural ones when used for rehabilitation of radioactive contaminated territories (including agriculture) and water areas, as well as for decontamination of liquid radioactive wastes and for creation of <b>geochemical</b> <b>barriers</b> in solid radioactive waste storage. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
40|$|In the {{consideration}} of Yucca Mountain as a possible site for storing high level nuclear waste, a number of geologic concerns have been suggested for study by the National Academy of Sciences which include: (1) natural geologic and <b>geochemical</b> <b>barriers,</b> (2) possible future fluctuations in the water table that might flood a mined underground repository, (3) tectonic stability, and (4) considerations of shaking such as might be caused by nearby earthquakes or possible volcanic eruptions. This volume represents the third {{part of an overall}} plan of geophysical investigation of Yucca Mountain, preceded by the Site Characterization Plan (SCP; dated 1988) and the report referred to as the Geophysical White Paper, Phase 1, entitled Status of Data, Major Results, and Plans for Geophysical Activities, Yucca Mountain Project (Oliver and others, 1990). The SCP necessarily contained uncertainty about applicability and accuracy of methods then untried in the Yucca Mountain volcano-tectonic setting, and the White Paper, Phase 1, focused on summarization of survey coverage, data quality, and applicability of results. For the most part, it did not present data or interpretation. The important distinction of the current volume lies in presentation of data, results, and interpretations of selected geophysical methods used in characterization activities at Yucca Mountain. Chapters are included on the following: gravity investigations; magnetic investigations; regional magnetotelluric investigations; seismic refraction investigations; seismic reflection investigations; teleseismic investigations; regional thermal setting; stress measurements; and integration of methods and conclusions. 8 refs., 60 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R
