5|$|Although critics panned the novel, Balzac {{remained}} steadfast in {{his belief}} that it provided an important look at philosophy, especially metaphysics. As he developed the scheme for La Comédie humaine, he placed Louis Lambert in the Études philosophiques section, and later returned to the same themes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Séraphîta, about an androgynous angelic creature.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Ulysses, James Joyce {{mentions}} the bird while the novel's main character is drifting into sleep. He associates the great auk with the mythical roc {{as a method}} of formally returning the main character to a sleepy land of fantasy and memory.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel.</b> Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing {{and he had been}} dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|Comments about Heliade and his Bucharest statue feature {{prominently}} in Macedonski's short story Nicu Dereanu, whose main character, a daydreaming Bohemian, idolizes the Wallachian writer. Sburătorul, a modernist literary magazine of the interwar period, edited by Eugen Lovinescu, owed {{its name to}} Zburătorul, making use of an antiquated variant of the name (a form favored by Heliade). During the same years, Camil Petrescu made reference to Heliade <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Un om între oameni, which depicts events from Nicolae Bălcescu's lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Puddletown's parish {{church has}} {{significant}} architectural interest, particularly its furnishings and monuments. It has a 12th-century font and well-preserved woodwork, including 17th-century box pews. Thomas Hardy {{took an interest}} in the church, and the village provided the inspiration for the fictional settlement of Weatherbury <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Far from the Madding Crowd; Weatherbury Farm, the home of principal character Bathsheba Everdene, is based on a manor house within the parish.|$|E
5|$|Teman Doedoek {{was read}} by Soeman Hs, a Bengkalis-born teacher {{who had already}} gained {{popularity}} as a writer of detective fiction. Soeman, once a student of Kasim's, had also experimented with more humorous story-telling approaches, including <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Pertjobaan Setia {{as well as in}} the numerous short stories he had published through Pandji Pustaka. After the commercial success of Teman Doedoek, Balai Pustaka sought to release a new short story collection; thus, Soeman was contacted.|$|E
5|$|The Gardens {{feature in}} a number of other works of literature. They are the scene of a brief but pivotal turning point in the {{fortunes}} of anti-heroine Becky Sharp in Thackeray's 19th-century novel Vanity Fair, as well as a setting <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Pendennis. Thomas Hardy sets scenes in his The Dynasts in the Gardens. In Cecilia by Frances Burney the Gardens are where the character Mr Harrell commits suicide.|$|E

5|$|William Harrison Ainsworth, a Victorian novelist {{considered}} {{in his day}} the equal of Dickens, wrote a romanticised account of the Pendle witches published in 1849. The Lancashire Witches {{is the only one}} of his 40 novels never to have been out of print. The British writer Robert Neill dramatised the events of 1612 <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Mist over Pendle, first published in 1951. The writer and poet Blake Morrison treated the subject in his suite of poems Pendle Witches, published in 1996, and in 2011 poet Simon Armitage narrated a documentary on BBC Four, The Pendle Witch Child.|$|E
5|$|Written by Douglas Adams, {{this was}} one of several ideas that Adams {{proposed}} to the production office around 1976. It was rejected by script editor Robert Holmes, who nonetheless encouraged Adams to continue submitting material; this ultimately led to his commission for The Pirate Planet. In 1980, Adams revised The Krikkitmen for use by Paramount Pictures as a potential Doctor Who feature film, although nothing came of this project. Finally, Adams included many of the ideas from The Krikkitmen <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Life, the Universe and Everything, the second sequel to his The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the century, some of {{the most}} widely read Russian {{literary}} figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to forced prostitution and slavery, a theme that he also touched on <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.|$|E

5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E
5|$|Jim Thompson {{was hired}} by Foster and McQueen to adapt his novel. He worked on the {{screenplay}} for four months, changing some of the scenes and episodes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel.</b> Thompson's script included the borderline surrealistic ending from his novel featuring El Rey, an imaginary Mexican town filled with criminals. McQueen objected to the depressing ending and Thompson was replaced by screenwriter Walter Hill. Hill had been recommended by Polly Platt, Bogdanovich's wife, who was then still attached to direct; Platt had been impressed by Hill's work on Hickey & Boggs (1972). Hill said Bogdanovich wanted to turn the material into a more Hitchcock-type thriller, but he had only gotten twenty-five pages in when McQueen fired the director. Hill finished the script in six weeks, then Peckinpah came on board.|$|E
5|$|Psycho {{has become}} one of the most {{recognizable}} films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock's best known film. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel,</b> Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader's expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh's character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Scully later {{runs into}} the author at a church. He admits sending Scully the pendant and {{discusses}} with her the Sacred Heart of Jesus. She leaves, visibly shaken. Scully meets Mulder and relays her most recent encounter with the writer to Mulder. Later, Padgett woos Scully into his apartment with more character revelations. Mulder bursts in and arrests him based on accurate descriptions of the case murders <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel,</b> which he secretly read after discovering it in the mail. While Padgett is in custody, Maggie is murdered {{in the same fashion}} as Kevin. This establishes a de facto alibi for the author. Lacking concrete and connective evidence to the murders, and hoping Padgett might lead them to his partner in crime, Mulder releases Padgett from custody.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} was never financially stable and had difficulty profiting from its agricultural pursuits. By 1844, the Brook Farmers adopted a societal model {{based on the}} socialist concepts of Charles Fourier and began publishing The Harbinger as an unofficial journal promoting Fourierism. Following his vision, the community members began building an ambitious structure called the Phalanstery. When the uninsured building was destroyed in a fire, the {{community was}} financially devastated and never recovered. It was fully closed by 1847. Despite the experimental commune's failure, many Brook Farmers looked back on their experience positively. Critics of the commune included Charles Lane, founder of another utopian community called Fruitlands. Nathaniel Hawthorne was {{a founding member of}} Brook Farm, though he was not a strong adherent of the community's ideals. He later fictionalized his experience <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> The Blithedale Romance (1852).|$|E
5|$|The line of Abrahams {{came to an}} end in 1842 when Sir Charles Abraham Elton, 6th Baronet, succeeded his father. Sir Charles was a writer, {{and contributed}} to several {{periodicals}} including The Gentleman's Magazine. Sir Charles' sister Julia was married to the historian Henry Hallam, and his nephew Arthur Hallam is buried in the Elton family vault at St Andrew's church. Arthur Hallam is the subject of Alfred Tennyson's poem In Memoriam A.H.H.. Tennyson visited Clevedon Court in 1850, the year in which the poem was published, and also in which he was created Poet Laureate. William Makepeace Thackeray was a visitor to the court during Sir Charles's time and it was the inspiration for the house Castlewood which featured <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novel</b> The History of Henry Esmond although, contrary to common belief, it is improbable that he wrote any of it at Clevedon Court. Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived in Clevedon briefly during this period and may have visited the Court.|$|E
50|$|Mystery novel writer K.C. Constantine {{has used}} various {{elements}} of Greensburg {{as a basis}} for the fictional town of Rocksburg <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novels.</b>|$|R
50|$|He writes {{not only}} mystery novels but also essays and story books for children. The style of writing differs from <b>his</b> <b>novels,</b> but {{basically}} {{he does not}} use as many characters as <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>novels.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>novels,</b> he fused {{national}} romanticism {{characterized by}} buoyant and inventive language with realistic {{depictions of the}} growth of the petite bourgeois class.|$|R
