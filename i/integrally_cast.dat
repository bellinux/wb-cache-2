500|$|The present {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Watkin George. George had been trained as a carpenter, but in 1792 became the chief engineer of the ironworks and {{a partner in the}} business. The bridge is composed of two cast iron A-frame trusses supporting a rectangular 2-foot by 6-foot-2-inch cast iron trough. This lower trough carried the Taff Fechan leat and acts as a girder supporting the plates acting as the railway sleepers, into which the rail chairs are <b>integrally</b> <b>cast.</b> [...] Wooden uprights were attached to the iron risers that passed through the apex of each of the A-frames and these supported the upper trough carrying the Taff Fawr leat. Reflecting its designer's roots in carpentry, the members composing the trusses are joined by dovetail and mortise and tenon joints commonly used in wooden structures.|$|E
50|$|For {{a channel}} {{constructed}} balisong, {{the main part}} of each handle is formed from one piece of material. In this handle, a groove is created (either by folding, milling, or being <b>integrally</b> <b>cast)</b> in which the blade rests when the knife is closed. This style is regarded as being stronger than sandwich construction.|$|E
50|$|The Algol was a {{conventionally}} {{laid out}} radial engine, with nine cylinders {{in a single}} row. The crankcase was a barrel-shaped aluminium alloy casting, with an internal integral diaphragm which held the front crankshaft bearing. Forward of the diaphragm there was an <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> cam-gear case for the double track cam-ring. The reduction gear was housed under a domed casing attached {{to the front of}} the crankcase.|$|E

50|$|All {{of these}} engines are of robust construction, with large cast iron frames {{that have the}} {{cylinders}} <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with them. The Park Street Mill engine is made from two large castings bolted together along a central plane and with the steam passages cored directly into the castings.|$|R
2500|$|The RAF 1 {{was based}} on the Renault 70/80 hp engine, being {{intended}} specifically to replace that engine in the B.E.2c. It featured larger cylinders (...) for a total displacement of 540 cubic inches (8.8 L). It was rated at 92hp (70kW) at 1,600 rpm. The heads were <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with the cylinders, with the intake and exhaust valves set one above the other in an upside-down F-head configuration.|$|R
50|$|A blisk (portmanteau of bladed disk) is a {{turbomachine}} component comprising both {{rotor disk}} and blades. It {{consists of a}} single part, instead of an assembly of a disk and individual, removable blades. Blisks may be <b>integrally</b> <b>cast,</b> machined from a solid piece of material, or made by welding individual blades to a rotor disk. The term is used mainly in aerospace engine design. Blisks may also be known as integrally bladed rotors (IBR).|$|E
50|$|The Pétrel was {{an upright}} V-12 engine with two banks of six cylinders, {{arranged}} at 60° to each other, driving a common crankshaft. The cylinder blocks were bolted onto the crankcase, all light alloy parts. The crankcase came in two pieces, with seven crankshaft bearings {{in the upper}} section. Roller bearings were used at the crankshaft ends; the remaining five were plain. The upper crankcase section also had <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> water channels {{as part of the}} cooling system.|$|E
50|$|Between late {{model year}} 1961 and early model year 1963, {{approximately}} 52,000 die-cast aluminum RG blocks were produced and installed in passenger cars. These open-deck blocks used <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> high-nickel iron cylinder liners, and bolt-in iron {{upper and lower}} main bearing caps. Internal components (crank, rods, pistons, etc.) {{were the same as}} used in the iron engine, and an iron cylinder head was used with a special copper-asbestos gasket. The aluminum block weighs about 80 lb less than the iron RG block.|$|E
50|$|Donnington Bridge has {{a single}} arch span of 170 feet between {{supports}} and an overall width of 56 feet 8 inches. It is constructed of reinforced concrete deck slab <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with 10 pre-stressed concrete legs triangulated to meet the hinges enclosed within the abutments. The abutments are clad externally with precast concrete units faced with Criggion Green and Blue Shap stone and the fascias of the bridge are calcined flint.|$|R
50|$|The Class 24 had a {{one-piece}} cast-steel {{main frame}} which was <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with the cylinders, including the cylinder hind covers, smokebox support frame, stays and various brackets, {{all of which}} would normally be separate items riveted or bolted onto the frames. Advantages of this arrangement are reduced maintenance and less time spent in shops. It was the first South African steam locomotive to be built using this technique.|$|R

50|$|The Pelton {{turbines}} are horizontal units {{operating at}} 750rpm. The runner buckets {{are made with}} <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> stainless cast steel. The runner is directly coupled to the generator shaft. Other equipment associated with the turbine are inlet valve, distributor, power nozzles and needles and the governor and hydraulic systems. Rated voltage of the generators is 6.3kV. The bearings of generators are oil lubricated sleeve type and separate oil lubrication unit is used. Two 6MVA transformers are used to step up the generator voltage to 33KV. These transformers are the outdoor type. A 50kVA transformer operating at 400V is used for station supply.|$|E
5000|$|The Ten Curves Road-Manistique River Bridge in Germfask {{consisted}} of two 90 foot, arched concrete through girders sitting on concrete brackets cantilevered from concrete abutments. [...] The roadway was 22.3 feet wide, with an overall structure width of 25.3 feet. Twelve concrete floor beams, <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> into the deck, ran between the main spans. The walls of the bridge were punctured with five small arched cutouts. Guardrails had been installed {{at each end of}} the bridge. Prior to the bridge's demolition, the concrete walls of the bridge were severely spalled, but the bridge remained structurally sound.|$|E
50|$|In most {{types of}} {{reciprocating}} engines, a valve guide is provided for each poppet valve in the cylinder head. Along with the valve spring, it serves to positively locate the valve {{so that it}} may make proper contact with the valve seat. A valve guide is a cylindrical piece of metal, pressed or <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> into the cylinder head, with the valve reciprocating inside it. Guides also serve to conduct heat from the combustion process out from the exhaust valve and into the cylinder head where it may be {{taken up by the}} cooling system. Bronze is commonly used, as is steel; a balance between stiffness and wear on the valve is essential to achieve a useful service life.|$|E
50|$|The tandem {{compound}} locomotive {{first appeared on}} the American Erie Railroad in 1867. In a {{tandem compound}} engine, each pair of high- and low-pressure cylinders drove a common crosshead, connecting rod and crank. The high-pressure cylinders were bolted onto the fronts of the low-pressure cylinders, which were usually each <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with {{one half of the}} smokebox saddle. The hollow piston valves were mounted on the same valve spindle in a common steam chest, with the high-pressure valves arranged for inside admission and the low-pressure valves for outside admission.|$|R
40|$|Strengthening {{concrete}} {{members to}} improve the load carrying capacity and ductility at an economic cost has constantly been a challenge. This study aims to evaluate {{the effects of the}} conventional repair materials, mortar and galvanised wire mesh and mortar composite (MGWM) on the overall behaviours of confined concrete columns. The investigation was carried out on medium strength concrete (MSC) and normal strength concrete (NSC), respectively. Two methods were used to install the mesh reinforcement: <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with concrete and wrapped to precast concrete core. The first method was applied to MSC specimens while the second was adopted for NSC cylinders...|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was designed}} by Dr. M.M. Loubser, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the SAR from 1939 to 1949. It had a one-piece steel main frame that was <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with the cylinders, including the cylinder hind covers, smokebox support frame, stays and various brackets, all of which would normally be separate items riveted or bolted onto the frame. Advantages of this arrangement were reduced maintenance and less time spent in shops. It was the first South African steam locomotive to be built using this technique. They were built with Watson Standard no. 1 boilers and they used Type MY Torpedo tenders that ran on three-axle Buckeye bogies.|$|R

50|$|The 4-8-4 type {{arrived on}} the {{locomotive}} scene {{at a time when}} nearly all the important design improvements had already been proven, such as the superheater, mechanical stoker, outside valve gear, the Delta trailing truck and the one-piece bed frame of cast steel with <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> cylinders, which did much to advance the application of roller bearings on steam locomotives since it gave the strength and rigidity to hold them in correct alignment. In 1930, the Timken Company actually used a 4-8-4 built by ALCO with roller bearings on all axles and called the Timken 1111, to demonstrate the value of their sealed roller bearings over nearly every mainline in the United States. The Timken 1111 was subsequently sold to the NP, where it became NP no. 2626, their sole Class A-1 locomotive.|$|E

40|$|Superalloy {{airfoils}} {{are produced}} by investment casting (IC), which uses ceramic cores and wax patterns with ceramic shell molds. Hollow cored superalloy airfoils in a gas turbine engine are an example of complex IC parts. The complex internal hollow cavities of the airfoil are designed to conduct cooling air through one or more passageways. These complex internal passageways have been fabricated by a lost wax process requiring several processing steps; core preparation, injection molding for wax pattern, and dipping process for ceramic shell molds. Several steps generate problems such as high cost and decreased accuracy of the ceramic mold. For example, costly tooling and production delay are required to produce mold dies for complex cores and wax patterns used in injection molding, resulting in a big obstacle for prototypes and smaller production runs. Rather than using separate cores, patterns, and shell molds, it would be advantageous to directly produce a mold that has the casting cavity and the ceramic core by one process. Ceramic stereolithography (CerSLA) {{can be used to}} directly fabricate the <b>integrally</b> cored ceramic <b>casting</b> mold (ICCM). CerSLA builds ceramic green objects from CAD files from many thin liquid layers of powder in monomer, which are solidified by polymerization with a UV laser, thereby “writing” the design for each slice. This dissertation addresses the <b>integrally</b> cored <b>casting</b> ceramic mold (ICCM), the ceramic core with a ceramic mold shell in a single patternless construction, fabricated by ceramic stereolithography (CerSLA). CerSLA is considered as an alternative method to replace lost wax processes, for small production runs or designs too complex for conventional cores and patterns. The main topic is the development of methods to successfully fabricate an ICCM by CerSLA from refractory silica, as well as related issues. The related issues are the segregation of coarse fused silica powders in a layer, the degree of segregation parameter to prevent segregation, and sintering and cristobalite transformation in fused silica compacts...|$|R

5000|$|Structural {{engineer}} John Scarry, who {{is known}} in New Zealand as an ardent critic of his peers, praised {{the design of the}} Pacific Tower and the HSBC building in Worcester Boulevard (another steel frame building) as good examples of how buildings should be designed. [...] The earthquake performance demonstrates the resilience and economic value of steel-framed buildings—any damaged components can be removed and replaced. Completed in 2010 and comprising eccentrically braced steel frames <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with composite metal deck slabs, the building also incorporates several innovative features. These include car stackers, cranked braces and ‘super’ moment-resisting frames at ground floor level. The latter removed the need for braces from the front elevations of the building, allowing unobstructed views. These features all helped the building to withstand the extreme forces it experienced during the many earthquakes of 2010 and 2011.|$|R
40|$|A {{high torque}} motor with {{improved}} servo mechanism is reported. Armature windings are cast into an epoxy cylinder and armature conductors are <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> with an aluminum mounting ring which provides thermal conductance directly into the structure. This configuration eliminates magnetic hysteresis {{because there is no}} relative motion between the rotating magnetic field and any stationary iron.

40|$|A {{modified}} corrugated-insert blade with <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> {{shell and}} base was developed. This blade was {{as light as}} a conventional fabricated corrugated-insert blade. Of four test blades operated in a full-scale turbojet engine, one failed after about 15 hours operation at an inlet gas temperature of 1670 degrees F, a coolant-flow ratio of 0. 0064, and a 1 / 3 -span centrifugal stress of approximately 28, 000 psi. Three other test blades ran for approximately 16, 31, and 36 hours without failure at similar conditions...|$|E
40|$|Impingement {{channels}} {{are often used}} in turbine blade cooling configurations. This paper examines the heat transfer performance of a typical <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> impingement channel. Detailed heat transfer coefficient distributions on all heat transfer surfaces were obtained {{in a series of}} low temperature experiments carried out in a large-scale model of a turbine cooling system using liquid crystal techniques. All experiments were performed on a model of a 19 -hole, low aspect ratio impingement channel. The effect of flow introduced at the inlet to the channel on the impingement heat transfer within the channel was investigated. A novel test technique has been applied to determine the effect of the initial cross flow on jet penetration. The experiments were performed at an engine representative Reynolds number of 20, 000 and examined the effect of additional initial cross flow up to 10 % of the total mass flow...|$|E
40|$|Integral {{abutment}} bridges (IAB) {{are becoming}} increasing popular both in Australia and globally {{due to their}} low construction and maintenance costs in comparison to traditional road bridges. The abutment of IAB is <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with the deck, thus eliminating the thermal expansion joints. Due {{to this type of}} construction, the abutment-backfill system and the piles supporting the abutments may be influenced considerably by temperature induced longitudinal displacements, which create undesirable stresses in the bridge, eventually leading to failure. The daily and seasonal temperature variation induces cyclic thermal movements in IAB that develop an increase in soil pressure behind the abutment wall. The magnitude of the soil pressure can exceed the at-rest pressure or even reach the passive pressure. The increase in soil pressure can lead to unsatisfactory performance of IAB. As no unified earth pressure model currently exists, the methods used to estimate soil pressure are mostly empirical, relying on past experience and assumptions. This paper analyses the soil pressure models used by transportation agencies, to understand the variability among each models and compares these findings with field data...|$|R
40|$|Integral bridges, or {{integral}} abutment and jointless bridges, as {{they are}} more commonly known in the USA, are constructed without any movement joints between spans or between spans and abutments. Typically these bridges have stub-type abutments supported on piles and continuous bridge deck from one embankment to the other. Foundations are usually designed to be small and flexible to facilitate horizontal movement or rocking of the support. Integrally bridges are simple or multiple span ones that have their superstructure <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with their substructure. The jointless bridges cost less to construct and require less maintenance then equivalent bridges with expansion joints. Integral bridges present a challenge for load distribution calculations because the bridge deck, piers, abutments, embankments and soil must all be considered as single compliant system. This paper presents some of the important features of integral abutment and jointless bridge design and some guidelines to achieve improved design. The goal {{of this paper is}} to enhance the awareness among the engineering community to use integral abutment and jointless bridges in Romania...|$|R
40|$|This {{lead alloy}} badge from the British Museum {{represents}} a medieval hood repurposed as a sack for a harvest of cherries. It measures 38 by 30 millimetres and was <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with its pin and clasp in a three-part mould. When first made, {{it would have}} shone like silver. Badges were purchased in their millions by pilgrims between the late twelfth and early sixteenth centuries, as attractive, wearable and cheap souvenirs of their visits to holy sites. By the later Middle Ages badges were also worn as general symbols of devotion, as livery insignia, and as humorous or amorous tokens; which of these categories the “hood of cherries” badge falls into is debatable. Five {{of them have been}} found: three in Salisbury, and another in London, while the provenance of the fifth is unknown. Their cataloguers reluctantly associate them with the cult of St Dorothy, whose emblem is a basket of fruit, although Spencer expressed concern that, “a fashionable hood seems far removed from her story. ” There are also possible alternative explanations to its meaning, which will be explored here. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of a turbine in the effluent of a pressurized fluidized bed (PFB) coal combustor presents serious materials problems. Synergistic erosion/corrosion and deposition/corrosion interactions may favor the growth of erosion-resistant oxides on blade surfaces, but brittle cracking of these oxides {{may be an important}} source of damage along heavy particle paths. <b>Integrally</b> <b>cast</b> alloy 713 LC and IN 792 + Hf superalloy turbine rotors in a single-stage turbine with 6 % partial admittance have been operated in the effluent of a PFB coal combustor for up to 164 hr. The rotor erosion pattern exhibits heavy particle separation with severe erosion at the leading edge, pressure side center, and suction side trailing edge at the tip. The erosion distribution pattern gives a spectrum of erosion/oxidation/deposition as a function of blade position. The data suggest that preferential degradation paths may exist even under the targeted lower loadings (less than 20 ppm) ...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} determine mechanical properties of two rhenium-free modifications of alloy TRW, and to evaluate the suitability of the alloy {{for use in a}} small <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> turbine rotor. The two alloys were initially developed using stress rupture properties of specimens machined from solid gas turbine blades. Properties in this investigation were determined from cast to size bars and bars cut from 3. 8 by 7. 6 by 17. 8 cm blocks. Specimens machined from blocks had inferior tensile strength and always had markedly poorer rupture lives than cast to size bars. At 1, 000 C the cast to size bars had shorter rupture lives than those machined from blades. Alloy R generally had better properties than alloy S in the conditions evaluated. The results show the importance of casting geometry on mechanical properties of nickel base superalloys and suggest that the geometry of a component can be simulated when developing alloys for that component...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{detailed}} experimental measurements and computational predictions of {{heat transfer coefficient}} distributions {{in a large scale}} perspex model of a novel <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> blade cooling geometry are reported. In a gas turbine blade, the cooling passage investigated is <b>integrally</b> <b>cast</b> into the blade wall, providing good thermal contact with the outer surface of the turbine blade. Flow enters the racetrack passage through the root of the blade and exits to a central plenum through a series of nineteen transfer holes equally spaced in a staggered arrangement across the span of the blade. The Reynolds number changes continuously along the passage length because of the continuous ejection of fluid through a series of 19 transfer holes to the plenum. The smooth passage surface opposite is in closest proximity to the external surface, and this investigation has characterised the heat transfer coefficient on this surface at a range of engine representative inlet Reynolds numbers using a hybrid transient liquid crystal technique. The ability of three different rib configurations to enhance the heat transfer on this surface was also determined. Because the passage at engine scale is necessarily small, the rib height in all cases was 32. 5 % of the passage height. As the entire passage wetted surface is able to contribute to the blade cooling, and knowledge of the heat transfer coefficient distribution on the holed surfaces is crucial to prediction of blade life, a commercial CFD package, Fluent, was used to predict the heat transfer coefficient distributions on the holed surface, where there was no optical access during these tests. This also allowed investigation of additional rib configurations, and comparison of the pressure penalty associated with each design. The study showed that the turbulator configuration used allows the position and maximum level of heat transfer coefficientenhancement to be chosen by the engine designer. For the configurations tested heat transfer coefficient enhancement of up to 32 % and 51 % could be achieved on the holed surface and the ribbed surface respectively. For minimum additional pressure drop 45 ° ribs should be used. Copyright © 2006 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|Superalloy lattice block panels, {{which are}} {{produced}} directly by investment casting, {{are composed of}} thin ligaments arranged in three-dimensional triangulated trusslike structures (see the preceding figure). Optionally, solid panel face sheets can be formed <b>integrally</b> during <b>casting.</b> In either form, lattice block panels can easily be produced with weights less than 25 percent {{of the mass of}} a solid panel. Inconel 718 (IN 718) and MarM- 247 superalloy lattice block panels have been developed under NASA's Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology Project and Higher Operating Temperature Propulsion Components Project {{to take advantage of the}} superalloys' high strength and elevated temperature capability with the inherent light weight and high stiffness of the lattice architecture (ref. 1). These characteristics are important in the future development of turbine engine components. Casting quality and structural efficiency were evaluated experimentally using small beam specimens machined from the cast and heat treated 140 - by 300 - by 11 -mm panels. The matrix of specimens included samples of each superalloy in both open-celled and single-face-sheet configurations, machined from longitudinal, transverse, and diagonal panel orientations. Thirty-five beam subelements were tested in Glenn's Life Prediction Branch's material test machine at room temperature and 650 C under both static (see the following photograph) and cyclic load conditions. Surprisingly, test results exceeded initial linear elastic analytical predictions. This was likely a result of the formation of plastic hinges and redundancies inherent in lattice block geometry, which was not considered in the finite element models. The value of a single face sheet was demonstrated by increased bending moment capacity, where the face sheet simultaneously increased the gross section modulus and braced the compression ligaments against early buckling as seen in open-cell specimens. Preexisting flaws in specimens were not a discriminator in flexural, shear, or stiffness measurements, again because of redundant load paths available in the lattice block structure. Early test results are available in references 2 and 3; more complete analyses are scheduled for publication in 2004...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the issues}} that has not been {{completely}} resolved in bridges built without expansion joints is the influence of seasonal temperature variations and soil characteristics on the maximum bridge length. To study this problem, a 40 meter long road composite bridge over the river Leduân in the north of Sweden was built in 2005. The bridge superstructure was <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with the substructure. One row of piles {{on each side of the}} bridge was constructed to support the abutment. The bridge was continuously monitored for 18 months in order to provide information on the strain level at the top of the pile as a function of the air temperature variations. The results from the measurements were compared to results obtained from 2 D Finite Element Analysis. Soil characteristics were varied in the FEA to investigate its influence on the overall bridge behaviour as well as on the level of strain variations at the top of the piles. The bridge monitoring was a part of a research project, INTAB, Economic and Durable Design of Composite Bridges with Integral Abutments, 2005 - 2008. The main objective of the project was to propose recommendations for rational analysis and design of bridges with integral abutments.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to determine the cooling effectiveness {{of a wide variety}} of air-cooled turbine-blade configurations. The blades, which were tested in the turbine of a - commercial turbojet engine that was modified for this investigation by replacing two of the original blades with air-cooled blades located diametrically opposite each other, are untwisted, have no aerodynamic taper, and have essentially the same external profile. The cooling-passage configuration is different for each blade, however. The fabrication procedures were varied and often unique. The blades were fabricated using methods most suitable for obtaining a small number of blades for use in the cooling investigations and therefore not all the fabrication procedures would be directly applicable to production processes, although some of the ideas and steps might be useful. Blade shells were obtained by both casting and forming. The cast shells were either welded to the blade base or <b>cast</b> <b>integrally</b> with the base. The formed shells were attached to the base by a brazing and two welding methods. Additional surface area was supplied in the coolant passages by the addition of fins or tubes that were S-brazed. to the shell. A number of blades with special leading- and trailing-edge designs that provided added cooling to these areas were fabricated. The cooling effectiveness and purposes of the various blade configurations are discussed briefly...|$|R
