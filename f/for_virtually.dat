5|$|Antananarivo is the {{administrative}} capital and largest city of Madagascar. It {{is located in}} the highlands region, near the geographic center of the island. King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga. As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration <b>for</b> <b>virtually</b> the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants. The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Washington in October 1861, the {{regiment}} spent the following winter in camp at Hall's Hill, near Arlington in Virginia. It {{became part of}} the Army of the Potomac, with which it would be associated for its entire term of service. The regiment saw its first action during the Siege of Yorktown in April 1862. It was involved in the Peninsular Campaign, particularly the Battle of Gaines' Mill during which it suffered its worst casualties (numerically) of the war. Their worst casualties in terms of percentages took place during the Battle of Gettysburg (60 percent). The 22nd Massachusetts was present <b>for</b> <b>virtually</b> all of the major battles in which the Army of the Potomac fought, including the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg and Lieutenant General Ulysses Grant's Overland Campaign.

These 22 years were arguably the most significant for the regiment with between one and three battalions involved in combat operations in South-East Asia at any one time. A second lengthy period of operational service commenced with the intervention in East Timor in 1999, which became {{the first of many}} commitments for the regiment that have continued to the present day. Approximately 85,000 personnel have served in the RAR during this time, with casualties sustained by the regiment on operations including 693 killed and over 3,000 wounded.|$|E
