5|$|The Dominicans, who {{introduced}} the first printing {{press in the}} Philippines, were <b>fortunate</b> {{to have been able}} to transfer the UST printing press from Intramuros to the España campus in the nick of time in 1940, a year before the Pearl Harbor bombing.|$|E
5|$|A former member, Lewis had {{a privileged}} {{upbringing}} {{and sought to}} help the less <b>fortunate</b> and fight oppression and corruption as a crime-fighter. To this end Lewis created a costume with special wings that helped him glide. His mental stability ultimately deteriorated after he was called before HUAC, leading to him being forcibly brought to a mental asylum.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke was <b>fortunate</b> {{during the}} Second World War to suffer very little bomb damage. A stick of German bombs did {{fall in the}} Church Square area on 16 August 1940. The same day bombs {{destroyed}} part of a row of houses in Burgess Road. Six {{people were killed in}} the raid. After the war, the town had a population of 25,000.|$|E
5|$|For {{the emperor}} Caesar, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus , the pious, <b>fortunate</b> Augustus, {{greatest}} victor in Parthia, greatest victor in Britain, greatest victor in Germany, Pontifex Maximus, holding tribunician {{power for the}} twentieth time, Emperor for the fourth time, Consul for the fourth time, Father of the Country, Proconsul, and for Julia Augusta , the pious, <b>fortunate</b> mother of the camp and the Senate and the country, because of his exceptional and new kindness towards all, which is {{greater than that of}} the principes that came before, the Republic of the Volubilitans took care to have this arch made from the ground up, including a chariot drawn by six horses and all the ornaments, with Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, procurator, who is most deeply devoted to the divinity of Augustus, initiating and dedicating it.|$|E
5|$|It's not {{my natural}} {{inclination}} to {{see myself as}} a brand, I'm just a person who has been <b>fortunate</b> to explore other interests and passions outside of the game I love. I will always be associated with my sport but I am now working across other areas that will continue long after my career has finished.|$|E
5|$|Maredudd ap Rhys (died 1239) {{was also}} given as a hostage, but was less <b>fortunate</b> than Hywel. He was blinded by King Henry after {{the failure of}} the {{invasion}} of Wales in 1165, and became known as Maredudd Ddall (Maredudd the Blind). He ended his days as a monk at Whitland Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Sigurd {{was in the}} <b>fortunate</b> {{position}} that on his accession to the earldom there {{seem to have been}} no other serious contenders. In this respect his rule was unlike that of the earlier generation of the sons of Earl Thorfinn and of the next generation in that it avoided the bitter feuding that beset the earldom during both of those periods.|$|E
5|$|The German {{national}} team {{was not so}} <b>fortunate,</b> losing {{the final of the}} European Championship to the Netherlands before a home town crowd in Frankfurt. It claimed silver at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto, Canada, and beat the Netherlands in the 2015 European Championships, to claim its tenth European title. At the 2016 Paralympic Games, it won silver after losing the final to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Smithfield {{area was}} <b>fortunate</b> to emerge largely unscathed by the Great Fire of London in 1666, which was abated near the Fortune of War Tavern, at the {{junction}} of Giltspur Street and Cock Lane, where the statue of the Golden Boy of Pye Corner is located. In the late 17th century, several residents of Smithfield emigrated to America where they founded the Town of Smithfield, Rhode Island.|$|E
5|$|Although Elizabeth Johnson {{was mistaken}} about the Pike village site, her mistake is {{held to be}} a <b>fortunate</b> one. The Webster County site had been {{subjected}} to decades of cultivation and relic hunting. The Republic County site was not entirely pristine, due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation; but it was far better preserved. Today, the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site, built in 1967 {{over one of the}} excavated earth lodges.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was <b>fortunate</b> to {{be better}} known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she {{suggested}} {{that there would be a}} lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E
5|$|At the September 2008 {{topping off}} ceremony, Donald Trump marketed his hotel by expressing {{doubts about the}} Chicago Spire ever being {{completed}} due to the financial crisis of 2007–2009. However, Donald Jr. {{said that they were}} <b>fortunate</b> to complete the project, while the Spire and Waterview Tower were among developments hit by the economic slowdown that followed the financial crisis. Occupancy had begun on lower-floor condominiums {{at the time of the}} ceremony.|$|E
5|$|By {{the death}} of Dom Pedro in 1786, all the {{interior}} work was completed. This was <b>fortunate,</b> as from this period his widow's mental health deteriorated, until in 1794, she and her court took up official and full-time residence at Queluz. There the now completely insane Queen could be hidden from the view of her subjects. Her eldest son, later King João VI, was appointed Regent and ruled from Lisbon and the great palace at Mafra.|$|E
5|$|Despite his father's {{wishes that}} DeLee become a rabbi, DeLee {{attended}} Chicago Medical College. Of particular influence on DeLee was obstetrics professor W. W. Jaggard. He graduated in 1891. Author Charlotte Borst noted {{that most women}} delivered {{at home in the}} 1870s through 1890s; medical students at Northwestern only witnessed deliveries at that time if they could bribe women into having their babies at the hospital's amphitheatre. DeLee felt <b>fortunate</b> to have observed two such births while he was a student.|$|E
5|$|Eardwulf's {{whereabouts}} {{after his}} recovery are not known. In surviving King Æthelred's anger {{he was more}} <b>fortunate</b> than Ælfwald's sons, who were drowned on Æthelred's orders in 791. Osred returned from exile but was betrayed, and killed by Æthelred's command on 14 September 792. Æthelred himself was assassinated on 18 April 796, perhaps at Corbridge, by conspirators led by the dux Ealdred. Æthelred was followed as king by Osbald, whose antecedents are unknown: he was deposed after twenty-seven days and fled {{to the land of}} the Picts with a few supporters.|$|E
5|$|Glinicki was {{philosophical}} {{about the}} win, noting in December 2012 {{that there were}} many awards and ceremonies, but that the memory of London was fading over time. He returned to coaching his club team, Hamburger SV (now renamed BG Baskets Hamburg), which included national team members Mareike Adermann and Edina Müller (and Australia's Bridie Kean). It {{went on to win the}} national championship for the eighth time in 2013. The national team was not so <b>fortunate,</b> losing the European Championship to the Netherlands by a point, 56–57, before a home town crowd in Frankfurt in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann, a pre-war glider pilot, {{joined the}} Luftwaffe in 1940 and {{completed}} his fighter pilot training in 1942. He was posted to Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG52) on the Eastern Front and was <b>fortunate</b> {{to be placed}} {{under the supervision of}} some of the Luftwaffes most experienced fighter pilots. Under their guidance, Hartmann steadily developed his tactics, which earned him the coveted Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds on 25 August 1944 for claiming 301 aerial victories. At the time of its presentation to Hartmann, this was Germany's highest military decoration.|$|E
5|$|Howling Bells parted {{ways with}} Bella Union and, in 2008, {{signed a deal}} with record label Independiente. The band worked with {{producer}} and mixer Dan Grech-Marguerat (Radiohead, Paul McCartney) and recorded its follow-up album, Radio Wars, at several different recording studios. 8:35, b 9:41, c10:25, d 10:50}} At times, the members {{found it difficult to}} work with their new producer. However, they have stated that in retrospect, they learned a great deal from him and felt <b>fortunate</b> for having the experience of collaborating with him.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Round Vale drew another league {{rival in}} Southport, who battled to a 1–1 draw at Haig Avenue on 12 December, Harry Whitworth's header {{cancelling}} out Basil Hayward's opener. The Vale players later admitted they were <b>fortunate</b> to {{come away with}} a draw, especially seen as Colin Askey and Albert Leake {{spent much of the}} game limping. Two days later Vale recorded a 2–0 win in the replay in what was a tough game.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's early {{romantic and}} sexual {{relationships}} were exclusively with men. Keynes {{had been in}} relationships while at Eton and Cambridge; significant among these early partners were Dilly Knox and Daniel Macmillan. Keynes was open about his affairs, and from 1901 to 1915 kept separate diaries in which he tabulated his many sexual encounters. Keynes's relationship and later close friendship with Macmillan was to be <b>fortunate,</b> as Macmillan's company first published his tract Economic Consequences of the Peace.|$|E
5|$|Michael compares {{that the}} {{circumstances}} of the episode to the components for an audition tape for Fear Factor, an American sports dare reality game show. Michael later bothers Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) with an impression of the Popeye cartoon character J. Wellington Wimpy. Dwight makes repeated calls to WEZX Rock 107, a Scranton radio station that plays classic rock. Michael snidely compares Darryl and Roy's work to , an American reality television series providing home improvements for less <b>fortunate</b> families and community schools.|$|E
5|$|Other memoirs by the Robinsons include Bunkier (The Bunker) by Chaim Goldstein, Byłem ochroniarzem Karskiego (Karski's Bodyguard) by Dawid Landau, Ukrywałem się w Warszawie : styczeń 1943 – styczeń 1945 (I Hid in Warsaw: January 1943 – January 1945) by Stefan Chaskielewicz, Moje szczęśliwe życie (My <b>Fortunate</b> Life) by Szymon Rogoźinski, and Aniołowie bez skrzydeł (Angels Without Wings) by Czesława Fater. Many other testimonies and {{recollections}} {{are contained}} in {{the archives of the}} Emmanuel Ringelblum Żydowski Instytut Historyczny (Jewish Historical Institute) in Warsaw and Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Scotia left Troon, Scotland, on 2 November 1902. On her way southward {{she called}} at the Irish port of Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire), at Funchal in Madeira, {{and then the}} Cape Verde Isles before an {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt was made to}} land at the tiny, isolated equatorial archipelago known as St Paul's Rocks. This attempt almost cost the life of the expedition's geologist and medical officer, James Harvie Pirie, who was <b>fortunate</b> to escape from the shark-infested seas after misjudging his leap ashore. Scotia reached Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands on 6 January 1903, where she re-provisioned for the Antarctic journey ahead.|$|E
5|$|Skagen Town and Regional Museum (Skagen By- og Egnsmuseum), {{an open-air}} museum, was opened {{by the local}} {{population}} in 1927. In 1938 it {{was moved to the}} sand dunes of Vesterby. The museum brings together examples of fishermen's cottages and the homes of less <b>fortunate</b> inhabitants of Skagen {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. There is an old life-saving station, a smithy, an old Dutch windmill, pictures of ships in distress and related nautical artefacts as well as a collection of items illustrating the town's history over various periods.|$|E
5|$|Spedding was <b>fortunate</b> {{in having}} {{the full support of}} Charles E. Friley, the {{president}} of Iowa State College, even though the nature of the work could not at first be disclosed to him while security checks were being undertaken. Once these were completed, Friley brought in Harold V. Gaskill, the Dean of Science, as the Ames Project's administrator. The United States Army Corps of Engineers took control of the Manhattan Project in June 1942, and the Ames Project in late 1942.|$|E
5|$|Sue is {{laughed at}} by her co-workers, {{who have seen}} the video, and is mocked by new {{alcoholic}} astronomy teacher and badminton coach Brenda Castle (Molly Shannon). Sue is reminded by her sister, Jean (Robin Trocki), who has Down Syndrome, that when they were hurt as children they would volunteer at an animal shelter as a reminder there was always someone less <b>fortunate</b> than themselves. In light of her sister's advice, Sue decides {{to act as a}} therapist to guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), informing her that Will has been unfaithful to her. Emma confronts Will in the teachers' lounge, publicly shaming him.|$|E
5|$|The British press {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} Arsenal were <b>fortunate</b> to win; Wenger himself admitted so in {{his press conference}} afterwards. A television audience of over 480million worldwide watched the final; in the United Kingdom, coverage of the match peaked at 12.8million, making it the highest-rated game in Cup history since the 1996 final. The departures of captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane before the year end, coupled with the changing objectives of both clubs, meant the 2005 final is considered as the natural end point in the rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United under Ferguson and Wenger.|$|E
5|$|The Deltas are despondent, but Bluto rallies {{them with}} an impassioned, if {{historically}} inaccurate, speech ("Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"), and so they decide {{to take action against}} Wormer, the Omegas, and the college. They convert Flounder's damaged car into an armored vehicle and hide it inside a cake-shaped breakaway float in order to sneak into the annual homecoming parade. As they wreak havoc on the event, the futures of several of the student main characters are revealed using freeze-frame labels. Most of the Deltas become respectable professionals, while their adversaries suffer less <b>fortunate</b> outcomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} {{received}} by script editor Melinda M. Snodgrass at a <b>fortunate</b> time. The crew {{were looking for}} a script which could go immediately into production in order to free up time to work on other scripts which needed more work. She handed it to executive producer Michael Piller, who thought it didn't need much work. He passed it onto fellow executive producer Rick Berman, who held onto it for a week while the writers chased the production crew for updates. The script was then purchased, and Bailey, Bischoff and White were informed that it was due to go into production a week later.|$|E
5|$|Through a <b>fortunate</b> {{combination}} of circumstances I escaped from prison before my trial {{came on and}} lived for eighteen days in the forist(sic) and fields near Little Rock without a morsil(sic) of food except such raw corn and berries as I could gather in my lone wanderings. While a prisoner I felt that I was ungenerously treated by the harsh criticisms {{of the press and}} individuals not only in regard to my want of loyalty to the southern caus(sic) but also with regard to my supposed want of courage. I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E
5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a <b>fortunate</b> accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another <b>fortunate</b> coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} scene filmed was the final scene {{to appear in the}} film (shot during the filming of Attack of the Clones in 2000), {{principal}} photography on the film occurred from June 30, 2003 to September 17, 2003, with additional photography occurring at Shepperton Studios and Elstree Studios in London from August 2004 to January 31, 2005. The initial filming took place on sound stages at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, although practical environments were shot as background footage later to be composited into the film. These included the limestone mountains depicting Kashyyyk, which were filmed in Phuket, Thailand (they were later damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami). The production company was also <b>fortunate</b> enough to be shooting {{at the same time that}} Mount Etna erupted in Italy. Camera crews were sent to the location to shoot several angles of the volcano that were later spliced into the background of the animatics and the final film version of the planet Mustafar.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00 on 26 April 1797, the 74-gun ship of {{the line}} HMS Irresistible under Captain George Martin and the 36-gun frigate HMS Emerald under Captain Velterers Cornewall Berkeley were sailing at the {{southern}} edge of Jervis' (now known as Earl St. Vincent) fleet. While cruising close to the Spanish coast two unknown ships were sighted. Martin immediately ordered his ships to give chase and the strangers fled with Martin's vessels in pursuit. The new arrivals were two Spanish 34-gun frigates, the Santa Elena and Ninfa, bound to Cádiz from Havana with a cargo of silver specie. The captains of these Spanish ships had unwittingly sailed into the midst of the blockade fleet the previous night, but had had a <b>fortunate</b> encounter with a Spanish fishing vessel which had warned them of the danger. Acting quickly, the captains off-loaded their treasure into the fishing boat with instructions to carry it safely into Cádiz.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{is married}} to Stephanie and they have two children, Grace and Andrew (born November 2007). His cousin, Scott Fletcher, also played for the Cubs, {{along with many other}} teams over his fifteen-year career. Barrett has spent a {{considerable}} portion of his personal life devoted to helping children. He runs several youth baseball programs, including one in Hawaii, which was inspired from his tenure with the Hawaiian Winter Baseball League. He also works with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Cubs Care Program to help lesser <b>fortunate</b> and sick children. More recently, he has worked with Kerry Wood and Ryan Dempster to raise money to help Derrek Lee's daughter and research for Leber's congenital amaurosis. Michael Barrett donated $50,000 to Project 3000 and pledged an additional sum of money for every home run he hits. Barrett was also a regular guest on FOX Chicago's The Final Word television show, which is co hosted by Tom Waddle, a former Chicago Bears wide receiver.|$|E
