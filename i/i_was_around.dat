500|$|Several {{breaking}} {{practitioners and}} pioneers tend {{to side with}} the camp that does not believe breaking came from capoeira. B-boy Crazy Legs states: [...] "We didn't know what the f-ck no capoeira was, man. We were in the ghetto!" [...] According to Pabon, [...] "Unlike the popularity of the martial arts films, capoeira was not seen in the Bronx jams until the 1990s. Top rockin' seems to have developed gradually and unintentionally, leaving space for growth and new additions, until it evolved into a codified form." [...] B-boy crew Spartanic Rockers adds: [...] "Despite of [...] many rumours and opinions Breaking didn't originate from Capoeira but during the last few years many moves, steps and freezes of this Brazilian (fight-) dance have inspired more and more B-Girls and B-Boys who integrated them into their dance." [...] B-boy Ken Swift was breaking long before he saw capoeria: [...] "In '78 I started [...] and I didn't see it [...] til '92 ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>around,</b> too—I was in Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, I went around and I didn't see it. What we saw was Kung Fu—we saw Kung Fu from the 42nd Street theaters. So those were our inspirations... when we did the Kung Fu sh-t we switched it up and we put this B-boy flavor into it..." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{living in}} Evanston, Vedder's family fostered seven younger {{children}} in a group home. In the mid-1970s, the family, including Vedder's three younger half-brothers, moved to San Diego County, California. It {{was at this point}} that Vedder, who had received a guitar from his mother on his twelfth birthday, began turning to music (as well as surfing) as a source of comfort. He particularly found solace in The Who's 1973 album, Quadrophenia. He said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> 15 or 16... I felt all alone... I was all alone—except for music." [...] His mother and Mueller divorced when Vedder was in his late teens. His mother and brothers moved back to the Chicago area, but Vedder remained with his stepfather in California so he would not have to change high schools.|$|E
2500|$|Hooley {{claims that}} she was promised major storylines that never materialised, was asked {{to come up with}} ideas for black characters, but that all her pages of {{suggestions}} (including developing an interesting relationship with the character Dot Cotton or having Josie start her own business) were ignored. She also claims {{that she was}} only used for two-thirds of her contracted appearances. She said: [...] "In the 18 months I was in EastEnders, I had no impact. There was nothing that made people sit up and take notice of what Josie was doing. It was like they remembered <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> and threw me a line where I would slide into the bar and say, 'Hello, how are you' and then sit on a stool and say nothing {{for the rest of the}} episode. I came to feel that I was letting the black community down because my character was so empty. People of my own colour often accosted me in public and accused me of playing a token black. I was so little-used that they even wrote me cheques for episodes I never appeared in. So why did they not use me? Why are they wasting the taxpayers' money? It was very dispiriting." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{seems to}} me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> here in the {{neighborhood}} of the Public Library about fifty or sixty years ago. I don't deny the circumstance, although I don't see how you got it out of my autobiography, which was not to be printed until I am dead, unless I'm dead now. I had that $3 in change, and I remember well the $10 which was sewed in my coat. I have prospered since. Now I have plenty of money and a disposition to squander it, but I can't.

The door was left unlocked, {{as on the}} {{previous}} night, and I lay with Grandmamma, a light burning as before. About two she clutched me as I was dropping off. I looked, and there, peeping in between the dark curtains, was a pale face with long hair all about it, and a red streak at the throat. It was very dim, the light being low, but I saw it, and after one breathless minute sprang up, caught my foot, fell down with a crash, {{and by the time}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>around</b> the bed, not a vestige of the thing appeared.

Up in the air I went, {{just as soon as}} I said it, and the umbrella sailed so fast that I felt as if I was in a gale of wind. It was a long, long trip, and I got awful tired holding onto the handle, but just as I thought I'd have to let go, I began to drop down slowly, and then I found myself in the streets of a big city. I put down the umbrella and asked a man what the name of the city was, and he said 'Buffalo'." ...|$|E

5000|$|He {{said of his}} {{teaching}} years: [...] "I never went to the teachers’ lounge. But the teachers liked me.
