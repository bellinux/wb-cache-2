Poongkothai Chandrahasan told The Hindu, [...] "Mani Ratnam <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> {{to make a film}} that interesting with a different storyline. Also the way P. C. Sriram shot the film was so beautiful". Kushboo called Mouna Ragam her favourite [...] "film with a strong woman character." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the fall}} of Sihanouk, Hanoi became alarmed at the {{prospect}} of a pro-Western regime that might allow the Americans to establish a military presence on their western flank. To prevent that from happening, they began transferring their military installations away from the border regions to locations deeper within Cambodian territory. A new command center was established at the city of Kratié and the timing of the move was propitious. President Nixon was of the opinion that: [...] "We need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol...something symbolic...for the only Cambodian regime that <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> to take a pro-Western and pro-American stand." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to events in Cambodia, President Nixon {{believed that there}} were distinct possibilities for a U.S. response. With Sihanouk gone, conditions were ripe for strong measures against the Base Areas. He was also adamant that some action be taken to support [...] "The only government in Cambodia in the last twenty-five years that <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> to take a pro-Western stand." [...] The president then solicited proposals for actions from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and MACV, who presented him {{with a series of}} options: a naval quarantine of the Cambodian coast; the launching of South Vietnamese and American airstrikes; the expansion of hot pursuit across the border by ARVN forces; or a ground invasion by ARVN, U.S. forces, or both.|$|E

500|$|Eventually Butler's {{leadership}} {{style and the}} directness of actions undermined his support within the community. His departure seemed imminent. Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> to bring General Butler to Philadelphia and I {{have the guts to}} fire him." [...] Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted General Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt he was doing a bad job, though, and when the news started to break that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the Academy of Music. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia for a while longer, and the president authorized a one-year extension.|$|E
500|$|On a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (January 16, 1989) {{episode of}} ABC's late-night news program Nightline, Julian Bond, a social activist and {{leader in the}} Civil Rights Movement, nicknamed the film [...] "Rambo Meets the Klan" [...] and criticized its {{depiction}} of the FBI: [...] "People {{are going to have}} a mistaken idea about that time... It's just wrong. These guys were tapping our telephones, not looking into the murders of [...]" [...] Filmmaker Spike Lee criticized the film for its lack of central African-American characters; he felt it was among several other films that used a white savior narrative to exploit blacks in favor of depicting whites as heroes. When asked about the film at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, Lee responded, [...] "Hated it. They should have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> to have at least one central black character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} well received. Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine celebrated that [...] "for {{the first time}} I can remember, an extreme-sports game {{actually}} has a real story [...] honest-to-goodness characters". IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> to try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, Game Informers Justin Leeper thought that [...] "it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The French Prime Minister Guy Mollet, {{outraged by}} Nasser's move, {{determined}} that Nasser {{would not get}} his way. French public opinion very much supported Mollet, and apart from the Communists, all of the criticism of his government came from the right, who very publicly doubted that a socialist like Mollet <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> {{to go to war}} with Nasser. During an interview with publisher Henry Luce, Mollet held up a copy of Nasser's book The Philosophy of the Revolution and said: [...] "This is Nasser's Mein Kampf.

2500|$|In early 1956, the 4080th SR Wing {{moved to}} Laughlin AFB, Texas. Midair-refuelling capable RB-57Ds (Group B and the sole Type C) were {{deployed}} in 1957 to Rhein-Main AB, West Germany to support USAFE operations. All RB-57D operations were under heavy security {{and very little}} information ever leaked out about their early operations. They presumably carried out ELINT/SIGINT missions along the East German border and over the Baltic Sea. Since the missions were carried out under an atmosphere of high secrecy, RB-57s returning from missions over the Baltic were often intercepted by RAF Hawker Hunter interceptors {{just to make sure}} that they were not Soviet aircraft. These particular versions of the RB-57Ds <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> ripped out of the fuselage. They were equipped with an camera with a [...] focal length from lens to aperture. They produced individual frames that were developed as large as 4'x6' for CIA analysts to go over in great detail when looking for missile silos throughout Eastern Europe. The pilot and navigator who flew these missions never even got to view the film they shot. Upon landing a CIA employee would take the film before they even left their seats in their planes. When the 4025th SRS was inactivated in June 1959 the RB-57D aircraft were assigned to the 7407th Support Squadron at Rhein-Main AB, two additional aircraft added to complement including the unique RB-57D-1 equipped with SLR. Intelligence gathering sorties by the RB-57’s in West Germany continued until 1964 when wing fatigue problems caused type to be withdrawn from service.|$|E
2500|$|Bryant {{debuted in}} the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points {{in front of}} a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders {{struggled}} to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris. He scored 36 points in the finale, and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four game. As a rookie in [...] 1996–97, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel. At the time he became the youngest player ever to play in an NBA game (18 years, 72 days; a record since broken by Jermaine O'Neal and former teammate Andrew Bynum), and also became the youngest NBA starter ever (18 years, 158 days). Initially, Bryant played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time. By the end of the season, he averaged 15.5 minutes a game. During the All-Star weekend, Bryant participated in the Rookie Challenge and won the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, becoming the youngest dunk champion ever at the age of 18. Bryant's performance throughout the year earned him a spot on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team with fellow bench teammate Travis Knight. The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference semifinals in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz, when Bryant was pressed into a lead role at the end of Game 5. Byron Scott missed the game with a sprained wrist, Robert Horry was ejected for fighting with the Utah's Jeff Hornacek, and Shaquille O'Neal fouled out with 1:46 remaining in the fourth quarter. [...] Bryant shot four air balls {{at the end of the}} game; the Jazz won 98–93 in overtime to eliminate the Lakers 4–1. He first whiffed a game-winning 2-point jump shot in the fourth quarter, and then misfired three three-point field goals in overtime, including two tying shots in the final minute. O'Neal commented that [...] " [...] was the only guy who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>guts</b> at the time to take shots like that." ...|$|E
