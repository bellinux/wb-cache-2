Subsequently, Dr. Henry Chapeskie performed this procedure on over 1,100 patients with no recurrences since 1988. Unlike other procedures used to treat ingrown toenails, the Vandenbos procedure doesn't touch the nail. In this procedure, the involved toe is first anesthetized with a <b>digital</b> <b>block</b> and a tourniquet applied. An incision is made proximally {{from the base of}} the nail about 5 mm (leaving the nail bed intact) then extended toward the side of the toe/toenail in an elliptical sweep to end up under the tip of the nail about 3-4 mm in from the edge. It is important that all the skin at the edge of the nail be removed. The excision must be adequate often leaving a soft tissue deficiency measuring 1.5 × 3 cm. A portion of the lateral aspect of the distal phalanx is occasionally exposed without fear of infection. Antibiotics are not necessary as the wound is left open to close by secondary intention. Postoperative management involves soaking of the toe in warm water 3 times/day for 15-20 minutes. The wound is healed by 4-6 weeks. No cases of osteomyelitis have been reported. When healed, the nail fold skin remains low and tight at the side of the nail.|$|E
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Finger {{injuries}} are very common and {{majority of them}} can be treated under <b>digital</b> <b>block</b> anesthesia. Traditional <b>digital</b> <b>block</b> {{is one of the most}} commonly performed blocks performed by care providers in several medical fields. There are two other less known methods, transthecal (pulley) block, in which local anesthesia is injected into the flexor tendon sheat that needs less volume of anesthesia and hasnot neurovascular complications and subcutaneous block in which local anesthesia is injected subcutaneously at the level of A 1 pulley. This study aimed to compare the results of the three methods of <b>digital</b> <b>block.</b> Materials & Methods: A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed at Kashani hospital to compare the less known transthecal (pulley) and subcutaneous methods with traditional <b>digital</b> <b>block</b> with regard to the length of anesthesia and need to another anesthetic method (due to insufficient anesthesia) as a supplement. We divided 150 patients that were admitted to kashani hospital operating room due to finger injury, randomly, into three groups. In each group the patients were anesthetized by one of the three different methods. All blocks were performed by the same investigator. Data were analyzed by SPSS software using T test. Results: Mean length of anesthesia was 34. 2 min’s in the transthecal <b>digital</b> <b>block</b> method and 34 min’s in the subcutaneous method and 33. 8 min’s in the traditional <b>digital</b> <b>block</b> method. A repeat injection or local infiltration as a supplement was necessary in 5 instances (7 blocks) in the traditional <b>digital</b> <b>block</b> method and 9 instances (11 blocks) in the subcutaneous method (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Regarding fewer injections and less amount of lidocaine and no risk of damaging the neurovascular bundles and comparable length of anesthesia and no need to supplemental anesthesia, transthecal <b>digital</b> <b>block</b> is an appropriate alternative to traditional <b>digital</b> <b>block</b> and subcutaneous injection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The mixed-signal {{circuits}} {{with both}} analog and <b>digital</b> <b>blocks</b> {{on a single}} chip have wide applications in communication and RF circuits. Integrating these two blocks can cause serious problems especially in applications with fast digital circuits and high performance analog blocks. Fast switching in <b>digital</b> <b>blocks</b> generates a noise which can be introduced to analog circuits by the common substrate. This noise can decrease the performance of mixed-signal circuits; therefore, studying this noise {{and the way it}} is transmitted will lead to solutions for reducing it and improving mixed-signal circuit’s performance. In this paper, an efficient model for substrate is extracted from Green’s function in MATLAB environment, and its accuracy is demonstrated. Using a VCO and a multiplier as analog and <b>digital</b> <b>blocks,</b> respectively and connecting them with the proposed model of the substrate, the effects of substrate noise coupled to analog blocks are shown. Finally, some methods for reducing this noise are applied to the circuit, and the results are compared to each other. The results indicate that using P+ Guard Rings is the best method for reducing substrate noise in the mixed-signal circuits...|$|R
