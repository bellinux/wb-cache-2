5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E

5|$|From Europe, {{the legend}} {{maintains}} that the returning crusaders brought the Saluki back from the Middle East. The painting of Henry IV, Duke of Saxony with <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> dog, painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1514, is thought by some to show a Saluki. The dog wears a collar decorated with a scallop shell, which is the badge of a pilgrim who has traveled the Way of Saint James in Spain. Salukis appear in Paolo Veronese's 1573 work The Adoration of the Magi (also known as the Adoration of the Kings), currently located at the National Gallery, London. Veronese painted the breed in another two of his religious paintings: The Marriage at Cana and The Finding of Moses.|$|E
5|$|From Iran, {{the breed}} is {{mentioned}} in the poetry of Khaghani (1121-1190), depicted in miniature paintings of hunting scenes along with horseback archers by Master Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād (1450–1535), depicted in book illustrations by 'Abd al-Wahhab ibn 'Abd al-Fattah ibn 'Ali (1516), and in metal-smithing from {{the reign of the}} Injuid prince, Jamal al Dine Abu Is'haq, created between 1342–1353. One of the more outstanding pieces of sculpture in Iran is the Savashi Canyon Relief, carved around 1800, that was commissioned by Shar Fath-Ali Shah Qajar to commemorate <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> exploits.|$|E

5|$|Pedro's {{character}} {{was marked by}} an energetic drive that bordered on hyperactivity. He was impetuous with {{a tendency to be}} domineering and short-tempered. Easily bored or distracted, in his personal life he entertained himself with dalliances with women in addition to <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> and equestrian activities. His restless spirit compelled him to search for adventure, and, sometimes in disguise as a traveler, he frequented taverns in Rio de Janeiro's disreputable districts. He rarely drank alcohol, but was an incorrigible womanizer. His earliest known lasting affair was with a French dancer called Noémi Thierry, who had a stillborn child by him.

When he was old enough he was given an English musket, which he used to hunt mud turtles, wild turkeys, and raccoons. He was praised in the village for <b>his</b> <b>hunting</b> skills.

Alder was living in the Indian village of Mack-a-chack when it was destroyed by Benjamin Logan during his raid into Ohio Country in 1786, and he accompanied the Indians on raids into Kentucky to steal horses from white settlers.|$|E
