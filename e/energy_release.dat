This rate of <b>energy</b> <b>release</b> is equivalent to 70 times the world energy consumption of humans and 200 times the worldwide electrical generating capacity, or to exploding a 10-megaton nuclear bomb every 20minutes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total <b>energy</b> <b>release</b> unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the <b>energy</b> <b>release</b> during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E

It is defined as the <b>energy</b> <b>released</b> per air fuel ratio.

5|$|In Germany, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons, {{and noted}} that barium, a lighter element, was among the {{products}} produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result. They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called fission. They calculated that this {{would result in the}} release of about 200 MeV, implying an <b>energy</b> <b>release</b> orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, Pierre Joliot, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist John Wheeler, Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope, which made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium.|$|E
5|$|Seismologists {{reported}} that the earthquakes {{were part of a}} prolonged aftershock sequence associated with the major magnitude 7.1 earthquake of September 2010, which includes the February 2011 event. They were succeeded by multiple lighter aftershocks; the strongest, a moderate magnitude 5.1 ML struck a minute after the event. Another tremor 5.0 ML struck the region two days later. Despite significant <b>energy</b> <b>release,</b> the earthquakes were believed to have increased the risk of an additional aftershock of similar magnitude; calculations from GNS Science indicated a 23 percent probability of a magnitude 6.0–6.9 ML earthquake occurring in the Canterbury aftershock zone within the 12 months following the event. Weeks later, a magnitude 5.4 ML tremor jolted Christchurch overnight on 22 June, causing additional damage and prompting evacuations.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It {{is at this point}} that cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting <b>energy</b> <b>release,</b> made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because of the need for a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E

Scully explains to Fox Mulder that Willis has been obsessed with the Dupre-Phillips case for the past year, and admits to dating Willis while he was her instructor at the FBI Academy. It is discovered that left-handed shears were used to cut off Dupre's fingers, {{despite the fact that}} Willis is right-handed, leading Mulder to believe that Willis' body is inhabited by Dupre's consciousness.

5|$|At the top-secret Icarus Base, {{the group}} is {{introduced}} to Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira), Colonel David Telford (Lou Diamond Phillips), and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott (Brian J. Smith). Wallace's solution is tested but fails to establish a lock. During dinner, three Ha'tak vessels, believed {{to be under the}} control of the Lucian Alliance, attack the planet. An evacuation is begun while the Hammond which is manned by Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and a squadron of F-302s led by Colonel Telford battle the enemy. Rush, desperate to see his project succeed, enlists Wallace's aid in figuring out what went wrong. Wallace suggests that the final symbol of the address is wrong, and that they should use the symbol for Earth. Rush aborts the dialing sequence to Earth, arguing that the <b>energy</b> <b>release</b> from the exploding planet could follow them through the Gate, and tests the theory, which succeeds. With the planet's unstable core about to go critical and lacking any other means of escape, the remaining survivors in the base (roughly 80 people) are forced to risk heading to an unknown destination. The planet explodes shortly after everyone is evacuated, destroying the three Ha'tak vessels. The Hammond survives, but the fate of those in the base is a mystery to Stargate Command.|$|E

25|$|Boosted fission weapons {{improve on}} the {{implosion}} design. The {{high pressure and temperature}} environment {{at the center}} of an exploding fission weapon compresses and heats a mixture of tritium and deuterium gas (heavy isotopes of hydrogen). The hydrogen fuses to form helium and free neutrons. The <b>energy</b> <b>release</b> from this fusion reaction is relatively negligible, but each neutron starts a new fission chain reaction, speeding up the fission and greatly reducing the amount of fissile material that would otherwise be wasted when expansion of the fissile material stops the chain reaction. Boosting can more than double the weapon's fission <b>energy</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E

25|$|Critical fission {{reactors}} are {{the most}} common type of nuclear reactor. In a critical fission reactor, neutrons produced by fission of fuel atoms are used to induce yet more fissions, to sustain a controllable amount of <b>energy</b> <b>release.</b> Devices that produce engineered but non-self-sustaining fission reactions are subcritical fission reactors. Such devices use radioactive decay or particle accelerators to trigger fissions.|$|E

25|$|Large-scale {{application}} of fusion power. According to mass-energy equivalence, TypeI implies {{the conversion of}} about 2kg of matter to energy per second. An equivalent <b>energy</b> <b>release</b> could theoretically be achieved by fusing approximately 280kg of hydrogen into helium per second, a rate roughly equivalent to 8.9×109 kg/year. A cubickm of water contains about 1011 kg of hydrogen, and the Earth's oceans contain about 1.3×109 cubickm of water, meaning that humans on Earth could sustain this rate of consumption over geological time-scales, in terms of available hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|It is {{expected}} this will cause about 20MJ of fusion energy to be released, {{resulting in a}} net fusion energy gain of about 15 (G=Fusion energy/UV laser energy). Improvements in both the laser system and hohlraum design are expected to improve the energy absorbed by the capsule to about 420kJ, which, in turn, could generate up to 100-150MJ of fusion energy. However, the baseline design allows for a maximum of about 45MJ of fusion <b>energy</b> <b>release,</b> due {{to the design of}} the target chamber.
