It is known that several cells on the surfaces of the test specimens are destroyed during specimen preparation. Hence the effective thickness of the test specimen differs from the geometrical thickness and proper corrections are {{to be made for}} the thickness of the destroyed surface layers before other properties are calculated. This note presents an apparatus, its operating principles and an experimental pro-cedure to determine the thickness of destroyed surface layers of <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> insula-tion test specimens...|$|R
40|$|One {{purpose of}} this work was to examine if a {{modification}} of the exterior insulation finishing system can lower the number of outer walls damaged by damp. The modification is the cut of the <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> which is 45 degrees instead of a horizontal cut. One other purpose was; is <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> or mineral wool better as insulation to minimize the dampness {{in this type of}} outer walls? A third purpose was to examine if there is any difference of dampness in the outer walls if using a gravel bed or concrete stones next to the outer wall. To examine these three purposes a laboratory experiment with three test walls with an exterior insulation finishing system was built. The difference between the three walls was the insulation. One wall was built with mineral wool with a horizontal cut, one with <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a horizontal cut and the third with <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a cut of 45 degrees. Simulations of pelting rain and measurements of dampness were carried out for 21 days. The measurements were taken at the same time every evening. After 21 days small samples of tree from the walls was weight, dried in an oven and then weight again to get the quantity of moisture in the samples before they were dried. A diffusion calculation of two outer walls, one with <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> and one with mineral wool, was completed to examine the difference between the relative humidity in the walls. An identical calculation without a plastic film was executed too. The result of the calculations showed a minimal difference in the walls built with a plastic film. When the film was removed the result presented critical values. The result of the laboratory experiment indicates that the test wall with the cut of 45 degrees is better than the walls with a horizontal cut of the insulation. The differences were minimal but possible to read. Some critical, too high, values regarding the moisture content in wood were found and they came from the sills in the walls that had insulation with horizontal cuts. Of the two insulation types the result of calculations and laboratory experiment shows a minimal difference but they both indicates a better result for the mineral wool. The conclusion of this work indicates that <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a 45 degree cut is slightly better than the horizontal cut. The comparison of <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> and mineral wool indicates that the mineral wool is better. Another conclusion of this work is that the material on the ground next to the outer wall did not alter the dampness in the wall...|$|R

40|$|Background: The most energy {{efficient}} houses today are so called passive houses. These houses achieve high energy-efficiency partly by having well insulated walls. U-value describes {{the amount of}} heat transfered through a building element, the more insulation, the smaller U-value. A typical passive house wall have a U-value of 0. 10 W/m 2,°C. The passive houses are primarily made as small family houses {{and not as a}} block of apartments. This is partly because the bigger houses often are made of prefabricated walls, which at present times are not made with enough insulation. One construction method common in prefabrication is a sandwich-construction with two layer of concrete surrounding a core of <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic.</b> Skanska is making this type of walls in a factory on Gotland. We wanted to combine the energy efficiency of passive housing with the efficiency of prefabricated sandwich-walls. Aims: To present a suggestion of a sandwich-construction made with concrete and <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> with a U-value below 0. 10 W/m 2,°C, that could be implemented in the factory on Gotland. Methods: By analyzing systems of today we developed two different models that have a U-value below 0. 10 W/m 2,°C. The first system was developed from a system used in Skanska’s factory on Gotland and the second one was based on a system delivered by Halfen DEHA. This was made through empirical tests and theoretical calculations. We compared the developed systems in terms of the conditions in Skanska’s factory on Gotland. Result and discussion: The system based on Halfen DEHA needs a larger amount of shackles, than the system developed from Skanska’s present system. This leads to the need of thicker insulation to achieve the desired U-value. The reason is that the Skanska-based system uses a combination of shackles and <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> to carry the loads of the coating layer while the Halfen DEHA depends on the shackles alone. We believe that the first of our two developed systems is the best in terms of the ease in adopting to the production method in Skanska’s factory. The second system is safer in terms of controlling the production and has the possibility to have an air gap. Conclusion: In the rapport we present a sandwich-construction system that has a U-value below 0. 10 W/m 2,°C, that we believe would work for prefabrication of wall structures and could be easily adopted in Skanska’s factory on Gotland...|$|R

40|$|Högpresterande isolering är en typ av {{material}} som finns tillgängligt men inte används på den svenska marknaden i den utsträckning som de bör göra. I denna rapport kommer det högpresterande isoleringsmaterialet PIR att ligga i fokus och det jämförs främst med det traditionella isoleringsmaterialet cellplast men paralleller dras även till mineralullen. PIR- isoleringen har 40 % bättre värmekonduktivitet än cellplasten och detta innebär att materialet har bättre isoleringsförmåga som bidrar till tunnare konstruktioner. Isoleringen är därför idealiskt att använda för passiv-, lågenergi och nollenergihus. En annan egenskap som utmärker PIR- isoleringen är dess brandegenskaper som uppfyller en högre brandklass än cellplasten, trots att det är ett plastmaterial. PIR- isoleringen är ett dyrare material, dock sparas pengar in redan vid produktion då fukt- och vindskydd kan uteslutas i en konstruktion. Om högre energikrav ska uppfyllas kan pengar även sparas in på sikt genom lägre energikostnader. High performance insulation {{is a type}} {{of material}} that is available but has not been used at the Swedish market as it should have. In this rapport the high performance insulation material PIR will be the major subject. This material will be compared to the traditional insulation material cellular plastic; parallels will also be drawn to the mineral fiber. PIR- insulation has 40 % better thermal conductivity than the <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> and means that the material has a better insulation ability, which leads to a thinner construction. This insulation is therefore ideal for use in passive-, low-energy- and zero-energy houses. Another property that makes PIR- insulation stand out is its fire resistant capacity which fulfill a higher fire class than the <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic,</b> despite that it also is a plastic material. PIR-insulation is a more expensive material; however, money can be saved during production when moisture and wind protection can be excluded.

These materials are extremely effective in meeting energy efficiency goals in buildings and their safe use should also be enabled and optimised by undertaking comprehensive fire safety analyses. The proposed methodology consists of determining the mass loss {{as a function of the}} thermal evolution by applying a mass conversion directly using thermogravimetric data under non-oxidative conditions. In order to verify this simplified method, an experimental programme based on 100 mm thick samples of rigid polyisocyanurate foam was conducted using a Cone Calorimeter, obtaining measurements of mass loss and temperature within the core of the material. A Monel plate was used on top of the sample in order to represent a simpler boundary condition by eliminating the smouldering process of the charred material. Although the pyrolysis rates using this methodology did not provide a perfect fit with experimental data, they showed similar trends, with a slightly delayed prediction but still accurate magnitude. This methodology presents potential for fire safety engineering applications in two domains: (1) as a complementary technique to improve the interpretation of results from standard and ad-hoc testing, and (2) as a design technique for the evaluation of potential heat release contribution and gaseous emissions of assemblies incorporating insulation materials...|$|R

One of the main requirements of this material is that it must possess excellent recovery properties following extensive compressive periods over several years.

More recently, {{there has been a}} growing interest in replacing the polyurethane foam with an alternative <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> that possesses similar, if not identical, compressive recovery and behaviour. Attention was focused on the other primary polymer contingent, a polyethylene foam. A polyimide foam was also considered as it was already being used in applications {{similar to those of the}} polyurethane foam. The structures of the foams were investigated by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Image Analysis. The deformation mechanisms that occur during the application of a compressive force were examined visually via a scanning electron microscope compression rig. The mechanical analysis involved stress-strain testing whereby three stages of compression were identified (‘linear elastic, stress plateau and densification’), as described in the literature. Quadratic relationships were found to exist between the foam density and the ‘elastic modulus, plateau modulus and the compressive strength’ respectively. Such relationships had previously been found to exist in the literature, but not for the rigid variety of foam at such a broad range of densities.

40|$|Abstract The {{demand for}} {{temporary}} buildings has increased {{during the last}} few years. The main reason for this increase is the need for temporary housing.  This thesis contains the development of a construction solution that locks, joins and seals sandwich panels together in temporary buildings. This solution also explains how to mount, de-mount and re-mount the buildings and was developed in cooperation with the commissioning company Swetech Design AB.   The project has been limited to just the horizontal joints of Swetech Design AB´s sandwich panels.  The panels which the construction solution is going to be applied on have the dimensions of 2703 mm in height, 2297 mm in width and a thickness of 206 mm. The core consists of <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> that is laminated with a material that consists of fiberglass and polyester.   The pre-study consisted of literature studies of various types of joints, the important properties needed in order to make an airproof construction and the various building requirements for temporary residents. The pre-study also consisted of a visit to the module building company Mobile Composite Solutions (MCS) which helped in acquiring knowledge of mounting big units and the manufacturing technique RTM. Even inventories in different branches were made, to get knowledge around the different possibilities and variations of locking, sealing and joining parts.   After the completion of the pre-study a requirements specification and two function analysis where made that put demands and requirements on the concept solution and expressed the concept in terms of functions instead of solutions. The requirements specification and the function analysis became the base of the idea generating phase. This phase resulted in partial solutions and complete solutions which were then combined together to establish different concepts. Through elimination methods, screening tools and discussions together with the commissioning company a final concept was chosen. The concept is built on a tension joint in combination with a sealing profile and a locking device made of an angle steel, bolt and nut which can join and seal the sandwich panels.   The concept has been visualized in the form of sketches, CAD-model, a physical model on a cut-out between two sandwich panels in scale 1 : 1, basic drawings and a component list.

Nonstructural components are usually defined as secondary structures, since they are not designed to bear horizontal forces or vertical loads. Nevertheless, they must still have suitable features to ensure their integrity {{in the aftermath of}} an earthquake. Indeed, the damage of nonstructural components can have significant consequences on the operability of strategic buildings, on the human life safety, but can also have a relevant economic impact related to the post-earthquakes retrofitting actions. The above mentioned motivations highlight that a rational seismic design is required for secondary structures. The modern technical codes should provide appropriate analysis methods to define the seismic capacity of nonstructural components and establish design criteria aimed at protecting the secondary structure from the effects of the earthquakes. The present work focuses on innovative solutions for nonstructural components, namely partition walls and cladding panels, both in residential and industrial buildings. Particular attention is given to the seismic performance assessment of plasterboard panels, nowadays widespread in the European area as internal partition systems. The seismic capacity of such components can be assessed by means of experimental tests or numerical models capable to simulate the real behavior of the analyzed systems. In this work, experimental test performed on high plasterboard partitions, i. e. with height equal to 5 meters, are presented. Ten specimens, representative of the most common plasterboard panels' typology, are subjected to quasi-static cyclic tests in order to evaluate their in-plane seismic behavior. The experimental results show ductile behavior of the tested partitions, which achieve very high inter-story drift at the collapse (usually larger than 1 %). On the base of the tests outcomes, a reliable numerical model technique, able to predict the collapse inter-story drift ratio, is proposed and validated. The validated finite element model is then extended to several plasterboard partition typologies whose geometrical features do not allow the experimental assessment. Moreover, a parametric study is carried out in order to identify the influence of some geometrical parameters on the definition of the inter-story collapse drift. To reduce the computational effort in the partitions FEM model definition and analysis, a computer tool, interfacing the SAP 2000 finite element structural program and the Matlab platform, is developed. By inserting in the input file the main features of the plasterboard panel to assess, the tool automatically performs the analysis and evaluates the collapse drift. The last part of the work focuses on an experimental test campaign aimed at the mechanical characterization of an innovative material, namely a hybrid cement- polyurethane foam. Compressive, tensile and shear test are carried out on the base of ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standards for rigid <b>cellular</b> <b>plastic</b> materials. The lightweight and the high deformability features of the hybrid foam, joined to sound insulation, fire resistance and water vapor permeability make the material suitable for nonstructural components also in seismic zones...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} flow of evidences {{collected on}} elementary forms of learning processes in selected animal models evidentiates some mechanisms which can represent the basic <b>cellular</b> principles underlying <b>plastic</b> changes: 1. 5 HT and second messengers of nucleotide type (like cAMP) have {{a pivotal role}} in the learning process. 2. In almost all short-term learning processes the modifications are subserved by a mechanism of protein phosphorylation. 3. In various animal models the modulation of K+ and Ca 2 + channels is the molecular mechanism for learning. Experiments performed in sensory T neuron of the leech indicate that the modulation of Na+/K+ electrogenic pump is one of the fundamental mechanism for learning. 4. In long-term plastic changes, the most important finding is that newly synthesized proteins are formed. 5. In addition to what has been observed in the Aplysia model, where changes in synaptic efficacy represent the basic principles of memory storage, in the leech it has been demonstrated that a molecular machinery present in a single neuron can adapt the activity of the cell to environmental stimuli...|$|R
40|$|The {{striking}} similarity {{displayed at}} the mechanistic level between tumorigenesis and the generation of {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} and the fact that genes and pathways relevant for embryonic development are reactivated during tumor progression highlights the link between pluripotency and cancer. Based on these observations we tested whether it is possible to use a pluripotency-associated transcriptional reporter, whose activation is driven by the SRR 2 enhancer from the Sox 2 gene promoter (named S 4 + reporter), to isolate cancer stem cells from breast cancer cell lines. The S 4 + pluripotency transcriptional reporter allows the isolation of cells with enhanced tumorigenic potential and its activation was switched on and off in the cell lines studied, reflecting a <b>plastic</b> <b>cellular</b> process. Microarray analysis comparing the populations in which the reporter construct is active vs. inactive showed that positive cells expressed higher mRNA levels of cytokines (IL- 8, IL- 6, TNF) and genes (such as ATF 3, SNAI 2, KLF 6) previously related with the cancer stem cell phenotype in breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cellular</b> carbon fiber-reinforced <b>plastic</b> (CFRP) composites, either {{unfilled}} or {{filled with}} foam, {{may be of}} interest for energy absorption application due to their improved crashworthiness. In the current paper, new combinations of octagonal and hexagonal cellular CFRP composites are introduced as energy absorption devices. Different arrangements of cells are tested. In addition, the effect of filling the structure with foam is studied. The well-known crashworthiness parameters {{are being used to}} compare the different configurations. In addition, 2 new parameters (crush load stability and springback coefficient) are introduced to assess both the difference between the peak and the average crushing load and the stability during the post crushing stage as well as the capability of the structure to retain its original height after crushing. The results show that the configurations with closed cells are advantageous in terms of the peak and the average crushing load and the energy absorption, whereas the open cells are of great interest when comparing the stability of the crushing load in the post-crushing stage.

40|$|Conformational {{barcodes}} tag functional {{sites of}} proteins and are decoded by interacting molecules transmitting the incoming signal. Conformational barcodes are modified by all co-occurring allosteric events induced by post-translational modifications, pathogen, drug binding, etc. We argue that fuzziness (plasticity) of conformational barcodes {{may be increased}} by disordered protein structures, by integrative plasticity of multi-phosphorylation events, by increased intracellular water content (decreased molecular crowding) and by increased action of molecular chaperones. This leads to increased plasticity of signaling and cellular networks. Increased plasticity is both substantiated by and inducing an increased noise level. Using the versatile network dynamics tool, Turbine (www. turbine. linkgroup. hu), here we show that the 10 % noise level expected in cellular systems shifts a cancer-related signaling network of human cells from its proliferative attractors to its largest, apoptotic attractor representing their health-preserving response in the carcinogen containing and tumor suppressor deficient environment modeled in our study. Thus, fuzzy conformational barcodes may not only make the <b>cellular</b> system more <b>plastic,</b> and therefore more adaptable, but may also stabilize the complex system allowing better access to its largest attractor. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
