50|$|ETAdirect {{is powered}} by a {{patented}} algorithm that continuously learns mobile employees’ work patterns, analyzes them statistically and uses pattern recognition to accurately predict an employee's time of arrival at a customer's location and the length that each job/appointment will take, thereby providing <b>enhanced</b> <b>accuracy</b> for planning and customer experience management. ETAdirect typically narrows the wait window to less than 60 minutes. Using time-based predictions, ETAdirect can communicate to consumers the exact time that a field service employee will arrive via voice/IVR, email, text/sms, Twitter and other communications channels, reducing customer frustration, wasted time and inquiry calls to service provider call centers.

50|$|More modern SFF warhead versions, {{through the}} use of {{advanced}} initiation modes, can also produce rods (stretched slugs), multi-slugs and finned projectiles, and this in addition to the standard short L to D ratio projectile. The stretched slugs are able to penetrate a much greater depth of armor, at some loss to BAD. Multi-slugs are better at defeating light and/or area targets and the finned projectiles have greatly <b>enhanced</b> <b>accuracy.</b> The use of this warhead type is mainly restricted to lightly armored areas of MBTs—the top, belly and rear armored areas for example. It is well suited for use in the attack of other less heavily armored armored fighting vehicles (AFVs) and for breaching material targets (buildings, bunkers, bridge supports, etc.). The newer rod projectiles may be effective against the more heavily armored areas of MBTs.|$|E

5000|$|The Marlin Model 60 was {{developed}} in 1960 from the Model 99 design. The primary difference was that the stock was made of birch instead of walnut to reduce the recurring production costs for the more expensive wood. Marlin also moved away from their practice of using steel inner tubes with their tubular magazine. They moved back to brass inner tubes as other companies had done. This, instead of the steel tubes often seen on earlier Marlin [...]22 rifles, completely eliminated the rust problems that the all-steel tubular magazines had experienced which helped make the inexpensive Marlin rifle as durable as more expensive [...]22 caliber rifles. The Model 60 additionally featured a 16-groove rifled barrel, utilizing Marlin's trademarked Micro-Groove rifling technology, which had been developed in 1953. This rifling, with its precision-crowned muzzle, gave the Model 60 an inherent, <b>enhanced</b> <b>accuracy</b> over competing rifles, which used traditional deep grooved rifling, because the bullet was not as severely deformed while traveling down the barrel, and downrange.|$|E
50|$|In January 2014, former Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz {{confirmed}} that the B61-12 nuclear bomb upgrade would have <b>enhanced</b> <b>accuracy</b> and a lower yield with less fallout compared to previous versions of the weapon. Accuracy {{has not been a}} guarantee for air-dropped nuclear weapons, so consequently large warheads were needed to effectively impact a target; the B61-11 nuclear earth-penetrator is accurate to 110-170 meters from the desired detonation location, so it requires a 400-kiloton warhead. The B61-12 is accurate to 30 meters from a target and only requires a 50-kiloton warhead. Schwartz believes that greater accuracy would both improve the weapon and create a different target set it can be useful against. An example is the higher-yield B61-11's role of attacking underground bunkers that need a ground burst to create a crater and destroy it through the shockwave. A 50-kiloton yield detonating on the ground produces a crater with a radius of 30-68 meters, depending on the density of the surface, effectively putting the bunker within the circular error probability.|$|E

40|$|Question {{classification}} is {{an important}} step in factual question answering (QA) and other dialog systems. Several {{attempts have been made to}} apply statistical machine learning approaches, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with sophisticated features and kernels. Curiously, the payoff beyond a simple bag-ofwords representation has been small. We show that most questions reveal their class through a short contiguous token subsequence, which we call its informer span. Perfect knowledge of informer spans can <b>enhance</b> <b>accuracy</b> from 79. 4 % to 88 % using linear SVMs on standard benchmarks. In contrast, standard heuristics based on shallow pattern-matching give only a 3 % improvement, showing that the notion of an informer is non-trivial. Using a novel multi-resolution encoding of the question’s parse tree, we induce a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to identify informer spans with about 85 % accuracy. Then we build a meta-classifier using a linear SVM on the CRF output, <b>enhancing</b> <b>accuracy</b> to 86. 2 %, which is better than all published numbers. ...|$|R
