40|$|Cultivated land {{transition}} and its driving mechanism are the hotspots among studies on land use change. In this study, we constructed a framework {{to study the}} driving mechanism of cultivated land transition from the quantitative perspective. Based on the vector data of land use in 1990, 2000 and 2009 of Yantai Proper, Shandong Province China, 11 explanatory variables were chosen from two aspects: the elevation, slope, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> major water area and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> minor water area, which presented physical factors; cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> district center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> town center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> city expansion center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> major roads, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> city roads, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> county roads and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> rural roads, which presented the socio-economic factors. Combined with spatial analysis tools and Logistic regression analysis model, we construct Logistic regression analyses with four objectives that were urban construction land, rural residential land, orchard and other lands. The results show that, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> district center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> town center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> city expansion center and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> city roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into urban construction land. The main explained factors on the transition of cultivated land into rural residential land are slope, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> town center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> county roads and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> rural roads. Slope, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> minor water area, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> town center, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> county roads and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> rural roads are the significant explanatory variables for the transition of cultivated land into orchard land. Elevation, slope, cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> major water area and cost <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> minor water area are the main explanatory variables on the transition of cultivated land into other land uses...|$|R

5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at {{the time for the}} <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and {{to the edge of the}} universe (about 73 million miles).

5|$|Some {{scholars}} theorise {{that the}} galactic tide {{may have contributed}} to the formation of the Oort cloud by increasing the perihelia (smallest <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> the Sun) of planetesimals with large aphelia (largest <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> the Sun). The effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. Cumulatively, however, the effect can be quite significant: up to 90% of all comets originating from the Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide. Statistical models of the observed orbits of long-period comets argue that the galactic tide is the principal means by which their orbits are perturbed toward the inner Solar System.|$|E

40|$|Tremendous {{land use}} change has {{occurred}} in Lagos in recent times. Modelling urban systems now extends beyond the use of geographic information systems models. This research therefore presents a loose coupling of geographic information systems and artificial neural network for simulating land use change in Lagos. The experiment is based on three land use epochs of Lagos: 1963 - 1978, 1978 - 1984, and 1984 - 2000. Twelve salient land use explanatory variables (<b>distance</b> <b>to</b> water, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> residential structures, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> industrial and commercial centres, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> major roads, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> railway, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> Lagos Island, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> international airport, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> international seaport, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> University of Lagos, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> Lagos State University, income potential, and population potential) are used for the simulation. Using the Kappa statistic, {{the result of the}} simulation in terms of the order of best-fit of the reference data is: 1978 - 1984, 1984 - 2000, and 1963 - 1978. An evaluation of the simulation using the receiver operating characteristics corroborates the Kappa estimates. A non black-box experiment using a one-neuron neural network to assess the performance of the spatial independent variables used for the simulation indicates that for all three epochs <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> residential structures has the highest impact in the simulation while population potential has the lowest impact. </p...|$|R

5|$|Marine {{regression}} also {{resulted in}} the loss of epeiric seas, such as the Western Interior Seaway of North America. The loss of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing coastal plains that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments, since continental runoff now had longer <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to freshwater vertebrates, those that prefer marine environments, such as sharks, suffered.|$|E
