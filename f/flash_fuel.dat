40|$|Our project {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} climate change and vegetation type conversion in the Santa Monica Mountains on north and south facing slopes. Our hypothesis is that with a shift in climate towards dryer, hotter, and longer summers, and shorter and dryer winters, {{we will see a}} shift in the density of native chaparral in the Santa Monica mountains, and possibly an influx of non-native species. We tested this hypothesis by choosing three study sites that were on north/south ridgelines to simulate a dryer, harsher climate (south) and a more temperate climate (north). Using the point-quarter method to measure the prevalence of each type of plant in each study area we were able to determine what was growing on each slope. Our investigation is significant and relevant because if our hypothesis is correct, and there is a shift towards coastal sage and non-natives in areas that normally had chaparral, there would be serious consequences for the ecosystem and humans. An increase in smaller plants would decrease fire interval, which is dangerous to humans and is devastating to the plant infrastructure as it creates a positive feedback loop that promotes the influx of dry <b>flash</b> <b>fuel</b> invasive and exacerbates the decrease of the fire return interval...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 I {{inventoried}} {{the forests}} of the Anchorage wildland-urban interface and created a hierarchical classification of twenty forest types differentiated according to tree species, tree and basal area densities and degree of spruce bark beetle mortality. The inventory included the data necessary to parameterize NEXUS - a fire behavior model that integrates surface and crown fire initiation and spread algorithms. The twenty inventory forest types consolidated into eight custom fuel models and canopy attribute sets that correspond to the cover types identified by the Anchorage Wildfire Partnership. I assessed the models using NEXUS and completed a sensitivity analysis that identified the most influential model parameters and the forest attributes that managers should prioritize in future mitigation efforts. Results indicate that needleleaf low-density forests pose the largest hazard due to large 1 -hour fuel loads and fuelbed depths, low crown-base-heights and high crown bulk-densities. Stands infested by the spruce bark beetle also pose a serious hazard due to the ecological/physiological changes that promote the growth of Calamagrostis canadensis, a <b>flash</b> <b>fuel</b> that dries quickly and readily burns.

The hollow cone spray was injected into a constant pressure bomb filled with quiescent air. The fuel was fed at 7 MPa constant pressure to the injector. Three parameters were changed to study {{the effect of the}} injection conditions on the spray angle: fuel composition, fuel temperature and air pressure in the test bomb. The injector tip was heated up to 150 °C to keep the fuel to be injected at the desired temperature. Different blends of iso-octane and n-pentane were used to obtain fuels with different bubble temperature at the same air pressure. In a reduced set of experiments, only with pure fuels, the ambient pressure was varied to change the bubble temperature independently from the fuel temperature. It was observed that, when the fuel conditions exceed the bubble point, the spray angle, measured close to the injector, becomes wider. This angle was chosen as an indicator of the flash boiling intensity.

But the very short time available to prepare the correct burning mixture requires a deep knowledge of the air-fuel mixing phenomena to attain the desired results and to withstand the pollution limits. In the present work a hollow-cone iso-octane spray produced by a GDI injector was injected into ambient air and was characterised by means of high speed photography and Laser Doppler Velocimetry. Two different fuel temperatures, respectively 293 K and 393 K, were used to study {{the effect of the}} fuel evaporation on the spray structure and of its interaction with the surrounding air. At ambient temperature the structure of the spray, when quasi-steady conditions are reached, is hollow-cone shaped in the proximity of the injector. At further distance the spray collapses because of the air entrainment flow: the spray angle becomes narrower and the hollow cone structure is lost. At the same time a toroidal vortex structure is induced in the air surrounding the spray.

The fuel pressure and the chamber pressure were varied from 200 - 500 bar and 1 - 10 bar respectively, all at room temperature conditions. Images of the spray were captured at a rate of 7500 fps utilizing a high speed camera, with a CMOS sensor, in conjunction with a schlieren optical system. The images were then analyzed to determine quantitative aspects of the spray such as spray penetration, cone angle and mean spray velocity and qualitative aspects like evaporation and <b>flash</b> boiling. The <b>fuel</b> line pressure was also recorded and analysed to determine the effect that injection had on the pressure in the line. For the same injection conditions it was found that the penetration of diesel was greater than that of DME and the cone angle of diesel was greater than that of DME except at atmospheric back pressure. The pressure oscillation in the DME fuel line was smaller in amplitude and longer in duration than that of diesel. The DME spray exhibited signs of flash boiling and evaporation when injected into an environment at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. As the chamber pressure was increased the DME spray shape became increasingly similar to that of the diesel spray shape.

In a test designed to achieve a more 2 -D experiment, our investigation of a shallow, wide pool (2 mm deep x 78 mm wide x 30 cm long) was unsuccessful in mu-g, due to an unexpectedly long time required to fill the tray. As such, the most recent Spread Across Liquids (SAL) sounding rocket experiment had two principal objectives: 1) determine if pulsating flame spread in deep fuel trays would occur under the conditions that a state-of-the-art computational combustion code and short-duration drop tower tests predict; and 2) determine if a long, rectangular, shallow fuel tray could achieve a visibly flat liquid surface across the whole tray without spillage in the mu-g time allotted.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this project was to develop the next {{generation}} of fuel injection technologies for environmentally friendly, hydrogen syngas combustion in gas turbine engines that satisfy DOE's objectives of reducing NOx emissions to 3 ppm. Building on Parker Hannifin's proven Macrolamination technology for liquid fuels, Parker developed a scalable high-performing multi-point injector that utilizes multiple, small mixing cups in place of a single conventional large-scale premixer. Due to the small size, fuel and air mix rapidly within the cups, providing a well-premixed fuel-air mixture at the cup exit in a short time. Detailed studies and experimentation with single-cup micro-mixing injectors were conducted to elucidate the effects of various injector design attributes and operating conditions on combustion efficiency, lean stability and emissions and strategies were developed to mitigate the impact of flashback. In the final phase of the program, a full-scale 1. 3 -MWth multi-cup injector was built and tested at pressures from 6. 9 bar (100 psi) to 12. 4 bar (180 psi) and flame temperatures up to 2000 K (3150 F) using mixtures of hydrogen and natural gas as fuel with nitrogen and carbon dioxide as diluents. The injector operated without <b>flash</b> back on <b>fuel</b> mixtures ranging from 100 % natural gas to 100 % hydrogen and emissions were shown to be insensitive to combustor pressure. NOx emissions of 3 -ppm were achieved at a flame temperature of 1750 K (2690 F) when operating on a fuel mixture containing 50 % hydrogen and 50 % natural gas by volume with 40 % nitrogen dilution and 1. 5 -ppm NOx was achieved at a flame temperature of 1680 K (2564 F) using only 10 % nitrogen dilution.

There are certain benefits to using heated fuels, namely, increased sensible enthalpy, increased combustion efficiency, a decrease in certain emissions, and enhanced vaporization characteristics. However, the thermal and pressure enviornment inside an injector can result in the <b>fuel</b> <b>flashing</b> to vapor. Depending on the injector design, this can have deleterious effects on engine performance. As interest in heated fuels inreases, {{it is important to}} understand what occurs in the flow path of an injector under flashing conditions. ^ At the High Pressure Laboratory at Purdue University 2 ̆ 7 s Maurice J. Zucrow Laboritories, a test rig was designed and built to give visual access into the flow path of a 2 -D slot injector. The rig is capable of pressurizing and heating a liquid to superheated conditions and utilizes a pneumatically actuated piston to pusth the liquid through the slot injector. Methanol was chosen as a surrogate fuel to allow for high levels of superheat at relatively low temperatures. Testing was completed with acrylic and quartz injectors of varying L/DH. ^ Flashing conditions inside the injector flow path were induced via a combination of heating and back pressure adjustments. Volume flow rate, pressure measurements, and temperature measurements were made which allowed the discharge characteristics, the level of superheat, and other parameters to be calculated and compared. To give a basis for comparison the flashing results are compared to the flow through the injector under cavitating conditions. Cavitation and flashing appear to be related phenomena and this relationship is shown. Bubble formation under cavitating or flashing conditions is observed to attenuate the injector 2 ̆ 7 s discharge characteristics. ^ High speed videos of the flow field were also collected. Several flow regimes and flow structures, unique to these regimes, were observed. A frequency analysis was also performed on the video files. Bubble formation in the flow field dominates the frequency spectrum, which is confined below 1 kHz. ^ The test campaign was successful. The result is a possible way to predict an injector 2 ̆ 7 s performance under flashing conditions without running heated fuel through the injector. These results may be applicable to real world injector design and testing. ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of our {{research}} on flame spread across a pool of liquid fuel is the quantitative identification of the mechanisms that control the rate and nature of flame spread when the initial temperature of the liquid pool is below the <b>fuel's</b> <b>flash</b> point temperature. Besides numerous experiments in drop towers and 1 g laboratories, we have flown five microgravity (mu-g) experiments on sounding rockets. As described in earlier papers, the first three flights examined the effect of forced opposed airflow over a 2. 5 cm deep x 2 cm wide x 30 cm long pool of 1 -butanol in mu-g. It {{was found that the}} flame spread is much slower and steadier than in 1 g where flame spread has a pulsating character. It was speculated that the flame spread in mu-g resembled the character of pseudo-uniform spread in 1 g; Ito et al later confirmed this conclusively in 1 g experiments. Much of the mu-g flame is also farther from the surface, dimmer, and with less soot, when compared to the 1 g flame. Three-dimensional liquid-phase flow patterns that control the liquid preheating were discovered in both 1 g and mu-g. Our numerical model, restricted to two dimensions, had predicted faster, pulsating flame spread in mu-g for opposed airflow. In examining the differences in the dimensionality of the model and experiment, it was noted that the experiment allowed gas expansion in the lateral direction (across the width of the pool), for which the model could not account. Such lateral expansion could reduce the expansion in the forward and upward directions. Because only these latter directions could be modeled, it was decided to artificially reduce the gas thermal expansion in the predictions. When this was done, satisfactory agreement could be obtained between the predicted and observed spread rates and the steadiness of the spread in microgravity. In 1 g, however, the predicted flame spread character also changed to pseudo-uniform, which disagreed with our 1 g experiments where the spread is pulsating. It was then speculated that gas-phase buoyant flow might oppose the lateral gas expansion, so that the 1 g experiments retained their pulsating flame spread character. If this speculation was valid, a difference in lateral gas expansion should be observable when comparing 1 g and mu-g experiments. Specifically, it was anticipated that greater flow divergence caused by lateral expansion would be measured in mu-g {{in the absence of a}} buoyant flow directed towards the flame...|$|R
40|$|Many thermal {{management}} challenges have developed as advancements in {{gas turbine engine}} designs are made. As the thermal demands on gas turbine engines continue to increase, the heat sink available in the combustor fuel flow becomes more attractive. Increasing the temperature of fuel by {{using it as a}} heat sink can lead to higher combustion efficiency due to the increase in flow enthalpy and improved vaporization of the heated fuel. Emissions levels can also be affected by using heated fuels with the levels of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons tending to decrease while the amount of the oxides of nitrogen tends to increase. Although there are several benefits associated with using heated fuels in gas turbine engines, some problems can arise from their use including combustion instabilities, <b>flashing</b> within the <b>fuel</b> injector, and fuel coking or deposit formation within the fuel system. Various deoxygenation methods have been created to address the coking problem seen when using heated fuels. ^ In the Gas Turbine Test Cell of the High Pressure Laboratory at Purdue University 2 ̆ 7 s Maurice J. Zucrow Laboratories, a 5 MW combustion rig was developed to complete combustion test with heated fuels. The facility 2 ̆ 7 s supply systems including heated air, jet fuel, cooling water, and nitrogen were designed and integrated to produce simulated engine conditions within the combustion rig. Heating capabilities produced fuel temperatures ranging up to 600 deg F. Testing was completed with two fuel deoxygenation methods: nitrogen sparging and catalytic deoxygenation. ^ Results from the testing campaign included conventional pressure, temperature, and fuel property measurements; however, the most important measurements were the emissions samples that were analyzed for each test condition. Levels of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen were determined as well as the combustion efficiency calculated from these emissions measurements. The trends in emissions and performance from the increase in fuel temperature will be discussed. In addition, high frequency pressure data were recorded during testing to monitor combustion instabilities. Fuel samples were also taken and analyzed to document the changes in the volatile composition of the fuel from the two deoxygenation methods. ^ The testing campaign was extremely successful. All project objectives were met with the heated fuel testing campaign. The combustion rig was run safely with fuel temperature up to 600 deg F, allowing the effects of elevated fuel temperatures on the performance and emissions of a gas turbine combustor to be evaluated as planned. ...|$|R
