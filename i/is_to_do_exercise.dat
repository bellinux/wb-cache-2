The instrument of this study is the researcher and the data source is the compositions in the writing final test written by Writing III class C students of the English Department in the academic year of 2010 / 2011. Having collected all the students’ compositions, the researcher copied and re-typed the compositions verbatim. The researcher analyzed the data by searching for paragraphs which contain vague pronouns. The writer counted the frequency of occurrences of vague pronouns in each essay. The research found out that out of 19 compositions, there were 13 pronouns with vague reference identified in the 10 compositions. From this result, it can be concluded that vague pronoun reference exists in the English Department Students’ compositions and the pronouns which have vague reference are the misuse of it, she, and this.

An electrocardiogram associated with exercise is used as screening procedure for detecting latent coronary artery disease in asymptomatic patients. Present study <b>is</b> <b>do</b> ne <b>to</b> evaluate the R wave amplitude changes during exercise and to correlate heart rate changes that can influence ECG changes. It was seen during the study that R - Wave Amplitude increases after exercise upto heart rate of 120 - 130 /min and decreases with fu rther increase in the heart rate. This incidentally reflects end diastolic dimensions of left ventricle. METHODS: 64 normal non - athletic male subjects {{with a mean age}} of 19. 06 years were chosen for the study. They <b>were</b> made <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exercise</b> on Treadmill for 10 mins, with a gradual increase in the speed every 2 mins with constant inclination. ECG was recorded in standing position using a computer based serial communication electrocardiograph – CARDIOWIN – Genesis medical systems Pvt. Ltd. Heart Rate & R - Wave Amp litude were measured before exercise, immediately after exercise and 5 mins after exercise. RESULTS: Heart rate changes, R Wave Amplitude expressed from lead II and average of chest leads from V 1 - V 6 are taken as parameters. Paired t test was done. In major ity of individuals RWA increased initially and later decreased. Corresponding values after 5 mins of exercise showed that the decrease in Heart Rate is more pronounced with a reversal of R - Wave Amplitude. CONCLUSION: The study shows that with exercise the R wave amplitude increased in majority of individuals up to the heart rate of 120 – 130 and later the R wave amplitude decreased. It also shows that R wave amplitude changes are greatly influenced by changes in the heart rate which in turn are influenced b y changes in systemic peripheral resistance. An increase in R wave Amplitude is seen in CAD due to coronary narrowing and ventricular dilatation leading to ventricular dysfunction.

A second round will usually be held in London for {{a small percentage of}} applicants, who divide into groups and <b>are</b> asked <b>to</b> <b>do</b> various <b>exercises</b> <b>to</b> test their business skills and to gauge how they work as a team. Following this, between 20 and 30 applicants are chosen and given an assessment by a psychologist, receiving further checks by the production team and providing them with references, before the final line-up is selected from this group and filming can begin. The number of candidates who appear in a series has varied over the show's history, though consists of a balanced number of men and women; for the first two series, the show featured 14 candidates, increased to 16 between Series 3 to 9 (the fifth series featured 15, as a candidate dropped out with little time left to find a replacement), and later 20 to mark the tenth year of the show (the highest number of any variation of The Apprentice), before eventually consisting of 18 candidates from the eleventh series. Candidates who successfully make it into the show are split into two teams, normally by gender, in which they usually pick a team name {{at the start of the}} process.|$|R
40|$|Background During {{the recent}} decades, {{happiness}} and psychological wellbeing {{have been among}} the most attractive issues for researchers in the fields of social sciences and health. Medical and paramedical students in comparison with other college students are less happy due to work circumstance in hospital and special education. Objectives The aim of the present study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> evaluate happiness among college students of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in terms of socio-demographic variables. Materials and Methods In this cross-sectional web-based study, all the students of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences in Iran who had course classes <b>were</b> invited <b>to</b> participate in the study and 541 students filled out the web-based questionnaire including questions for measuring happiness oxford happiness questionnaire (OHQ), health status, stress experience in the past six months, cigarette and hookah smoking, physical activity rapid assessment of physical activity (RAPA), as well as socio-economic and demographic information. Results The mean happiness score was 114. 59 ± 18. 31. Socio-economic status, physical activity, and experience of stress in the last 6 months <b>were</b> related <b>to</b> the happiness score (P = 0. 009, P < 0. 001, P < 0. 001, respectively). However, gender, cigarette smoking, hookah smoking and body mass index were not significantly correlated with happiness. Conclusions The findings of the present study show that a happiness score among our sample study was slightly low and people with high happiness scores had a healthier lifestyle, i. e. more physical activity and less tobacco smoking. College students should <b>be</b> encouraged <b>to</b> <b>do</b> regular <b>exercise</b> as a way to increase the happiness level...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a {{metabolic disorder}} resulting from defective insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A {{consequence of this}} is chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrates, proteins and fat metabolism. Exercise {{plays a major role}} in the prevention and control of insulin resistance, type II diabetes, and diabetes-related health complications. Both aerobic and resistance training improve insulinaction and can assist with the management of blood glucose levels, lipids, blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, mortality, and quality of life. Aims: Effects of aerobic exercise on blood glucose level and lipid profile in Type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects. Materials& Methods: Sedentary men and women suffering from Type II diabetes mellitus (n= 20) were selected randomly for this study. Subjects <b>were</b> made <b>to</b> <b>do</b> aerobic <b>exercises</b> for 4 days/week for 30 min duration. They <b>were</b> made <b>to</b> <b>do</b> stepping at a stepper of 9 inches height for first 10 minutes. This was followed by 20 minutes of cycling at the resistance of 5 (according to the static cycle used). The heart rate of the subjects was monitored during the exercises. Blood glucose level and lipid profile were measured biochemically. HbA 1 c was also checked before and after exercise protocol. Results: Very high density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides (TG) parameter in lipid profile showed significant decrease as p values were less than 0. 05). The changes in the glycaemic control and HbA 1 c were also insignificant (p> 0. 05). We concluded that duration of 4 weeks aerobic exercise on Type II diabetic patients to improve their glycaemic control and lipid profile was not sufficient as it showed significant changes only in the VLDL and triglycerides parameter of lipid profile...|$|R
