5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to <b>emulsify</b> it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E

30|$|Matrix-acidizing {{operations}} have been accounted {{to be the}} most hazardous and environmentally harmful among all the well-stimulation techniques. For instance, diesel oil-based <b>emulsified</b> acids have been prohibited from usage due to their high level of toxicity. There is, therefore, a dire need for <b>emulsified</b> acids that are environmentally viable and technically competent to replace the diesel-based <b>emulsified</b> acids. In this study, a novel oil-based environmental friendly <b>emulsified</b> acid has been synthesized from Jatropha curcas oil and, then, compared against diesel and palm oil-based <b>emulsified</b> acids. The technical evaluation of the three acids has been done based on experimental results obtained from thermal stability, droplet size analysis, rheological study, acid solubility, and toxicity screening. In addition, core flooding experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the three <b>emulsified</b> acids as well stimulants. The results revealed that Jatropha oil-based <b>emulsified</b> acid has the potential to replace diesel-based <b>emulsified</b> acid. Jatropha oil-based <b>emulsified</b> acid was found to perform better than the diesel-based <b>emulsified</b> acid as indicated by having greater thermal stability and more popular rheological properties at varying temperatures of ambient, 50 and 70  °C. Furthermore, it possessed a lower toxicity load and a higher retardation effect on acid solubility than that of the diesel oil-based <b>emulsified</b> acid. The core flooding results have also indicated better well-stimulation performance of Jatropha-based <b>emulsified</b> acid as compared with diesel-based <b>emulsified</b> acids.|$|R
40|$|<b>Emulsified</b> acids {{have been}} {{extensively}} {{used in the}} oil industry since 1933. Most of the available research and publications discussed mainly the application of <b>emulsified</b> acid in the field. A fair number of the published work also discussed in depth some of the <b>emulsified</b> acid properties such viscosity, stability and reactivity. However, all of the available research discussed the <b>emulsified</b> acid without sufficient details of its preparation. Beside their chemical composition, the ways <b>emulsified</b> acids are prepared cause significant differences in their physical properties. The characterization of <b>emulsified</b> acid by its droplet size and size distribution complements its chemical composition and gives the <b>emulsified</b> acid a unique description and thus reproducible properties. No previous study considered the impact of the droplet size on the characteristics and properties of <b>emulsified</b> acid. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to study the effects of the droplet size on various properties of <b>emulsified</b> acid such as viscosity, stability and reactivity. Results showed that the droplet size and size distribution have a strong effect on the stability, viscosity and diffusion rate of the <b>emulsified</b> acid. The results of this work are important because knowledge of the effect of the droplet size on major design parameters will guide the way <b>emulsified</b> acid is prepared and applied in the field...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} work can be divided into; the {{measurement}} of the rheological properties of a new <b>emulsified</b> acid system that can be suitable for high temperature applications, {{a study of the}} performance of the new <b>emulsified</b> acid in stimulating both calcite and dolomite formations, measuring the reaction rate and diffusion coefficient when the new <b>emulsified</b> acid systems react with both calcite and dolomite, and testing the new <b>emulsified</b> acid using core samples obtained from carbonate reservoirs. The droplet size has a practical impact on the performance of <b>emulsified</b> acid. A good understanding and characterization of the <b>emulsified</b> acid by its size distribution will lead to better understanding of its stability, rheology and how it reacts with carbonate rocks. The influence of the concentration of the new emulsifier on the droplet size, droplet size distribution and upon the rheology of <b>emulsified</b> acids is studied in detail. The <b>emulsified</b> acid reaction kinetics with calcite rocks was studied before in few studies, and very little work was done with dolomite. One of the main objectives of the present work is to study in detail the reaction of the <b>emulsified</b> acid with both calcite and dolomite rocks using the rotating disk apparatus. Most of the previous studies on the <b>emulsified</b> acid were done using core samples that were saturated with brine or deionized water. One of the main objectives of the present work is to study in detail the effect of the presence of crude oil in the reservoir rock on the performance of <b>emulsified</b> acids. Lastly, an innovative technique of <b>emulsifying</b> the chelating agents is evaluated for high temperature applications. The rheology of the <b>emulsified</b> chelating agent is measured using an HPHT rheometer. Also, the reaction of the new <b>emulsified</b> chelating agent with calcite is studied using the rotating disk apparatus, and coreflood experiments were performed using chelating agents and calcite core samples...|$|R

25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a whisk, or fork, or with the aid of an {{electric}} mixer or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can <b>emulsify</b> more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|E
25|$|A {{lipoprotein}} is a biochemical assembly {{whose purpose}} is to transport hydrophobic lipid (a.k.a. fat) molecules in water, as in blood or extracellular fluid. They have a single-layer phospholipid and cholesterol outer shell, with the hydrophilic portions oriented outward toward the surrounding water and lipophilic portions of each molecule oriented inwards toward the lipids molecules within the particles. Apolipoproteins are embedded in the membrane, both stabilising the complex and giving it functional identity determining its fate. Thus the complex serves to <b>emulsify</b> the fats. Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesions, and toxins are lipoproteins. Examples include the plasma lipoprotein particles classified as HDL, LDL, IDL, VLDL and ULDL (a.k.a. chylomicrons) lipoproteins, according to density / size (an inverse relationship), compared with the surrounding plasma water. These complex protein capsules enable fats to be carried in all extracellular water, including the blood stream (an example of emulsification), subgroups of which are primary drivers / modulators of atherosclerosis, the transmembrane proteins of mitochondrion, chloroplast, and bacterial lipoproteins.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has {{the ability}} to metabolise a variety of substrates including n-alkanes, hexadecane and oils. Uptake of these hydrophobic substrates is speculated to rely on the production of rhamnolipids. It is thought that rhamnolipids either cause the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell surface to become hydrophobic, promoting an interaction between the substrate and the cell, or secreted rhamnolipids <b>emulsify</b> the substrate and allow it to be taken up by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell. There is evidence that rhamnolipids are highly adsorbent to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell surface, causing it to become hydrophobic. It has also been shown that production of rhamnolipids promotes uptake of hexadecane by overcoming the inhibitory effect of the hydrophilic interactions caused by LPS. Production of rhamnolipids is observed on hydrophobic substrates but equally high yields are achievable on other carbon sources such as sugars. Furthermore, although mono-rhamnolipids have been shown to interact with the Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell membrane and cause it to become hydrophobic, di-rhamnolipids do not interact well with the cell membrane because the polar head group is too large to penetrate the LPS layer. Therefore, although Rhamnolipids may play a part in interaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with hydrophobic carbon sources, they are likely to have additional functions.|$|E

30|$|<b>Emulsified</b> acid has {{attracted}} considerable {{attention of the}} oil and gas industry due to its delayed nature that allows deeper penetration of acid into the formation which essentially facilitate further enhancing the well productivity, and at the same time minimizes the corrosion issues. However, <b>emulsified</b> acid has only been extensively studied and applied on carbonate formations. Considering more than half of the reservoirs worldwide are sandstone reservoirs, studying the effects of <b>emulsified</b> acid on sandstone under high-temperature conditions would unlock the potential of <b>emulsified</b> acid and help generate more value for {{the oil and gas}} industry by improving the well productivity from sandstone reservoirs. To ensure the applicability of the <b>emulsified</b> acid on the real sandstone reservoir, which usually has a temperature higher than ambient conditions, the stability of <b>emulsified</b> acids is investigated under 300  °F. Then, the stable <b>emulsified</b> acid samples are developed and their impact on the properties of Berea sandstone core samples, including porosity, pore-size distribution, permeability and wettability, are investigated. The core samples have undergone pre-flush (10 % HCl: 5 % CH 3 COOH) before the main flush (<b>emulsified</b> acid). The <b>emulsified</b> acids are prepared using hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, cationic surfactant and chelating agent. Fourteen core samples are saturated with different <b>emulsified</b> acids under vacuum conditions for 3  days to ensure maximum saturation. The porosity, permeability and wettability of each core sample are measured before and after the reaction with acid. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis has been applied to evaluate the change in pore size distribution. This study has demonstrated that the <b>emulsified</b> acids are capable of improving the porosity and permeability of Berea sandstone core sample. The pore size distribution has also been affected by the application of <b>emulsified</b> acid, where more large pores have been evolved to the core samples due to the reaction of acids with the sandstone which ultimately helps in improving the productivity of hydrocarbons. This indicates less precipitation of the secondary reaction products resulting better enhancement in sandstone flow properties. These results demonstrate the potential of <b>emulsified</b> acid during sandstone acidizing as <b>emulsified</b> acid significantly improved the sandstone properties which can essentially enhance the well productivity.|$|R
