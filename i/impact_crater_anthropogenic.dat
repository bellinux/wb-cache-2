50|$|Just {{like the}} <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> on Earth and other {{terrestrial}} planetary bodies, <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> on Venus include central peaks, rims, floors, walls, ejected deposits and outflows from the craters.

50|$|An <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> is an {{approximately}} circular {{depression in}} {{the surface of a}} planet, moon or other solid body in the Solar System, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body with the surface. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. <b>Impact</b> <b>craters</b> range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed <b>impact</b> basins. Meteor <b>Crater</b> is perhaps the best-known example of a small <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> on the Earth.|$|R

40|$|Lunar <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> are {{important}} for studying lunar surface morphology {{because they are the}} most typical morphological units of the Moon. <b>Impact</b> <b>crater</b> descriptive indices can be used to describe morphological features and thus provide direct evidence for both the current state and evolution history of the Moon. Current description methods for lunar <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> are predominantly qualitative, and mostly focus on their morphological profiles. Less attention is paid to the detailed morphological features inside and outside of the craters. A well-established and descriptive index system is required to describe the real morphological features of lunar <b>impact</b> <b>craters,</b> which are complex in a systematic way, and further improve study, such as heterogeneity analyses of lunar <b>impact</b> <b>craters.</b> This study employs a detailed lunar surface morphological analysis to propose a descriptive index system for lunar <b>impact</b> <b>craters,</b> including indices for the description of individual craters based on their morphological characteristics, spatial structures and basic composition (i. e., crater rim, crater wall, crater floor, central uplift, and ejecta), and indices for crater groups, including spatial distribution and statistical characteristics. Based on the proposed descriptive index system, a description standard for lunar <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> is designed for categorising and describing these indices in a structured manner. To test their usability and effectiveness, lunar <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> from different locations are manually detected, and corresponding values for different indices are extracted and organised for a heterogeneity analysis. The results demonstrate that the proposed index system can effectively depict the basic morphological features and spatial characteristics of lunar <b>impact</b> <b>craters...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{compilation}} of circular topographic, morphological, or geophysical structures in Fennoscandia and adjacent areas reveals 62 craterform structures of which 15 {{appear to be}} of extraterrestrial origin due to meteorite impact. The majority of the structures are probable and possible <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> {{for which there is}} not yet sufficient proof for impact origin. Four of the proven <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> contain large volumes of impact melt and many other features of intense shock metamorphism. The age of recognized <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> vary from prehistoric to late Precambrian. We review the Fennoscandian impact cratering record giving examples of geophysical signatures of <b>impact</b> <b>craters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Calculations {{are made}} to {{determine}} the sizes of stony and iron meteoroids which could penetrate the atmosphere of Venus and cause hypervelocity <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> on the planet's surface. Using scaling relationships based on kinetic energy, <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> size is related to meteoroid size.

25|$|Non-explosive {{volcanic}} craters {{can usually}} be distinguished from <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> by their irregular shape and the association of volcanic flows and other volcanic materials. <b>Impact</b> <b>craters</b> produce melted rocks as well, but usually in smaller volumes with different characteristics.|$|R
50|$|The Toms Canyon <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> is a {{probable}} <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> where {{one or more}} asteroids struck the Atlantic continental shelf, about 160 km east of Atlantic City, New Jersey. The submarine canyon is the drowned glacial-age mouth of Toms River.|$|R
50|$|Lakes {{can also}} fill <b>impact</b> <b>craters,</b> {{but these are}} not usually {{referred}} to as crater lakes except in a few isolated cases. Example of such <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> lakes include Manicouagan in Canada, Lake Bosumtwi in Ghana and Siljan in Sweden.|$|R
2500|$|In May 1992, Michael Rampino {{published}} [...] {{an abstract}} for the American Geophysical Union noting {{the discovery of}} a circular gravity anomaly near the Falkland Islands. He suggested this structure might correspond to an <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> with a diameter of 250 miles. In August 2017, Rampino, Maximilliano Rocca [...] and Jaime Baez Presser followed up with a paper [...] providing further seismic and magnetic evidence that the structure is an <b>impact</b> <b>crater.</b> Estimates for the age of the structure range up to 250 millions years old. If, in fact, this is an <b>impact</b> <b>crater,</b> it would be substantially larger than the 65 million year old Chicxulub <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> which is associated with a significant, but smaller extinction event.|$|R
30|$|<b>Impact</b> <b>craters</b> {{are often}} {{produced}} when ballistic blocks hit the ground. Several studies on <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> {{have been conducted}} regarding {{the distribution of the}} ballistic blocks after landing (Fitzgerald et al. 2014; Pistolesi et al. 2008; Maeno et al. 2013). For the 2014 Mount Ontake eruption, Kaneko et al. (2016) studied the distribution of <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> of ballistics from photographs they took days after the start of the eruption from a journalist’s helicopter. They defined A, B, C, and D zones around the vent depending on the number of <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> per 5  m ×  5  m. These <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> were visible because they formed on the fine ash layer during the eruption. Ballistic blocks were ejected several times on 27 September from 11 : 52 a.m. when the eruption started to 12 : 40 p.m. when the fall of pyroclasts ended (Oikawa et al. 2016). For this reason, the distributions obtained by Kaneko et al. (2016) likely exclude some blocks ejected before the ash deposition. To estimate the ejection speed of the ballistics, we compared the ground distribution of ballistic blocks simulated using our numerical model with the distribution of the <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> photographed by Kaneko et al. (2016).|$|R
5000|$|When a velocity-driven {{extraterrestrial}} object impacts {{a relatively}} stationary body, an <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> forms.

40|$|The {{possible}} role of <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> {{in controlling}} local Martian endogenic activity is reviewed. Martian <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> exhibiting evidence for endogenic modification are considered, including {{the style of}} modification. In addition, the cooling history of a mafic body intruded beneath <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> of different sizes which contain water-ice deposits are examined, and results are related to modified Martian craters. This analysis is extended to basin-sized structures, and evidence for impact basin control of major volcanic and tectonic provinces is considered...|$|R
50|$|More {{research}} is needed before the Maniitsoq structure can be definitely confirmed as an <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> because present diagnostic tools used to identify impacting in the upper crust are inadequate for giant, deeply eroded structures. If confirmed as an <b>impact</b> <b>crater,</b> this crater would be older than other old <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> such as the much smaller 16 km wide, 2.4 billion year old, Suavjärvi crater in Russia and the larger 300 km wide, 2.0 billion year old, Vredefort crater in South Africa.|$|R

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{discrepancies}} in published crater frequency data, effects modifying production size distributions of <b>impact</b> <b>craters</b> are discussed. The resulting criteria are applied to {{the determination of the}} size distributions of unmodified <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> populations in selected lunar regions of different ages. The measured cumulative crater frequencies are used to obtain a general calibration size distribution curve by a normalization procedure. Deviations of measured size distributions from the calibration distribution are strongly suggestive of the existence of processes having modified the primary <b>impact</b> <b>crater</b> population...|$|R
