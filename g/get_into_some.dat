Typical of the genre, Simpson would play a prank on {{everyday}} people while secretly filming them {{and at the end}} of each prank, he would shout, [...] "You've been Juiced!" [...] Less typical, each episode opened with topless strippers dancing around Simpson, who is dressed as a pimp. He sings his own rap song, which includes the lyrics [...] "Don't you know there's no stopping the Juice / When I'm on the floor I'm like a lion on the loose / Better shoot me with a tranquilizer dart / Don't be stupid, I'm not a Simpson named Bart." [...] In one episode, Simpson is at a used car lot in Las Vegas where he attempts to sell his white Bronco (made famous during the chase in Los Angeles prior to his arrest). A bullet hole in the front of the SUV is circled with his autograph, and he pitches it to a prospective buyer by saying that if they [...] "ever <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>some</b> trouble and have to get away, it has escapability." [...] In another sketch called [...] "B-I-N-G-O.J.", Simpson pretends to be having an affair with another man's girlfriend. Later he transforms into an old white man whose dying wish is to call a game of bingo. [...] "Juiced" [...] aired as a one-time special on pay-per-view television and was later released on DVD.|$|E
