40|$|This paper {{provides}} interview {{strategies for}} teachers who talk to children about serious events, including bullying, truancy, and suspected maltreatment. With regard to the latter, teachers are among {{the largest group of}} professionals reporting child abuse, but also tend to evince low substantiation rates. We review research on best practice interviewing, with a focus on its application in school settings. Interview phases are described chronologically, with interview excerpts included for illustrative purposes. Gaps in knowledge about the appropriateness of techniques are highlighted, and recommendations for future research specifically within the school setting are made. It is proposed that teachers receive basic training in best practice <b>interviewing</b> <b>so</b> that, when required, they can confidently ask about difficulties in children 2 ̆ 7 s lives while minimizing the potential for contamination of children 2 ̆ 7 s responses...|$|E

50|$|The film {{uses the}} expository {{interview}} method where the subjects {{speak to a}} camera and the interviewer is not voiced. Parmar does not use narration in the <b>interviews,</b> <b>so</b> the subjects explain matters themselves.|$|R

60|$|This {{closed the}} <b>interview</b> <b>so</b> far as Mr. Wright was concerned, {{and on his}} leaving the house the others {{discussed}} the {{work to be done}} the following day; but Skip Miller's disappearance had little place in the conversation.|$|R

60|$|These words {{broke from}} him not without tears, though David {{was of no}} melting mood. Archibald had, with {{delicate}} attention, withdrawn the spectators from the <b>interview,</b> <b>so</b> that the wood and setting sun alone were witnesses of the expansion of their feelings.|$|R

50|$|The {{series was}} {{directed}} by Hans Pihl and Pontus Ströbaek, the host was Mi Ridell as Oumi.

60|$|Mr. Kendal, {{after this}} <b>interview,</b> <b>so</b> far relaxed his displeasure as to {{occasionally}} address Gilbert {{when they met}} at luncheon after this deplorable morning, while towards Lucy he observed a complete silence.

30|$|Justification 2 : Events or {{previous}} {{survey questions}} may cause bias in individual responses, {{but it is}} expected to be unbiased for aggregate responses from many respondents, since these events should have equal chance of increasing or decreasing individual SWB.

50|$|Daniels botched the <b>interview</b> <b>so</b> badly, she {{ultimately}} {{decided to}} edit {{it and have}} it broadcast as a comedic look at how not to conduct an interview.
