5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether the levels of {{physical}} activity before and <b>during</b> early <b>pregnancy</b> are associated with the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The study group included 160 puerperas. Among them, 40 (25 %) diagnosed as having GDM <b>during</b> their recent <b>pregnancy,</b> whereas the remaining 120 (75 %) served as controls. The international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ-Greek version) was applied twice, in an attempt to estimate the level of physical activity before and <b>during</b> early <b>pregnancy.</b> Women who were "inactive" before or <b>during</b> early <b>pregnancy</b> had odds ratio (OR) 7. 9 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 7 - 16. 56] and 1. 3 (95 % CI 1. 2 - 1. 4) of developing GDM, compared to "minimally active" or "active" women, respectively. Pregnancy resulted in a decrease in the level of physical activity (P< 0. 005) <b>during</b> early <b>pregnancy,</b> independently of the diagnosis of GDM and morbidity <b>during</b> early <b>pregnancy.</b> We conclude that physical inactivity before and <b>during</b> early <b>pregnancy</b> is associated with increased risk for developing GDM in late pregnancy...|$|R

50|$|Women are {{encouraged}} to begin treatment {{as soon as they}} are diagnosed with HIV. If they are diagnosed prior to pregnancy, they should continue with ART <b>during</b> the <b>pregnancy.</b> If the diagnosis of HIV is made <b>during</b> the <b>pregnancy,</b> ART should be initiated immediately.|$|R
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) {{are other}} topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. <b>During</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{contraindicated}} in pregnancy, as {{it passes}} through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus; warfarin use <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> is commonly associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm birth. Coumarins (such as warfarin) are also teratogens, that is, they cause birth defects; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin in utero appears to be around 5%, although higher figures (up to 30%) {{have been reported in}} some studies. Depending on when exposure occurs <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise.|$|E

5|$|If {{pregnancy}} {{is a high}} concern using two methods {{at the same time}} is reasonable, and two forms of birth control is recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin, due to the high risk of birth defects if taken <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|E

5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by {{about five times}} because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with {{a family history of}} VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{cervical}} mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> This provides a protective seal for the uterus against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E

5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if {{used in the}} elderly, <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> in children, in alcohol- or other drug-dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Additional caution is required in critically ill patients, as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur. Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of midazolam leading to prolonged and enhanced effects. Contraindications include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative contraindications.|$|E
5|$|Even mild or {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism {{leads to}} possible infertility and {{increased risk of}} miscarriage.

Women are affected by hypothyroidism in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies. Subclinical hypothyroidism <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> has also been associated with gestational diabetes and birth of the baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy</b> may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child <b>during</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It {{is possible to}} be co-infected {{by more than one}} strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.|$|E
