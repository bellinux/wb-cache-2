5|$|Copenhagen {{is in the}} {{oceanic climate}} zone (Köppen: Cfb ). Its weather is subject to {{low-pressure}} systems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.|$|E

5|$|Events in {{southern}} Britain to 796 have sometimes been {{portrayed as a}} struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was enormous. By 796 Charlemagne had become master of an empire which stretched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E
5|$|Irene–Olivia {{is unusual}} in that it survived passage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to Pacific Ocean. Only nine other named storms {{are known to have}} done so. Irene was the first of three Atlantic-to-Pacific {{crossover}} tropical cyclones in the 1970s, all three of which took eastern Pacific names starting with the letter O.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{days after}} the sinking of Irish Oak, on 24 May 1943, Admiral Dönitz ordered a U-boat {{withdrawal}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> Of their operational fleet, 41 U-boats – or 25% – had been lost in Black May, against a total of 50 Allied merchant ships destroyed. The Battle of the Atlantic was over.|$|E

5|$|Northern {{parts of}} the country are {{characterized}} by hot, humid summers with mild, drier winters, and highly seasonal precipitation. Mesopotamia, located in northeast Argentina, has a subtropical climate with no dry season and is characterized by high temperatures and abundant rainfall because of exposure to moist easterly winds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean throughout the year. The Chaco region in the center-north, despite being relatively homogeneous in terms of precipitation and temperature, is the warmest region in Argentina, {{and one of the few}} natural areas in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert. Precipitation decreases from east to west in the Chaco region because eastern areas are more influenced by moist air <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean than the west, resulting in the vegetation transitioning from forests and marshes to shrubs. Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry, hot, and subtropical although its rugged topography results in a diverse climate.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean Sea is {{a nursery}} for {{juvenile}}s, {{as well as}} a common place for adults {{in the spring and summer}} months. Almost 45% of the Mediterranean juvenile population has migrated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> Loggerheads feed in the Alboran Sea and the Adriatic Sea.|$|E

5|$|Aarhus is in {{the humid}} {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen: Dfb) and the weather is influenced by low-pressure systems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.|$|E
5|$|All-ACC honorees were {{selected}} by a 67-member committee <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Coast Conference Sports Media Association (ACSMA). Maryland tied with Atlantic Division Co-Champion Boston College for most All-ACC honorees at nine. Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech each secured eight All-ACC honors. Three Maryland players {{were selected}} to the first team: punter Travis Baltz, running back Da'Rel Scott, and center Edwin Williams. Linebacker Alex Wujciak {{was named to the}} second team. Offensive linemen Scott Burley and Jaimie Thomas, tight end Dan Gronkowski, wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, and defensive lineman Jeremy Navarre were named as honorable mention All-ACC players.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats from the Philippines were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. In step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E

5|$|Britain {{recognized}} {{the independence of}} the United States following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781. In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.|$|E
5|$|Canada {{occupies}} much of {{the continent}} of North America, sharing land borders with the contiguous United States to the south, and the US state of Alaska to the northwest. Canada stretches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean. Greenland is to the northeast. By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, {{the difference being due}} to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.|$|E
5|$|Each {{participating}} {{team was}} selected by the bowl game's selection committee, which had paid contracts with the participating football conferences. The Chick-fil-A Bowl had the second pick of bowl-eligible teams <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Coast Conference and the fifth pick from eligible teams in the Southeastern Conference. In picking Virginia Tech and Tennessee, the selection committee bypassed teams with better or similar records {{in order to create}} a matchup appealing to television audiences. Pregame media coverage focused on the close geographic rivalry between the two teams and the success of Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin in reversing his team's poor fortune from the previous season.|$|E

5|$|Following the storm, {{officials}} in Honduras requested international assistance, which totaled $2.8billion over a several year period. Despite this, {{the gross domestic}} product began decreasing at the end of 1998, and contracted by 1.9% in 1999. Officials enacted a widespread curfew following the storm, and for 15days temporarily restricted constitutional rights to maintain order. There were outbreaks in various diseases, and many residents faced food and water shortages. Due to the heavy damage, the name Mitch was retired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> hurricane naming list.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan's {{path through}} the {{southern}} Caribbean in late October was highly unusual. Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took the southernmost path of a tropical cyclone since a June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of Joan's. Joan-Miriam was also unusual in that it survived passage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to Pacific Ocean. Only seven other storms {{have been known to}} survive the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the Korean War broke out, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S.-based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization Missouri was called up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces on the Korean peninsula.|$|E
