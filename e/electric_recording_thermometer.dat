25|$|A direct {{indicating}} {{dial thermometer}} (such as a patio thermometer or a meat thermometer) uses a bimetallic strip wrapped into a coil. One {{end of the}} coil is fixed to the housing of the device and the other drives an indicating needle. A bimetallic strip is also used in a <b>recording</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Breguet's thermometer consists of a tri-metallic helix.|$|R
50|$|As British pub rock lay the minimalist {{foundations}} for the oncoming punk rock scene, Cube became Electric Cube, albeit briefly, before its label manager Jeremy Thomas shelved the Cube imprint and established The <b>Electric</b> <b>Record</b> Company, whose <b>Electric</b> <b>Records</b> imprint became {{the home for}} new releases.|$|R
50|$|Alcohol thermometers, {{infrared}} <b>thermometers,</b> mercury-in-glass <b>thermometers,</b> <b>recording</b> <b>thermometers,</b> thermistors, and Six's thermometers {{are used}} in meteorology and climatology in various levels of the atmosphere and oceans. Aircraft use thermometers and hygrometers to determine if atmospheric icing conditions exist along their flight path. These measurements are used to initialize weather forecast models. Thermometers {{are used in}} roadways in cold weather climates to help determine if icing conditions exist and indoors in climate control systems.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>recording</b> <b>thermometer</b> {{is a type}} of <b>thermometer</b> that <b>records</b> {{temperature}} {{changes over}} a period of time. One end of the strip is attached to a long, light metal lever that holds a special pen. Tiny movement of the bimetallic strip causes much larger movement of the free end of the lever and the pen. The pen traces a rising and falling line on a strip of paper attached to a slowly turning drum. The drum usually makes one turn every seven or so days, so afterwards each strip of paper contains a complete and accurate record of temperature changes for a whole week. There are normally two types of metal on the bimetallic strip. Mostly one is steel and one is copper. Because these metals expand and contract at different rates.When one of these metals expand it curls tighter, when one contracts it uncurl slightly. When it curls or uncurls, the data is converted into <b>electric</b> signals, which <b>record</b> the temperature change.|$|R

50|$|The party made {{atmospheric}} measurements at {{the peak}} of the mountain for purposes of determining its elevation. At the summit, their aneroid barometer read 13.175 inches, their boiling-point thermometer read 174.9 degrees, their mercurial barometer read 13.617 inches. The alcohol minimum <b>recording</b> <b>thermometer</b> read 7 °F. These measurements, with others taken at Fort Gibbon and Valdez, were reduced by C. E. Griffin, Topographic Engineer of the United States Geological Survey, to produce an elevation for Denali of 20,384 feet. The precise figure measured by the United States Geological Survey in 2015 is 20,310 feet.|$|R

5000|$|The Regener barrel (Regener-Tonne) was {{the name}} of a {{scientific}} payload for the World War II V-2 rocket. Mid-1942 plans for subsequent launches to study upper-atmospheric guidance and science were not carried out due to the need for test launches and the eventual advance of the Russian armies. Instrumentation had been contracted on July 11, 1942; and the Research Foundation for the Physics of the Stratosphere was to develop the [...] "Regener barrel" [...] with a quartz barograph, a <b>recording</b> <b>thermometer,</b> an ultra-violet spectrograph, and an air sampler. By January 18, 1945, rumors of nearby Soviet tanks resulted in Erich Regener's organization being sent from Peenemünde before the A-4 instrument package had been finished. [...] The Regener-Tonne parachute was tested at Peenemünde Prüfstand VII and a mock-up was launched in January 1945.|$|R
