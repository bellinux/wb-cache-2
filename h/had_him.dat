5|$|Andrew Kehoe's {{body was}} {{eventually}} claimed {{by one of}} his sisters. Without ceremony, she <b>had</b> <b>him</b> buried in an unmarked grave in an initially unnamed cemetery. It was later revealed that Kehoe was buried in the paupers' section of Mount Rest Cemetery, St. Johns, Clinton County, Michigan. The Price family buried Nellie Price Kehoe in Lansing's Mount Hope Cemetery under her maiden name.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Wales loss against Australia, the {{selectors}} kept {{faith with}} John, and he retained his {{place for the}} next Wales international. Played away from home, the opener of the 1967 Five Nations Championship against Scotland <b>had</b> <b>him</b> paired at half-back with Cardiff's Billy Hullin. John played badly while carrying a leg injury, and the very next match he was dropped, replaced by the more experienced Watkins.|$|E
5|$|During his career, {{and most}} notably {{during his time}} in Baltimore, {{he was known to}} always have his dog, an Irish setter named Kelly, and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> sit in the players' area. It is claimed that the players never minded much, as he was very well-behaved and never left the area to run out on the field or made very much noise.|$|E

60|$|Hardly {{anyone was}} at work that day--no doubt the {{builders}} were <b>having</b> <b>him</b> in some obscure manner--and the whole place seemed a dismal and depressing litter. The builder's shed, black-lettered WILKINS, BUILDER, HYTHE, looked like a stranded thing amidst a cast-up disorder of wheelbarrows and wheeling planks, and earth and sand and bricks. The foundations of the walls were trenches full of damp concrete, drying in patches; the rooms--it was incredible they could ever be rooms--were shaped out as squares and oblongs of coarse, wet grass and sorrel. They looked absurdly small--dishonestly small. What could you expect? Of course the builders were <b>having</b> <b>him,</b> building too small, building all wrong, using bad materials! Old Kipps <b>had</b> told <b>him</b> a wrinkle or two. The builders were <b>having</b> <b>him,</b> young Walshingham was <b>having</b> <b>him,</b> everybody was <b>having</b> <b>him!</b> They were <b>having</b> <b>him</b> and laughing at him because they didn't respect him. They didn't respect him because he couldn't do things right. Who could respect him?...|$|R

5|$|In 1024, because Maymandi {{had gained}} {{a great amount}} of wealth during his career as a vizier, Mahmud removed him from his office, confiscated his property, and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> imprisoned at Kalinjar in India. While the nobles who opposed Maymandi urged Mahmud to execute his former vizier, Mahmud chose instead to spare Maymandi.|$|E
5|$|In January 1940 Hauptmann (Captain) Wolfgang Falck took {{command of}} I./ZG1. Falck {{came to the}} opinion that the Bf110 {{was just a little}} too big for Ostermann and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> {{transferred}} to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 equipped I./Jagdgeschwader 21 (JG21) on 7April 1940. JG21 at the time was based at Mönchengladbach and was subordinated to Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Max Ibel, the Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of Jagdgeschwader 27.|$|E

5|$|Some of Wallace's friends {{suggested}} that he be buried in Westminster Abbey, but his wife followed his wishes and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> buried in the small cemetery at Broadstone, Dorset. Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster Abbey near where Darwin had been buried. The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915.|$|E
5|$|The Naps {{acquired}} Shoeless Joe Jackson {{from the}} Athletics {{in a trade}} and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> replace Flick in the lineup. In July 1910, the Naps sold Flick to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association, but Flick refused to report to Kansas City, which cancelled the transaction.|$|E
5|$|With his father's death, Ladislaus {{inherited}} {{an enormous}} domain in 1456. The ambitious Ladislaus had his father's main opponent, Ulrich II, Count of Celje, captured and murdered on 9 November. The King, who promised amnesty to Ladislaus under duress, <b>had</b> <b>him</b> arrested in next year. Ladislaus {{was sentenced to}} death for high treason. He was executed on 16 March 1457.|$|E

5|$|A {{short time}} later Brock {{received}} a report from Fort George {{that some of the}} garrison were planning to imprison the officers and flee to the U.S. Immediately he boarded the schooner that had brought the message and proceeded to Fort George, under the command of then-Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Hale Sheaffe. A hastily assembled honour guard formed to greet Brock's unexpected arrival. Alone on entering the fort, Brock ordered the sergeant of the guard to disarm and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> confined.|$|E
5|$|Although he openly opposed secession {{during the}} American Civil War, federal {{military}} forces labeled Helm a Confederate sympathizer. In September 1862, {{he was arrested}} for this alleged sympathy, but Governor James F. Robinson recognized him as he was being transported to a prison in Louisville and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> released. After the war Helm identified with the Democratic Party, and in 1865 Hardin County voters returned him to the state senate. In 1867 he was the state's Democratic candidate for governor. Despite his failing health, Helm made a vigorous canvass of the state and won the general election. He was too weak to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so state officials administered the oath of office at his home on September 3, 1867. He died five days later.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster <b>had</b> <b>him</b> abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E
5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations. Kennan {{played a central role}} in the drafting of the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|Colonel William E. Peters {{was able}} to get his 21st Virginia Cavalry Regiment ready for the {{oncoming}} Union cavalry, but was driven back across the river. Earlier, Peters had refused to burn Chambersburg and General McCausland <b>had</b> <b>him</b> arrested. However, the arrest was revoked a short time later, and Peters led the rear guard when they left the burning town. He performed relatively well at Moorefield, leading portions of his regiment while they slowed the Federal advance {{on the south side of}} the river.|$|E

5|$|DeForest Kelley, {{the actor}} who portrayed {{physician}} Leonard McCoy on Star Trek, was a personal favorite of John Belushi. Belushi had offices on the same lot as Kelley. Kelley overheard Belushi discussing the Saturday Night Live parody of Star Trek with William Shatner, and mentioned {{to both of them}} that he had not yet seen the sketch. Belushi immediately escorted Kelley to his office on the lot and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> watch it on videotape.|$|E
5|$|Dorian Holley is an African American musician, backing {{singer and}} vocal coach. Holley began his {{professional}} {{career as an}} on-stage backing vocalist for American entertainer Michael Jackson during his Bad World Tour in 1987. The series of concerts <b>had</b> <b>him</b> perform {{to millions of people}} throughout the world, including British royalty. From there, Holley went on to travel with Jackson for all of his subsequent world tours. He also performed with other artists such as Rod Stewart in 1991 and James Taylor in 1994. In 1991, Holley was the singing voice of Choir Boy in the Robert Townsend movie, The Five Heartbeats. His stage presence and vocal ability were praised by music critics during such performances.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was born}} at Windsor Castle on 13 November 1312, and was often {{referred}} to as Edward of Windsor in his early years. The reign of his father, EdwardII, was a particularly problematic period of English history. One source of contention was the king's inactivity, and repeated failure, in the ongoing war with Scotland. Another controversial issue was the king's exclusive patronage {{of a small group of}} royal favourites. The birth of a male heir in 1312 temporarily improved EdwardII's position in relation to the baronial opposition. To bolster further the independent prestige of the young prince, the king <b>had</b> <b>him</b> created Earl of Chester at only twelve days of age.|$|E
