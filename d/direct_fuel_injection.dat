25|$|The Daimler-Benz DB 601 was a German {{aircraft}} engine built during World War II. It was a liquid-cooled inverted V12, and powered the Messerschmitt Bf 109, among others. The DB 601 was basically an improved DB 600 with <b>direct</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b>|$|E
25|$|The DB 601A-1 was a {{development}} of the DB 600 with mechanical <b>direct</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> Like all DB 601s, it had a 33.9 litre displacement. The first DB 601A-1 prototype, designated as F4E, was test run in 1935, and an order for 150 engines was placed in February 1937.|$|E
25|$|The next model, the V10 prototype, was {{identical}} to the V8, except for its Jumo 210G engine. The V10, V11, V12 and V13 prototypes were built using Bf 109B airframes, and tested the DB 600A engine {{with the hope of}} increasing the performance of the aircraft. The DB 600A was dropped as the improved DB601A with <b>direct</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> was soon to become available.|$|E

25|$|High {{emissions}}. As {{unburnt fuel}} {{is in the}} exhaust stream, emissions requirements are difficult to meet. This problem may be overcome by implementing <b>direct</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> into the combustion chamber. The Freedom Motors Rotapower Wankel engine, which is not yet in production, met the ultra low California emissions standards. The Mazda Renesis engine, with both intake and exhaust side ports, suppressed the loss of unburned mix to exhaust formerly induced by port overlap.|$|E
25|$|Due to a 50% longer stroke {{duration}} than a reciprocating four-cycle engine, {{there is}} more time to complete the combustion. This leads to greater suitability for <b>direct</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> and stratified charge operation. A Wankel rotary engine has stronger flows of air-fuel mixture and a longer operating cycle than a reciprocating engine, achieving a concomitantly thorough mixing of hydrogen and air. The result is a homogeneous mixture and no hot spots in the engine, which is crucial for hydrogen combustion.|$|E
25|$|Production of the {{short-lived}} Bf 109C {{began in the}} spring of 1938. The 109C was powered by a 700PS (690hp, 515kW) Jumo 210G engine with <b>direct</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> Another important change was a strengthened wing, now carrying two more machine guns, giving four 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17s in total. The C-0s were pre-production aircraft, the C-1 was the production version, and the C-2 was an experimental version with an engine-mounted machine gun. The C-3 was planned with 20mm MG FF cannons replacing the two MG 17s in the wings, but it is not known how many C-3s (if any) were built or converted. The C-4 was planned to have an engine-mounted Motorkanone MG FF, but this variant was not produced.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} controlled <b>direct</b> gasoline <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (DGI) {{system has been}} modeled, programmed and constructed for a four-stroke SI engine. Locally available materials {{have been used for}} this experimental model. All the old model vehicle were equipped with carburetor for air fuel mixing and later on electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> system has been introduced for maintaining better air fuel ratio and mixing in many late model vehicles. Later on Japan introduced <b>direct</b> gasoline <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> system in their SI engine but it is not yet commercialized in many under developed countries. <b>Direct</b> gasoline <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> (DGI) system has the advantage of fulfilling proper air fuel ratio in various operating conditions and loads providing minimum air pollution. In four stroke engine, fuel needs to be supplied once in every two revolution. A logic control and program is necessary to control and supply fuel supply once in the cylinder at every two revolution. A program has been made to control the system. <b>Fuel</b> <b>injection</b> period was maintained by opto-isolator sensor in this model. But <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> period need to be varied depending on operating condition and loads. Further research is necessary to develop this model and program depending upon engine loads. The designed DGI system is found to work properly with the designed constant speed of 3000 rpm. The development of this model with variable speed and load is necessary for improvement of vehicle performances and emission control. 1...|$|R

25|$|The first {{internal}} combustion piston engine design to be widely used for powering aircraft was the Antoinette water-cooled V8 engine, {{believed to be}} the very first V-form eight-cylinder {{internal combustion}} engine ever placed in production, designed by the Frenchman Léon Levavasseur. The Antoinette 8V incorporated <b>direct</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> evaporative water cooling and other advanced features, weighed 95kg (209lb) and produced 37kW (50hp). Introduced in 1906, these engines were used by, among others, Santos Dumont, the early Voisin aircraft and Samuel Cody. American aviation engine designers quickly picked up on the V-8 engine concept from 1906 onwards as the era progressed, with both Glenn Curtiss' firm designing a series of liquid-cooled V-8 aviation engines culminating in the Curtiss OX-5 by the early years of World War I — another major American engine manufacturer, Hall-Scott, had their A-2 and A-3 overhead valve, liquid-cooled V-8s in production as early as 1908.|$|E
25|$|Mazda {{is still}} {{continuing}} development of next-generation of Wankel engines. The company is researching engine laser ignition, which eliminates conventional spark plugs, <b>direct</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> and sparkless HCCI ignition. These {{lead to greater}} rotor eccentricity (equating to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine), with improved elasticity and low revolutions-per-minute torque. Research by T. Kohno proved that installing a glow-plug in the combustion chamber improved part load and low revolutions per minute fuel economy by 7%. These innovations promise to improve fuel consumption and emissions. To improve fuel efficiency further, Mazda is looking at using the Wankel as a range-extender in series-hybrid cars, announcing a prototype, the Mazda2 EV, for press evaluation in November 2013. This configuration improves fuel efficiency and emissions. As a further advantage, running a Wankel engine at a constant speed gives greater engine life. Keeping to a near constant, or narrow band, of revolutions eliminates, or vastly reduces, many of the disadvantages of the Wankel engine.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{spark plugs}} {{need to be}} {{indented}} into {{the walls of the}} combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's apex seals pass over the spark plug hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional spark plugs and removing the narrow slit in the motor housing so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the glow plug used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow Plugs in the JDTI Stratified Charge Rotary Engine'. The laser plug can fire its spark through the narrow slit. Laser spark plugs can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. <b>Direct</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|E

500|$|The use of {{carburettors}} {{was calculated}} {{to give a}} higher specific power output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems. However, the Merlin's float controlled carburettor meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary Bf 109E, which had <b>direct</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> could [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been {{forced out of the}} carburettor's float chamber by the effects of negative g-force (g).

[...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a restrictor in the fuel supply line to restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in the float chamber to contain fuel under negative G, went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted.
