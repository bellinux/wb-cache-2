40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to estimate the}} damping properties of human tissue by using spring and damper system as a model. Data of impacting human tissue at the deltoid area was used to obtain a continuous, second order system to represent the mass-spring-damper system. A discrete ARMA(2, 1) model was fitted using the data obtained from experiments in which the deceleration of a pendulum impacting human shoulders {{in the area of}} the deltoid muscle was measured. The data of the deceleration was integrated twice to obtain estimates of displacement. The integration was done until the maximum displacement occurred at zero velocity. An ARMA (2, 1) model was then fitted on the displacement data using the Data-Dependent-System (DDS) technique. The results were then converted to a continuous second order autoregressive model A(2) using the concept of Green’s Function and the auto covariance. Utilizing the principles of a mass-spring-damper system enabled the estimation of the spring constant (K) and damper constant (C) for each trail of the experiment. Estimates for both constants were found to be highly correlated with the mass of the <b>impacting</b> <b>pendulum.</b> Explanations for this string relationship were investigated...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the Journal of Biomechanics [© Elsevier]. It is also available at: www. elsevier. com/locate/jbiomechThe {{aim of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that by accounting for soft tissue motion of the lower leg during the impacts associated with in vivo testing, that the differences between in vivo and in vitro estimates of heel pad properties can be explained. To examine this a two-dimensional model of the shank and heel pad was developed using DADS. The model contained a heel pad element and a rigid skeleton to which was connected soft tissue which could move relative to the bone. Simulations permitted estimation of heel pad properties directly from heel pad deformations, and from the kinematics of an <b>impacting</b> <b>pendulum.</b> These two approaches paralleled those used in vitro and in vivo respectively. Measurements from the pendulum indicated that heel pad properties changed from those found in vitro to those found in vivo as relative motion of the bone and soft tissue was allowed. This would indicate that pendulum measures of the in vivo heel pad properties are also measuring the properties of the whole lower leg. The ability of the wobbling mass of the shank to dissipate energy during an impact was found to be significant. These results demonstrate the important role of both the heel pad and soft tissue of the shank to the dissipation of mechanical energy during impacts. These results provide a further clarification of the paradox between the measurements of heel pad properties made in vivo and in vitro...|$|E

Increasing energy level by a factor of four (from 0. 022 to 0. 082 J) caused the bruise volume to increase by a factor of three (from 46 to 134. 5 mm 3). Increasing drop height from 18 cm (0. 026 J) to 54 cm (0. 079 J) caused the bruise volume to increase up to 35 %. Bruise severity due to compression force was higher than those of obtained from other tests. Doubling the loading time from 2 to 4 seconds showed no significant difference in bruise volume. Although Gavita variety had greater sensitivity to bruising than Selva variety, the effect of variety was significant only in <b>impact</b> test with <b>pendulum</b> tester...|$|R
40|$|This certificatio report {{describes}} the processing and characterisation of ERM-FA 013 bb, {{a batch of}} Charpy V-notch certified reference test pieces. sets of five of these test pieces are used for the verification of <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> test machines according to EN 10045 - 2) or according to ISO 148 - 2. The certified value for KV (= energy required to break a V-notched test piece using a <b>pendulum</b> <b>impact</b> test machine) is 28. 1 J. The associated uncertainty (0. 8 J, k= 2 corresponding to a confidence level of 95 %) is calculated for the mean {{of a set of}} five test pieces. The certified vlaue is traceable to the Charpy impact test method as described in EN 10045 1 and ISO 148, via the corresponding Master Batch ERM-FA 013 d of the same nominal absorbed energy (30 J).

40|$|The BioRID P 3 (Biofidelic Rear Impact Dummy) and the Hybrid III were {{evaluated}} in <b>pendulum</b> <b>impacts</b> {{to the back}} and compared to data from previous cadaver tests. The test setup impacting seated cadavers was reproduced with a <b>pendulum</b> <b>impacting</b> seated dummies {{at the level of}} T 6 (6 th thoracic vertebra). The pendulum mass was 23 kg and the impact velocity 4. 6 m/s. The results showed that the BioRID P 3 was more biofidelic than the Hybrid III in terms of the peak responses and the temporal window of the head and head relative to T 1 horizontal, vertical, and angular displacement. This study is an evaluation of both the BioRID P 3 and the Hybrid III against a recently available set of human subject data. The study meets the need for validation of the BioRID P 3 at a higher impact severity than has been previously accomplished...|$|R
40|$|A torsional-type thrust stand {{has been}} {{designed}} and built to test Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPT's) in both single shot and repetitive operating modes. Using this stand, momentum per pulse was determined strictly {{as a function of}} thrust stand deflection, spring constant, and natural frequency. No empirical corrections were required. The accuracy of the method was verified using a swinging <b>impact</b> <b>pendulum.</b> Momentum transfer data between the thrust stand and the pendulum were consistent to within 1 %. Following initial calibrations, the stand was used to test a Lincoln Experimental Satellite (LES- 8 / 9) thruster. The LES- 8 / 9 system had a mass of approximately 7. 5 kg, with a nominal thrust to weight ratio of 1. 3 x 10 (exp - 5). A total of 34 single shot thruster pulses were individually measured. The average impulse bit per pulse was 266 microN-s, which was slightly less than the value of 300 microN-s published in previous reports on this device. Repetitive pulse measurements were performed similar to ordinary steady-state thrust measurements. The thruster was operated for 30 minutes at a repetition rate of 132 pulses per minute and yielded an average thrust of 573 microN. Using average thrust, the average impulse bit per pulse was estimated to be 260 microN-s, which was in agreement with the single shot data. Zero drift during the repetitive pulse test was found to be approximately 1 % of the measured thrust...|$|R
