Carnitine is used in lipid transport.|$|E

Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural <b>functions,</b> <b>for</b> example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E

5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have <b>functions</b> <b>for</b> defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Inhibition of this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the inhibition of receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the brain}} became more {{sophisticated}} {{with the use of}} the microscope and the development of a silver staining method by Camillo Golgi during the 1870s.

He used microscopy to uncover many cell types, and proposed <b>functions</b> <b>for</b> the cells he saw.
