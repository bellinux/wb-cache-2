In comparison with previous legislation, {{the new one}} brings slight shift in understanding of this comprehensive legal institute. New Civil Code uses term residency co-ownership instead of flat ownership, thus, apart from securing housing needs, emphasizing house co-ownership. Part of this thesis is dedicated to accessory co-ownership, as special co-ownership legislation, with goal of simplifying common ownership management.

40|$|Phosphorus is an {{essential}} element for life, serving as an integral component of nucleic acids, lipids and a diverse range of other metabolites. Concentrations of bioavailable phosphorus are low in many aquatic environments. Microalgae, including diatoms, apply physiological and molecular strategies such as phosphorus scavenging or recycling as well as adjusting cell growth in order to adapt to limiting phosphorus concentrations. Such strategies also involve adjustments of the carbon metabolism. Here, we review the effect of phosphorus limitation on carbon metabolism in diatoms. Two transcriptome studies are analysed in detail, supplemented by other transcriptome, proteome and metabolite data, to <b>gain</b> <b>overview</b> of different pathways and their responses. Phosphorus, nitrogen and silicon limitation responses are compared, and similarities and differences discussed. We use the current knowledge to propose a suggestive model for the carbon flow in phosphorus replete and phosphorus-limited diatom cells...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{methods to}} determine additional loads bolts susceptible to fatigue-T connections. The {{reason for this}} exercise is the desire to increase the level of knowledge in this area. There is very little in literature and standards on this subject. The target {{of the study was}} to <b>gain</b> <b>overview</b> of existing formulas to calculate prying forces in T-connections subjected to dynamic loads. The results should be compared against analysis in Ansys Workbench. If possible, it would also be prepared separate formulas that would be verified against Ansys Workbench. It should also draw up a supervisor who showed step by step how an analysis of additional forces could be estimated in Ansys Workbench. It has been carried out literature studies of screw charts, calculations of prying forces and fatigue standards to get an overview of the effects that affected screw. To test out theories it have been set up models in Ansys. These have been tried up against theory of both prying forces and screw chart. The studies of the screw charts has led to two main theories. One calculating the compressed parts using pressure cone, Shigly [2] and the other uses a cylinder, Waløen [1]. It turns out that the theory that uses pressure cone coincides best with Ansys results. This is also much more complicated to use. Evidence indicates that Ansys analysis is very conservative, yet both methods fall conservatively into practice. Evidence indicates that, since the method of cylinder is mostly used in Norway. The studies of prying forces has headed to two equations which predict prying forces and the smallest flange thickness these formulas apply. The formulas are very similar in their structure, but one is more conservative than the other. It's just the most conservative formula that provides opportunities for fatigue analysis. These fatigue analysis is also little nuanced and provides only the result that says less than 20, 000 cycles, between 20, 000 and 500, 000 and over 500, 000 cycles, screw guide [3]. From these data, it constructed a fatigue curve to compare with Ansys analyzes. These comparisons do not coincide very well. More factors than prying forces play a role when we look at fatigue. By prying forces we also get a bending effect in the screw. This often generate bending stresses which give almost equally large changes inn stress range in many cases, as prying forces alone. Of fatigue standards it has been looked in to DNV-RP-C 203 [6] and EN 1993 - 1 - 9 [5]. The literature does not say anything about witch fatigue curve that is suitable if you have prying forces. DNV-RP-C 203; W 2 and EN 1993 - 1 - 9; 40 is used in this report. These curves are also almost identical. The formulas for prying forces don’t say anything about stress range. It is actually stress range who is used in the fatigue standards. It's also bean created formulas to calculate the lifetime of bolts by susceptible to fatigue T-pieces based on the formulas that have been examined in the report. This formula publishes stress range, so it can be used with fatigue standards. The result of the comparison with Ansys, gives a curve on the conservative side. This formulas is very extensive and complicated, so it is relatively easy to get a calculation error along the way. Finally, it has bean produced a guide to determine stress range in Ansys. The model in this guide is design so all dimensions can be changed easily inside Ansys. This makes it possible to calculate models with other dimensions than the model initially...|$|E
40|$|We are {{surrounded}} by an ever increasing ocean of information, everybody will agree to that. We build sophisticated strategies to govern this information: design data models, develop infrastructures for data sharing, building tool for data analysis. Statistical datasets curated by National Statistical Offices (NSO) and international bodies like the OECD and Eurostat are being increasingly published on the Web, using Web standards, as Linked Open Data. We call Linked Statistical Data (LSD) all statistical datasets published on the Web as Linked Open Data. These datasets do not only consist of current statistics, but also an inheritage of such statistics conducted in the past by these NSO. Of these, the most prominent statistics are the Historical Censuses [1, 2, 3, 5]. In designing the current research landscape, {{there seems to be}} little attention to one very basic inquiry prior to any research design, so basic that it almost seems to be a shame to mention is, and that is a baseline statistics {{on the size of the}} problem we encounter to tackle, its occurrence, and the the actual need to tackle it. For our own research project [2] it was important to know all these baseline statistics, for instance, how much datasets, variables and values we have, and of which nature [12]. In the context of harmonization we looked for other existing vocabularies to avoid reinventing the wheel. The effort on trying to reuse these vocabularies was the immediate trigger for this exercise. In this paper we pose the following questions: What kind of dimensions are used in LSD? How often do they occur on the Web? Hereby, dimensions stand for the variables (and the categories used to encode their values) used when describing statistical data inquired to monitor society. Most of those statistical datasets published on the Web use the RDF Data Cube vocabulary [4] to describe the observations, dimensions, measures and attributes they contain. It is the beauty of semantic web technologies which allow us to perform, once every hour, an on­the­flight collection of data from those machine­readable publications of statistical information from almost 600 endpoints all across the Web. Web visualization technologies allow us to build a user interface for this meta study almost without any efforts ­ for all of those capable of playing with those tools of course. We call it LSD Dimensions, and it is available online [6, 7]. The availability of baseline statistics about the usage of multidimensional data on the Web opens up multiple questions, especially regarding comparability and reusability of statistical data, metadata and concepts, and how these can be combined or mixed in a semantically meaningful way [8]. But its implications are much bigger. Insights into the amount of statistical data available allows to better place the need for efforts to build research infrastructure for them. Baseline statistics as shown in this paper also highlight where research efforts are still needed, e. g. on coding schemes that do not exist yet and for which automatic tools that assist knowledge experts on building and publishing them are highly demanded [13]. At the end the innovativeness of this paper lies neither in the visualizations not in the data analytics, but in the smart use of existing technologies to <b>gain</b> <b>overview</b> about the problem space prior to entering into it. This way of thinking about visualizing baseline statistics in very much in line with the goals of KnoweScape combining data analytics with visualizations to enhance the access to large information spaces. This exercise has been inspired by numerous works from colleagues, which either use visualizations to advocate their own profound efforts of data integration and semantical referenceable data publishing [9, 11], or build pipelines of data harvest, analysis and visualization for all kind of other information [10]...|$|E
