40|$|The Enskog {{kinetic theory}} {{is used as}} a {{starting}} point to model a suspension of solid particles in a viscous gas. Unlike previous efforts for similar suspensions, the gas-phase contribution to the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>particle</b> <b>acceleration</b> appearing in the Enskog equation is modelled using a Langevin equation, which can be applied to a wide parameter space (e. g. high Reynolds number). Attention here is limited to low Reynolds number flow, however, in order to assess the influence of the gas phase on the constitutive relations, which was assumed to be negligible in a previous analytical treatment. The Chapman–Enskog method is used to derive the constitutive relations needed for the conservation of mass, momentum and granular energy. The results indicate that the Langevin model for instantaneous gas–solid force matches the form of the previous analytical treatment, indicating the promise of this method for regions of the parameter space outside of those attainable by analytical methods (e. g. higher Reynolds number). The results also indicate that the effect of the gas phase on the constitutive relations for the solid-phase shear viscosity and Dufour coefficient is non-negligible, particularly in relatively dilute systems. Moreover, unlike their granular (no gas phase) counterparts, the shear viscosity in gas–solid systems is found to be zero in the dilute limit and the Dufour coefficient is found to be non-zero in the elastic limit...|$|E
40|$|When {{designing}} a split Hopkinson system, the yield {{strength of the}} selected pressure bar material determines the maximum stress attainable within deforming samples and also, the maximum striker velocity that is usable to prevent plasticity in bars. In practice, to avoid strain gages stripping, the velocity of the striker {{is limited by the}} <b>instantaneous</b> <b>particles</b> <b>acceleration</b> generated in the bars. As a consequence, the full potential of the Hopkinson system can not be used. Therefore, for material having very high yield strength, {{it is very difficult to}} induce the required stress wave to create plasticity using a split Hopkinson apparatus. The idea of using an improved method for installing strain gages to withstand very high accelerations is very important for high dynamic loading using the split Hopkinson bar system.

We focus on <b>particle</b> <b>acceleration</b> and magnetic field generation, and describe the recent progress in the field driven by theory advances and by the rapid development of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. In weakly magnetized or quasi parallel-shocks (where the magnetic field is nearly aligned with the flow), <b>particle</b> <b>acceleration</b> is efficient. The accelerated particles stream ahead of the shock, where they generate strong magnetic waves which in turn scatter the particles {{back and forth across}} the shock, mediating their acceleration. In contrast, in strongly magnetized quasi-perpendicular shocks, the efficiencies of both <b>particle</b> <b>acceleration</b> and magnetic field generation are suppressed. <b>Particle</b> <b>acceleration,</b> when efficient, modifies the turbulence around the shock on a long time scale, and the accelerated particles have a characteristic energy spectral index of ~ 2. 2 in the ultra-relativistic limit.
