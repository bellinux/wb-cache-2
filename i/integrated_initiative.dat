The project entitled: “Rationalization of Ras El Ain Irrigation Systems” started in January 2005 and ended in March 2008. The project was aimed at addressing the problem of water resources scarcity in the project area of Ras El Ain, around the springs of Al Khabour, located in the Hassakeh province (North Mesopotamia) of the Syrian Arab Republic. During the project implementation, a real field experience was carried out involving national and international researchers, local officers and technicians, and local farmers as direct beneficiaries. An appropriate sustainable model concerning the crop management practice was elaborated to save both water resources and production inputs for cotton and wheat.

40|$|Parkinson’s {{disease is}} a complex {{heterogeneous}} disorder with urgent need for disease-modifying therapies. Progress in successful therapeutic approaches for PD will require an unprecedented level of collaboration. At a workshop hosted by Parkinson’s UK and co-organized by Critical Path Institute’s (C-Path) Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) Consortiums, investigators from industry, academia, government and regulatory agencies agreed {{on the need for}} sharing of data to enable future success. Government agencies included EMA, FDA, NINDS/NIH and IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative). Emerging discoveries in new biomarkers and genetic endophenotypes are contributing {{to our understanding of the}} underlying pathophysiology of PD. In parallel there is growing recognition that early intervention will be key for successful treatments aimed at disease modification. At present, there is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of disease progression and the many factors that contribute to disease progression heterogeneity. Novel therapeutic targets and trial designs that incorporate existing and new biomarkers to evaluate drug effects independently and in combination are required. The integration of robust clinical data sets is viewed as a powerful approach to hasten medical discovery and therapies, as is being realized across diverse disease conditions employing big data analytics for healthcare. The application of lessons learned from parallel efforts is critical to identify barriers and enable a viable path forward. A roadmap is presented for a regulatory, academic, industry and advocacy driven <b>integrated</b> <b>initiative</b> that aims to facilitate and streamline new drug trials and registrations in Parkinson’s disease...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine recent {{developments}} in European policy debates concerned with whether governments should intervene in the digital intermediary marketplace to protect the public’s interest. Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses the public’s interest in the evolution of the digital intermediary marketplace, considers the economics and policy literature on the case for policy intervention in the market dynamics of digital platforms and examines the extent to which policy makers in Europe are catching up with changes in the market for digital platform services. Findings – It is argued that policy-makers need to broaden the evidence base upon which they consider whether policy intervention is needed beyond economic analysis. This is essential to ensure that the European digital intermediary marketplace develops in line with economic, social and cultural goals. Research limitations/implications – The case is made for measures to ensure continuous and integrated monitoring of developments in the digital marketplace based on economic indicators and evidence on the diversity of media content. Practical implications – Suggestions are made about the need for innovations in the way policy makers develop the required evidence base for their decisions. Social implications – The paper draws attention to the need for proactive policy making based on a consideration of economic, social and cultural goals to ensure that digital intermediaries are held accountable. Originality/value – The paper provides a multidisciplinary perspective on the dynamics of the digital intermediary ecology and assesses the extent to which the European digital market strategy provides an <b>integrated</b> <b>initiative</b> that is likely to be implemented...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of vision and}} eye health has been recognized {{with the introduction of}} vision objectives in Healthy People 2010, a national disease prevention initiative that identifies opportunities to improve the health of all Americans. Furthermore, the National Commission of Prevention Priorities has identified vision screening among adults aged 65 years and older {{as one of the top}} 10 priority areas for effective clinical preventive services that can be offered in medical settings. To meet these vision objectives, it is essential to build on existing vision health and other health programs, resources, and priorities to create a more coordinated public health approach that not only conveys the urgency of the problem to decision makers and the public but also includes strategies to reach different age groups and high-risk populations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), through its Vision Health Initiative (VHI) located within the Division of Diabetes Translation (DDT), has begun the effort by involving a wide range of stakeholders in the design of a coordinated public health framework to prevent blindness and vision impairment. It is intended that this report will assist CDC and other public health champions in developing and implementing more comprehensive and detailed strategies that will reduce the burden of vision impairment and eye diseases for all Americans during the next decade and beyond.

40|$|Landscapes {{are linked}} to human {{well-being}} in a multitude of ways, {{some of which are}} challenged by global market forces and traditional management approaches. In response to this situation there has been a rise in local initiatives to sustain the values of landscape.

This review collects examples of <b>integrated</b> landscape <b>initiatives</b> from all over Europe through systematic internet key word searches and canvassing of European umbrella organisations; followed by an online survey of representatives from the identified initiatives (n = 71). Our results show that the most relevant characteristics of <b>integrated</b> landscape <b>initiatives</b> in Europe are: a holistic approach to landscape management (acting in multifunctional landscapes and combining different objectives), the involvement and coordination of different sectors and stakeholders at many levels, and the role as agents of awareness raising and learning hubs. <b>Integrated</b> landscape <b>initiatives</b> mainly depend on impulses of local civil society. Identified barriers to their work include a lack of funding and institutional support. Therefore, political and societal action is needed to increase their effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{variable}} {{success of}} <b>integrated</b> care <b>initiatives</b> has led experts to recommend tailoring {{design and implementation}} to the organizational context. Yet, organizational contexts are rarely described, understood, or measured with sufficient depth and breadth in empirical studies or in practice. We thus lack knowledge of when and specifically how organizational contexts matter. To facilitate the accumulation of evidence, we developed a research toolkit for conducting case studies using standardized measures of the (inter-) organizational context for integrating care.   Theory and Methods: We used a multi-method approach to develop the research toolkit: (1) development and validation of the Context and Capabilities for Integrating Care (CCIC) Framework, (2) identification, assessment, and selection of survey instruments, (3) development of document review methods, (4) development of interview guide resources, and (5) pilot testing of the document review guidelines, consolidated survey, and interview guide.   Results: The toolkit provides a framework and measurement tools that examine 18 organizational and inter-organizational factors that affect the implementation and success of <b>integrated</b> care <b>initiatives.</b>   Discussion and Conclusion: The toolkit {{can be used to}} characterize and compare organizational contexts across cases and enable comparison of results across studies. This information can enhance our understanding of the influence of organizational contexts, support the transfer of best practices, and help explain why some <b>integrated</b> care <b>initiatives</b> succeed and some fail...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} {{on the use of}} project management to measure the provision of low-cost housing (LCH) in the Metsimaholo Local Municipality (MLM). The provision of LCH forms part of government urban regeneration programmes for achieving social sustainability. The LCH projects serve as an instrument for the development of sustainable human settlements and contribute to urban regeneration. The housing vision is underpinned by principles of sustainability, integration, equality and good governance. The South African government has since 1994 been acknowledged for its policy framework and mandate towards human settlement developments in order to give effect to the new housing approach. The government adopted a housing policy aimed at building one million houses by the year 1994. An effective measurement system <b>integrates</b> <b>initiatives,</b> aligns organisational units and resources, and improves performance. A great amount of houses were delivered to their new households. Despite the successes achieved, there are growing concerns regarding the social and environmental sustainability of these housing programmes. There are insufficient resources which lead to substantial shortage of housing and related infrastructure in the country. These issues gave rise to community dissatisfaction leading to service delivery protests in the MLM. Numerical estimates also indicate that there are difficulties to obtain reliable up-to-date statistical information on the completed housing projects. Housing provision has the potential to function as an economic engine, however the abovementioned factors impede the realisation of the economic potential of a viable and vibrant housing delivery system. An effective measurement system <b>integrates</b> <b>initiatives,</b> aligns organisational units and resources, and improves performance. The study provides analysis of {{the current state of the}} government's approach to the distribution of housing within the MLM. The use of project management on housing projects is also analysed. The paper also examines the extent to which social sustainability is incorporated within urban regeneration projects in the MLM. The objectives of this study are realised in the application of theoretical and empirical surveys. The paper also offers a series of recommendations to enhance the LCH provision in the MLM.

40|$|Across Europe, area-based {{policies}} have been developed {{as a mode of}} urban governance to deal with the unfavourable situation in many urban neighbourhoods, particularly large post-Second World War developments. The philosophy behind these area-based policies is that <b>integrated</b> <b>initiatives</b> to deal with the physical, economic and social aspects of these urban neighbourhoods, will lead to the most effective solution. This paper focuses on the ‘integrated’ aspect of area-based policies in the Netherlands. We find that there is an unbalanced relationship between policies that focus on physical interventions and those that focus on social interventions. Also, findings show that some area-based initiatives claiming to be using an integrated approach are not. ‘Integration’ is often a term used by policy-makers but not implemented. This lack of integration is partly due to the limited flexibility in decision-making at the local level in dividing funds between and within the different policy fields...|$|R

However, the adoption of PPP forms for Smart City projects has not been fully explored and only experimentally applied so far. In order to promote the usage of PPP to finance Smart City initiatives, this paper proposes some PPP financial instruments and discusses the associated strengths and weaknesses. In particular, the use of Project Finance, Revenue Sharing and Social Impact Bonds are suggested as sound alternatives and suitable sources of financing for Smart City project...|$|R
