2500|$|Stocking {{density is}} {{an issue in the}} welfare of {{commercial}} turkeys and high densities are a major animal welfare concern. [...] Permitted stocking densities for turkeys reared indoors vary according to geography and animal welfare farm assurance schemes. [...] For example, in Germany, there is a voluntary maximum of 52kg/m2 and 58kg/m2 for males and females respectively. [...] In the UK, the RSPCA Freedom Foods assurance scheme reduces permissible stocking density to 25kg/m2 for turkeys reared indoors. [...] Turkeys maintained at commercial stocking densities (8 birds/m2; 61kg/m2) exhibit increased welfare problems such as increases in gait abnormalities, hip and foot lesions, and bird disturbances, and decreased bodyweight compared with lower stocking densities. [...] Turkeys reared at 8 birds/m2 have a higher incidence of hip lesions and <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis</b> than those reared at 6.5 or 5.0 birds/m2. [...] Insufficient space may lead to an increased risk for injuries such as broken wings caused by hitting the pen walls or other turkeys during aggressive encounters and can also lead to heat stress. The problems of small space allowance are exacerbated by the major influence of social facilitation on the behaviour of turkeys. If turkeys are to feed, drink, dust-bathe, etc., simultaneously, then to avoid causing frustration, resources and space must be available in large quantities.|$|E

40|$|Aviary {{systems for}} laying hens offer space and {{opportunities}} to perform natural behaviors. However, hen welfare can be impaired due to increased risk for keel bone and <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> disorders in those systems. This cross-sectional study (N = 47 flocks) aimed to assess prevalences of keel bone and <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> disorders in laying hens housed in aviaries in Belgium to identify risk factors for these disorders and their relation to egg production. Information on housing characteristics and egg production were obtained through questionnaire-based interviews, farm records, and measurements in the henhouse. Keel bone (wounds, hematomas, fractures, deviations) and <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> disorders (<b>dermatitis,</b> hyperkeratosis) were assessed in 50 randomly selected 60 -week-old laying hens per flock. A linear model with stepwise selection procedure was used to investigate associations between risk factors, production parameters, and the keel bone and <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> disorders. The flock mean prevalences were: hematomas 41. 2 %, wounds 17. 6 %, fractures 82. 5 %, deviations 58. 9 %, hyperkeratosis 42. 0 %, dermatitis 27. 6 %, and bumble foot 1. 2 %. Identified risk factors for keel bone disorders were aviary type (row vs. portal), tier flooring material (wire mesh vs. plastic slats), corridor width, nest box perch, and hybrid. Identified risk factors for <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> disorders were aviary type (row vs. portal), free-range, and hybrid. Percentage of second-quality eggs was negatively associated with keel bone deviations (P = 0. 029) at the flock level.

The identification of various risk factors suggests improvements to aviary systems may lead to better welfare of laying hens. </p...|$|R
40|$|Automated {{tracking}} {{of the location}} of individual chickens is becoming more common in behavioural research. This technology has several advantages including gathering large amounts of data and monitoring of individual animals as opposed to flocks. To ensure {{the quality of the}} research the transmitters or tags attached to the bird as part of the automated positioning system should not have any effect on bird behaviour, welfare and production. Tag-related effects may lead to unreliable results which cannot be extrapolated to untagged birds. Therefore, we tested the effects of wearing a backpack containing a tag as part of an ultra-wideband system for automated position monitoring. The chickens' behaviour, leg health, cleanliness and body weight gain were studied. Sixty slow-growing broiler chickens (Sasso XL 451) were housed in groups of 10 birds. Per pen, five birds were fitted with a 36 -g tag (TAG) in a backpack from day 35 - 70 and the other five were identified using colour markings (CON). Behavioural observations from video recordings of TAG and CON chickens were performed twice daily (15 -min periods) every other day. Birds were weighed on day 35 and 70, and on day 70 <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> and hock <b>dermatitis,</b> gait, and cleanliness were scored. TAG birds walked less than CON birds in week 6, but this difference was absent from week 7 onwards. CON birds pecked more at TAG birds than other TAG birds did in week 6, probably due to the novelty of the tags, whereas the TAG birds could investigate their own tag instead of pecking at other birds' tags. No significant differences were observed for scores for <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> and hock <b>dermatitis,</b> gait and cleanliness scores or weight gain between TAG and CON birds. These results indicate that the backpacks with tags had only minor, non-persistent effects on slow-growing broiler chickens' behaviour. The effects of colour-marking on behaviours observed in this study are likely to be small. The results indicate that the tags can be used for further studies in which these behaviours, welfare measures and production parameters play an important role. </p...|$|R

40|$|Over supplementation of {{inorganic}} trace minerals {{is common}} practice in the poultry industry which often results in poor bioavailability and low body retention. This can lead to more than 90 % of the dietary trace minerals being excreted. The trace minerals Cu, Mn and Zn {{have been shown to}} contribute to a healthy skin through their roles in the structural proteins of collagen, keratin and elastin. In this study the effects of replacing industry levels of inorganic Cu, Mn and Zn with lower levels of 2 -hydroxy- 4 -(methylthio) butanoic acid (HMTBA) 2 metal chelates of Cu, Mn and Zn was investigated on broiler performance, carcass characteristics, skin and intestinal integrity and the prevalence of <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Two 35 -day grow out trials were conducted in an environmentally controlled broiler facility. The purpose of the first trial was to find a litter moisture level to be applied in a subsequent trial in order to simulate most commercial conditions where the prevalence of <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis</b> is relatively high. In Trial 2 a total of 1920 Ross first grade day-old male broiler chicks were randomly distributed into 32 identical concrete floor pens. The dietary treatments in Trial 2 consisted of:  Inorganic treatment (standard commercial trace mineral levels) containing 10, 100 and 100 mg/kg Cu, Mn and Zn, respectively (from inorganic sulphates)  Negative control containing reduced inclusion levels of inorganic Cu, Mn and Zn at 8, 32 and 32 mg/kg, respectively (from inorganic sulphates)  (HMTBA) 2 chelated Cu, Mn and Zn at inclusion levels of 8, 32 and 32 mg/kg (from only Mintrex® Zn, Mintrex® Cu and Mintrex® Mn, respectively)  (HMTBA) 2 chelated Cu,Mn and Zn at inclusion levels of 30, 32 and 32 mg/kg (from only Mintrex® Zn, Mintrex® Cu and Mintrex® Mn, respectively). Broiler performance results of body weight (BW), body weight gain (BWG), feed intake, mortality, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) adjusted for mortality were not significantly affected when broilers were fed lower levels of Cu, Mn and Zn (organic and inorganic) compared with broilers fed the commercial inorganic levels of these trace minerals over the entire trial period. Feeding Cu, Mn and Zn (HMTBA) 2 chelates at levels of 8, 32 and 32 mg/kg, respectively, resulted in the largest final mean body weight and body weight gain at 35 days of age, while maintaining a similar FCR. Carcass traits were mostly not affected by the different trace mineral treatments; whilst feeding 30, 32, and 32 mg/kg Cu, Mn and Zn (HMTBA) 2 chelates resulted in a significant increase in percentage of carcass yield in comparison to all other treatment diets. At 21 days of age the negative control treatment resulted in a significantly higher presence of <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in comparison to all other treatments. At 35 days of age the feeding of Cu, Mn and Zn- (HMTBA) 2 resulted in a significant reduction of <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis</b> and thus more saleable paws in comparison to the inorganic sulphate treatments. A lower average carcass scratch length and higher ileum strength were both observed from the supplementation of (HMTBA) 2 chelates. The analysed Cu and Zn liver concentrations were significantly similar between the positive control, and the (HMTBA) 2 treatments (P > 0. 05). The Mn liver concentrations were significantly higher for the positive control treatment in comparison to the (HMTBA) 2 treatments(P < 0. 05). The dermis length and dermis area were significantly lower for the negative control treatment in comparison to all other treatments when comparing all grade 1 samples at 21 days of age. The epidermis length of foot pad skin samples were largest for the (HMTBA) 2 8 : 32 : 32 treatment when comparing all <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis</b> grade 1 samples taken at 35 days of age. The stratus corneum area and epidermis area increased from a <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis</b> grade of 1 to grade 3 for samples taken at 21 and 35 days of age. At 35 days of age the grade 5 samples had the largest measurement for the stratus corneum area and epidermis area in comparison to all other grades. From this study it may be concluded that organic trace minerals of (HMTBA) 2 metal chelates may be supplied in broiler rations at much lower levels than the currently utilised commercial levels of inorganic trace minerals without having any adverse effects on the performance and carcass characteristics of birds. The results suggest that organic trace minerals may provide a viable tool for improving broiler production and overall profitability through improved flock uniformity, improved foot pad health and increased intestinal strength.

40|$|ABSTRACT Continuous {{light with}} 1 h of {{darkness}} at midnight {{is a common}} photoperiod for raising meat-type fowl. The logic behind the 1 h of darkness, usually provided between midnight and 0100 h, is to acclimate the birds to darkness {{in the event of}} a power failure. Increasing evidence from several research laboratories indicates that lighting regimens other than continuous light, such as intermittent or step-up lighting, can lower the incidence of leg abnormalities in meat-type fowl. Some evidence suggests that increased exer-cise contributes in part to the reduction in lameness due to lighting. Management can influence the incidence of leg and foot problems via effects on rate of gain, flooring systems, and litter moisture. Rapid weight gains have been correlated with tibial dyschondroplasia (TD), although more evidence is needed to determine whether other types of leg deformities, such as long bone distortion, are related to rapid growth rates. Using low intensity X-ray imaging (hand-held lixiscope), live breeders with TD lesions can be identified and the incidence of TD can be reduced in breeder flocks through genetic selection. In addition, turkeys can be selected for wider shanks to improve walking ability. Slippery surfaces should be avoided to prevent spraddled legs. With the exception of TD, broilers reared in cages have more leg deformities than floor-reared birds.

A randomized design in a factorial arrangement with 4 diets [basal diet, basal diet + 0. 5 % AminoGut from d 1 to 21, basal diet + 0. 5 % AminoGut from d 1 to 42, and basal diet + virginiamycin (0. 02 %) for d 1 to 42] and 2 stocking densities [0. 100 m 2 /bird (23 birds/pen; LD) or 0. 067 m 2 /bird (35 birds/pen; HD) ]. Results showed that villi length and crypt depth were not changed by different dietary treatments. However, birds in the HD group had smaller villi (P = 0. 03) compared with those of the LD group. Regardless of diet, HD consistently increased the serum concentrations of ceruloplasmin, α- 1 acid glycoprotein, ovotransferin, and corticosterone (P = 0. 0007), and elevated heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (0. 0005). Neither AminoGut supplementation nor stocking density affected cecal microflora counts. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, dietary supplementation of AminoGut, irrespective of stocking density, had no beneficial effect on growth performance, intestinal morphology, and physiological adaptive responses of broiler chickens raised under hot and humid tropical conditions. However, AminoGut supplementation from d 1 to 42 was beneficial in reducing mortality rate.

40|$|The {{reasons for}} the gait {{problems}} in broiler chickens are multiple although weight and growth rate {{are said to be}} the main reasons for locomotion problems (Vestergaard and Sanotra, 1999). Other factors that play role are infectious diseases, genetics, sex, weight and growth rate, age, feed conversion, feeding, management and movement. In this study, gait score as a measure for lameness, is thoroughly investigated in relation to the following physiological variables: weight, sex, corticosterone content in the blood plasma, hock burns, chest dirtiness, <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> tibial dyschondroplasia and femoral head necrosis. A total of 152 birds were selected from a house of 1500 birds in 3 consecutive growth periods.

Additionally, a field trial investigating the influence of variable, economically justifiable biotin levels on the devel-opment of <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> lesions was conducted and statistically analysed. In its basic structures, the reticulate scale epidermis of fattening turkeys is {{comparable to that of}} broilers. Nevertheless, the results presented here suggest that there are differences within the bird population and that an age dependent maturation of the skin as a whole occurred. The results on the epidermal lipid metabolism of the reticulate scales are contrary to any pre-vious investigation in birds and emphasises the need of further investigations of the mecha-nism and structure of the avian permeability barrier. Based on my results, the permeability barrier in turkeys is solely maintained by the interdigitation of glycolipids located within the lipid cell envelope of neighbouring sebocorneocytes. In birds these glycolipids originate from lipid bilayer residuals of the broken down multigranular bodies, rather than their limiting membrane as in mammals. The observed <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> lesions are the consequence of a progressive inflammatory reaction. In severe cases an ulcer is formed. With increasing age these ulcers can heal, leaving visible scar tissue behind. The occurrence of <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> lesions is associated with a decrease of epi-dermal &# 969; 6 -fatty acids and a change in the hydroxy fatty acid pattern. It was not possible to demonstrate an influence of the different biotin levels on the structure of the reticulate scales from the examined turkeys. An influence of biotin on the epidermal fatty acid pattern and the macroscopic evaluation of the foot health was detectable only in positive environmental conditions. None of the applied biotin levels compensated for the negative environmental influences or prevented the development of <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> lesions. A posi-tive effect on the healing of existing <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> lesions was detectable using high biotin levels in the last seven weeks of fattening. The skin from the various turkeys examined had an indi-vidually varying affinity to develop <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> lesions and also, a genetic factor cannot be ex-cluded. Consequently, exclusion of affected chicks from the breeding program should be considered. Avoiding a decrease of biotin levels during the last seven fattening weeks under optimal envi-ronmental conditions seems advisable to improve foot health in male fattening turkeys.

Their apocrine glands, like those in humans, produce an odorless oily milky {{secretion}} evolved not to evaporate and cool but rather coat and stick to hair so odor-causing bacteria can grow on it. Eccrine glands on their <b>foot</b> <b>pads,</b> like those on palms and soles of humans, did not evolve to cool either but rather increase friction and enhance grip.|$|R
40|$|Non-cage systems provide {{laying hens}} with {{considerable}} space allowance, perches {{and access to}} litter, thereby offering opportunities for natural species-specific behaviors. Conversely, these typical characteristics of non-cage systems also {{increase the risk of}} keel bone and foot pad disorders. The aim of this study was twofold: 1) to investigate if providing ramps between perches (housing factor) reduces keel bone and foot pad disorders and 2) to test for genetic predisposition by comparing 2 different layer hybrids. In a 2 × 2 design, 16 pens were equipped either with or without ramps between perches and nest boxes (8 pens/treatment), and housed with either 25 ISA Brown or Dekalb White birds per pen (in total 200 birds/hybrid). Keel bone injuries and foot health were repeatedly measured via palpation and visual assessment between 17 and 52 wk of age and daily egg production was recorded. The relationships between the dependent response variables (keel bone and footpad disorders, egg production) and independent factors (age, ramps, hybrid) were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models and corrected for repeated measures. Ramps reduced keel bone fractures (F 1, 950 = 45. 80, P < 0. 001), foot pad hyperkeratosis (F 1, 889 = 10. 40, P = 0. 001), <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (F 1, 792 = 20. 48, P < 0. 001) and bumble foot (F 1, 395 = 8. 52, P < 0. 001) compared to pens without ramps. ISA Brown birds sustained more keel bone fractures (F 1, 950 = 33. 26, P < 0. 001), had more foot pad hyperkeratosis (F 1, 889 = 44. 69, P < 0. 001) and laid more floor eggs (F 1, 1883 = 438. 80, P < 0. 001), but had fewer keel bone deviations (F 1, 1473 = 6. 73, P < 0. 001), fewer cases of <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (F 1, 792 = 19. 84, P < 0. 001) and no bumble foot as compared to Dekalb White birds. Age, housing and hybrid showed several interaction effects. Providing ramps proved to be very effective in both reducing keel bone and foot pad problems in non-cage systems. Keel bone and foot pad disorders are related to genetic predisposition. These results indicate that adaptation of the housing systems and hybrid selection may be effective measures in improving laying hen welfare. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the feather coverage on breast and thighs in meat type chickens, reared on three different types of litter materials, including wood shavings, shredded paper and chopped wheat straw. The experiment lasted for 72 days. A total of 447 one-day-old meat type chickens were randomly allotted to the three litter materials, giving 149 birds per litter. On days 24, 47 and 72 of the experimental period, feathering on the breast and thighs was scored according to a 1 – 4 scale. In addition, the severity of <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (FPD) and hock burn (HB) was evaluated at the same days by attributing scores from 1 − 3. Litter characteristics (moisture content, water absorbing capacity, bulk density, pH) were determined {{at the end of}} the experiment. Severity of FPD varied significantly (P   0. 016) on the severity of HB and on thigh feathering. Birds reared on chopped wheat straw presented the lowest breast feather coverage. Straw litter had the highest moisture content and pH value. In conclusion, wood shavings proved to be best litter material for meat type chickens rearing among the three tested litter materials...|$|E
40|$|In a {{long term}} {{research}} project in Germany the influence of husbandry {{on the health of}} fattening turkeys (Study 1) as well as the influence of practiced rearing conditions on the health of turkey poults (Study 2) was examined in 24 farms and at the meat processing plant. In all examined rearing farms, litter samples for the determination of litter moisture were taken. This paper summarizes the results obtained by our working group from 2007 until 2012. The results elucidate the universal problem of <b>foot</b> <b>pad</b> <b>dermatitis</b> (FPD). Nearly 100 % of the observed turkeys showed a clinically apparent FPD at the meat processing plant. Furthermore, skin lesions of the breast, especially breast buttons were diagnosed, particularly at the slaughterhouse. FPD was detected {{in the first week of}} the rearing phase. Prevalence and degree showed a progressive development up to the age of 22 – 35 days, whereas 63. 3 % of the poults had foot pad alterations. As even mild alterations in the foot pad condition can be indicators for suboptimal design of the rearing environment, especially high litter moisture, it is important to focus on the early rearing phase...|$|E

50|$|While {{there are}} not many {{characteristics}} that distinguish the bush rat from other Rattus species, it is characterized by having a small tympanic bullae and a straight incisive foramina. Adult bush rats are smaller than the Australian swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus) and in addition, the bush rat's <b>foot</b> <b>pads</b> are a pink colour, whereas the swamp rat's <b>foot</b> <b>pads</b> are dark brown. The feet are pentadactyl with all digits clawed. The bush rat exhibits sexual dimorphism; the males are larger than the females in the species.|$|R
50|$|The {{rules of}} the bout were disputed between both fighters {{right up to the}} day of the fight. Alexio, who had competed {{exclusively}} under American kickboxing rules, wanted both fighters to wear <b>foot</b> <b>pads</b> and low kicks to be illegal. Cikatić, a Muay Thai fighter, wanted low kicks as well as the Thai clinch to be allowed. In the end, low kicks were allowed and Alexio wore <b>foot</b> <b>pads,</b> and knees and the clinch were banned. The duration of the fight was set at eight, three-minute rounds.|$|R
