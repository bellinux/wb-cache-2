This was put {{under the command of}} General Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga and sent to the north to fight the Americans. Paredes got as far as San Luis Potos√≠, but instead of marching north against the invaders, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> capital in December and overthrew President Herrera.|$|E
60|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mansion, {{attended}} by the Jester.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{shelter and}} aroused Dick, and then Tom. This awoke {{all of the}} others.|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his counter {{his manner}} seemed much changed.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Hals {{now with}} a {{resumption}} of his patronizing manner.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{his work}} almost rudely, but she stayed by his side.|$|R
60|$|He saw {{the color}} creep into Muriel's face; and when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house Prescott lifted the girl {{down from the}} sleigh.|$|E

60|$|They {{took their}} leave, Nikasti showing them out. When the last had departed, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre table, {{from the other}} side of which Pamela was {{watching}} him curiously.|$|E
60|$|Jacob {{rose to his}} feet. The girl's look of {{disappointment}} was so ingenuous that <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
5000|$|Vultur: A {{reconnaissance}} spy and messenger for Arktos, {{but then}} changed allegiance <b>to</b> Humsin. Afterwards <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Arktos.|$|R

6000|$|... "My {{child has}} {{at any rate}} been {{fortunate}} in securing the friendship of such a friend." [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fireplace, and she was constrained {{to leave the room}} without another word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it must be}} a year old; {{but what}} he means by the way he begins is more than I can imagine;" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point at which he had broken off.|$|E
60|$|Her intonation, {{the tilt}} of her head, gave Wade such a pang {{that he could not}} answer. And to hide his {{momentary}} restraint <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hounds. Then she came out upon the porch.|$|E
60|$|Shopland {{closed the}} door behind him. Sir Timothy waited until he heard his departing footsteps. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Francis.|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} Indian pretended not <b>to</b> hear, then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> look at them, but without {{stopping}} his pony.|$|R
60|$|He {{called to}} a waiter, and was {{particular}} in his instructions as to my order. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me.|$|R
60|$|Don Miguel escorted him {{as far as}} the cloisters, until a {{servitor}} {{took charge}} of his lordship. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience chamber, where he found His Eminence sitting placidly in a high-backed arm-chair.|$|E
60|$|Wood. Most {{certainly}} a thief; for, hearing my landlady cry out, I flew from my chamber to her help, and met him running down stairs, and then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> balcony, and leapt into the street.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{only could}} find father," [...] he sighed {{to himself as}} <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> store. [...] "Something in my heart {{tells me that he}} is not dead, and yet, if this is so, where can he be?" ...|$|E

50|$|In 1967, Aboutorabi came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Iran {{and married}} {{at the age of}} 28. Then <b>he</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Najaf with his wife.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Lerumie, {{illuminating}} {{him as he}} clung in the rigging, and {{his voice}} was harsh and cold as he addressed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{table and}} laid the money on the first vacant card he saw. In another moment, as it seemed to him, it was raked away by the dealer. A sense of relief came over him.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{does not}} seem to be any danger so far," [...] said he. [...] "Some more Africans have turned up. Maka has gone to meet them. We shall find out about them in a few minutes," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entrance.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel, {{walking a}} little unsteadily. All {{the time he}} was not sure {{that this was not a}} dream.

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{guess he}} will," [...] said Jimmy, {{and a moment}} later he knocked at Bince's office door. When Bince saw who it was <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his work with a grunt.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Midwinter {{with a laugh}} of relief. [...] "What {{nonsense}} {{have you}} been talking!" [...] he said. [...] "And what nonsense have I been listening to! It's the governess at last." ...|$|R
60|$|Edward {{walked to}} the edge of the {{verandah}} and leaning over looked intently at the blue magic of the night. There was a slight smile on his face when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Bateman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wish {{it was my}} class, I'd {{like to see it}} out," [...] mused Tom. [...] "But never mind, I guess I'll {{hear about}} it later," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> campus, to wait for Sam.

60|$|Very white, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> balcony, {{and leaning}} on it, gazed {{down on the}} Square; the figures were still there {{looking up at the}} light with dull persistency, the policeman's face, too, upturned, and staring, but he saw nothing of them. Below, a {{carriage}} drew up, two figures got in, and drove away....|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little writing-room, {{scribbled}} a {{note and}} sent it down by the boots.
