5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, <b>double-layered</b> robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and {{slippers}} with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E

5|$|Pita {{bread is}} a <b>double-layered</b> flat or pocket bread {{traditional}} in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, {{or with a}} topping of sesame or nigella seeds or za'atar. Pita is used in multiple ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for scooping up hummus, eggplant and other dips. A lafa is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads. Jews from the former Soviet republic of Georgia make the flatbread, lavash.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the transition of the boundary layer adjacent to a sidewall of a differentially heated cavity to a <b>double-layer</b> structure and with the important flow and heat transfer features of the <b>double-layer</b> structure. The transition to the <b>double-layer</b> structure is examined by comparing numerical and experimental results. The mechanism responsible for the formation of the <b>double-layer</b> structure, i. e. the stratification of the fluid in the core, is discussed. Detailed discussion of the energy balance adjacent to the sidewall reveals that the heat transfer in the <b>double-layer</b> structure is rather complex.

25|$|The {{source of}} {{luminescence}} is symbiotic bacteria that dwell {{in and around}} the esca. In some species, the bacteria recruited to the esca are incapable of luminescence independent of the anglerfish, suggesting they have developed a symbiotic relationship and the bacteria are unable to synthesize all of the chemicals necessary for luminescence on their own. They depend on the fish to make up the difference. Electron microscopy of these bacteria in some species reveals they are Gram-negative rods that lack capsules, spores, or flagella. They have <b>double-layered</b> cell walls and mesosomes. A pore connects the esca with the seawater, which enables the removal of dead bacteria and cellular waste, and allows the pH and tonicity of the culture medium to remain constant. This, as well as the constant temperature of the bathypelagic zone inhabited by these fish, is crucial for the long-term viability of bacterial cultures.|$|E
25|$|Face {{protection}} is mentioned {{at least three}} times in the literature of the Komnenian period, and probably indicates face-covering mail, leaving only the eyes visible. This would accord with accounts of such protection in earlier military writings, which describe <b>double-layered</b> mail covering the face, and later illustrations. Such a complete camail could be raised off the face by hooking up the mail to studs on the brow of the helmet. However, the remains of metal ‘face-mask’ anthropomorphic visors were discovered {{at the site of the}} Great Palace of Constantinople in association with a coin of Manuel I Komnenos. Such masks were found on some ancient Roman helmets and on contemporary helmets found in grave sites associated with Kipchak Turks from the North Pontic Steppe. The existence of these masks could indicate that the references to face-protection in Byzantine literature describe the use of this type of solid visor.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>double-layer</b> Trombe wall assisted by a temperature-controlled direct current (DC) fan. THERB for HAM, a dynamic thermal load calculation software, {{was used to}} estimate the heating ability of a <b>double-layer</b> Trombe wall for an office building. We designed a new <b>double-layer</b> Trombe wall that has two ventilated air cavities installed on the south facade of the office building, and a pipe with a temperature-controlled DC fan used to control thermo-circulation. The office building was located in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan. The temperature of the ventilated air cavity of the <b>double-layer</b> Trombe wall and the indoor temperature were simulated. It was more efficient for the DC fan to start when the ventilated air cavity temperature was 19 °C and the operative temperature of indoor was maintained at 20 °C. The {{results showed that the}} <b>double-layer</b> Trombe wall with a temperature-controlled DC fan can reduce yearly heating needs by nearly 0. 6 kWh/m 3 and improve the performance of a <b>double-layer</b> Trombe wall up to 5. 6 % (22. 7 % in November, 8. 56 % in December, 1. 04 % in January, 3. 77 % in February, and 3. 89 % in March), compared to the <b>double-layer</b> Trombe wall without an air supply. The ventilated (all day) <b>double-layer</b> Trombe wall performed better than the unventilated <b>double-layer</b> Trombe wall in November, December, February, and March. Thus, the potential of a <b>double-layer</b> Trombe wall can be improved with the assistance of a temperature-controlled DC fan...|$|R
25|$|When nests {{are also}} found built among the {{branches}} of various trees, {{the architecture of the}} nest is changed because of the substrate to which it has to attach. The most noticeable difference is that R. romandi nests connected to branches are sphericsl rather than hemispherical and mostly <b>double-layered,</b> with only a few single-layered sections. The envelope is not a gray color, but instead a creamy brown, suggesting differences in the plants available to construct the nest. The saliva coating of the envelope is thicker when built in trees, suggesting that the thickness of the coat might be related to the rain exposure of the nest location. Instead of a roof, the nests often use leaves from the tree, incorporated into the envelope, to cover the top of the nest. The number of combs in a branch-built nest is almost double that of one built on a solid surface, however they are much more irregular in shape and arrangement.|$|E
25|$|Scallops have a {{large number}} (10–100) of small (about 1mm) eyes {{arranged}} {{along the edge of}} their mantle. These eyes represent a particular innovation among molluscs, relying on a concave, parabolic mirror of guanine crystals to focus and retro-reflect light instead of a lens as found in many other eye types. Additionally, their eyes possess a <b>double-layered</b> retina, the outer retina responding most strongly to light and the inner to abrupt darkness. While these eyes are unable to resolve shapes with high fidelity, the combined sensitivity of both retinas to light entering the eye and light retro-reflected from the mirror grants scallops exceptional contrast definition as well as the ability to detect changing patterns of light and motion. Scallops primarily rely on their eyes as an 'early-warning' threat detection system, scanning around them for movement and shadows which could potentially indicate predators. Additionally, some scallops alter their swimming or feeding behavior based on the turbidity or clarity of the water, by detecting the movement of particulate matter in the water column.|$|E
25|$|Steam was {{collected}} inside a dome {{on top of}} the top chamber, and in the Reed boiler all but the dome and the ends of the three water chambers was enclosed in a <b>double-layered</b> casing with an air gap and asbestos lining that reduced the temperature of the outer layer. The casing rose at the top to form an outlet for hot gases into a funnel. The furnace was fed with coal by stokers through firebox doors at one end, and, whereas the Normand boiler required a fire of about 18inches (460mm) depth, the Reed boiler required a shallower one of between 8and 12inches (200–300mm). Air for the furnace passed through the air gap in the boiler casing, thus providing a supply of heated air that was directed {{to the rear of the}} ashpan. This admitted air through three doors that closed automatically if a tube failed, the intention being to prevent flames, steam and debris escaping into the boiler room. A constant supply of pure water was essential for this type of boiler, as a shortage of water would rapidly result in an empty boiler liable to severe damage from the furnace, and the deposition of any contaminant, such as limescale, would result in a significant loss of efficiency and could block tubes. Each boiler had its own feedwater pump, and a feedwater regulator also of Reed's design.|$|E

In 423, a defence line over 2,000 li (...) long was built to resist the Rouran; its path roughly followed the old Zhao wall from Chicheng County in Hebei Province to Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia. In 446, 100,000 men were put to work building an inner wall from Yanqing, passing south of the Wei capital Pingcheng, and ending up near Pingguan on the eastern bank of the Yellow River. The two walls formed the basis of the <b>double-layered</b> Xuanfu–Datong wall system that protected Beijing a thousand years later during the Ming dynasty.|$|E
