A feverish indisposition {{which had}} been hanging about him for some time, {{the result of a}} chill caught the {{previous}} winter, seemed to acquire virulence with the prostration of his hopes. But not a soul knew of his languor, and he did not think the case serious enough to send for a medical man. After a few days he was better again, and crept about his home in a great coat, attending to his simple wants as usual with his own hands. So matters stood when the limpid <b>inertion</b> of Grace's pool-like existence was disturbed as by a geyser. She received a letter from Fitzpiers.|$|E

The current results in heating(cooling) at first(second) sample contact due to Peltier effect. The contacts temperatures are different. The measured voltage {{is the sum of}} the ohmic voltage swing and Peltier effect induced termopower which is linear on current. As a result, the thermal correction to resistance measured exists at I→ 0. The correction should be in comparison with ohmic resistance.

40|$|Founded {{at the end}} of 1842, La Belgique Judiciaire {{lasted until}} 1939 and {{therefore}} was the first successful legal periodical in Belgium. Twelve years after Belgium’s independence and despite the constitutional pledge to change them as soon as possible, the Napoleonic codes were still in force. This situation was discussed in the Brussels courts where four young liberal attorneys decided to publish a new periodical providing articles in which every jurist could offer a solution for the juridical <b>inertion.</b> The legal practitioner also benefited from this initiative: the most important Belgian case law was published, even from the lower courts which was at that time a novelty. Next to that, interesting news about the legal world had a place in the magazine. The changes in legislation combined with a lack of renewal in the rigid editorial board and the possibility to buy alternative publications, led almost inevitably {{to the end of the}} review, a monument in the Belgian legal world...|$|E
40|$|Large vessels {{containing}} electrostatically charged flammable mists or dust clouds {{form part}} of many industrial processes. Consequently, high internal space potentials and electric fields are possible, promoting electrostatic discharges. The risk of ignition is often addressed by nitrogen <b>inertion</b> or by adding explosion protection systems. A preferred cost-effective alternative is to analyse the process {{with the aim of}} determining the maximum electric field that can be generated inside the vessel, for comparison with breakdown strength of air at which electrostatic discharges can occur. This field can seldom be measured directly. It can, however, be determined by performing simple measurements of the charge concentration and vessel dimensions to model the electrostatic conditions using a finite element, field analysis package. The package has been routinely used in hazard analyses by Wolfson Electrostatics, allowing the potential distributions and electric fields inside vessels to be displayed, using interactive graphics, as contour lines, vectors or graphs. Two hazard investigations in which the package was used are described in this paper...|$|E

The aim is to develop the methods for evaluation of the complexity rate characteristics in the chaotic oscillations {{according to the data}} of the finite length and finite accuracy. The methodology for evaluation of the complexity rate in the oscillations represented with time realizations of the finite length and limited accuracy the base of which are the procedure on the restoration of the attractors and calculation of their dimensionality {{as a function of the}} spatial observation scale has been developed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the optimization problem for the bilinear system x ̇ = {x, ω} (1) based on the well-known method of continuous parametric group reconstruction using of its structure constants defined by the Brockett equation z ̇ = {z, ω}. (2) Here x is the system state vector, {·, ·} are the Lie brackets, z = {x, y}, y is the vector of cojoint variables, ω = A− 1 z is the control vector, A is the <b>inertion</b> matrix. The quadratic control functional has to reach an extremum at the optimal solution of the equation (2) and the boundary optimization problem is to find such z 0 that solution (2) makes evolution from the state x(t 0) = x 0 up to the final state x(t 1) = x 1 during the time delay T = t 1 − t 0. Therefore it is necessary to define a transformation group of the state space which is parametrized by components of the vector and then to solve the Cauchy problem for an arbitrary smooth curve joining x(t 0) with x(t 0) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{determines the}} {{flammability}} properties of two hydrocarbon blends, {{natural gas and}} propane-butane refrigerant, mixed with CF 3 I and C 3 F 7 H inerting agents. Four flammability envelopes are obtained allowing {{the determination of the}} minimum inerting concentrations and the maximum hydrocarbon to suppressant weight ratios for formulating non-flammable hydrocarbon refrigerants. These ratios are calculated from the slopes of lines drawn from the origin and tangent to the lower branches of the flammability envelopes. The flammability measurements are conducted using a tubular flow burner. The apparatus is convenient to operate, yields reproducible results without repetitive testing necessitated by explosion vessels. More importantly, the tubular flow burner applies a clear criterion for extinction avoiding the innate problems of the explosion vessels, which relate to the strength of the ignition source and the vessel size. The results indicate that it is not possible, using CF 3 I or C 3 F 7 H, to formulate a refrigerant mixture with a substantial hydrocarbon content. Specifically, <b>inertion</b> of the propane-butane blend considered in this study demands 87. 7 % and 94. 2 % by weight of CF 3 I and C 3 F 7 H, respectively. CF 3 I displays similar inerting properties to those of CF 3 Br. The higher inerting requirement for C 3 F 7 H stems from the nature of this agent to decrease the lower flammability limit of the hydrocarbon blends...|$|E
40|$|The author’s {{starting}} point is his wish to define as precisely as possible the idea of mannerism {{for the purpose of}} its application in analysis as well as in synthesis of art history, thus rendering it serviceable in historical (scientific) seanse. The author considers that this idea enters into the wide province of cultural history, and even anthropology, only through a correct historization. The idea really was a factor of smashing conventions since the time of Dvořak and the polemic between Pevsner and Weissbach. The process of generalization was completed (and has even exceeded the limits) by the establishment of the idea in the sociological provinces by Hanser and in the literary and cultural historical ones. So has mannerism been looked upon as a spiritual-historical category, as an expressive aura of a definite time, lying between the Renaissance and Baroque, and not only of that period – here is where the questionableness of the suggestion begins – but, {{following in the footsteps of}} Curtius, as a constant, respectively as an alternating alternative of the classic period, as Urgebärde, as a great and wide space of the »spiritual-problematic position«, extending mostly after, but also before and during the classic period. One can, however, use that idea very carefully, and, only metaphorically, outside its historical time, as proposed by some reasearchers: always the art upsets the established balance between the subject and object, between the creative imagination and nature, conveying the centre of gravity to an »inside image«. The exxential pre-suppositions for the historical appearance of mannerism are the following: 1) a stylistically defined {{starting point}} and the attained secure balance, and, 2) the existence of morphologic <b>inertion.</b> The latter is an epigonous extension of the classic period, in academic mannerism, a phenomenon of no small significance, but without the style = creative strength (Stilbildende Kraft). The morphological <b>inertion,</b> after all, is the aspiration of the realized beauty, formed in a stylistic category, to continue living and to revive – a natural wish of a reached ideal to survive. The significance of that <b>inertion</b> depends, naturally, on several heterogeneous factors, but also on the level of the achieved humaneness in the foregoing period, on the entirety of disalienation in him – but I should rather say on the realized historical degree. Collisions and crossbreedings generate new hybrids (syncretisms) and all the unperceivable wealth of our cultural horizon we owe just to that radiancew that lasts, traversing the limits. Mannerism is its creative alternation, a derived secondary art, intimately tied to Renaissance (with a classical balance on its top), while Baroque is its categorical negation: a new departure from nature and observation. Mannerism is, in reality, a pseudomorphous classic style – one should, perhaps, apologize for reviving this forgotten Spenglerian term, and throw some light upon the imposing thought, allusive and imperfect, of course, like all interdisciplinarian comparisons. That time, though, was not only the time of Reformation and Counter-reformation, but also of a new elevation of mind, research, empirism and phylosophy, so that the great forms of the classical Renaissance were filled by new contents by questions and suggestions, by a new experience of life and ancient myths. The creative subject has also undergone a change, as has the man who now faces the work. As in the world of minerals, in which the composition and the essence of crystals experience sometimes a complete change, but the formal crystallization remains the same, so has in our case the morphology essentially remained the same, classical (or, more exactly, clasicistic), but executed in a sense of the most sensual musical line (from Parmigianino and Primatieco to Spranger) or El Greco’s linear and chromatic spiritualization, etc. The spatial extension of the style particularly leads to changes of contents (experience). It often leads to a collision of styles, that is to syntheretism, as in the case of the Flemish »Romanesque« artists, and that dialectic play of styles is something quite different from morphological inversion and certainly much more stimulative, although neither in the former nor in the latter case must necessarily arrive at the pseudomorphous classic style. This pre-supposes a solid morphological background and its continuity. In other words: the essential reference of each secondary style consists in its original morphological layer and in the inherited form from which it starts and which should be present in the new visual structure. The style too, naturally, changes with the pseudomorphosis, taking on new ideas and sensitiveness, and even iconography; acording to itd meaning it may also be transformed into its opposite. Under syncretism we understand a stylistic manifestation in which the expressive qualities still bear visible characteristics of heterogeneous origin and a different morphology. A morphologic structure is laid on another and different one, this resulting in bizzare symbioses, often very fertile and apt for new »accelerations«. No schematism are, however, necessary in that immense number of systems of coordinates and inter-combinations, of development processes, contributing to the »marvelousness of the world«. The modern theory has, with much justification, found a difference between the classical period and the anti-Renaissance, and between the anti-Renaissance and mannerism (C. Battisti). By engaging in exemplification of these theses, the author had the possibility to touch only tangentially the characteristic phenomena of the European 16 th century, and has tried to do that with regard to their essential characteristics, constantly avoiding categorical conclusions, but always insisting on historical definition and the use of terms...|$|E
40|$|The article gives {{a survey}} of economy and {{management}} theories {{from the point of}} view of a lack in adapting abilities of enterprises. First of all, this problem does manifest itself in: lack of compatibility between particular parts of an enterprise, faulty or tardy recognition of exigences that surround a given business subject in its operations, or - finally - in inadequate or ineffective activity aimed at correction of misfunctionning. The cause o f such troubles looks differently in view o f various theories. For instance, a disparity in access to information is being stressed (conf. : F. H. Knight’s profit theory) : it can be a source of a rise or of a crash of an enterprise. Lack of adaptability can also be a result of bad allocation of own transactions of an enterprise (theory of transactions costs), of internal interests conflict (behavioural theories), or - of structural <b>inertion</b> of a given subject (theories of populations’ ecology). The expected answer to such an inadaptability should be a shift operated in activity of the enterprise. Depending on the kind o f problem experienced by the organisation, its repair programme can be a form of operational or strategic shift. Post-socialistic enterprises do experience quite particular kind of inadaptability. Thoroughly changed real conditions make many of them forced to operate a shift of compound character where a need exist to make their domain more attractive and, in the same time, to render the potential used in a more flexible and effective way. As far as effective operating of changes in an enterprise, not only post-socialistic one, is concerned — the ways of managing a shift as shown in the article can be helpful, as well as theories of crisis management and, finally, instructions given by researchers from the “excellence literature” trend...|$|E
