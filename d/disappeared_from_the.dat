5|$|The {{species has}} {{generally}} fared badly with human {{change to the}} landscape. Once common on the Cumberland Plain in Sydney's western suburbs, it has now almost <b>disappeared</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sydney Basin. It has also <b>disappeared</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of Rockhampton in Queensland, and declined on Rottnest Island, and in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. Field studies in small patches of remnant vegetation indicate reduced survival rates there.|$|E

Some sections have been converted to concrete channels; others run through landscaped private gardens and some run in underground pipes. Much of the original vegetation has <b>disappeared</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> creeks, particularly those closest to the city. Introduced species including Olives, bamboo, boxthorn, watsonia and blackberries have displaced native flora.|$|E

5|$|In the 1810s and 1820s, greater {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, <b>disappeared</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy in the 1850s after the development of wrought-iron-jacketed steel cannon by William Armstrong and Joseph Whitworth. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had <b>disappeared</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> landscape.|$|E
5|$|After {{a number}} of failed marriages {{throughout}} the 40s, she {{spent much of the}} remainder of her life at the court of her brother Herod Agrippa II, amidst rumors the two were carrying on an incestuous relationship. During the First Jewish-Roman War, she began a love affair with the future emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus. However, her unpopularity among the Romans compelled Titus to dismiss her on his accession as emperor in 79.

5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave.

One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E

After the beginning of 1955, Thrilling Wonder was merged with Startling, which itself ceased publication at the end of 1955.|$|E
