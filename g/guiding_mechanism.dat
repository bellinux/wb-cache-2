During 2006-2011, Indonesia had carried out 26 programs within the framework of the NAASP , such as the NAASP-UNEP Workshop on Environmental Law and Policy held in 2006, Asian African Forum on Genetic Resources, Traditional Knowledge, and Folklore in 2007, and Apprenticeship Program for Mozambican Farmers in 2010. In addition, Indonesia hosted the NAASP Ministerial Conference on Capacity Building for Palestine in 2008 in which 218 participants from 56 countries and 3 international organizations took part. Commitment to the development of the NAASP has also been shared by other NAASP countries. Just to mention a few, Malaysia conducted Training Course for Diplomats in 2007 and Training Course in Disaster Management in 2008 while China held the 5th Training Program for Staff from African Chambers in 2009 and the China-Zambia Trade and Investment Forum in 2010. With a view to providing recommendations for a future NAASP summit, The NAASP Senior Officials’ Meeting (SOM) was held in Jakarta on 12-13 October 2009. The meeting discussed particularly the proposal for the 8 Focus Areas of Cooperation which was aimed to be the <b>guiding</b> <b>mechanism</b> for directing and focusing cooperation initiatives previously formulated in the 2005 Asian African Summit, into feasible and result-oriented programs. The 8 focus areas of cooperation are Counter Terrorism, Combating Trans-national Organized Crime, Food Security, Energy Security, Small and Medium Enterprises, Tourism, Asian African Development University Network, and Gender Equality and Women Empowerment. A number of Asian countries, such as Bangladesh, China, Japan, Filipina, and Thailand, have demonstrated their willingness to be the Champion Countries in the aforesaid areas of cooperation concurrent with their counterparts from African countries. Meanwhile, Indonesia is the Champion Country from the Asian region, along with Algeria from the African region for the counter-terrorism area of cooperation.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to generate the knowledge required to adapt macro- and microscale compliant mechanism theory to design carbon nanotube-based nano-scale compliant mechanisms. Molecular simulations of a nano-scale parallel <b>guiding</b> <b>mechanism</b> uncovered three regions of behavior. Region I is governed by the bulk deformation of the carbon nanotubes. Region II is characterized by hinge-like flexing of four "kinks" that occur due to buckling of the carbon nanotube walls. Region III, an intermediate region, exhibits direction dependant behavior. We report on the ability of a conventional compliant mechanism modeling approach, the pseudo-rigid-body model, to predict the region I behavior of a nano-scale parallel <b>guiding</b> <b>mechanism</b> that uses single-walled (5, 5) carbon nanotubes as the flexural elements. Van der Waals forces were found to affect the kinematic and elastomechanic behavior of the nano-scale parallel <b>guiding</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A modified value of the pseudo-rigid-body model stiffness coefficient is presented to capture the affect of van der Waals interactions within (5, 5) nanotubes during region I operation. (cont.) Molecular simulation of region I behaviors match the modified pseudo-rigid-body model predictions of (1) kinematic behavior with less than 7. 3 % error and (2) elastomechanic behavior with less than 8 % error.
