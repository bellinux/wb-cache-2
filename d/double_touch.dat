60|$|June 11.--Bad {{dreams about}} poor Charlotte. Woke, {{thinking}} my old and inseparable friend beside me; {{and it was}} only when I was fully awake that I could persuade myself that she was dark, low, and distant, and that my bed was widowed. I believe the phenomena of dreaming are in a great measure occasioned by the <b>double</b> <b>touch,</b> which takes place when one hand is crossed in sleep upon another. Each gives and receives the impression of touch to and from the other, and this complicated sensation our sleeping fancy ascribes to the agency of another being, when it is in fact produced by our own limbs acting on each other. Well, here goes--incumbite remis.|$|E
60|$|I {{have been}} seduced into a dry {{discussion}} where I had intended {{only a few}} amusing facts, in proof, that the mind makes the sense {{far more than the}} senses make the mind. If I have life, and health, and leisure, I purpose to compile from the works, memoirs, and transactions of the different philosophical societies in Europe, from magazines, and the rich store of medical and psychological publications, furnished by the English, French, and German press, all the essays and cases that relate to the human faculties under unusual circumstances, (for pathology is the crucible of physiology), excluding such only as are not intelligible without the symbols or terminology of science. These I would arrange under the different senses and powers: as the eye, the ear, the touch, &c.; the imitative power, voluntary and automatic; the imagination, or shaping and modifying power; the fancy or the aggregative and associative power; the understanding, or the regulative, substantiating, and realizing power; the speculative reason, 'vis theoretica et scientifica', or the power, by which we produce, or aim to produce, unity, necessity, and a universality in all our knowledge by means of principles, [2]'a priori'; the will or practical reason; the faculty of choice, ('Willkühr'), and (distinct both from the moral will, and the choice), the sensation of volition which I have found reason to include under the head of single and <b>double</b> <b>touch.</b>|$|E
60|$|It is a general, but, as {{it appears}} to me, a mistaken opinion, that in our {{ordinary}} dreams we judge the objects to be real. I say our ordinary dreams;--because as to the night-mair the opinion is to a considerable extent just. But the night-mair is not a mere dream, but takes place when the waking state of the brain is recommencing, and most often during a rapid alternation, a twinkling, as it were, of sleeping and waking;--while either from pressure on, or from some derangement in, the stomach or other digestive organs acting on the external skin (which is still in sympathy with the stomach and bowels,) and benumbing it, the sensations sent up to the brain by <b>double</b> <b>touch</b> (that is, when my own hand touches my side or breast,) are so faint as to be merely equivalent to the sensation given by single touch, as when another person's hand touches me. The mind, therefore, which at all times, with and without our distinct consciousness, seeks for, and assumes, some outward cause for every impression from without, and which in sleep, by aid of the imaginative faculty, converts its judgments respecting the cause into a personal image as being the cause,--the mind, I say, in this case, deceived by past experience, attributes the painful sensation received to a correspondent agent,--an assassin, for instance, stabbing at the side, or a goblin sitting on the breast. Add too that the impressions of the bed, curtains, room, &c. received by the eyes in the half-moments of their opening, blend with, and give vividness and appropriate distance to, the dream image which returns when they close again; and thus we unite the actual perceptions, or their immediate reliques, with the phantoms of the inward sense; and in this manner so confound the half-waking, half-sleeping, reasoning power, that we actually do pass a positive judgment on {{the reality of what}} we see and hear, though often accompanied by doubt and self-questioning, which, as I have myself experienced, will at times become strong enough, even before we awake, to convince us that it is what it is--namely, the night-mair.|$|E

40|$|We {{postulate}} {{the existence}} of a natural Poissonian marking of the <b>double</b> (<b>touching)</b> points of SLE 6 and hence of the related continuum nonsimple loop process that describes macroscopic cluster boundaries in 2 D critical percolation. We explain how these marked loops should yield continuum versions of near-critical percolation, dynamical percolation, minimal spanning trees and related plane filling curves, and invasion percolation. We show that this yields for some of the continuum objects a conformal covariance property that generalizes the conformal invariance of critical systems. It is an open problem to rigorously construct the continuum objects and to prove that they are indeed the scaling limits of the corresponding lattice objects...|$|R

5000|$|The épée is a {{thrusting}} weapon {{like the}} foil, but heavier, {{with a maximum}} total weight of 775 grams. In épée, the entire body is valid target. The hand guard on the épée is a large circle that extends towards the pommel, effectively covering the hand, which is a valid target in épée. Like foil, all hits must be with the tip and not {{the sides of the}} blade. Hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action). As the entire body is legal target, there is no concept of an off-target touch, except if the fencer accidentally strikes the floor, setting off the light and tone on the scoring apparatus. Unlike foil and sabre, épée does not use [...] "right of way", and awards simultaneous touches to both fencers. However, if the score is tied in a match at the last point and a <b>double</b> <b>touch</b> is scored, the point is null and void.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{version of}} wallball {{is that the}} ball is catchable {{off the wall and}} the {{catching}} player can move about freely as long as they throw the ball within the next few seconds. If the ball bounces very far away from the wall the other players may call [...] "challenge" [...] to the player with the ball. A call of challenge means the player may not move and must throw the ball and try to hit the wall. If the player chooses to drop the ball at his/her feet then the player is automatically out. The thrower, however, may choose to simply throw it at an object that would cause the ball to be hard to get before the thrower can be thrown out, possibly causing a successive number of challenges until a suitable throw has been made. If a player catches the ball they may run to the wall and place both their off hand and foot on the wall and call [...] "bulldog." [...] If the player does this they can freely throw the ball at whomever they wish. If they hit another player then the hit player must touch the wall before they are thrown out. [...] "Bulldogs" [...] are usually frowned upon by other players and considered a cheap way of getting other players out. If a player has committed a <b>double</b> <b>touch</b> another player may call the foul and is allowed a throw at the person. The offending player must be [...] "spread eagle" [...] as it is called, against the wall and may not move. The thrower is not allow a full force throw unless the person moves or flinches as it is usually taken from a short distance. This can either result in a peg or a double throw depending on the rules. If the thrower makes a full force throw without the offender moving then the thrower must be pegged by the original offender. In some games the thrower on [...] "spread eagle" [...] must touch the wall or they too will be out, unless they missed and hit the wall.|$|E
40|$|A right-brain damaged {{patient with}} pure tactile {{extinction}} {{was asked to}} report series of single or double light, brief touches delivered to both hands, the thumb or the pinkie of a single hand, the sides of a single index. The stimulated hand was positioned palm up or palm down, in front of or behind the patient, in anatomic or crossed position. In <b>double</b> <b>touch</b> conditions, stimuli coded as left-sided were extinguished not only when delivered to both hands, but also when delivered on a single hand or a single finger. The findings suggest that tactile stimuli may be coded as left or right according to multiple body anchors that are dynamically scaled from the corporeal midline, to axes centered on a single hand or finger.

5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>touching</b> of {{a forward}} pass is legal, but batting a pass towards the opponent's end zone is illegal. Previously, a second {{offensive}} player could not legally catch a deflected pass unless a defensive player had touched it. This is usually {{referred to as}} the [...] "Mel Renfro Rule". During a play in Super Bowl V, Baltimore Colts receiver Eddie Hinton tipped a pass intended for him. Renfro, the Cowboys defensive back, made a stab at the ball and it was ruled that he tipped it ever so slightly (which he denied) into the arms of Colts tight end John Mackey, who ran for a touchdown. Later, this rule was also the one in question during the Immaculate Reception in 1972. But despite these two incidents, the rule change did not occur until this season.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{geometry}} of scaling limits of near-critical 2 D percolation, i. e., for p = pc + λδ 1 /ν, with ν = 4 / 3, as the lattice spacing δ → 0. Our proposed framework extends previous analyses for p = pc, based on SLE 6. It combines the continuum nonsimple loop process describing the full scaling limit at criticality with a Poissonian process for marking <b>double</b> (<b>touching)</b> points of that (critical) loop process. The double points are exactly the continuum limits of “macroscopically pivotal ” lattice sites and the marked ones are those that actually change state as λ varies. This structure is rich enough to yield a oneparameter family of near-critical loop processes and their associated connectivity probabilities as well as related processes describing, e. g., the scaling limit of 2 D minimal spanning trees...|$|R

Double-sided touch mode capacitive pressure sensor almost has the same character of the single sided one, which {{can be divided into}} four regions (normal region, transition region, linear region, saturation region). In the linear region, the diaphragm of the capacitive pressure sensor touches the substrate structure in operation range. The advantage of the double-sided capacitive pressure sensor of operation is near linear output characteristics, large over range pressure and robust structure. It has not only the advantage of the single sided one, but also higher sensitivity and more dependable without increasing the fabrication significantly, this is what really counts.

40|$|A {{screencast}} is {{a digital}} recording of computer screen output. The format is frequently used to demonstrate and teach {{the usage of}} software functions, and is then often accompanied by narrative audio. In order for a screencast to be considered effective in these cases, it is required that it clearly conveys the interaction between user and computer program. This is problematic {{in the case of}} gesture based user interfaces since input by touch gestures lack visual representation other than feedback from the user interface. Thus, from visual information only, it is hard for the audience to interpret which specific gesture, such as touch, long touch and <b>double</b> <b>touch,</b> is used for a specific program function. Instead they have to rely on the producer communicating the information in some other way. In this master’s thesis, a pictorial language with the purpose of visualizing touch gestures in screencasts is designed, since it could be a potential solution to the above dilemma. This is done by combining an autobiographical design method with external user evaluations. The research suggest that users interpret this type of visualizations as interface functions rather than physical touch gestures, and that some of the language’s design attributes are highly dependent on external factors. Thus, for the pictorial language to function as an effective tool in screencasts, it is needed for the producers using the tool to understand both its limitations as well as possibilities...|$|E
40|$|Changes in limb posture (such as {{crossing}} the hands) can impair people's performance in {{tasks such as}} those involving temporal order judgements, when one tactile stimulus is presented to either hand. This crossed hands deficit {{has been attributed to}} a conflict between externally and anatomically anchored reference systems when people localize tactile stimuli. Interestingly, however, the performance of congenitally blind adults {{does not seem to be}} affected by {{crossing the}} hands, suggesting a default use of an anatomically rather than an externally anchored reference system for tactile localization. In the present study, 12 congenitally blind and 12 sighted adults were instructed to attend to either the left or the right hand on a trial-by-trial basis in order to detect rare deviants (consisting of a <b>double</b> <b>touch)</b> at that hand, while ignoring both deviants at the other hand and frequent standard stimuli (consisting of a single touch) presented to either hand. Only the sighted participants performed less accurately when they crossed their hands. Concurrent electroencephalogram recordings revealed an early contralateral attention positivity, followed by an attention negativity in the sighted group when they adopted the uncrossed hands posture. For the crossed hand posture, only the attention negativity was observed with reduced amplitude in the sighted group. By contrast, the congenitally blind group displayed an event-related potential attention negativity that did not vary when the posture of their hands was changed. These results demonstrate that the default use of an external frame of reference for tactile localization seems to depend on developmental vision...|$|E

As numerical illustration we apply the method to the valuation of several barrier-type options (double barrier knockout option, American corridor and <b>double</b> no <b>touch)</b> under a number of different models, including a case with deterministic interest rates, and compare with Monte Carlo simulation results. In all cases we find tight bounds with short execution times. Theoretical convergence results are also provided. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} on patients with left tactile extinction {{has shown that}} crossing of hands, so that each hand is {{on the opposite side}} of the body midline relative to the other, improves detection of stimuli given to the left hand. Objectives: To study the influence of the spatial position of limbs on left tactile extinction, and its relations with left visual neglect. Methods: Normal participants and patients with right cerebral hemisphere damage and left tactile extinction were asked to detect single or <b>double</b> light <b>touch</b> stimuli applied to their cheeks, hands, or knees with their arm and legs either in anatomical or in crossed position, increasing the attentional load of the task. Results: In patients with left extinction, limb crossing caused a deterioration in performance for stimuli applied to right body parts, with only a tendency to an improvement in detection for left body parts (only two of 24 patients showed substantial (. 20 %) improvement in left extinction after limb crossing). After crossing, left limb detections of double stimuli decreased with increasing degrees of visual neglect. Conclusions: In conditions of high attentional load, limb crossing may impair tactile detection in most patients with left extinction, and particularly in those showing signs of left visual neglect. These result...|$|R
