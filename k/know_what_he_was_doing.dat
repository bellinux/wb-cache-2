500|$|On 20 January 1843, Daniel M'Naghten {{attempted}} to assassinate Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Approaching {{a man he}} believed to be Peel, M'Naghten fired into his back, in fact killing Edward Drummond, Peel's secretary. Immediately arrested, {{he was charged with}} murder and tried on 3 March 1843 at the Old Bailey. He was assisted in his defence by two solicitors, four barristers including Alexander Cockburn and nine medical experts, along with eight lay witnesses. Both sides agreed that M'Naghten was insane; the question was what constituted a valid legal defence of insanity. The judges decided that [...] "every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> was wrong", which was boiled down to [...] "did the defendant <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> and if so, that what he was doing was wrong?". This established the M'Naghten Rules, which remain the principal method of deciding insanity in English law.|$|E
500|$|A year later, Frusciante and {{his mother}} moved to Mar Vista, Los Angeles with his new {{stepfather}} who, he says, [...] "really supported me and {{made me feel good}} about being an artist." [...] Like many young people in the area, he became intimately involved in the L.A. punk rock scene. At nine he was infatuated with the Germs, wearing out several copies of their record (GI). By ten, he had taught himself how to play most of (GI)'s songs. He has stated that he did not really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> and that he would play every chord with a single-finger barre.|$|E
500|$|In June 1953, Hayward took {{command of}} the escort carrier [...] He confessed to the crew {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> and urged any crewman who felt he was doing {{something}} wrong to tell him so at once. At the end of the Korean War, the carrier was deployed at Inchon, where a baby was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. The baby was brought to an orphanage, and Hayward sent Point Cruzs chaplain in response to a request for assistance. The nun running the orphanage felt the blue-eyed baby would not be safe if he remained in Korea. Hayward is said to have told the chaplain: [...] "You are not to return to this vessel until you have procured that baby." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, never mind; I wish I knew it all," [...] {{answered}} another. [...] "I guess <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing." [...] And in this <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right; Theodore Roosevelt <b>knew</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{trying to}} accomplish.|$|R
500|$|California {{used the}} M'Naghten {{standard}} for sanity which held {{that for a}} defendant to [...] "establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of}} the committing of the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of mind, and not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it, that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> was wrong." [...] Kemper appeared to have known that the nature of his acts were wrong, and had also shown signs of malice aforethought. On November 1, Kemper took the stand. He testified that he killed the co-eds because he wanted them [...] "for myself, like possessions," [...] and attempted to convince the jury that he was insane based on the reasoning that his actions could only have been committed by someone with an aberrant mind.|$|E
500|$|Involuntary and {{pathological}} intoxication are affirmative defenses to all criminal offenses in New Jersey, {{but are not}} defenses to regulatory law {{and traffic}} law offenses that are considered strict liability violations (e.g. environmental regulations, DUI). Involuntary intoxication relates to cases where someone {{did not know that}} they had consumed alcohol (e.g. a spiked drink). Pathological intoxication is applicable where, for medical reasons, a person had an exaggerated response to alcohol. To be used as a defense, the person being charged must show that [...] "at the time of his conduct did not know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> was wrong." [...] Contracts made with an intoxicated person may be voided by courts if [...] "the defendant was so intoxicated" [...] that he or she [...] "could not realize and appreciate the nature and consequences of what defendant was doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Where the {{defendant}} {{is alleged to have}} been insane at the time of committing the offence, this issue can be raised in one of three ways; {{the defendant}} can claim he was insane, the defendant can raise a defence of Automatism where the judge decides it was instead insanity, or the defendant can raise a plea of diminished responsibility, where the judge or prosecution again show that insanity is more appropriate. Whatever the way in which a plea of insanity is reached, the same test is used each time, as laid out in the M'Naghten Rules; [...] "to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, {{at the time of the}} committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> was wrong".|$|E

2500|$|Harrison {{spent two}} years {{on and off the}} {{practice}} squad for the Steelers, being released three times, and also was briefly on the active roster {{towards the end of the}} 2002 season, playing only special teams. [...] Teammate and fellow linebacker, James Farrior, later told NFL Network that Harrison was so green early on in his career that he would simply [...] "give up" [...] on plays on which he was struggling and even would ask the coaches not to play him when he was struggling. Farrior said, [...] "He was a knucklehead that didn't know the plays. We'd be in practice, in training camp, and he might not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> so he'd just stop and throw his hands up and tell (the coaches) to get him out of there. We thought the guy was crazy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1949, {{the church}} was damaged in a fire set by an {{arsonist}} described by the Los Angeles Times as a [...] "wild-eyed" [...] and [...] "crazed 25-year-old UCLA art student". After setting the church on fire {{in the early morning}} hours, the arsonist, dressed in a well-cut flannel suit, {{stood in the middle of}} the church parking lot screaming, [...] "The church is afire. Let her burn. [...] Let her burn." [...] When the pastor and staff tried to extinguish the fire, the arsonist tried to block their passage, struck a staff member in the face, and threw a statue at the fire. [...] The fire caused $5,000 in damages, and the following day, Father Murray said mass in the church and urged forgiveness for the young man who had set the fire: [...] "Let us pray for the poor boy who didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> [...] Let us pray that Almighty God may give him back his health." ...|$|E
2500|$|Percussionist Emil Richards {{recalled}} {{that he did}} not know who Zappa was and did not take him seriously as the recording sessions began, believing that Zappa was merely the guitarist for a rock band. However, upon meeting them, Zappa handed the musicians the scores for the pieces, which were dense, complex and varied in time signatures. Richards' close friend, guitarist Tommy Tedesco, was another member of the recording sessions. Tedesco mocked Zappa, believing that Zappa did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> The bassoonist and bass clarinetist hired for the sessions refused to perform their parts, declaring them impossible to play. Zappa responded, [...] "If I play your part, will you at least try it?" [...] Zappa then played the notes for the musicians, who agreed to perform their assigned parts. By the end of the recording sessions, Richards and Tedesco became convinced of Zappa's talent, and became friends with the composer. Richards later performed on sessions which appeared on Zappa's album Orchestral Favorites.|$|E
