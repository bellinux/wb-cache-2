40|$|Electrostatic {{phenomena}} are {{pervasive in}} powder <b>handling</b> <b>processes.</b> In this study, contact electrification and electrostatic interactions during powder <b>handling</b> <b>processes</b> are explored using the discrete element method coupled with {{computational fluid dynamics}} (DEM-CFD), in which contact electrification and electrostatic interaction models are developed and implemented. The effects of particle shape on contact electrification are also investigated, for which multi-sphere methods are adapted and implemented into the DEM-CFD. The electrostatic and dynamic behaviours in various powder <b>handling</b> <b>processes</b> are analyzed, which include contact electrification of spherical particles during fluidization; electrostatic interactions during deposition of mono-charged and bi-charged particles; contact electrification and electrostatic interactions of spherical particles during fluidization; contact electrification of elongated particles in a vibrating container and particles of arbitrary shapes in a rotating drum. It is found that charge accumulation and distribution of particles are caused by contact electrification and dispersion of mono-charged particles and agglomeration of bi-charged particles are induced by electrostatic interactions. The combined effects of contact electrification and electrostatic interactions can alter the dynamic behaviours of particles {{and the performance of}} powder <b>handling</b> <b>processes.</b> Non-uniform charge distributions can be induced on particles of irregular shapes and the charge accumulation is also affected by particle shapes. ...|$|R

When column batch recirculating dryer is used, the moisture content variation problem is avoided, but the additional <b>handling</b> <b>process</b> may result in grain spoilage.|$|E

Indeed, the model for the commission has been recommended for introduction at the federal level in Australia.|$|E
