Next, the study deals with exhaust manifold’s materials and with present basic principles of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic. Then two parametric models were modelled in Solidworks software.

For second parametric model the collector was moved in horizontal direction, so this model is asymmetrical.

The preload of bolts {{can improve the}} fatigue strength <b>of</b> the <b>exhaust</b> component. In addition, the bolt pretension ensure the sealing in the maximum firing pressure. Using of simulation method, the displacement and deformation <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve component are analyzed when the maximum firing pressure and preload are applied. By analysis of the deformation <b>of</b> the <b>exhaust</b> valve housing under different preload force, the deformation <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve housing increase with the increaseing of preload. The maximum total deformation is 0. 40 mm in the preload of 720 KN. The maximum deformation occurs in the region near the bolt in the side <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas outlet.

A former analysis to the linkage control of the mechanical smoke exhaust system showed that the control <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> fans is safe and reliable with multiple redundant control. but the control security <b>of</b> <b>exhaust</b> ports in the large space buildings is very poor.

50|$|The {{magnitude}} <b>of</b> the <b>exhaust</b> scavenging {{effect is}} a direct function of the velocity of the high and medium pressure components <b>of</b> the <b>exhaust</b> pulse. Performance headers work to increase the exhaust velocity as much as possible. One technique is tuned-length primary tubes. This technique attempts to time the occurrence <b>of</b> each <b>exhaust</b> pulse, to occur {{one after the other}} in succession while still in the exhaust system. The lower pressure tail <b>of</b> an <b>exhaust</b> pulse then serves to create a greater pressure difference between the high pressure head <b>of</b> the next <b>exhaust</b> pulse, thus increasing the velocity <b>of</b> that <b>exhaust</b> pulse. In V6 and V8 engines where {{there is more than one}} exhaust bank, 'Y-pipes' and 'X-pipes' work on the same principle of using the low pressure component <b>of</b> an <b>exhaust</b> pulse to increase the velocity <b>of</b> the next <b>exhaust</b> pulse.|$|R

Exactly how blocking PD- 1 :PD-L interactions improves T cell immunity, however, remains unclear. PD- 1 :PD-L blockade could reprogram all exhausted T {{cells to}} become antiviral effectors. Alternatively, this blockade might selectively expand a subset <b>of</b> <b>exhausted</b> T cells. We have identified two subpopulations <b>of</b> <b>exhausted</b> CD 8 T cells during chronic viral infection in mice. One subset <b>of</b> <b>exhausted</b> CD 8 T cells is rescued by αPD-L 1 blockade, {{whereas the other}} subset appears more terminally differentiated and responds poorly to PD- 1 :PD-L blockade. Blocking PD- 1 :PD-L interactions reduces spontaneous apoptosis and enhances expansion and protective immunity of the rescuable subset, but not the more terminally differentiated subset <b>of</b> <b>exhausted</b> CD 8 T cells.
