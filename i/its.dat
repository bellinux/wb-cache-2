30|$|Intelligent Tutoring Systems (<b>ITSs)</b> with {{conversational}} dialogue form {{a special}} category of <b>ITSs.</b> The development of conversational <b>ITSs</b> such as DeepTutor {{is driven by}} explanation-based constructivist theories of learning and the collaborative constructive activities that occur during human tutoring (Rus et al. 2013). Conversational <b>ITSs</b> have several advantages over other types of <b>ITSs.</b> They encourage deep learning as {{students are required to}} explain their reasoning and reflect on their basic approach to solving a problem. Such conceptual reasoning is more challenging and beneficial than mechanical application of mathematical formulas (Hestenes et al. 1992). Furthermore, conversational <b>ITSs</b> have the potential of giving students the opportunity to learn the language of scientists, an important goal in science literacy. A student associated with a more shallow understanding of a science topic uses more informal language as opposed to more scientific accounts (Mohan et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{functions}} of telomeres and, probably, of interstitial telomeric sequences (<b>ITSs)</b> {{are influenced by}} their chromatin structure and organization. Telomeres in higher eukaryotes fold into nucleosomes that are about 20 – 40  bp shorter than the nucleosomes associated with bulk chromatin. Although the functional relevance of this short nucleosomal organization remains unknown, {{it is believed that}} short nucleosomes should contribute to telomere function. Whereas telomeric nucleosomes have been widely studied in different organisms, very {{little is known about the}} nucleosomal organization of <b>ITSs.</b> Chinese hamster <b>ITSs</b> have been found to associate with short nucleosomes. However, we have found that Arabidopsis thaliana <b>ITSs</b> fold into nucleosomes that have a repeat length similar to bulk chromatin. We discuss how the primary sequence of telomeres and <b>ITSs</b> could influence their nucleosomal organization...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we focus on}} the role of ontologies in {{developing}} constraint-based tutors, a special class of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (<b>ITSs).</b> Domain models for <b>ITSs</b> are extremely difficult to develop, and therefore efforts devoted to automatic induction of the necessary knowledge are of critical importance for widening the real-world impact of <b>ITSs.</b> We conducted an initial study which showed that ontologies were useful for manual composition of domain models for constraint-based tutors, as they allow authors to reflect on their understanding of the domain and organize the domain model better. Starting from these encouraging results, we developed ASPIRE, an authoring system for constraint-based tutors, which automated many of the tasks in domain model generation and serves the produced <b>ITSs.</b> The domain ontology plays {{a central role in the}} authoring procedure deployed in ASPIRE. We present one of the <b>ITSs</b> produced in ASPIRE as well as the experiences of authors in using ASPIRE. 19 page(s...|$|R

To analyze their complexity, we introduce a modular technique which {{allows us to}} use existing tools for standard <b>ITSs</b> in order to infer complexity bounds for our generalized <b>ITSs.</b> The key idea of our technique is a summarization method {{that allows us to}} analyze components of the transition system independently.

40|$|Intelligent Tutoring Systems (<b>ITSs)</b> are {{educational}} systems that use artificial in-telligence techniques for representing the knowledge. <b>ITSs</b> design is often criti-cized {{for being a}} complex and challenging process. In this article, we propose a framework for the <b>ITSs</b> design using Case Based Reasoning (CBR) and Multi-agent systems (MAS). The major advantage of using CBR is to allow the intelli-gent system to propose smart and quick solutions to problems, even in complex domains, avoiding the time necessary to derive those solutions from scratch. The use of intelligent agents and MAS architectures supports the retrieval of similar students models and the adaptation of teaching strategies according to the stu-dent profile. We describe deeply how the combination of both technologies helps to simplify the design of new <b>ITSs</b> and personalize the e-learning process for each student...|$|R
40|$|Telomeres prevent {{chromosome}} fusions {{and degradation}} by exonucleases and are implicated in DNA repair, homologous recombination, chromosome pairing and segregation. All these functions of telomeres require {{the integrity of}} their chromatin structure, which has been traditionally considered as heterochromatic. In agreement with this idea, different studies have reported that telomeres associate with heterochromatic marks. However, these studies addressed simultaneously the chromatin structures of telomeres and subtelomeric regions or the chromatin structure of telomeres and Interstitial Telomeric Sequences (<b>ITSs).</b> The independent analysis of Arabidopsis telomeres, subtelomeric regions and <b>ITSs</b> has allowed the discovery of euchromatic telomeres. In Arabidopsis, whereas subtelomeric regions and <b>ITSs</b> associate with heterochromatic marks, telomeres exhibit euchromatic features. We think that this scenario {{could be found in}} other model systems if the chromatin organizations of telomeres, subtelomeric regions and <b>ITSs</b> are independently analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Telomeres are {{nucleoprotein}} complexes {{protecting the}} physical ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes and therefore helping {{to ensure their}} stability and integrity. Additionally, telomeric sequences can be localized in non-terminal regions of chromosomes, forming so-called interstitial telomeric sequences (<b>ITSs).</b> <b>ITSs</b> are traditionally considered to be relics of chromosomal rearrangements and thus very informative in {{the reconstruction of the}} evolutionary history of karyotype formation. We examined the distribution of the telomeric motifs (TTAGGG) n using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 30 species, representing 17 families of squamate reptiles, and compared them with the collected data from another 38 species from literature. Out of the 68 squamate species analyzed, 35 possess <b>ITSs</b> in pericentromeric regions, centromeric regions and/or within chromosome arms.
