2500|$|A common {{method of}} {{tampering}} on mechanical disk meters is to attach magnets {{to the outside}} of the meter. [...] Strong magnets saturate the magnetic fields in the meter so that the motor portion of a mechanical meter does not operate. [...] Lower power magnets can add to the drag resistance of the internal disk resistance magnets. [...] Magnets can also saturate current transformers or power-supply transformers in <b>electronic</b> <b>meters,</b> though countermeasures are common.|$|E
2500|$|In North America, it {{is common}} for {{electricity}} meters to plug into a standardised socket outdoors, {{on the side of a}} building. This allows the meter to be replaced without disturbing the wires to the socket, or the occupant of the building. Some sockets may have a bypass while the meter is removed for service. The amount of electricity used without being recorded during this small time is considered insignificant when compared to the inconvenience which might be caused to the customer by cutting off the electricity supply. [...] Most <b>electronic</b> <b>meters</b> in North America use a serial protocol, ANSI C12.18.|$|E

2500|$|Analog meters {{can measure}} {{voltage and current}} by using power from the test circuit, but require a {{supplementary}} internal voltage source for resistance testing, while <b>electronic</b> <b>meters</b> always require an internal power supply to run their internal circuitry. [...] Hand-held meters use batteries, while bench meters usually use mains power; either arrangement allows the meter to test devices. Testing often requires that the component under test be isolated from the circuit {{in which they are}} mounted, as otherwise stray or leakage current paths may distort measurements. [...] In some cases, the voltage from the multimeter may turn active devices on, distorting a measurement, or in extreme cases even damage an element in the circuit being investigated.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the company}} grew, it {{increased}} its fleet from 242 to 582 buses {{over the next}} decade. In 1949, it took over the Bandra Bus Company, which used to ply buses in the suburbs. In 1951, the electricity division switched over from direct current (DC) to the more efficient alternating current (AC). The company launched its services in the eastern suburbs in 1955. That year, the Undertaking and private operators went to court, with the BEST asking for a complete closure of the private companies. The case dragged on for four years before the Supreme Court of India granted the organisation a complete monopoly over bus services in the Greater Bombay area. In 1964, due to high operational costs and poor public support, its long-running tram services were terminated. The company achieved the status {{of being the first}} company in the country to issue computerised billing in 1974. In 1994, the company introduced <b>electronic</b> <b>meters,</b> in a move to replace the less accurate electric meters.|$|E
