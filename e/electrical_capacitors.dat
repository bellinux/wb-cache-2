METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 139 workers in a plant manufacturing <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitors,</b> the long-term exposure to HHPA and MHHPA was assessed through the quantification of TPPA using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Smoking and medical histories were obtained through questionnaires. Work-related symptoms of the eyes and airways were recorded. Specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E (radioallergosorbent test) and IgG (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were determined in serum. RESULTS: The mean level of the TPPA of HHPA was 840 fmol/ml and that of the TPPA of MHHPA was 1700 fmol/ml. There was no correlation between the TPPA of HHPA and the TPPA of MHHPA. Of all the workers, 19 % were found to be positive for specific IgE and 17 - 19 % for IgG. Positive associations were observed between HHPA exposure and specific IgE and IgG and between MHHPA exposure and specific IgG. Regarding work-related symptoms, 27 % of the workers had symptoms of the nose, 21 % had symptoms of the eyes, 11 % had symptoms of the lower airways, and 8 % had nose bleeding. There were significant exposure-response relationships for symptoms of the eyes and nose for HHPA exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that there is an exposure-response relationship for HHPA both with specific antibodies and with work-related symptoms and down to adduct levels of 40 fmol/ml plasma.

40|$|December 2013. A Dissertation Presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy in Biological Engineering. Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Shramik Sengupta. Vita. Despite {{advances}} in DNA based technologies and molecular methods, {{there are still}} several drawbacks to these methods and hence, {{there is a need}} for development of a new technology for microbial detection and quantification. We present here a novel method for detecting the presence of viable microorganisms in various suspensions ranging from bacterial growth media, to food substrates such as milk and apple juice, water and complex suspensions like blood along with their quantification and characterization. The underlying principle for our method of detection of microorganisms is based on the fact that in the presence of an AC electric field, the intact/viable bacterial cell membrane becomes polarized. This polarization leads to the buildup of charges across the intact membrane and hence, these viable microbial cells behave like <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitors.</b> An increase in the number of microorganisms due to proliferation thus results in a corresponding increase in the "bulk capacitance" of the suspension containing bacteria, due to an increase in the total amount of charge stored in the interior of a suspension. However, this increase cannot be directly measured since the capacitance of the solid-liquid interface ("double layer" which is usually ? 1000 X larger than the bulk capacitance) in effect "screens" the former. In the work presented here, we introduce a method that is able to discern such changes with high sensitivity and robustness. We also demonstrate the ability of our method to a) Monitor food quality/safety by detecting bacterial proliferation in "real world" liquid food samples like milk and apple juice b) Quantify the bacteria in a sample by estimating the MPN of the viable bacteria c) Detect presence of viable bacteria in blood for diagnosis of Sepsis d) Determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) and assay for bactericidal/bacteriostatic activity of various bacteria e) Extend the application to detect presence of other microorganisms such as yeast and mold.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to high-tech companies founded by Poles {{at the end of}} the 19 th century in the rural canton of Fribourg in Switzerland. The text is divided into two parts. In the first part, the author attempts to present the economic, social and political reality of Fribourg in a period of intense industrialization in the world and the formation of the liberal free market system. In this rapidly changing reality, the new Catholic-conservative authorities of the canton tried to lead to establishing of a comprehensive, but also different system of a “Christian republic”, whose aim was to achieve social justice consistent with the teachings of the Gospel. In order to complete the project, the cantonal government did not shy away from using the possibilities and measures offered by the contemporary world. Decision-makers, led by Georges Python, needed support from the society, who was aware of the changes. Due to this fact, it became necessary to establish a university capable of shaping new attitudes and views. However, the costs significantly exceeded the financial capabilities of the agricultural and relatively poor canton of Fribourg. In these less favourable circumstances, a conscious policy of industrialization was the way out of the deadlock. Newly created industrial institutions were to contribute to an increase of cash inflows to the canton and thus allow for the financing of the university, which would also become an intellectual foundation for the emerging industry. The activity of Polish scientists, which is the subject of the second part of the article, matched this philosophy perfectly. The Poles invited to cooperate with Python, i. e. Józef Wierusz-Kowalski, Ignacy Mościcki and Jan Modzelewski, created the foundations of the Faculty of Mathematical and Natural Sciences at the University of Fribourg. As members of the faculty, in addition to teaching, they conducted research into, among other things, nitric acid synthesis and construction of <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Convinced of the need to put their innovations into wide production, they financed and built the first experimental factories and, over time, led to the development of a nitric acid factory and a high-voltage capacitor factory on an industrial scale. Although after the First World War the commitment of the Poles stopped, the 30  years of academic research and experience clearly showed that a conscious cooperation of policy-makers and highly qualified scientific personnel can bring surprising and unexpected results...|$|E

40|$|Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are {{hazardous}} {{organic compounds}} {{best known for}} their use in transformers and <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitors</b> because of their non-combustibility and flexibility. Lesser known, but widespread, use in caulking, finishes, and paint is now coming to light because of health risks, particularly associated with their prevalence in schools. Humans can be exposed to PCBs in numerous ways: through deteriorating caulk that makes {{its way to the}} soil by rain run-off, by breathing contaminated air, or by dermal contact with the material. This thesis will give a brief introduction to the history of PCBs in building construction from about 1950 to 1980 before production, sale, and disposal was regulated through the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA). The TSCA was {{one of a group of}} acts passed in the 1970 ’s to improve the quality of the environment including the Clean Air Act, Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act. Although it will decrease the amount in the environment, proper removal of PCBs may have implications for historic buildings. Because PCBs often migrate into porous adjacent substrate, original materials may have to be abated as well. I was introduced to the topic of polychlorinated biphenyls during a summer internship when a client did not want to re-point within six inches of the windows on their historic building for fear of PCBs in the caulk. Partial re-pointing would have a detrimental effect on the appearance of the façade. This thesis will be illustrated with case studies of buildings containing PCBs and how they were managed. PCB abatement will continue to be a concern, especially in urban areas, because they are most commonly found in apartment buildings, schools, and larger office buildings. New York in particular has been examining PCB contamination in public schools. P. S. 199 in Manhattan, a 1963 building by noteworthy architect Edward Durell Stone is a prime example of New York City’s push to remove PCBs from public schools. The building was part of an initial PCB pilot study. A second case study is Westgate Dormitory at MIT where several brick courses contaminated with PCBs were removed. Case study three will focus on PCB migration in a concrete building on UMass Amherst’s campus. I will compare the techniques for abatement from the case studies to determine what parallels can be drawn. This thesis will give preservation instructions for buildings containing PCBs by providing a PCB abatement approach that is sensitive to the preservation of historic structures...|$|E
40|$|The Nevada Basin and Range (NVBR) {{study unit}} of the U. S. Geological Survey 2 ̆ 7 s National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program is {{investigating}} the status of, trends in, and factors affecting water quality in the Las Vegas area. A principal objective of the investigation is to assess the effects of urbanization {{on the quality of}} area water resources. Las Vegas Wash is the surface-water outlet for the Las Vegas area. The wash transports stormwater runoff, shallow ground-water discharge, and tertiary-treated sewage effluent from the Las Vegas area to Las Vegas Bay of Lake Mead on the Colorado River. Most of the flow—about 96 percent in 1993 —transported in the wash to Las Vegas Bay is treated effluent from city and county sewage-treatment facilities. Storm-water runoff, shallow ground-water discharge, and treated sewage effluent from Las Vegas and other urbanized areas in the valley have the potential to affect the water quality of Las Vegas Wash and Lake Mead. In 1992, NVBR personnel collected bottom-sediment samples from Las Vegas Wash upstream from the discharge of treated sewage effluent and Las Vegas Bay during a survey to determine if synthetic organic compounds (organochlorines and semivolutile industrial compounds) were present. Organochlorines (pesticides and industrial compounds), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH 2 ̆ 7 s), phthalales, and phenols were detected at one or both of these sites. Many of these compounds are persistent in the environment, are relatively insoluble in water, and strongly partition into sediment organic material and lipid tissues of organisms. Compounds referred to as organochlorines include chlorinated pesticides and their metabolites, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 2 ̆ 7 s), dioxins, and furans. PCB 2 ̆ 7 s have been used as plusticizers and hydraulic lubricants, in heat-transfer systems, and as dielectric fluids in <b>electrical</b> <b>capacitors</b> and transformers. Dioxins and furans were produced inadvertently during the manufacture of herbicides and PCB 2 ̆ 7 s, and are formed during municipal waste combustion; they are commonly discharged to surface waters in effluents from chemical manufacturing plants, leather tanneries, kraft-pulp mills, wood-processing plants, and sewage-treatment plants. PAH 2 ̆ 7 s originate from natural and human sources. They are produced mainly by high-temperature pyrolylic reactions such as municipal incineration or forest fires, but a few are produced commercially for use in mothballs, pesticides, fungicides, dyes, wetting agents, synthetic resins, cutting fluids, solvents, and lubricants. Phlhalates are used extensively as plaslicizers to manufacture products from polymers of vinyl chloride, propylene, ethylene, and styrene. Phenols are used in the production of phenolic resins, germicides, herbicides, fungicides, Pharmaceuticals, dyes, plastics, and explosives. Most phenols are not persistent and are highly soluble; however, highly chlorinated phenols are persistent and tend to partition into sediment organic matter and lipids of aquatic organisms. Interest in environmental contaminants that may affect endocrine systems of animals by causing hormone imbalance, commonly referred to as endocrine disruption, has grown during the past 40 years. A symposium on estrogen in the environment increased the debate about effects of environmental contaminants on endocrine systems. More recently, Colborn and Clement (1992) concluded that many synthetic organic compounds have the potential to disrupt the endocrine systems of animals, including humans; these compounds include organochlorines, PAH 2 ̆ 7 s, phthalates, and phenols. Recent studies have found evidence of endocrine disruption in fish from contaminated ecosystems. Fitzsimons (1990) reported lower sex-steroid hormone levels in male lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) of Lake Ontario compared with fish from less-polluted sites. Additionally, an inverse relation was found between 11 -ketotestosterone and contaminant body burdens in trout from three of the Great Lakes. Male and female white suckers (Catostomus rommersoni) and lake whitcfish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in the vicinity of pulp-mill effluent were found to have depressed gonadal sex-steroid hormones, delayed maturity, lowered reproductive capability, and reduced secondary sex characteristics. Other studies have measured vitellogenin to assess endocrine disruption. Vitellogenin is an estrogen-induced or dependent egg protein used in the production of egg yolk and normally synthesized by the livers of female egg-laying vertebrates. Male fish have the vitellogenin gene but it is normally suppressed; however, the gene can be activated by exposure to exogenous contaminants or xenoestrogens. Several recent field studies have documented vitellogenin synthesis in carp males from streams affected by sewage effluent. Histologic abnormalities in gonads offish with endocrine disruption can include multinuclear eggs or the presence of dark, bar-shaped structures in tubules of the testes. Necrosis in tissues of organs can be caused by exposure to a toxicant or a combination of toxicants. The potentially harmful effects that organochlorines and semivolatile industrial compounds can have on humans and aquatic wildlife prompted the National Park Service (NPS), which administers the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and the NVBR to begin a cooperative investigation to determine the occurrence and distribution of these compounds in Las Vegas Wash and Lake Mead. Concurrent assessments of the endocrine systems and histology of selected organs in carp (Cyprinus carpio) were made in cooperation with the National Biological Service (NBS), which on October 1, 1996, became part of the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Although the investigation is currently (1996) ongoing, data were collected in 1995 for Las Vegas Wash, Las Vegas Bay, and Callville Bay. Callville Bay, which is in a part of Lake Mead upstream from Las Vegas Bay, was sampled as a reference site for comparisons with Las Vegas Wash and Bay.
