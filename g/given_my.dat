Edward was grief-stricken. [...] "To lose our eldest son", he wrote, [...] "is one of those calamities one can never really get over". Edward told Queen Victoria, [...] " [...] have <b>given</b> <b>my</b> life for him, as I put no value on mine". Albert Victor was the second of Edward's {{children}} to die. In 1871, his youngest son, Alexander John, had died just 24 hours after being born. Edward had insisted on placing Alexander John in a coffin personally with [...] "the tears rolling down his cheeks".|$|E

[...] His younger brother Prince George wrote, [...] "how deeply I did love him; & I {{remember}} with pain nearly every hard word & little quarrel I ever had with him & I long to ask his forgiveness, but, alas, it is too late now!" [...] George took Albert Victor's place in the line of succession, eventually succeeding to the throne as George V in 1910. Drawn together during their shared period of mourning, Prince George later married Mary himself in 1893. She became queen on George's accession.|$|E

500|$|That evening, the 21st Division {{relieved}} the 38th Division {{who moved}} near Gommecourt and relieved the 48th (South Midland) Division. On 12 July, Watts {{returned to the}} 7th Division and Blackader assumed command of the 38th. The division had suffered 3,993 casualties during the six days it had fought on the Somme, with over 600 men killed. Although it had captured 400 prisoners and Mametz Wood (the largest wood on the Somme), {{paving the way for}} the assault on Bazentin Ridge, the reputation of the division had been further hindered by inaccuracies. The failure of the first attack harmed the division's reputation, as the comparably few casualties were seen as evidence of a lack of determination by the men. The 113th Brigade's commander, Brigadier-General Price-Davies, made things worse by reporting panic among the men and refusals of orders. Price-Davies later wrote: [...] "I may not have <b>given</b> <b>my</b> brigade full credit for what they did", but the damage had been done. The difficulty of wood fighting was not appreciated at the time, and Farr wrote that the reputation of the division suffered due to the repeated interference by Horne in matters best left to the divisional or brigade staff and his [...] "inexperience of battlefield command at this level".|$|E
500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have <b>given</b> <b>my</b> life in the struggle. If I have to lose my life, that is the way it will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E
