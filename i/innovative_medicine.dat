40|$|This book {{is devoted}} to <b>innovative</b> <b>medicine,</b> {{comprising}} {{the proceedings of the}} Uehara Memorial Foundation Symposium 2014. It remains extremely rare for the findings of basic research to be developed into clinical applications, and {{it takes a long time}} for the process to be achieved. The task of advancing the development of basic research into clinical reality lies with translational science, yet the field seems to struggle to find a way to move forward. To create innovative medical technology, many steps need to be taken: development and analysis of optimal animal models of human diseases, elucidation of genomic and epidemiological data, and establishment of “proof of concept”. There is also considerable demand for progress in drug research, new surgical procedures, and new clinical devices and equipment. While the original research target may be rare diseases, it is also important to apply those findings more broadly to common diseases. The book covers a wide range of topics and is organized into three complementary parts. The first part is basic research for <b>innovative</b> <b>medicine,</b> the second is translational research for <b>innovative</b> <b>medicine,</b> and the third is new technology for <b>innovative</b> <b>medicine.</b> This book helps to understand <b>innovative</b> <b>medicine</b> and to make progress in its realization...|$|E

40|$|Of Russia's 142 million citizens, {{fewer than}} 20 million are {{enrolled}} in outpatient drug coverage plans.

To match <b>innovative</b> <b>medicine</b> prices with their health benefits, in the long run, we suggest that Russia consider adopting value-based pricing, and in the short term, that it introduce direct price negotiations and price drugs according to reference countries that use health technology assessment. Although generic market shares are high, generic medicine prices are higher than they should be. We propose tenders at the manufacturer level for the pricing of high-selling generics, and free pricing for products with sufficient market competition.

40|$|Human {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (PSCs) exist in naive and primed states and provide important models to investigate the earliest stages of human development. Naive cells can be obtained through primed-to-naive resetting, {{but there are no}} reliable methods to prospectively isolate unmodified naive cells during this process. Here we report comprehensive profiling of cell surface proteins by flow cytometry in naive and primed human PSCs. Several naive-specific, but not primed-specific, proteins were also expressed by pluripotent cells in the human preimplantation embryo. The upregulation of naive-specific cell surface proteins during primed-to-naive resetting enabled the isolation and characterization of live naive cells and intermediate cell populations. This analysis revealed distinct transcriptional and X chromosome inactivation changes associated with the early and late stages of naive cell formation. Thus, identification of state-specific proteins provides a robust set of molecular markers to define the human PSC state and allows new insights into the molecular events leading to naive cell resetting.

DNA methylation is widely studied in the context of cancer. However, the rediscovery of 5 -hydroxymethylation of DNA adds a new layer of complexity to understanding the epigenetic basis of development and disease, including carcinogenesis. There have been significant advances in techniques for the detection of 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine and, with this, greater insight into the distribution, regulation and function of this mark, which are reviewed here. Better understanding of the associated pathways involved in regulation of, and by, 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine may give promise to new therapeutic targets. We discuss evidence to support the view of 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine as a unique and dynamic mark of cellular state. These 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine profiles may offer optimism for the development of diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Protein misfolding and {{aggregation}} {{is increasingly}} being {{recognized as a}} cause of disease. In Alzheimers disease the amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) misfolds into neurotoxic oligomers and assembles into amyloid fibrils. The Bri 2 protein associated with Familial British and Danish dementias contains a BRICHOS domain, which reduces A beta fibrillization as well as neurotoxicity in vitro and in a Drosophila model, but also rescues proteins from irreversible nonfibrillar aggregation. How these different activities are mediated is not known. Here we show that Bri 2 BRICHOS monomers potently prevent neuronal network toxicity of A beta, while dimers strongly suppress A beta fibril formation. The dimers assemble into high-molecular-weight oligomers with an apparent two-fold symmetry, which are efficient inhibitors of non-fibrillar protein aggregation. These results indicate that Bri 2 BRICHOS affects qualitatively different aspects of protein misfolding and toxicity via different quaternary structures, suggesting a means to generate molecular chaperone diversity.

The identification of rare events (such as those observed with initial rotavirus vaccine or suspected autoimmune complications) will require interrogation of large data sets and population-based research before application of systems vaccinology. The <b>Innovative</b> <b>Medicine</b> Initiative funded public-private project BIOVACSAFE is an initial attempt to systematically identify biomarkers of relatively common inflammatory events after adjuvanted immunization using human, animal, and population-based models. Discriminatory profiles or biomarkers are being identified, which require validation in large trials involving thousands of participants {{before they can be}} generalized. Ultimately, it is to be hoped that the knowledge gained from such initiatives will provide tools to the industry, academia, and regulators to select optimal noninflammatory but immunogenic and effective vaccine adjuvant combinations, thereby shortening product development cycles and identifying unsuitable vaccine candidates that would fail in expensive late stage development or postmarketing...|$|E
