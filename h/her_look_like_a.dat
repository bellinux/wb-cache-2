5|$|The Faraway Trees Dame Slap, {{who made}} regular use of {{corporal}} punishment, {{was changed to}} Dame Snap who no longer did so, {{and the names of}} Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie. Characters in the Malory Towers and St. Clare's series are no longer spanked or threatened with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George's short hair making <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> boy were removed in revisions to Five on a Hike Together, reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal. Anne of The Famous Five stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girl's dolls was removed.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{creative}} team {{did not want}} the X-Men to have an all-male lineup, editor Roy Thomas suggested that Cockrum make his character Typhoon, originally designed as a male, into the woman of the group. Cockrum liked the idea, and outfitted Typhoon with The Black Cat's costume, a cape, and a new haircut with white hair. His collaborators feared that Storm’s white hair would make <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> grandmother, but Cockrum, confident that he could consistently draw the character so that she would appear young, insisted on this aspect of her appearance.|$|E
25|$|Once Henry had {{withdrawn}} with {{the bulk of}} the imperial army the towns that had supposedly fallen to the Empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. Nicholas of Ajello, son of Matthew and former Archbishop of Salerno, who was helping defend Naples, wrote letters about the events to his friends in Salerno. Thus the populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred, so they besieged the defenseless Constance at Castel Terracena. Constance presented herself on a balcony and spoke to them in the tone of mild remonstrance and admonition, trying to tell them that the situation might improve and the defeat of Henry might be exaggerated by Nicholas, but the Salernitans were determined to capture her for Tancred, so they continued the siege. Constance locked herself in her room, locked the windows, and prayed to God for help and revenge. After a rapid negotiation with Elia di Gesualdo, a distant relative of Tancred, Constance voluntarily went out under the condition that her German garrison were to be allowed to leave unharmed. She was then arrested by Elia (and some barons of Apulia who were related to her) and delivered to Tancred in Messina by Admiral Margaritus of Brindisi (her brother-in-law who had helped in the defence of Naples), on a bireme galley or dromon with 200 rowers. She was in her attire as empress, wearing a dress quilted with gold and decorated with roses, a cloak covered with precious jewels, and her hair was strewn with gems, making <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> goddess. Thus she became an important and valuable prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. When meeting Constance Tancred blamed her for the invasion, but she proudly responded that she was just taking back her dominion robbed by Tancred.|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} further popularized and embellished in Journey Into Darkness: Ghosts and Vampires of New Orleans (1998) by Kalila Katherina Smith, the {{operator}} of a New Orleans ghost tour business. Smith's book added several more explicit details to the discoveries allegedly made by rescuers during the 1834 fire, including a [...] "victim [...] obviously had her arms amputated {{and her skin}} peeled off in a circular pattern, making <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> human caterpillar," [...] and another who had had her limbs broken and reset [...] "at odd angles so she resembled a human crab". [...] Many of the new details in Smith's book were unsourced, while others were {{not supported by the}} sources given.|$|E
500|$|May {{was delighted}} that Lima [...] "went for {{something}} more fashion-forward" [...] with Susan Sarandon's Queen Narissa. She decided to make <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "runway lady", wearing something that is [...] "still Disney" [...] but also [...] "high fashion, like something John Galliano or Thierry Mugler might design". Since Narissa appears in three media: hand drawn animation, live-action, and computer animation, May {{had to make sure}} that the costume would be the same throughout in terms of [...] "color, shape, and texture". The costume for Narissa consisted of a leather corset and skirt, which looked [...] "reptilian", as well as a cape. Working with the animators, May incorporated parts of the dragon's form into the costume; the cape was designed to look like wings, the [...] of the skirt wrap around like a tail and a crown that would turn into horns during Narissa's transformation into a dragon.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) employs {{method acting}} for her {{upcoming}} role as singer Janis Joplin, thus allowing Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) {{to take advantage}} of her. He tells her to do her research on Joplin on English Wikipedia, then edits the page contents with nonsense when Jenna goes off to read it. Jenna, however, believes what she reads and proceeds to imitate all the [...] "facts" [...] on the page to the amusement of everyone. When she finally confronts Frank, they end up having sex and Jenna is affronted when Frank wants to keep it a secret from their co-workers. She reveals their fling {{in front of the other}} TGS with Tracy Jordan writers to the dismay of Frank. At hearing this, Katie (Elizabeth Rouse), the show's hair dresser and Frank's girlfriend, ruins Jenna's hair and face making <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> witch.|$|E

500|$|On February 8, 2011, Gaga tweeted {{the words}} [...] "Trois Jours" [...] ("Three Days"), {{along with a}} picture of the {{official}} single artwork, via TwitPic. Gaga is shown topless in the black-and-white cover art and displays the tattoos on her back. Her hair is air-blown and she wears heavy make-up while sharp edges protrude from her face and shoulders. The artwork was described by Charlie Amter from The Hollywood Reporter as harkening back to the classic record covers from the 1980s. He compared it to the artworks by bands like Missing Persons, Roxy Music and Duran Duran. Gordon Smart from The Sun also felt that the [...] "stark black and white image" [...] had a glossy eighties air about it. Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the cover art, feeling that Gaga looked almost [...] "animalistic" [...] in the picture, and her flowing hair made <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> creature from the African jungle. She also added that the artwork was [...] "totally and completely fierce". Archana Ram from the same publication found similarities between the [...] "Born This Way" [...] cover art and [...] Kylie Minogue's cover art for her 2007 single [...] "2 Hearts". Nicole Eggenberger from OK! described the artwork as a perfect balance between the singer's [...] "wild side" [...] and her [...] "glamorous" [...] looks. Leah Collins from Dose believed that the extreme make-up and tattoos were an ironic play on the title of the song.|$|E

6000|$|Henderson first {{pushed in}} a big woman dressed in a faded blue-checked gown, belted around the waist {{in a manner that}} made <b>her</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sack tied in the middle.
