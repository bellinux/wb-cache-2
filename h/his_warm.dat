5|$|The 17th century {{did not end}} {{well for}} the Grand Duke: he still had no grandchildren, France and Spain would not {{acknowledge}} his royal status and the Duke of Lorraine declared himself King of Jerusalem without any opposition. In May 1700 Cosimo embarked {{on a pilgrimage to}} Rome. Pope Innocent XII, after much persuasion, created Cosimo a Canon of Saint John in the Lateran, in order to allow him to view the Volto Santo, a cloth thought to have been used by Christ before his crucifixion. Delighted by <b>his</b> <b>warm</b> reception from the Roman people, Cosimo left Rome with a fragment of Saint Francis Xavier's bowels.|$|E
5|$|Sora was {{originally}} designed by Kingdom Hearts series director and character designer Tetsuya Nomura during a discussion between Disney and Square about {{who should be}} the protagonist of the series. Wanting an original character, Nomura made various sketches of Sora until the design met the approval of Disney. Nomura came to regard Sora as his favorite character that he had designed, and pushed for the character to have {{a leading role in}} the Kingdom Hearts story in spite of the character's youth. Throughout the series, Sora has been voiced by Haley Joel Osment in the English version and Miyu Irino in the Japanese version. For his depiction as a child in the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Sora was voiced by Luke Manriquez and Takuto Yoshinaga in English and Japanese, respectively. Sora's character has received generally positive critical response due to <b>his</b> <b>warm</b> personality and adventurous spirit. His personal and martial growth in the series also received praise, especially in his appearance in Kingdom Hearts II. Additionally, Sora has ranked high on various video game character popularity polls.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by his dress, by <b>his</b> <b>warm</b> and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had not engaged in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E

25|$|Though his {{ministry}} covered {{the period of}} greatest activity in the adaptation of Judaism in America to changed conditions, he, as the advocate of Orthodox Judaism, withstood every appeal in behalf of ritualistic innovations and departures from traditional practice, winning the esteem of his opponents by his consistency and integrity. His sermons covered a wide scope of thought and action, and he showed the loftiness of his spirit when, in spite of congregational opposition to the expression of his views during the American Civil War, he continued, both in prayer and in his discourses, to show <b>his</b> <b>warm</b> sympathy with {{the cause of the}} slave. In appreciation of his attitude during these trying times the Union League Club of Philadelphia placed him on the roll of its honorary members.|$|E

25|$|This {{left the}} team {{in a state of}} disarray with the {{consensus}} view that the team should be disbanded. At that point, Radbourn offered to start every game {{for the rest of the}} season (having pitched in 76 of 98 games the season before) in exchange for a small raise and exemption from the reserve clause for the next season. From that point, July 23 to September 24 when the pennant was clinched, Providence played 43 games and Radbourn started 40 of them and won 36. Soon, pitching every other day as he was, his arm became so sore he couldn't raise it to comb his hair. On game day he was at the ballpark hours before the start, getting warmed up. He began <b>his</b> <b>warm</b> up by throwing just a few feet, increasing the distance gradually until he was pitching from second base and finally from short centerfield.|$|E

In November 1989, ten months after Reagan left office, the Berlin Wall was opened, the Cold War was unofficially declared over at the Malta Summit on December 3, 1989, and two years later, the Soviet Union collapsed.|$|E
500|$|Davis's {{reputation}} among ex-Confederates {{was restored}} {{by the book}} and by <b>his</b> <b>warm</b> reception on his tour of the region in 1886 and 1887. In numerous stops, he attended Lost Cause ceremonies, where large crowds showered him with affection and local leaders presented emotional speeches honoring his sacrifices to the would-be nation. Such events helped the South {{come to terms with}} its defeat and continued for decades after the war. The Meriden Daily Journal stated that Davis, at a reception held in New Orleans in May 1887, urged southerners to be loyal to the nation. He said, [...] "United you are now, and if the Union is ever to be broken, let the other side break it." [...] Davis stated that men in the Confederacy had successfully fought for their own rights with inferior numbers during the Civil War and that the northern historians ignored this view. Davis firmly believed that Confederate secession was constitutional. The former Confederate president was optimistic concerning American prosperity and the next generation.|$|E
500|$|Following the Restoration of {{the monarchy}} under Charles II in 1660, Rupert {{returned}} to England, where Charles had already largely completed the process of balancing the different factions {{across the country in}} a new administration. Since most of the better government posts were already taken, Rupert's employment was limited, although Charles rewarded him with the second highest pension he had granted, £4,000 a year. Rupert's close family ties to King Charles were critical to <b>his</b> <b>warm</b> reception; following the deaths of the Duke of Gloucester and Princess Mary, Rupert was the King's closest adult relation in England after his brother, the Duke of York, and so a key member of the new regime. Rupert, as the Duke of Cumberland, resumed his seat in the House of Lords. For {{the first time in his}} life, Rupert's financial position was relatively secure, and he had matured. Near-contemporaries described how [...] "his temper was less explosive than formerly and his judgement sounder". Rupert continued to serve as an admiral in the Royal Navy throughout the period, ultimately rising to the rank of [...] "General at Sea and Land".|$|E

500|$|The United States Congress, in {{recognition}} of his service, promoted Eichelberger, along {{with a number of}} other officers who had commanded armies or similar higher formations, to general in 1954. He was distressed that Harding and Fuller were still hurt and angry with him over being relieved of their commands, something he felt was really MacArthur's fault. In turn Eichelberger never forgave Krueger or Sutherland for real or imagined slights. When Sutherland tried to talk, Eichelberger refused to speak to him. Eventually, Eichelberger decided to write a tell-all book that [...] "would destroy the MacArthur myth forever". For this purpose, he gave his papers to Duke University. Jay Luuvas, a historian at Allegheny College, published his letters in 1972 as Dear Miss Em: General Eichelberger's War in the Pacific 1942–1945. However, Eichelberger maintained <b>his</b> <b>warm</b> wartime relationship with Herring. Herring and his wife Mary stayed with the Eichelbergers in Asheville in 1953, and they exchanged regular letters. Eichelberger underwent exploratory prostate surgery in Asheville on 25 September 1961. Complications set in and he died from pneumonia the following day. He was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in June 1968, the CTW {{conducted}} {{a series of}} seminars at Harvard and in Manhattan, which were led by Lesser. [...] These seminars became an important aspect of [...] "the CTW model", which incorporated educational pedagogy and research into TV scripts and was used to develop other educational programs and organizations all over the world. [...] The purpose of the seminars was to expose the production team and other filmmakers and illustrators involved in the creative aspects of the new show to scholars, educators, and experts, and to encourage that both groups work together to create a curriculum and goals for the new show. [...] The production team was skeptical regarding the place of research and objective analysis in the production of a television show, but Lesser's previous experience in television, <b>his</b> <b>warm,</b> informal, unpretentious, and collaborative manner, and his proficiency in leading the meetings, convinced them. [...] CTW researcher Keith Mielke stated, [...] "He was masterful at running meetings. [...] He was never stiff and formal, but casual and friendly". [...] According to producer Sam Gibbon, despite the participants' personalities, experiences, and dispositions, Lesser was the only reason the seminars were successful. [...] Lesser set the meetings' tone and agenda, and recruited the participants. [...] He stated, [...] "The message was clear; we were there to work. [...] No pretension was going to be allowed".|$|E
500|$|The book {{begins with}} a {{quotation}} from Henry James, [...] "Never say you know the last word about any human heart." [...] A short preface (an anonymous editor suggests {{it was written in}} 1987) explains that the earliest pages have been lost, and recounts briefly Mountstuart's childhood in Montevideo, Uruguay before he moves to England aged seven with his English father and Uruguayan mother. In his final term at school he and two friends set challenges. Logan is to get on to the school's first XV rugby team; Peter Scabius has to seduce Tess, a local farmer's daughter; and Ben Leeping, a lapsed Jew, has to convert to Roman Catholicism. Mountstuart enters Oxford on an exhibition and leaves with a third in History. Settling in London, he enjoys early success as a writer with The Mind's Imaginings, a critically successful biography of Shelley; The Girl Factory, a salacious novel about prostitutes (which is [...] poorly reviewed but sells well); and Les Cosmopolites, a respectable book on some obscure French poets. Mountstuart's mother loses the family wealth in the Wall Street Crash. He embarks on a series of amorous encounters: he loses his virginity to Tess, is rejected by Land Fothergill whom he met at Oxford, and marries Lottie, an Earl's daughter. They live together at Thorpe Hall in Norfolk, where Mountstuart, unstimulated by slow country life and <b>his</b> <b>warm</b> but dull wife, becomes idle.|$|E

500|$|In 1978 Dibnah was {{commissioned}} to make repairs to Bolton Town Hall. [...] Decades {{of exposure to}} soot and rain had caused serious damage to the clock tower and Dibnah alerted the Clerk of Works to {{the condition of the}} 16stone pillars {{at the top of the}} tower. [...] He bought new stone, built a lathe in his workshop and created the replacement pillars. [...] He was given the job of repairing the clock tower and he also gilded the golden sphere at the top of the building. While [...] Dibnah was working from his bosun's chair, a public relations officer at the Town Hall informed Dibnah that BBC Look North West wanted to interview him. The following week, the film crew arrived and Alistair MacDonald conducted the interview from the top of the building, with Dibnah perched outside on his scaffolding. <b>His</b> <b>warm</b> and friendly manner combined with his enthusiasm and broad Lancashire accent proved popular and he was later contacted by producer Don Haworth, with a view to making a documentary. After several meetings over the course of a few weeks, filming began early one morning just as Dibnah had climbed to the top of a [...] chimney at Shaw and Crompton, a mill town near Oldham. Sporadic filming took place over an 18-month period and captured Dibnah (with assistant Donald Paiton) working on a range of buildings, spending time with his family and enjoying his hobbies. Giulio Briccialdi's Carnival Of Venice (performed by James Galway) was the music chosen to accompany Dibnah's work on Bolton Town Hall. One of the more notable aspects was Dibnah's 1979 demolition of a chimney in Rochdale. Standing only yards away from the base of the chimney as it began to collapse, his retreat to safety and subsequent boyish outburst of [...] "Did you like that?" [...] endeared him to viewers.|$|E
