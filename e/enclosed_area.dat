Such ditches would {{make it difficult to}} bring siege equipment (ladders, rams, and other engines) to the walls. It would also concentrate attackers in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>area</b> where they would be exposed to missile fire from the walls.|$|E
5|$|A banqueting {{house was}} built just inside the {{south-west}} corner of the moat. Though it was probably built in the 16th century, {{it was in a}} dilapidated state by 1577. A base court (an <b>enclosed</b> <b>area)</b> was added in front of the castle’s gatehouse after the main complex was built, but it unclear when. Wetland areas south and east of the castle may have been used to emulate a mere, a type of broad shallow lake. As well as this, there were two fishponds, but their dating is uncertain. During Wressle Castle’s heyday in the 16th century, the quality of the gardens and ornamental landscape would have paralleled the interior of the renovated buildings, possibly even rivalling gardens at royal properties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the south}} eastern {{corner of the}} eastern terrace is the former pumping station, {{associated}} tunnels {{and a set of}} 1850s workshops within an enclosing wall. Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the pumping station and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and weirs cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a single storey limestone building on the western side with an <b>enclosed</b> <b>area</b> to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light steel truss on steel supports in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an <b>enclosed</b> <b>area</b> in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E
5|$|The Latvian {{government}} took {{a number of}} steps {{in order to try}} to bring the situation under control, and in 2006 not only were the events planned by right wing organizations not approved, but the monument was fenced off, according to an announcement by Riga city council, for restoration. The monument was indeed restored in 2006, but this statement was later questioned, as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date, the <b>enclosed</b> <b>area</b> was much larger than needed for restoration, and the weather appeared inappropriate for restoration work. Therefore, the government was criticized by the Latvian press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech. The unapproved events took place despite the ban. On November 23, 2006, the law requiring the approval of the authorities for public gatherings was ruled unconstitutional. In the future years the government mobilized the police force to guard the neighborhood of the monument and the events were relatively peaceful.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{large degree}} of {{variation}} in the size and exact shape of the castles built in England and Wales after the invasion. One popular form of castle was the motte and bailey, in which earth would be piled up into a mound (called a motte) to support a wooden tower, and a wider <b>enclosed</b> <b>area</b> built alongside it (called a bailey); Stafford Castle is a typical example of a post-invasion motte castle. Another widespread design was the ringwork in which earth would be built up in a circular or oval shape and topped with a wooden rampart; Folkestone Castle {{is a good example}} of a Norman ringwork, in this case built on top of a hill although most post-invasion castles were usually sited on lower ground. Around 80% of Norman castles in this period followed the motte-and-bailey pattern, but ringworks were particularly popular in certain areas, such as south-west England and south Wales. One theory put forward to explain this variation is that ringworks were easier to build in these shallow-soil areas than the larger mottes.|$|E

Ideally, a 60 to 70-foot (20–25 m) round pen is used. However, the corner of any enclosed arena or small field may also be used. For safety, it is best if there is no one riding in the longeing area.|$|E

However, not all plants are implemented this way, resulting in inconveniences in the locality.|$|E

25|$|The RPG {{still remains}} a potent threat to armored vehicles, {{especially}} in situations such as urban warfare or jungle warfare, {{where they are}} favored by guerrillas.

They remained in service with the Marine Corps until 1929, being used against rebel factions in Nicaragua in 1927, carrying out the first dive-bombing attacks made by U.S. military forces. The U.S. Navy converted some DH-4M-1s into primitive air ambulances that could carry one stretcher casualty in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>area</b> behind the pilot.|$|E
5000|$|The MK3 {{offensive}} {{hand grenade}} is a cylindrical concussion grenade designed to produce casualties during close combat while minimizing danger to friendly personnel exposed {{in the open}} owing to minimal fragmentation. There is a secondary fragmentation hazard though from rocks, gravel, wood splinters, glass, etc. The grenade is also used for concussion effects in <b>enclosed</b> <b>areas,</b> for blasting, or for demolition tasks. The shock waves (overpressure) produced by this grenade when used in <b>enclosed</b> <b>areas</b> are greater than those produced by the fragmentation grenade. It is, therefore, very effective against enemy soldiers located in bunkers, buildings, and fortified areas. It {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "concussion" [...] or [...] "demo" [...] (from demolition) grenade.|$|R
30|$|While {{enclosures}} in Chepareria {{were not}} mainly established for land rehabilitation but to address pasture scarcity in Chepareria; the rapid ecological change witnessed within <b>enclosed</b> <b>areas</b> has proven that enclosures {{can be used}} as a management tool for the rehabilitation of degraded rangelands. Similar results have been reported by numerous previous studies in SSA (Mekuria et al. 2007; Mureithi et al. 2010; Verdoodt et al. 2010; Mekuria and Veldkamp 2012; Mekuria and Aynekulu 2013). Ecological restoration in the formerly degraded communal rangelands has been fostered by increased flexibility in land, fodder and livestock management in Chepareria as observed by Wairore et al. (2015 b). While enclosures have been able to address land degradation, they have also reduced available communal land, increased land-based conflict within individual allotments, commoditized land, and created wealth stratification amongst households in Chepareria as observed in previous studies by Wairore et al. (2015 a) in Chepareria. Ecologically, enclosures have significantly shifted risks of degradation from communal rangelands to private allotments by reducing available communal land hence restricting grazing to <b>enclosed</b> <b>areas.</b> Where grazing and intensive use of rangeland is not appropriately regulated; risks of land degradation within <b>enclosed</b> <b>areas</b> will be significantly high over time.|$|R
50|$|Ordinary foresters {{were already}} poverty stricken, but now their plight had grown worse; They were {{denied access to}} the <b>enclosed</b> <b>areas</b> and so were unable to hunt in them or remove timber. In particular, they lost their ancient grazing and mining rights.|$|R
