40|$|Background: Understanding how {{environmental}} attributes can influence particular physical activity behaviors {{is a public}} health research priority. Walking {{is the most common}} physical activity behavior of adults; environmental innovations may be able to influence rates of participation. Method: Review of studies on relationships of objectively assessed and perceived {{environmental attributes}} with walking. Associations with environmental attributes were examined separately for exercise and recreational walking, walking to get to and from places, and total walking. Results: Eighteen studies were identified. Aesthetic attributes, convenience of facilities for walking (sidewalks, trails); accessibility of <b>destinations</b> (<b>stores,</b> park, beach); and perceptions about traffic and busy roads were found to be associated with walking for particular purposes. Attributes associated with walking for exercise were different from those associated with walking to get to and from places. Conclusions: While few studies have examined specific environment–walking relationships, early evidence is promising. Key elements of the research agenda are developing reliable and valid measures of environmental attributes and walking behaviors, determining whether environment– behavior relationships are causal, and developing theoretical models that account for environmental influences and their interactions with other determinants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-This paper proposes {{synchronization}} {{of mobile}} database with server database using Microsoft Synchronization Framework. It is {{a platform for}} data synchronization developed by Microsoft {{which is used to}} synchronize multiple data stores. The Sync Framework lists the each item in a data store which was recognized by an item Id. The Sync services create the session object for the synchronization session. This session synchronizes the data across source data <b>store</b> and <b>destination</b> data <b>store</b> (synchronization providers). The session object gets the instances of both providers. During Synchronization session, the destination provider throws the changes that {{have been made in the}} data store. The source provider compare the <b>destination</b> data <b>store</b> with the change set in the source to catalog the variation then passes it to the destination. The destination provider ensures the modification should not clash and combine the changes made in source provider and update the destination data source.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} the inventory rationing issue {{embedded in the}} regional supply chain inventory replenishment problem (RSIRP). The concerned supply chain, which was fed by the national supply chain, consisted of a single warehouse distributing a single product to multiple stores (M-stores) with independent and normally distributed customer demand. It was assumed that the supply chain operated under the order-up-to level inventory replenishment system and had only one truck at the regional warehouse. The truck could make one replenishment trip to one store per period (a round trip per period). Based on current inventories and the vehicle constraint, the warehouse must make two decisions in each period: which store {{in the region to}} replenish and what was the replenishment quantity? The objective was to position inventories so as to minimize lost sales in the region. The warehouse inventory was replenished in every fixed-interval from a source outside the region, but the store inventory could be replenished daily. The truck <b>destination</b> (<b>store)</b> in each period was selected based on its maximum expected shortage. The replenishment quantity was then determined based on the predetermined order-up-to level system. In case of insufficient warehouse inventories to fulfill all projected store demands, an inventory rationing rule must be applied. In this paper, a new inventory rationing rule named Expected Cost Minimization (ECM) was proposed based on the practical purpose. The numerical results based on real data from a selective industry show that its performance was better and more robust than the current practice and other sharing rules in the existing literature...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOpportunistic {{networks}} aim {{at building}} networks out of mobile devices carried by people, possibly without relying on any pre-existing infrastructure. They evolve the networking in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET), which {{after more than}} ten years of research, still has not massively entered the mass market. One of the main reasons of this has been identified in the lack of realization and a practical approach to the design of MANET, where the features of mobile networks are masked by the routing (and transport) layer. Higher layers see an Internet-like network abstraction, where wireless networks' peculiarities, such as mobility of users, disconnection of nodes, network partitions, links' instability, are seen as exceptions. This often results in the design of MANET network stacks that are significantly complex and unstable. Opportunistic networks look at mobility, disconnections, partitions, etc. as features of the networks rather than exceptions. Actually, mobility is exploited as a way to bridge disconnected "clouds" of nodes and enable communication, rather than a drawback to be dealt with. More specifically, in opportunistic networking no assumption is made on the existence of a complete path between two nodes wishing to communicate. Source and destination nodes might never be connected to the same network, at the same time. Nevertheless, opportunistic networking techniques allow such nodes to exchange messages. By exploiting the store-carry-and-forward paradigm, intermediate nodes (between source and <b>destination)</b> <b>store</b> messages when no forwarding opportunity towards the final destination exists, and exploit any future contact opportunity with other mobile devices to bring the messages {{closer and closer to the}} destination. This approach to build self-organising infrastructure-less wireless networks turns out to be much more practical than the conventional MANET paradigm. Furthermore, opportunistic networking can combine the technology of the mobile devices with the social behavior of the mobile devices' carriers. Thus, despite the fact that opportunistic network research is still in its early stages, the opportunistic networking concept is nowadays exploited in a number of concrete applications, and very successful projects as the Haggle project ([URL]...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. In South Africa, {{the retail}} {{pharmacy}} market {{has changed dramatically}} {{with the introduction of}} legislation allowing a non-pharmacist to own a pharmacy as well as the regulation of medicine prices, which has affected the profitability of independent community pharmacies. These regulations have caused a shift in the status quo in that major corporate retailers have successfully entered the retail pharmacy market. The independent community pharmacy owner has to manage and finance his/her own pharmacy and does not have access to vast financial resources such as the major corporates forcing some of them to close down. The aim of the research was to investigate in more detail the competitive strategies independent community pharmacies have in place by utilising qualitative empirical research to address the main research question and research objectives. All the respondents acknowledged the importance of personal customer service as a key success factor in their strategic planning process. The research results showed that independent community pharmacies cannot compete with corporate-owned pharmacies on their dispensary as {{they do not have the}} financial resources in comparison to corporate retailers. Respondents realized that by leveraging their front-shop offering and offering products to customers based on their needs and wants, they will be in a better position to compete. In order to attract and retain their customers, the respondents recognised the significance of offering value-added services to suit the needs of the community. Respondents highlighted the importance of understanding the market to improve their business as well as moving from a convenience store to a one-stop <b>destination</b> <b>store</b> for customers. Although the respondents agreed that marketing one’s products, services and promotions were important in order to create awareness of their offering, and considered a definite method to attract new customers to the store, some pharmacy owners stated they were not financially in a position to do so. Employee retention is currently not a concern due to low turnover, with respondents feeling that the current work atmosphere and culture are conducive to the retention of staff. Research results showed that proper inventory management is essential in order to ensure that the product offering addresses the needs of the clientele. Respondents seem to be concerned that further legislative changes may adversely affect their profit margins but appear to be hopeful regarding their sustainability into the future. The research highlighted the value of managerial capability and expertise enabling independent community pharmacies to pose a viable threat to the corporate retailer operating within its vicinity. To ensure competitiveness in the retail pharmacy sector, the independent community pharmacy needs to adapt and continue to redefine itself in the face of significant challenges in the health landscape by developing a sustainable strategy based on the following recommendations: - Expanding front-shop retail. - Offering value-added services. - Implement integrated business solutions. - Create brand awareness with an increased marketing presence. - Sponsor employee training interventions and/or attendance at industry seminars. - Implement employee incentive programmes. - Having defined and documented standard operating procedures and processes in place. - Joining buying groups in an attempt to increase buying power...|$|E
30|$|The forward {{distribution}} system is usually characterized by its sources (=dispatching locations), destinations (=points of reception) and associated links.

30|$|The growing {{importance}} of online sales means that traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers {{need to create}} new distribution systems to serve customers through multiple channels. Building an effective and efficient omni-channel (OC) distribution system, however, leads to multiple challenges. The questions arise for example, from where online orders should be fulfilled, how delivery and return processes can be organized, and which context-specific OC distribution systems exist. Answering these questions retail research and practice require an overall view of the distribution concepts for direct-to-customer and store deliveries in OC retailing, including the associated return processes. This overall picture is still missing in the literature. We conducted an exploratory study to close this observable gap in the literature. This exploratory study is based on semi-structured interviews with major OC retailers in German-speaking countries and was complemented by market data research and discussions with further {{experts in the field}} of OC retailing. Based on the results of the study, the forward distribution system in OC retailing is characterized by the sources (supplier DCs, retailer DCs, <b>stores)</b> and <b>destinations</b> (home, <b>store)</b> which describe the options for store delivery, home delivery, and store pickup. Return processes are likewise characterized by the sources (<b>store,</b> home) and <b>destinations</b> (<b>store,</b> DC, return center). This framework forms the foundation for analyzing contextual criteria, identifying when the different conceptual designs are applied, determining industry-specific characteristics, and illustrating ways to further advance OC retailing. The present paper, therefore, contributes to the literature in three main areas: (1) it identifies and systematizes the forward and backward concepts in OC retailing, (2) it reveals application and development areas for achieving excellence in OC fulfillment and logistics, and (3) shows the need for developing sector- and context-specific OC distribution systems.|$|R
