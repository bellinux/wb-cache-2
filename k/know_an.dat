Although her record label desired a direct sequel to Control, Jackson chose {{to include a}} socially conscious theme among various musical styles. She stated, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>an</b> album or a song can't change the world. I just want my music and my dance to catch the audience's attention, and to hold it long {{enough for them to}} listen to the lyrics." [...] The album's central theme of unity was developed in response to various crimes and tragedies reported in the media.|$|E

Such heart-stopping moments led her to help establish the Centre for Scientific Archives in 1972.|$|E

[...] Becky Bain from website Idolator favored Perry's live voice and her natural presentation, though she was ambivalent towards the decision of giving the songs an acoustic treatment. She {{went on to say that}} the MTV Unplugged versions of Perry's songs were not able to substitute the [...] "glossy originals". Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly gave the live album a D, opining that [...] "the stripped-down treatment of MTV Unplugged does Perry's yowling voice no favors", and that [...] " [...] songs just aren't solid enough to stand on their own without loads of glossy production".

2500|$|Shaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour was {{a highly}} erudite and {{influential}} defense {{of the use of}} irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of [...] "Good Breeding". He drew upon authors such as Seneca, Juvenal, Horace and Marcus Aurelius, for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as Francis Hutcheson was what came to be called moral sentiment, which is different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling that is very important for larger communities:A publick Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or Sense of Partnership with Human Kind. Now there are none so far from being Partners in this Sense, or sharers in this common Affection, as they who scarcely <b>know</b> <b>an</b> Equall, nor consider themselves as subject to any law of Fellowship or Community. And thus Morality and good Government go together.|$|E
