40|$|Abstract Goal {{orientation}} {{theory is}} concerned with per-formance and learning goals in academic, athletic, and other ability areas. Here we examine performance and learning <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> emotion regulation. We define perfor-mance <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> emotion regulation as seeking to prove one’s ability to manage emotions; learning <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> emotion regulation are defined as seeking to improve one’s ability to manage emotions. In two studies, we tested the hypothesis that performance <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> emotion regulation {{would be associated with}} greater use of defensive emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms. Results from both studies showed that individuals with greater performance <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> emotion regulation reported higher levels of rumination and thought suppression and greater depressive symptoms, while individuals with greater learning goals reported greater use of cognitive reappraisal. The findings suggest that <b>goals</b> <b>for</b> emotion regulation may help explain individual differences in use of defensive versus constructive emotion regulation strategies...|$|R
