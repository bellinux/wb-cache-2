40|$|Article 6 (1) of the European Trade Marks Directive {{provides}} {{a series of}} justifications for a third party to make unauthorized commercial use the proprietor s mark when his use is in accordance with <b>honest</b> <b>practices</b> in industrial and commercial matters. Recently in Gillette v. Parason and Celine SA v. Celine SARL, the ECJ has clarified what constituted <b>honest</b> <b>practices.</b> Essentially, the third party use must not {{give the impression that}} there is a commercial connection between the third party and the trade mark owner, must not affect the value of the trade mark by taking advantage of its distinctive character and must not denigrate the mark. Unfortunately, as I would illustrate in my paper, to avail himself of the honest use defense, the alleged infringer is required under Celine and Gillette to disprove the same elements that the trade mark proprietor would have already succeeded in proving when establishing that an actionable infringement had occurred. If the purpose of Article 6 (1) is to provide a meaningful defense for a third party, the parameters of what would constitute <b>honest</b> <b>practices</b> must not be just a repetition of the elements that establish an infringement action. In other words, given that the proprietor has succeeded in establishing that the third party s sign (1) would lead to a likelihood of confusion over the origin of goods or (2) would take an unfair advantage of the trade mark s distinctive character or repute or (3) is detrimental to the repute, a defense must be open to the unauthorized user notwithstanding the existence of the abovementioned transgressions. In this paper, I would critique the current ECJ definition of honest use and also seek to provide an alternative formulation for <b>honest</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|E
40|$|Geographical {{indications}} (GIs) are, {{just like}} trade marks, signs {{used for the}} purpose of distinguishing goods. Unlike trade marks, GIs do not identify the commercial origin of a product from a particular undertaking, but its geographical origin from a specific place or region and, connected therewith, in most cases a given quality or other characteristic of the product. In contrast to trade marks, GIs are not individual rights but indications that belong to all local producers of the relevant region. The right to use a GI is a right of all local producers which, in principle, cannot be withdrawn. Exercising this right is, however, subject to the condition of fair competition. The use of a GI by local producers must be fair. With regard to conflicts between GIs and trade marks, Union law guarantees the right to use a GI in the Trade Mark Directive (TMD) and the Community Trade Mark Regulation (CTMR). Article 6 TMD and Art. 12 CTMR provide for a limitation of trade mark protection in favour of use of a GI. According to these provisions the rights conferred by trade marks do not entitle their proprietors to prohibit third parties from using GIs provided the use is “in accordance with <b>honest</b> <b>practices</b> in industrial or commercial matters”. These general principles governing the function and use of GIs in competition apply to the EU system for a sui generis protection of GIs in a modified manner. This article outlines the basic features of this sui generis system for GI protection and its relationship to trade mark protection...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} TRIPS {{is not only}} to further {{competition}} but also to further fair competition. This is, however, done rather indirectly through the implementation of IP rights and the determination of their scope and limitations. Apart from this, TRIPS does not monitor acts in trade and commerce under the aspect of commercial fairness. In particular, TRIPS does not deal with commercial practices in connection with the negative side effects of a globalized economy, which, for instance, outsources production to countries with laxer standards in the field of labour, environment, and human rights. If at all, this is regarded as the domain of Article 10 bis of the Paris Convention, which expressly prohibits “any act contrary to <b>honest</b> <b>practices</b> in industrial or commercial matters”. This paper addresses the issue of whether Article 10 bis of the Paris Convention is part of TRIPS—or whether TRIPS could at least be interpreted in such a manner as to (directly or indirectly) include a general prohibition of unfair competition. As a second step it addresses {{the question of whether the}} obligation to combat unfair commercial practices under the Paris Convention (and possibly also under TRIPS) in its turn can be extended to cases where a company disregards its own pledges of commitment to so-called “corporate social responsibility”. This relatively new strategy used frequently by multinational companies tries to establish a favourable image in the public perception—typically by more or less explicitly pledging to respect certain principles of “business ethics”. Can non-compliance with one’s own standards of corporate social responsibility, often presented on the company’s website, be contrary to “honest practices” pursuant to Article 10 bis of the Paris Convention? And if so, can this in its turn (also) be in breach of TRIPS...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{number and}} quality of {{published}} scientific articles {{are among the most}} important measures of a scientist’s productivity. The increasing pressure to publish was found to be associated with unethical research practices and misuse of authorship. In an attempt to ensure <b>honest</b> <b>practices,</b> the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) defined contributions making a person eligible for authorship on a scientific article. However assessment of authorship contribution is often based on unreliable questionnaires and many researchers in biomedicine do not agree with ICMJE criteria or do not know what they are. We performed a cross-sectional study to analyze medical students’, graduate students’ and doctors’ and medical teachers’ perceptions of research contributions as criteria for authorship in relation to the ICMJE authorship criteria. Another cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the association between authors' perceived importance of different contributions for authorship and the level of their participation in that contribution category for manuscripts submitted to a general medical journal. The aim of last study was to assess if the use of different formats for the disclosure of authorship contributions influenced authors’ compliance with the ICMJE criteria for authorship. [...] - Methods In the first cross-sectional study, we asked medical students with (n = 152) or without (n = 85) prior instruction on ICMJE criteria, graduate students/doctors (n = 125) and medical teachers (n = 112) to rate the importance of 11 contributions for authorship. They also reported single contributions eligible for authorship and acceptable combinations of two or three qualifying contributions. The second study included authors (n= 1181) of 265 manuscripts submitted to the Croatian Medical Journal who were asked to rate their contribution in 11 categories in the preparation of the submitted manuscript (0 – none to 4 – full) and to rate the importance of the same contributions as authorship qualifications (0 – none to 4 – full). They were randomly allocated into 3 groups as follows: the first group (n= 90 manuscripts, n= 404 authors) first received the contribution disclosure form and then the importance rating questionnaire; the second one (n= 88 manuscripts, n= 382 authors) first received the questionnaire and then the contribution disclosure form, whereas the third group (n= 87 manuscripts, n= 395 authors) received both questionnaires at the same time. We compared the perceived importance of contribution categories of authors who did and did not declare a specific contribution, authors who were identified as deserving and non-deserving authors according to the ICMJE criteria, and authors who reported ≤ 3 contribution categories with those who reported > 3 contribution categories. The third study included 865 authors of 181 manuscripts submitted to the Croatian Medical Journal from January to July 2005. These authors were randomly allocated into 2 groups as follows: 456 authors (94 manuscripts) received an ordinal rating form to rate their contributions to the submitted manuscript in 12 categories on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (full), whereas 409 authors (87 manuscripts) received a binary rating form to mark the categories in which they made a contribution. [...] - Results Our study showed that Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation, and Drafting of article formed the most important cluster in all four groups. Students without prior instruction rated Critical revision and Final approval lower than the other three groups. Final approval {{was a part of the}} least important cluster in all groups except among students with instruction. In the study with authors from Croatian Medical Journal, we received responses from 1014 (85. 9 %) authors of 235 manuscripts. The authors who declared the contribution to a specific category rated it as more important for authorship than those authors who did not contribute to the same category. Authors identified as deserving authors according to ICMJE criteria rated all contribution categories higher than the authors identified as non-deserving authors. The same was true for authors who declared > 3 contribution categories in comparison with those with ≤ 3 reported contributions, except for Administrative or technical or logistic support, Obtaining of funding, and Provision of study materials or patients. The ordinal rating form identified twice as many authors (87. 9 %) as meeting the ICMJE criteria in comparison with the binary rating form (39. 2 %, P< 0. 001). The group answering the ordinal rating form also had 5 times more manuscripts (71. 6 %) with all authors meeting the ICMJE criteria than the binary rating form group (15. 5 %, P< 0. 001). The proportion of authors who reported contributions on each item on the binary rating form was similar to the proportion of authors who reported at least moderate participation to the same items on the ordinal rating form except Final approval of the article. [...] - Conclusions Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation, and Drafting of article were recognized as the most important ICMJE criteria by all participants. They can be considered independent of previous instruction or experience. Final approval and Critical revision should be actively taught as important authorship criteria to future scientists. Authors who did not make a substantial contribution to submitted manuscript evaluated all contributions in manuscript preparation lower than their coworkers who contributed more. Ordinal scales for reporting authors’ contributions to manuscripts were more sensitive than tick boxes for assessing the appropriateness of authorship. The exception was the Final approval of the article, which should be considered a dichotomous variable and thus considered separately...|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{objections}} to Samuel Richardson's Pamela: or Virtue Rewarded have come about {{because of its}} alleged middle-class morality. Responsibility for the early propagation of this idea {{can be traced to}} Henry Fielding's brilliant satire of the work, Shamela. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine both the morality of Pamela and its most influential criticism in light of the purpose of the book and the personality of its author. Also examined is the effect of the epistolary form of writing on the clarity of Richardson's ideas. Samuel Richardson wrote Pamela as an example of the value of moral behavior. Believing in the direct intervention of God, Richardson felt that virtuous actions led to success on earth as well as in heaven. Much of his justification for this theory came from his own experience. Richardson was already a successful printer when he undertook the writing of his first novel. That success, he felt, came through <b>honest</b> business <b>practices</b> and the resultant help of God. Richardson's novel was certainly liable to the criticism of Fielding, but to make a satiric point the intended emphasis of Pamela was changed to show Pamela as a calculating female instead of an example of virtue. A close examination of Richardson's work reveals that he did espouse middle-class values; but those values were not necessarily detrimental to the purpose of his writing...|$|R

By now, there was yet another reconceptualisation of prostitution, from psychopathology to sociopathology, and the resulting legislation replaced the vagrancy law with the antisocial behaviour law in 1964. Regulation of prostitution passed to this Act, but retained the concept of normative social citizenship based on <b>honest</b> labour.

40|$|Moral turpitude {{is a legal}} {{standard}} used in areas of American law as diverse as torts, immigration, professional licensing, and evidence. Although the standard has {{a profound effect on}} a wide array of privileges, entitlements, and liabilities, scholars have devoted scant attention to it. The few who have studied it have echoed the courts in arguing that the standard is vague. This Article argues, in contrast, that the problem with moral turpitude is that it has too much meaning, not too little. Moral turpitude imports into our legal system an outdated nineteenth century honor code that reflects republican virtues: oath and promise keeping, <b>honest</b> business <b>practices,</b> hard work and productivity for men, and sexual purity for women. It ignores certain violent behavior while condemning petty property crimes. Those norms are no longer uncontroversial and unquestioned. Moral turpitude continues to retain its original valence because courts are uncomfortable with a {{legal standard}} that requires that they use the rhetoric of morals to write opinions based on social beliefs. Courts have instead long reached for proxies for moral turpitude in order to eschew a moral analysis. Rather than taking the standard at face value and determining whether a crime is especially “base, vile, or depraved,” courts today make moral turpitude determinations by looking at whether the crime falls into particular, historically-informed categories, and if not, whether it involves an element of scienter. That approach fails along dimensions ranging from efficiency to transparency to substantive fairness. More broadly, this Article shows that using morality as an overt legal standard may have the perverse effects of clouding moral decision making and of ossifying outmoded values...|$|R

BACKGROUND - Little {{is known about the}} nature and effectiveness of the deliberative processes used by nurse regulating authorities (NRAs) disciplinary panels established to appraise and make determinations in response to allegations of unprofessional conduct by nurses. METHODS - A qualitative exploratory descriptive/pragmatic research approach was used.

Data were analysed using content and thematic analysis strategies. RESULTS - Attitudinal considerations (e. g. whether a nurse understood the &# 039;wrongness&# 039; of his or her conduct; accepted responsibility for his or her conduct; exhibited contrition/shame during the hearing; was candid in his or her demeanour) emerged as the singularly most significant factor influencing discipline panel determinations.

40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increasingly}} global and mass produced marketplace {{has led to a}} change in consumer values. In an attempt to mediate the current marketplace where consumers are beginning to experience exhaustion as their choices continue to increase, the consumer is employing new means of determining value. Value is increasingly being sough by the new consumer beyond the product itself, and includes the consideration of product customisation and <b>honest</b> production <b>practice</b> and promotion. Despite the development of techniques to mediate {{the current state of the}} consumption environment, there is a lack of research into how this could be explored through architecture. This thesis argues that architecture can be used to support the changing nature of the consumption environment, through a physical interpretation of the social needs of the new consumer. A reassessment of the environment designed for consumption is necessary, in order to physically facilitate the increase of consumer awareness of consumption habits and the effects of their given choices. The layout of this research is broken into two main bodies of work. Part one focuses on the architectural proposition through an analysis of literature, whilst part two explores the fundamental facets of the design solution. The new consumer addressed within the literature and alongside the case study and site analysis is translated spatially, throughout this design led research. The architectural application of new consumer ideals within a consumption program has resulted in the design - The Urban Brewery. The brewery program showcases the potentials for social values to be transformed into a spatial dialogue.
