(If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>additional</b> half-hour {{on a scale that}} rises from $1.50 to $8.00.

The current toll is $1 in each direction for two-axle vehicles and $0.50 <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>additional</b> axle. Previously emergency vehicles (ambulances) were not charged a toll, however beginning July 3, 2003, they must pay the standard $1toll. To allow quick passage through the toll barrier, these vehicles pay through a charge account. The Utah Department of Transportation worked out an agreement during local road construction for four days in 2003 to allow commuters to use the parkway free of charge.|$|E

All samples contained cells which were inflammatory activated, as demonstrated by positive CD 54 -staining. A certain amount of the cells showed also a positive staining for α-SMA, characterizing a myofibroblast phenotype of cancer-associated fibroblasts.
