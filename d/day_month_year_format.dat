We give general assumptions on the coefficient so that we can prove the existence of a solution (λ, N, φ) to the related eigenproblem. We also prove that the solution can be obtained as the sum of an explicit series. Our motivation, besides its applications to the biology and fragmentation, is that the eigenelements allow to prove a priori estimates and long time asymptotics through the General Relative Entropy. 1...|$|R

The transition, identified by {{a drop in the}} Hα intensity and an increase in the stored energy, the line-averaged electron density, has been observed in the Co-injection case. The experiment shows (1) the delay time between the NBI turned-on and the drop of the Hα intensity decreases with the power, and (2) the transition occurs at a certain toroidal current (bootstrap current and NBCD current). The critical current depends on the vacuum rotational transform. The free-boundary equilibrium calculation predicts that the rotational transform and the shape of the magnetic surface, especially in the outer region, can be modified asymmetrically to the current direction...|$|R
