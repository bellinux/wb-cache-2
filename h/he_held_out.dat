5|$|While Ellis {{attended}} LAHC, various Major League Baseball teams {{attempted to}} sign {{him to a}} professional contract, but as he heard the Pittsburgh Pirates gave out signing bonuses of $60,000, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> until the Pirates made him an offer. He was arrested for stealing a car, and given probation. Brewer, working as a scout for the Pirates, signed Ellis to the Pirates; {{as a result of}} the arrest, the Pirates offered Ellis $500 a month and a $2,500 signing bonus.|$|E
5|$|The team {{started the}} 1977–78 {{season with a}} 50–10 mark, and some {{predicted}} a dynasty in Portland. However, Bill Walton suffered a foot injury that ended his season and would plague him over {{the remainder of his}} career, and the team struggled to an 8–14 finish, going 58–24 overall. In the playoffs, Portland lost to the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1978 conference semifinals. That summer, Walton demanded to be traded to a team of his choice (Clippers, Knicks, Warriors, or 76ers) because he was unhappy with his medical treatment in Portland. Walton was never traded, and <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> the entire 1978–79 season and left the team as a free agent thereafter. The team was further dismantled as Lucas left in 1980.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{sense of}} closure for Grove before the {{beginning}} of the 1945 season, as he was awarded $310 ($ today) in damages for the auto accident in 1941. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> for a new contract in the off-season, and finally signed with the White Sox a couple weeks before {{the beginning of the season}} after becoming the last remaining holdout. Grove was the workhorse of the White Sox, leading the team in games pitched (33) and started (30), while remaining the youngest pitcher on the roster. He finished the season with 217 pitched innings, a career best four shutouts, a 14–12 record, and a 3.44 ERA.|$|E

5|$|After winning 15 {{games again}} in 1927, Aldridge {{expected}} a raise, but instead Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss traded {{him to the}} New York Giants on February 11, 1928, for Burleigh Grimes, citing Aldridge's 4.25 ERA in 1927 as a reason not {{to give him a}} raise. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> for much of the year; by the time he returned, he was out of shape and pitched poorly. During the time Aldridge refused to report, Giants manager John McGraw threatened Aldridge with less pay, and at one point tried to trade him to the Cincinnati Reds. After the season, in which Aldridge's record was four wins and seven losses with a 4.83 earned run average after 119 innings pitched, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, Aldridge refused to report and retired from baseball instead. His final game was on August 29, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Despite his success, Cagney {{remained}} {{dissatisfied with}} his contract. He wanted {{more money for}} his successful films, but he also offered to take a smaller salary should his star wane. Warner Bros. refused, so Cagney once again walked out. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> for $4000 a week, the same salary as Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Kay Francis. Warner Bros. refused to cave in this time, and suspended Cagney. Cagney {{announced that he would}} do his next three pictures for free if they canceled the five years remaining on his contract. He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go back to Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine. After six months of suspension, Frank Capra brokered a deal that increased Cagney's salary to around $3000 a week, and guaranteed top billing and no more than four films a year.|$|E
5|$|However, Rodes beat Schurz to Oak Hill, so the XI Corps {{division}} {{was forced to}} take up positions in the broad plain north of the town, below and {{to the east of}} Oak Hill. They linked up with the I Corps reserve division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, whose two brigades had been sent forward by Doubleday when he heard about Ewell's arrival. Howard's defensive line was not a particularly strong one in the north. He was soon outnumbered (his XI Corps, still suffering the effects of their defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville, had only 8,700 effectives), and the terrain his men occupied in the north was poorly selected for defense. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> some hope that reinforcements from Slocum's XII Corps would arrive up the Baltimore Pike in time to make a difference.|$|E
50|$|Due to an off-field injury (see Personal section), <b>He</b> was <b>held</b> <b>out</b> {{of spring}} {{practices}} but {{returned to the}} field in the fall.|$|R

5|$|In July 1945, Lawton handed in a {{transfer}} request at Everton {{as he wanted}} a move to a Southern club so as {{to see more of}} his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting {{a transfer}}. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the English king's {{possessions}} in France {{were coming}} under {{threat from the}} French king. Charles IV of France demanded that Edward again pay homage for his Duchy of Aquitaine, {{while at the same}} time threatening to confiscate the duchy under the pretext of a local dispute involving the priory at Saint-Sardos. In April 1324, Edmund and Alexander de Bicknor, Archbishop of Dublin, were sent to France on a diplomatic mission. While some historians have criticised Edmund for his failure to reach a diplomatic settlement, others have pointed to the difficult circumstances he faced, and how others had fared little better. When diplomacy failed, Edmund was appointed Edward's lieutenant in France on 20 July 1324. Though there was a desperate need for reinforcements from England, these never arrived. In the short war that followed, the English lands were quickly overrun by the French, and Edmund was besieged at La Réole. Here <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> until 22 September, at which point he was forced to surrender and agree to a six-month truce.|$|E
5|$|Ruffing won 20 games {{during the}} 1936 season. His 3.85 ERA was the sixth-best in the league, and his 20 wins tied him for third place, with Johnny Allen and Wes Ferrell, behind Tommy Bridges and Vern Kennedy. He started Game One of the 1936 World Series against the New York Giants, but lost. The Yankees {{defeated}} the Giants four games to two. In a salary {{dispute with the}} Yankees, Ruffing did not report to spring training, and <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> {{at the start of}} the 1937 season, missing the first month. He signed in May, receiving a $15,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms). Ruffing had a 20–7 win-loss record for the Yankees in 1937. He finished with the fourth-best ERA in the league, 2.98, trailing Lefty Gomez, Monty Stratton, and Allen, and his 20 wins were second only to Gomez, who had 21. His performance earned him eighth place in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award voting. He started Game Two in the 1937 World Series, earning the victory, as the Yankees defeated the Giants four games to one.|$|E
60|$|Fresnel dipped a {{hand into}} his pocket, and fetched thence a key. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> it <b>out</b> to Andre-Louis in fingers that shook--more in anger than in fear.|$|R

25|$|During {{his year}} as finance minister, Tupper {{retained}} the government's commitment to protectionism, even extending {{it to the}} iron and steel industry. By this time Tupper was convinced that Canada was {{ready to move on}} to its second stage of industrial development. In part, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> the prospect of the development of a great iron industry as an inducement to keep Nova Scotia from seceding.|$|E
25|$|McHale's stay in Boston {{got off to}} a rocky {{start as}} <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> for a large contract, even {{threatening}} to play in Italy, before signing a three-year deal with the Celtics. Backing up Larry Bird and Cedric Maxwell at forward, McHale made an immediate impact and was named to the NBA's All-Rookie First Team in his rookie season. Boston finished McHale's rookie season with a league-leading record of 62-20.|$|E
25|$|Back at {{the front}} in June 1944, Tolsdorff {{received}} orders to defend the city of Vilna against the Soviet Vilnius Offensive. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> long enough to evacuate the thousands of wounded from the city until the relief forces {{under the command of}} Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz arrived. This action resulted in his promotion to Oberst and the awarding of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 18 July 1944.|$|E

25|$|The New York Jets {{selected}} Toon {{with the}} 10th overall pick. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out,</b> and still without a contract by late August, Cindrich publicly {{suggested that the}} Jets trade Toon. But by Week 2 {{of the regular season}} (after New York lost 31-0 to the Los Angeles Raiders), Toon signed a deal reportedly worth $1.6 million over five years, including a signing bonus worth $475,000. The deal paid him more money than any other receiver drafted in 1985, including the San Francisco 49ers first round selection, Jerry Rice.|$|E
25|$|Hepburn {{seems to}} have been uneasy with the Scottish Reformation. Although he agreed in {{principle}} to modify the structure of Elgin Cathedral to accommodate Protestant forms of worship, few powerful figures on the reformist side trusted him. During the Civil War of 1567, the bishop pledged his support to James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, and was accused of giving him shelter during his flight northwards to Scandinavia. He was finally forfeited of his bishopric by parliament in August 1571. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> in Spynie Castle, but died on 20 June 1573.|$|E
25|$|As of the Patriots' first {{training}} camp practice at Gillette Stadium on July 28, {{they had the}} NFL maximum of 80 players signed to their roster. Deion Branch did not count against the limit as <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> of {{training camp}} and {{was placed on the}} Reserve/Did Not Report list. Also, the Patriots received eight total roster exemptions for the NFL Europe allocations of Earl Charles, Todd Mortensen, Rich Musinski, Zuriel Smith, Antwain Spann, Nick Steitz, and Ray Ventrone (one for each player, plus one bonus exemption because of the time Ventrone spent on a practice squad in 2006).|$|E

25|$|As background, Stan Kostka {{had a huge}} {{college career}} as a U of M running back, leading the Minnesota Gophers to an undefeated season in 1934. Every NFL team wanted to sign him. Since there was no draft back then, savvy Stan did the smart thing - <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> for the highest offer. While a free agent, Stan kept busy, even running for Mayor of Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. Although his {{political}} career didn’t take off, Stan's nine-month NFL holdout succeeded and he became the league's highest-paid player, signing a $5,000 contract with the NFL's team in Brooklyn, New York on August 25, 1935. As {{a response to the}} bidding war for Stan Kostka, the NFL instituted the draft in 1936.|$|E
25|$|There <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> {{for some}} six months, while Leo sent the new Domestic of the Schools, Gregoras Iberitzes, a {{relative}} by {{marriage to the}} Doukai, {{to persuade him to}} surrender. However, when Andronikos heard the news of the deposition of his friend the Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos (February 907), on whom he had placed hopes for mediation, he resolved to flee and asked for aid from the Arabs. In mid-spring 907, an Arab force came to his aid and broke the leaguer around Kaballa. Escorted by the Arabs, Andronikos and his family crossed the border, coming first to Tarsos and finally to the Abbasid capital, Baghdad. The flight of Andronikos Doukas represents a peculiar episode: several scholars, such as Alexander Vasiliev and Romilly Jenkins, consider it evidence of a real plot against Leo, which included the Patriarch Nicholas Mystikos and perhaps also the admiral Eustathios. Others, such as Demetrios Polemis and Shaun Tougher, reject this interpretation and explain the episode in terms of the rivalry with the powerful Samonas. They regard Andronikos's actions to have been purely defensive in character and mandated by his untenable position after his refusal to cooperate with Himerios.|$|E
25|$|The French were {{severely}} mauled by Saumarez's squadron, several French ships also running aground, but {{the wind}} prevented the British from {{taking advantage of the}} opportunity to closely engage them. Hannibal was under heavy fire from the anchored Formidable and an array of Spanish batteries and gunboats, and could not bring her guns to bear on them. The main and mizzen masts were shot away, and her casualties mounted, while attempts to pull the ship off the shoal failed. The British force had suffered considerable damage to sails, masts and rigging, and in the light breeze, Saumarez saw there was the danger that the remainder of his ships might run aground like the Hannibal. At 13:35 he ordered his squadron to withdraw to Gibraltar, leaving the damaged Hannibal behind. Ferris ordered the survivors of his crew below decks to escape the worst of the fire as the combined guns of the French and Spanish forces turned on the last remaining target. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> until 14:00, when seeing that further resistance would be futile, he ordered the colours struck, and the Hannibals ensign came down.|$|E
