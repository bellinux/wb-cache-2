40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy has radically been {{reformed}} in 2003 {{with the}} introduction of “decoupled” direct payments. Economic theory suggests that direct payments are expected to have no impact on production in a static deterministic environment with perfect markets for capital and labour. But if factor market imperfections or uncertainty are taken into account, this is no longer true. Taking into account these potential impacts, the empirical literature has studied the impacts of farm payments. However, most studies are based on assumptions such as perfect markets, risk neutrality or static environment. Recent researches have also often neglected the role of debt constraints. The paper develops and numerically solves a dynamic stochastic farm household model with occasionally binding debt constraints and investment adjustment costs. The impacts of direct and counter-cyclical payments are explored and compared to an <b>increase</b> in the <b>intervention</b> <b>price.</b> Results show that both types of payments will positively impact on investment, but the impacts on output will not be as significant as it is with an <b>increase</b> in <b>intervention</b> <b>price.</b> Further, the degree of decoupling of Single Farm Payments in the French crops sector is found to be significantly linked to the degree of capital market imperfections.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study identified issues and concerns {{related to the}} American apparel industry. Dialogue with apparel manufacturers sought their responses to the following: factors influencing apparel production site selection; opinions on profitability, government intervention, {{and the future of}} the American textile and apparel industries; opinions regarding the quality of materials and production techniques in the U.

Management personnel from nine domestic and nine overseas apparel manufacturers based in the San Francisco Bay Area were interviewed. For the domestic firms the most important criterion for production site selection was lead time; for the overseas firms the most important criterion was cost. Both groups also identified quality control and sourcing as important. A recurring issue for both groups was inflexibility in domestic sourcing and production; they indicated that greater flexibility would increase American apparel industry profits. Both groups predicted more government <b>intervention,</b> <b>increased</b> <b>prices,</b> and continued inflexibility in the future.

40|$|The USDA Global Agricultural Information Network {{released}} a report on March 5 th 2003 detailing how the EU's rice regime operates. It sets out how the standard EU import duties are designed to raise the price of imported brown indica rice to 180 % of the EU <b>intervention</b> <b>price,</b> the price of imported japonica rice to 188 % of the <b>intervention</b> <b>price,</b> and of milled rice to 267 % of the <b>intervention</b> <b>price.</b> However, this duty may not exceed the duty fixed in the EU's Common Customs Tariff, which is a maximum of € 264 /tonne for brown indica rice (currently the <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> is € 298. 35 /tonne so the maximum duty paid import price is € 537 /tonne). According to this report, because of the low price of rice on world markets in the past year, import duties for brown rice have continued at 264 /t.

50|$|Monetary {{compensatory}} amounts (MCAs) were border {{measures in the}} EU consisting of taxes and subsidies formerly applicable to intra-EC trade in agricultural and food products for which <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> were set. These border measures were made necessary {{by the fact that}} <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> were set in ECUs and converted into national currency terms at green rates, set at levels different from commercial market rates. This gave rise to price differentials between member nations (in market ECUs) that would influence intra-EC trade if not offset by the MCAs.

40|$|This paper reviews {{developments}} in the direct-fired biomass power sector and provides an up to date investment outlook by calculating the Net Present Value of new investments, and the appropriate level of Feed-in-Tariff needed to stimulate future investment. An overview is provided of support policies, historical growth in installations, and main market players. A number of data sources is combined to build a database with detailed information of individual biopower projects. This data is used to describe technological and market trends, which are used in a cash flow model to calculate the NPV of a typical project. The NPV for new projects {{is estimated to be}} negative, and investment should be expected to stall without proper policy <b>intervention.</b> <b>Increasing</b> fuel <b>prices,</b> local competition over biomass fuel resources, lower than expected operational performance and a downturn in carbon markets have deteriorated the investment outlook. In order to ensure reasonable profitability, the Feed-In-Tariff should be increased, from the current level of 90. 9 (sic) MWh(- 1), to between 97 and 105 (sic) MWh(- 1). Where possible, government organizations should help organize demand for the supply of heat. Local rural energy bureaus may help organize supply networks for biomass fuels throughout the country, in order to reduce seasonal and local fuel scarcity and price fluctuations.

40|$|The {{subsidies}} and protection {{structure of the}} sugar sectors in the European Union originated from the individual national protection systems, unified {{with the creation of}} the Common Agricultural Policy. The COM for Sugars is based on an <b>intervention</b> <b>price</b> quite higher than international prices. To determine who benefits from this <b>intervention</b> <b>price,</b> production quotas are established and distributed to each Member- State, producer and raw-material supplier. In parallel, levies are charged on sugar produced and tariffs on imported sugar, which contribute part of total funds required to finance these subsidies. The difference is covered by the community budget. The Eu imports sugar from ex- European colonies, paid at the internal EU price and benefitting from import tariff isention. Most of this sugar is reexported refined. There are other “entrances” for smaller quantities of sugar with preferential treatment, used, among others, by Cuba and Brazil. Subsidies and privileges are being contested internally and externally. Negotiations in international fora (WTO, bilateral talks) and preparation for the accession of East European countries to the EU will probably accelerate the reform of the COM for Sugar.

40|$|Recent Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{reforms have}} {{affected}} dairy policy, including the milk quota system, {{and increased the}} market orientation of the sector. A modelling exercise, using the European Dairy Industry Model (EDIM), simulates an initial sharp decline in the EU milk price {{in response to the}} decrease in the <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> of butter and SMP after 2003, followed by a period of stability and an increase from 2007 / 08 as the demand for dairy protein products increases over time and EU milk supply is still restricted by quotas. The phasing out of the milk quota following the implementation of the 2009 Health Check is estimated to lead to an increase in milk production and a decrease in the milk price both within and without the European Union. The gap between EU domestic and border prices is expected to continue to narrow. Looking at developments in dairy markets between 2000 and 2007, the study finds that milk prices did not decrease as much as expected because the <b>intervention</b> <b>prices</b> were no longer binding, in particular for skimmed milk powder. The income of dairy farms increased as decline in milk prices was more than compensated by the introduction of dairy premium and higher farm productivity due to the increase in farm size.
