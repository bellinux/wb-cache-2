50|$|A {{currency}} {{is said to}} be pegged within a band when the central bank specifies a <b>central</b> exchange <b>rate</b> with reference to a single currency, a cooperative arrangement, or a currency composite. It also specifies a percentage allowable deviation {{on both sides of this}} <b>central</b> <b>rate.</b> Depending on the band width, the central bank has discretion in carrying out its monetary policy. The band itself may be a crawling one, which implies that the <b>central</b> <b>rate</b> is adjusted periodically. Bands may be symmetrically maintained around a crawling central parity (with the band moving in the same direction as this parity does). Alternatively, the band may be allowed to widen gradually without any pre-announced <b>central</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R

This study uses Vector Auto Regression (VAR), which combined with the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) using the program Eviews 6. In the analysis methods Granger Causality Test, Impulse Response Function (IRF) and Variance Decomposition (VD) are used. The results showed that the Granger Causality Test found some significant relations between <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> that exist in the member countries of ASEAN + 3. The Impulse Response Function (IRF) shows the reaction of the <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> j shocks that occurred in <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> i. The average quickest response is two weeks from the shock of other countries <b>central</b> bank <b>rate.</b> While the results of the analysis Variance Decomposition (VD) shows some impact of shock on <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> i will be accepted at the <b>central</b> bank <b>rates</b> j. These results indirectly prove the presence of banking sector integration in the ASEAN + 3 country member...|$|R
