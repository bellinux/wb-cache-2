5|$|Changes in {{agricultural}} practices, which {{have led to}} local population declines and range fragmentation, are the main threats to this genus, although neither species <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> globally.|$|E
5|$|Like many Australian {{cockatoos}} and parrots, the red-tailed black cockatoo <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by the thriving {{illegal trade}} in bird smuggling. High demand and high transit mortality mean {{that many more}} birds are taken from the wild than actually sold.|$|E

5|$|After mating in August or September, {{the female}} katipo {{produces}} {{five or six}} egg sacs in November or December. The spiderlings hatch during January and February and disperse into surrounding plants. Due to habitat loss and colonisation of their natural habitat by other exotic spiders, the katipo <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> with extinction.|$|E
5|$|Although it is a mimid, {{the black}} catbird {{is not known}} to imitate any other species. Its song {{is a mix of}} harsh notes and clear flute-like whistles, with the phrases repeated. It builds a cup nest in low bushes or trees, and lays two bluish eggs. It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss, and has been {{assessed}} as near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Grevillea juniperina, {{commonly}} known as juniper- or juniper-leaf grevillea or prickly spider-flower, is a plant of the family Proteaceae native to eastern New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland in Australia. Scottish botanist Robert Brown described the species in 1810, and seven subspecies are recognised. One subspecies, G. j. juniperina, is restricted to Western Sydney and environs and <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by loss of habitat and housing development.|$|E

5|$|Krüper's {{nuthatch}} <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by urbanisation {{and development}} in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and {{made it easier for}} developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is {{now found}} only in the Mikea Forest of southwestern Madagascar, but subfossil records {{indicate}} that {{it used to be}} more widely distributed in southern Madagascar. Climatic changes and competition with introduced species may have led to the shift in its distribution. The Mikea Forest, the only place where it is still known to occur, <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by human development.|$|E
5|$|Since 1770, all Australian quoll {{species have}} {{declined}} in number owing to habitat loss caused by urbanization.

5|$|The Andean condor is a {{national}} symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and {{plays an important role}} in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered near threatened by the IUCN. It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss and by secondary poisoning from carcasses killed by hunters. Captive breeding programs have been instituted in several countries.|$|E
5|$|The city of Skopje {{encompasses}} various {{natural environments}} and its fauna and flora are rich. However, it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by {{the intensification of}} agriculture and the urban extension. The largest protected area within the city limits is Mount Vodno, which is a popular leisure destination. A cable car connects its peak to the downtown, and many pedestrian paths run through its woods. Other large natural spots include the Matka Canyon.|$|E

5|$|The eastern voalavo (Voalavo antsahabensis) is a rodent in {{the family}} Nesomyidae which occurs in the Anjozorobe forest of eastern Madagascar. Although surveys before 2002 failed to record the species, it is common in some places. However, it <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat loss because of slash-and-burn agriculture. The species was {{formally}} described in 2005 and is most {{closely related to the}} only other species of Voalavo, the northern voalavo from northern Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|The last {{remaining}} station building, the old parcels office, <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> with demolition by Network Rail, {{which owns the}} station.

5|$|This bird is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by habitat destruction. Since the arid, spiny forests in which it lives are not protected by the Malagasy government, it is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate.|$|E
