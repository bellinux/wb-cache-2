5|$|In May 2011, Cielo tested {{positive}} for the banned substance <b>furosemide.</b> <b>Furosemide</b> is a diuretic often used to help lose weight {{but it is also a}} masking agent which may hide the presence of other drugs. Cielo was one of four Brazilian swimmers who {{tested positive}} for the substance and was given a warning by Brazil's national swimming federation. Cielo claimed the positive drug test was a result of a cross-contamination. FINA appealed Cielo's case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and CAS upheld the warning for Cielo. CAS claimed that a caffeine supplement had been contaminated, causing the failed drug test. CAS was convinced that the <b>furosemide</b> found was not aimed at improving athletic performance or masking the use of some other performance-enhancing substance.|$|E
5|$|Two wrestlers, Greco-Roman 50kg silver medallist Nurbek Hakkulov of Uzbekistan and 63kg {{freestyle}} wrestler Johnny Pilay of Ecuador, were disqualified on 15 October after {{testing positive}} for the banned diuretic <b>furosemide.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{recovery}} phase intravenous fluids are discontinued {{to prevent a}} state of fluid overload. If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed. If a person is outside of the critical phase, a loop diuretic such as <b>furosemide</b> {{may be used to}} eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 the ApHC {{implemented}} {{new drug}} rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs <b>furosemide,</b> {{known by the}} trade name of Lasix, and acetazolamide. <b>Furosemide</b> is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. Acetazolamide ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers. The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and owners {{have the option to}} choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers. Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP will be required to be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.|$|E
5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic <b>furosemide</b> is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.|$|E
5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. <b>Furosemide,</b> a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, <b>furosemide</b> is a noncompetitive subtype-specific blocker of GABA-A receptors. <b>Furosemide</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to reversibly antagonize GABA-evoked currents of α6β2γ2 receptors at µM concentrations, but not α1β2γ2 receptors. During development, the α6β2γ2 receptor increases in expression in cerebellar granule neurons, corresponding to increased sensitivity to <b>furosemide.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide</b> (trade name: Lasix) {{administered}} {{prior to}} racing or strenuous exercise in Thoroughbred and Standardbred racehorses reduces the severity EIPH in 68% of horses. Up to 85% of Thoroughbred racehorses in the United States have been administered <b>furosemide</b> {{at least once}} during their racing career. <b>Furosemide</b> decreases pulmonary arterial pressure via its diuretic effects, bronchodilates, and redistributes blood flow during exercise. It reduces EIPH ranging from 90% at sub-maximal exercise and about 50% at maximal exercise intensities. However, over time, it causes electrolyte imbalances and has reduced effectiveness. <b>Furosemide</b> is prohibited in competing horses in some countries, and by the International Olympic Committee. The United States and Canada are the only countries which permit <b>furosemide</b> use during racing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide</b> is the INN and BAN. The {{previous}} BAN was frusemide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide</b> may {{increase}} the risk of digoxin toxicity due to hypokalemia.|$|E
25|$|Loop diuretics (e.g. <b>furosemide,</b> bumetanide) – most {{commonly}} used class in CHF, usually for moderate CHF.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide</b> is {{detectable}} in urine 36–72 hours following injection. Its use {{is prohibited}} by most equestrian organizations.|$|E
25|$|Tatyana Akulinushkina – 6-month ban for a Fenoterol {{positive}} in 2013 + 4-year ban for <b>Furosemide</b> {{positive in}} 2015.|$|E
25|$|Drug reactions, {{with the}} most common {{inducers}} including gold salts, beta blockers, traditional antimalarials (e.g. quinine), thiazide diuretics, <b>furosemide,</b> spironolactone, metformin and penicillamine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide</b> {{and other}} loop diuretics inhibit the {{activity}} of NKCC2, thereby impairing sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.|$|E
25|$|Loop diuretics (<b>furosemide,</b> bumetanide, torasemide) and thiazide diuretics (e.g., chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, or chlorothiazide) can {{increase}} kidney potassium excretion {{in people with}} intact kidney function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide</b> acts within 1hour of oral {{administration}} (after IV peak effect within 30minutes); diuresis is complete within 6hours (for {{oral administration}}) and 2hours (for IV administration).|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide</b> was {{discovered}} in 1962. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale price in the developing world is between 0.004 and 0.02 USD per day. In the United States it is available as a generic medication and costs about 0.15 USD per day. <b>Furosemide</b> is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned drug list due to concerns that it may mask other drugs. It has also been used to prevent and treat race horses for exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide</b> is {{injected}} either intramuscularly or intravenously, usually 0.5-1.0mg/kg twice/day, although less before a horse is raced. As with many diuretics, {{it can cause}} dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, including loss of potassium, calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Excessive use of <b>furosemide</b> will most likely lead to a metabolic alkalosis due to hypochloremia and hypokalemia. The drug should, therefore, {{not be used in}} horses that are dehydrated or experiencing kidney failure. It should be used with caution in horses with liver problems or electrolyte abnormalities. Overdose may lead to dehydration, change in drinking patterns and urination, seizures, gastrointestinal problems, kidney damage, lethargy, collapse, and coma.|$|E
25|$|Diuretic {{resistance}}: Diuretic resistance can {{be predicted}} by giving 80nbsp&mg intravenous <b>furosemide</b> after 3 days without diuretics {{and on an}} 80 mEq sodium/day diet. The urinary sodium excretion over 8 hours < 50 mEq/8 hours predicts resistance.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to exocrine glands, NKCC1 {{is necessary for}} establishing the potassium-rich endolymph that bathes part of the cochlea, an organ necessary for hearing. Inhibition of NKCC1, as with <b>furosemide</b> or other loop diuretics, can result in deafness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide,</b> {{like other}} loop diuretics, acts by {{inhibiting}} the luminal Na-K-Cl cotransporter {{in the thick}} ascending limb of the loop of Henle, by binding to the chloride transport channel, thus causing sodium, chloride, and potassium loss in urine.|$|E
25|$|The use of diuretics such as <b>furosemide,</b> is {{widespread}} and sometimes convenient in ameliorating fluid overload. It is {{not associated with}} higher mortality (risk of death), nor with any reduced mortality or length of intensive care unit or hospital stay.|$|E
25|$|Zonisamide {{and other}} {{carbonic}} anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate, <b>furosemide,</b> and hydrochlorothiazide {{have been known}} to interfere with amobarbital, which has led to inadequate anesthetization during the Wada test. Zonisamide may also interact with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to increase the potential for metabolic acidosis.|$|E
25|$|Moderate and/or {{symptomatic}} hyponatremia {{is treated}} {{by raising the}} serum sodium level by 0.5 to 1mmol per liter per hour {{for a total of}} 8mmol per liter during the first day with the use of <b>furosemide</b> and replacing sodium and potassium losses with 0.9% saline.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include low blood {{pressure}} with standing, ringing in the ears, {{and sensitivity to}} the sun. Potentially serious side effects include electrolyte abnormalities, low blood pressure, and hearing loss. Blood tests are recommended regularly for those on treatment. <b>Furosemide</b> {{is a type of}} loop diuretic that works by decreasing the reabsorption of sodium by the kidneys.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the brand}} names under which <b>furosemide</b> is marketed include: Aisemide, Apo-Furosemide, Beronald, Desdemin, Discoid, Diural, Diurapid, Dryptal, Durafurid, Edemid, Errolon, Eutensin, Flusapex, Frudix, Frusetic, Frusid, Fulsix, Fuluvamide, Furesis, Furix, Furo-Puren, Furon, Furosedon, Fusid.frusone, Hydro-rapid, Impugan, Katlex, Lasilix, Lasix, Lodix, Lowpston, Macasirool, Mirfat, Nicorol, Odemase, Oedemex, Profemin, Rosemide, Rusyde, Salix, Teva-Furosemide, Trofurit, Uremide, and Urex.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone is also {{formulated}} {{in combination with}} a variety of other drugs, including with hydrochlorothiazide as Aldactazide, with hydroflumethiazide as Aldactide, Lasilacton, Lasilactone, and Spiromide, with altizide as Aldactacine and Aldactazine, with <b>furosemide</b> as Fruselac, with benazepril as Cardalis (veterinary), with metolazone as Metolactone, with bendroflumethiazide as Sali-Aldopur, and with torasemide as Dytor Plus, Torlactone, and Zator Plus.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamides {{are used}} to treat allergies and cough, as well as {{antifungal}} and antimalarial functions. The moiety is also present in other medications that are not antimicrobials, including thiazide diuretics (including hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone, and indapamide, among others), loop diuretics (including <b>furosemide,</b> bumetanide, and torsemide), acetazolamide, sulfonylureas (including glipizide, glyburide, among others), and some COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib).|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} phase III {{clinical}} trial of RenalGuard Therapy to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. The therapy utilizes the RenalGuard System, which measures the patient's urine output and infuses an equal volume of normal saline in real-time. The therapy involves connecting the patient to the RenalGuard System, then injecting a low dose of <b>furosemide</b> to induce high urine output rates.|$|E
25|$|Omeprazole {{was first}} marketed in the United States in 1989 by Astra AB, now AstraZeneca, under {{the brand name}} Losec. In 1990, {{at the request of}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the brand name Losec was changed to Prilosec to avoid {{confusion}} with the diuretic Lasix (<b>furosemide).</b> The new name led to confusion between omeprazole (Prilosec) and fluoxetine (Prozac), an antidepressant.|$|E
25|$|Preventing {{recurrence}} of hyperkalemia typically involves reduction of dietary potassium, removal of an offending medication, and/or {{the addition of}} a diuretic (such as <b>furosemide</b> or hydrochlorothiazide). Sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol (combined as Kayexalate) are occasionally used on an ongoing basis to maintain lower serum levels of potassium though the safety of long-term use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate for this purpose is not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{medications}} {{can increase}} urination difficulties by increasing bladder outlet resistance by increasing smooth muscle tone at the prostate or bladder neck {{and contribute to}} LUTS. Alpha-adrenergic agonist medications, such as decongestants with pseudoephedrine can increase bladder outlet resistance. In contrast, calcium channel blockers and anticholinergic medications can worsen urinary retention by promoting bladder muscle relaxation. Diuretic medications such as loop diuretics (e.g., <b>furosemide)</b> or thiazides (e.g., chlorthalidone) can cause or worsen urinary frequency and nighttime awakenings to urinate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide</b> {{should be}} used with caution when {{combined}} with corticosteroids (as this {{increases the risk of}} electrolyte imbalance), aminoglycoside antibiotics (increases risk of kidney or ear damage), and trimethoprim sulfa (causes decreased platelet count). It may also cause interactions with anesthesics, so its use should be related to the veterinarian if the animal is going into surgery, and it decreases the kidneys' ability to excrete aspirin, so dosages will need to be adjusted if combined with that drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Furosemide,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Lasix among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat fluid build-up due to heart failure, liver scarring, or kidney disease. It may {{also be used for}} the treatment of high blood pressure. The amount of medication required depends on the person in question. It can be taken intravenously or by mouth. When taken by mouth it typically begins working within an hour while intravenously it typically begins working within five minutes.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol, {{often in}} high concentrations, {{is used to}} {{dissolve}} many water-insoluble medications and related compounds. Liquid preparations of cough and cold remedies, pain medication, and mouth washes may be dissolved in 1 to 25% concentrations of ethanol and {{may need to be}} avoided in individuals with adverse reactions to ethanol such as alcohol-induced respiratory reactions. Ethanol is present in over 700 liquid preparations of medicine including acetaminophen, iron supplements, ranitidine, <b>furosemide,</b> mannitol, phenobarbital, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and over-the-counter cough medicine.|$|E
