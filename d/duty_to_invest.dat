40|$|In recent years, {{pension funds}} and other {{institutional}} investors have begun to give {{more attention to the}} environmental and social behaviour of the companies in which they invest.

However, some confusion among investment decision- makers persists {{about the extent to which}} their fiduciary <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> beneficiaries allow policies that may sacrifice financial returns for environmental or other philanthropic causes. This is compounded by the belief that they cannot secure the best returns in respect of their fiduciary obligations with current socially responsible companies. With reference to the main common law jurisdictions, this article critically examines whether the fiduciary duties of pension fund investors hinder SRI. Contrary to some commonly held beliefs, SRI can often sit comfortably with fiduciary <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> prudently. However, legal reforms to improve the climate for SRI would help, as evident by some recent initiatives in several jurisdictions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. It {{is settled}} law that the trustee of any trust is {{unequivocally}} {{charged with the}} <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> {{the assets of the}} trust. However, in south Africa in the past, this duty has been qualified, with avoidance of risk seen as the trustee's number one priority when investing. The legislature and the judiciary focused on providing safeguards for beneficiaries and trustees were to avoid all risk to the capital of the trust. This reflected the attitude of the 19 th and first half of the 20 th century when the value of money had remained steady over long periods and inflation was non-existent. However, changes began to occur in world economics, such as the devaluing of currencies and progressive inflation. Despite these harsh economic realities, the courts continued for some considerable time to favour investment in interest-bearing securities. Most of the time trustees erred on the side of caution, following the judiciary's lead. Unfortunately, as it will be pointed out, this meant that the trustees were blind to their primary task, which is and always has been, to do the best for the beneficiaries. Trustees will have to expose the assets to at least some risk in order to outperform inflation, as the traditional investments are no longer suitable. This change in investment thinking was confirmed in South Africa in Administrators, Estate Richards v Nicol and Another 1999 1 SA 551 (SCA). Every trustee is, therefore, faced with a dilemma when engaging in investment decision making. He or she is under a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> with the minimum of risk and also to balance the interests of competing beneficiaries. The trustee is under a duty to balance the risk against the rewards, always bearing in mind that he or she must "preserve the trust fund rather than overtly seek its advancement". Any exercise of the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> will be limited by the provisions contained in the trust instrument as well as those provided for by statute, particularly the duty of care. Change occurred in English Trust Law with the introduction of the Trustee Act, 2000. The Trustee Act removes the constraints of the previous legislation and imposes positive obligations on trustees in their place, which reflect the reality of modern investment practices. Under section 1 of the Trustee Act a new uniform duty of care is created to guide trustees when performing their functions under the Act or a trust instrument. This uniformity is aimed at providing certainty and consistency in respect of the standard of competence and behaviour expected of trustees in all situations. The statutory duty of care is founded on the premise that there is a baseline standard of care expected of all trustees when investing trust assets. This standard is that of the "reasonable trustee", as referred to in section 1 (1) of the Trustee Act. The law in South Africa does not provide sufficient guidance for trustees, particularly in the area of trustee investment. It could certainly benefit from the sort of review that led to the changes in the English law. Master...|$|E

30|$|As for the {{terminology}} in this paper, VC stands for venture capital, {{which is a}} type of financial capital that often goes to early-stage, high-risk ventures with novel technology/ideas. Investors, who own the financial capital, can be wealthy individuals, insurance companies, university endowments, pension funds, etc. They often pool their capital together forming a fund and delegate a financial institution to run it. VC firms are such financial institutions responsible for the profitability of the funds under their management. They collect management fees (a percentage of their managed funds) and carried interest (a proportion of the investment return) from their investors. Venture capitalists in this context are the investment executives of the VC firms and also the main objects of this study. Their <b>duties</b> are <b>to</b> identify <b>investing</b> opportunities among numerous candidate projects, monitor their investees’ operation (sometimes by joining the board of directors), provide information (by using their own resources and social networks), and prepare them to go public, be acquired, or be sold to another financial institution (which I call an “exit” throughout this paper). Portfolio companies are the investees, which receive funding from VC firms and cooperate with their venture capitalists in a number of ways.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine, using panel data econometric techniques, the {{determinants}} of a firm’s strategy <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in a conflict location. To the best of our knowledge this has not been done before. We use a large database of firm-level data that includes 2858 multinational firms that have a subsidiary in a developing country (during 1999 - 2006). Out of these firms 290 are classified as having a subsidiary in a conflict location. The choice of a conflict location is based on data from the Inter Country Risk Guide (ICRG). We start with the population of multinationals who have chosen <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in low income countries with weak institutions. Our analysis then proceeds to explain the decision of those firms <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in conflict locations.
