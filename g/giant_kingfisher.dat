50|$|Among the {{colourful}} {{family of}} kingfishers, which preferably occur near open water, the woodland kingfisher, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), swallow-tailed bee-eater (Merops hirundineus), <b>giant</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Ceryle maxima), malachite kingfisher (Alcedo cristata) and the blue-breasted kingfisher (Halcyon malimbica) are notable.|$|E
50|$|The first formal {{description}} of the <b>giant</b> <b>kingfisher</b> was by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1769 under the binomial name Alcedo maxima. The current genus Megaceryle was erected by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 the Goa Football Association {{agreed to}} a deal with <b>giants</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> to rename the Duler Stadium to the Kingfisher Stadium but in January 2009 the people of Mapusa started to reject a rename because despite the stadium being owned by the GFA the land the stadium is on belongs to the Mapusa Communidade.|$|R
5000|$|The {{previous}} {{view that}} the Megaceryle kingfishers arose in the New World from a specialist fish-eating Alcedinid ancestor which crossed the Bering Strait and gave rise to this genus and the American green kingfishers Chloroceryle, with a large crested species later, in the Pliocene, crossing the Atlantic Ocean to give rise to the <b>giant</b> and crested <b>kingfishers</b> [...] is probably wrong. Rather, it now seems that the genus probably originates in the Old World, possibly Africa, and the ancestor of the belted and ringed kingfishers made the ocean crossing ...|$|R
40|$|Lizards {{and birds}} are both popular model organisms in {{behavioural}} ecology, but {{the interactions between}} them have attracted little study. Given the putative importance of birds as predators of diurnal Lizards, it is of considerable interest to know which traits (of lizards as well as birds) influence {{the outcome of a}} predatory attempt. We studied predation by <b>giant</b> terrestrial <b>kingfishers</b> (kookaburras, Dacelo novaeguineae: Alcedinidae) on heliothermic diurnal lizards (highland water skinks, Eulamprus tympanum: Scincidae), with particular reference to the role of prey (lizard) size. Our approach was twofold: to gather direct evidence (sizes of lizards consumed in the field, compared to those available) and indirect evidence rite-related shifts in lizard behaviour). We quantified the size structure of a natural population of skinks (determined by an extensive mark-recapture program), and compared it to the sizes of wild lizards taken by kookaburras (determined by analysis of prey remains left at the birds 2 ̆ 7 nests,. Kookaburras showed size-based predation: they preyed mainly on small and medium-sized rather than large lizards in the field. However, the mechanism producing this bias remains elusive. It is not due to any distinctive behavioural attributes (locomotor ability, activity level, habitat usage) of the lizards of the size class disproportionately taken by the kookaburras. The greater vulnerability of subadult lizards may reflect subtle ontogenetic shifts in ecological and behavioural traits, but our data suggest that great caution is needed in inferring patterns of vulnerability to predation from indirect measures based on either the prey or the predator alone. Instead, we need direct observations on the interaction between the two...|$|R

50|$|The {{spangled}} kookaburra (Dacelo tyro) {{also called}} Aru <b>giant</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> is a little-known species of kookaburra {{found in the}} Aru Islands, Trans Fly savanna and grasslands of southern New Guinea and Australia. It has bright blue wings and tail, a white chest and belly, dark eyes, and a striking white-spotted black head. Practically nothing is known of its family life or breeding biology.|$|E
5000|$|The {{smallest}} {{species of}} kingfisher is the African dwarf kingfisher (Ispidina lecontei), which averages [...] {{in length and}} between [...] in weight. The largest kingfisher in Africa is the <b>giant</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Megaceryle maxima), which is [...] in length and [...] in weight. The familiar Australian kingfisher known as the laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae) is the heaviest species with females reaching nearly 500 g in weight.|$|E
50|$|KingfishersThe kingfishers {{are famous}} as hunters of fish, {{but not all}} species hunt fish or over water. Indeed, some hunt away from water, such as the brown-hooded kingfisher, which is a {{woodland}} species that hunts large insects and small vertebrates. Some South African species are among the largest of their kind, such as the <b>giant</b> <b>kingfisher</b> and the pied kingfisher. Others are the smallest, such as the malachite kingfisher.|$|E
50|$|All are {{specialist}} fish-eaters with prominent stiff crests {{on their}} heads. They have dark grey or bluish-grey upperparts, largely unmarked {{in the two}} American species, but heavily spotted with white in the Asian crested kingfisher and the African <b>giant</b> <b>kingfisher.</b> The underparts may be white or rufous, and all forms have a contrasting breast band except male ringed kingfisher. The underpart pattern is always different for the two sexes of each species.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>kingfisher</b> is monogamous and {{a solitary}} breeder. The nest {{is a long}} {{horizontal}} tunnel that is excavated into a river bank by both sexes using their feet and bills. The entrance hole is [...] high and [...] wide.

5000|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>kingfisher</b> is [...] long, {{with a large}} shaggy crest, a {{large black}} bill and fine white spots on black upperparts. The male has a {{chestnut}} breast band and otherwise white underparts with dark flank barring. The female has a white-spotted black breast band and a chestnut belly. The forest race M. m. gigantea is darker, less spotted above, and more barred below than the nominate race, but the two forms intergrade along the forest edge zone.|$|E
50|$|Not {{longer than}} 5 {{million years ago}} - {{possibly}} as recently as 2.9 million years ago - an Old World <b>giant</b> <b>kingfisher</b> became the ancestor of the belted and ringed kingfishers, and later, another species related to the pied kingfisher became the ancestor of the Chloroceryle green kingfishers after colonizing the Americas. While the evolutionary history of the water kingfishers in regard to their internal relationships is well resolved, it is not entirely clear whether they evolved from river kingfishers or tree kingfishers, and whether they immigrated across the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean (though the former seems more likely).|$|E

50|$|Like all Coraciiformes, the kingfishers are cavity nesters, {{with most}} species nesting in holes dug in the ground. These holes are usually in earth banks {{on the sides}} of rivers, lakes or {{man-made}} ditches. Some species may nest in holes in trees, the earth clinging to the roots of an uprooted tree, or arboreal nests of termites (termitarium). These termite nests are common in forest species. The nests {{take the form of a}} small chamber at the end of a tunnel. Nest-digging duties are shared between the genders. During the initial excavations, the bird may fly at the chosen site with considerable force, and birds have injured themselves fatally while doing this. The length of the tunnels varies by species and location; nests in termitariums are necessarily much shorter than those dug into the earth, and nests in harder substrates are shorter than those in soft soil or sand. The longest tunnels recorded are those of the <b>giant</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> which have been found to be 8.5 m long.|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} patterns in selected components of the ichthyofauna and piscivorous avifauna in the small temporarily open/closed Riet River Estuary located on the eastern seaboard of southern Africa was investigated monthly over the period August 2005 to July 2006. The ichthyofauna within the littoral zone of the estuary was sampled using a 5 m seine net (8 stations) while a 30 m seine net (4 stations) was employed to sample {{the fish in the}} channel. Bird counts were made along repeat transects {{along the length of the}} estuary. Total ichthyofaunal abundances and biomass ranged between 1. 60 and 8. 67 individuals m⁻² and 0. 45 to 21. 76 g wwt m⁻² within the littoral zone, and between 0. 08 and 0. 44 individuals m⁻² and 0. 58 and 36. 52 g wwt m⁻² in the channel of the estuary. The highest values were generally recorded during the summer months. Results of the numerical analysis indicated that the breaching events recorded over the study period did not lead to a common trend in the ichthyofaunal community. In the absence of a link to the marine environment, the ichthyofaunal community in the littoral zone was numerically dominated by the estuarine resident species, Gilchristella aestuaria and to a lesser extent by Glossogobius callidus, which collectively accounted for ca. 54 % of the total ichthyofauna sampled. The establishment of a link to the marine environment coincided with increased numbers of marine breeding species including Atherina breviceps and Rhabdosargus holubi to total fish counts within the estuary. Hierarchical cluster analysis did not identify any spatial patterns in the community structure of the ichthyofauna in the littoral zone or channel zone of the estuary, which could likely be linked to the absence of any distinct horizontal patterns in salinity and temperature within the system. A total of thirteen piscivorous bird species was recorded over the study period. Of the recorded species, six species were wading piscivores, four species were aerial divers and the remaining three species were pursuit swimmers. There were no significant correlations between the estimates of the ichthyofaunal abundance and biomass and bird numbers evident during the study (P> 0. 05 in both cases). The Reed Cormorant (Phalacrocorax africanus) was the dominant species throughout the study, with a mean of 8. 25 (SD ± 7. 90) individuals per count. Mean values of the Pied Kingfisher (Ceryle rudis) and <b>Giant</b> <b>Kingfisher</b> (Megaceryle maximus) were 3. 42 (SD ± 1. 20) and 1. 17 (SD ± 0. 60) individuals per count, respectively. The remaining species revealed mean values < 0. 5 individuals per count. The highest bird numbers were recorded in winter reflecting the migration of large numbers of the Reed Cormorant into the system. Breaching events were associated with a decrease in total bird numbers, which was most likely due to loss of potential foraging habitat (littoral zone) for waders resulting from reduced water levels. Monthly food consumption by all piscivorous birds revealed large temporal variability, ranging from 26. 35 to 140. 58 kg per month. The observed variability could be linked to mouth phase and bird numbers...|$|E
