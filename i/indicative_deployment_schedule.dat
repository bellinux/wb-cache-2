40|$|The United States {{military}} strategy is currently focusing on Major Regional Conflicts (MRCs), {{rather than on}} a single, major war. The Plural NRC model, PaMM, is an integer programming model and solution procedure that develops <b>deployment</b> <b>schedules</b> for active duty Army combat divisions to two nearly simultaneous MRCs without perfect information regarding the second NRC. PaMM develops the <b>deployment</b> <b>schedules</b> using a sequential heuristic: It first solves the optimal <b>deployment</b> <b>schedules</b> for a single NRC, fixes all movement that occurs before the hypothesized start date of a second NRC, and solves the resulting problem for both NRCs. The sequential technique is robust: Using a hypothetical scenario where all divisions for the first NRC are required within the first 30 days, PaMM is run six times, varying the time difference between the start dates of the NRCs form 10 to 60 days. The <b>deployment</b> <b>schedules</b> for the first NRC are comparable to the 'optimal' <b>deployment</b> <b>schedules</b> created using perfect information. NANAU. S. Army (USA) autho...|$|R

This algorithm is {{fast enough to}} perform in situ within low-fidelity fuel cycle simulators. It uses Gaussian process regression models to predict the production curve {{as a function of}} time and the number of deployed facilities. Each of these predictions is measured against the demand curve using the dynamic time warping distance. The minimum distance <b>deployment</b> <b>schedule</b> is evaluated in a full fuel cycle simulation, whose generated production curve then informs the model on the next optimization iteration. The method converges within five to ten iterations to a distance that is {{less than one percent of}} the total deployable production.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Navy's peacetime mission is 'to conduct forward presence operations to help shape the strategic environment by deterring conflict, building interoperability, and by responding, as necessary, to fast breaking crises with the demonstration {{and application of}} credible combat power. 'To meet this mission, the Navy deploys aircraft carriers to forward positions throughout the world. A new nuclear powered aircraft carrier costs over $ 3. 4 billion dollars and when deployed carries over 6, 000 personnel onboard. Considering the cost and the man hours involved in carrier operations judicious and effective use of these valuable assets is imperative. The CINCPACFLT Operations Department maintains a five year deployment plan for the six carriers assigned to the Pacific Fleet. Currently, the <b>deployment</b> <b>schedule</b> is produced manually. A feasible five year plan typically takes the carrier scheduling officer one week to generate. This thesis presents an optimization based tool to assist in constructing <b>deployment</b> <b>schedules</b> that maximize the forward presence of Pacific Fleet carriers. The underlying optimization model is different {{from those in the}} literature. Instead of using a set covering approach, the problem is formulated as a shortest path problem with side constraints. This formulation allows the problem to be solved more rapidly, thus allowing more opportunities for sensitivity and trade-off analyses. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

50|$|In pre-internet {{software}} deployments, deployments (and their {{closely related}} cousin, new software releases) were of necessity expensive, infrequent, bulky affairs. It is arguable therefore that {{the spread of}} the internet made end-to-end agile software development possible.

This also meant that typically, <b>deployment</b> <b>schedules</b> were now determined by the software supplier, not by the customers. Such flexibility led to the rise of continuous delivery as a viable option, especially for less risky web applications.|$|R
