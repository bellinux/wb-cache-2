With frequent gunnery drill, the ships showed marked improvement in performance compared to the early days with the Fleet.

5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the system was determined not by how long a sensor would last in the field, but by the adequacy of coverage by a particular string of sensors. For instance, a well placed string with several failed sensors was more effective than a fully functional string placed in the wrong location. The electronic data was, however, only as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> human analysts and operators at the ISC. The knack of timely sensor activation depended on careful study of device locations and the patterns of PAVN logistical behavior.|$|E

5|$|An {{average of}} 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an {{estimated}} 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted {{that it was not}} as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> opening ceremony. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would have understood the nods to British film and television. George Michael was roundly criticised for his song choice while Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Russell Brand were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, and other high-profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony. NBC in the United States and Prime TV in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony. There was also a concert in Hyde Park to close the Olympics, featuring Blur, New Order, and The Specials.|$|E
5|$|In December 1939, Massey {{joined a}} {{group at the}} Admiralty Research Laboratory in Teddington led by Stephen Butterworth. They were soon joined {{by a number of}} other physicists, {{including}} Bates, Buckingham, Francis Crick and John Gunn. Together, they came up with a series of countermeasures that enable the Navy to successfully sweep the mines. With this in hand, Massey became Deputy Chief Scientist to the Scientific Section of Mine Design Department at the Admiralty Mining Establishment in Havant in early 1941. This time, the job was to create mines as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> German ones. Massey brought his team with him. While Bates worked on packaging to protect the mine when it was dropped from an aircraft, Buckingham and Gunn calculated its theoretical effectiveness, and Crick designed the circuitry. Their mine codenamed MX, was soon in service, and the group turned its attention to developing acoustic or pressure mines. On the retirement of A. B. Wood in 1943, Massey became Chief Scientist at Havant.|$|E
5|$|In the Northern Territory, P. fimbriata has {{no special}} tactics against other jumping spiders {{and tries to}} treat {{them as if they}} were web spiders, and then either tries to jump on them or gives up. Hence this variant is poor at {{catching}} other jumping spiders. The Northern Territory variant of P. fimbriata is not as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Queensland one as catching web spiders, but better than the Sri Lanka variant and some other species of Portia. It is not enthusiastic about pursuing insects, but very good at catching those it pursues, as the performance table above shows While pursuits by the Queensland variant typically take 26minutes, those of the Northern Territory variant typically take 3 to 5minutes, like some other species of Portia.|$|E

5|$|Located to the {{southeast}} of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and {{to the west of}} a low to mid-level ridge, Omar took a counter-clockwise turn on October14. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening. Later that day, an 11.5 to 17.2mi (18.5 to 27.7km) wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough. With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75mph (120km/h), signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane. The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared Puerto Rico. Shortly after, the eye quickly became well-defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> storm featured well-developed outflow and prominent banding features.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} not as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned {{that she would never}} find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 3 was {{released}} for the Microsoft Windows and Dreamcast platforms in 2000, featuring enhanced 3D character models and higher resolution graphics. The Dreamcast version includes more alternate costumes {{than in the}} PlayStation version. Critical reception for these ports was not as positive. The Microsoft Windows version was criticized for not being optimized for keyboard and mouse and for not letting players save their progress at any time. Critics noted {{that some of the}} pre-rendered backgrounds in the Dreamcast version of the game were not improved, resulting in them looking not as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation version's due to the Dreamcast's higher graphic fidelity. CVC generally praised the Dreamcast version, but admitted that the difference in graphical quality between Resident Evil 3 and Code: Veronica was very large.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the number}} of pack animals and {{carriers}} was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five {{were found to be}} in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the 25th Infantry Brigade was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, {{and despite the fact that}} there were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was <b>good.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.|$|E
5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>The</b> Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.|$|E
5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E
