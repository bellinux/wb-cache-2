5|$|September 4, 2010 – The island {{experiences}} <b>inclement</b> <b>weather</b> {{from the}} remnants of Tropical Storm Fiona.|$|E
5|$|By 1918 the two {{surviving}} Invincibles {{carried a}} Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter on flying-off ramps fitted {{on top of}} 'P' and 'Q' turrets. Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during <b>inclement</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{regiment}} {{was moved}} to Camp Supply, with some difficulty {{due to lack of}} familiarity with the terrain and the <b>inclement</b> winter <b>weather,</b> arriving only after guides from the camp intercepted them.|$|R
50|$|Only once they'd begun their circumnavigation {{did they}} realise just how {{challenging}} the weather would be. They {{knew that the}} <b>inclement</b> winter <b>weather</b> would cause delays but they could never have predicted how often and how long these delays would be.|$|R
50|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{facilities to}} be established in Botwood was by Newfoundland born Captain Sydney Bennett (1897-1945) and Australian-born Major Sidney Cotton (1894-1969). It became host to many dignitaries and celebrities, some as part of official delegations and others who were stalled there waiting out <b>inclement</b> flying <b>weather.</b> Among those were Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh in 1933.|$|R
5|$|In Michigan's 2011 {{season opener}} against Western Michigan, Robinson {{completed}} 9 of 13 passes for 98 yards and had 46 rushing yards on eight carries. The game was ended with 1:27 {{left in the}} third quarter due to <b>inclement</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mountain Grove Campground was {{affected}} relatively little by storms, {{as compared to}} other camp meeting sites in the area. However, in 1889, attendance of the camp meeting was significantly affected by <b>inclement</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{provisional}} fixture {{list was}} released on 14 June 2007, but was subject {{to change in the}} event of clashes with other competitions, <b>inclement</b> <b>weather,</b> or matches being selected for television coverage.|$|E
5000|$|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is {{a legendary}} reindeer, created by Robert Lewis May, usually {{depicted}} as a young fawn who barely has antlers, with a glowing red nose, popularly known as [...] "Santa's ninth reindeer." [...] When depicted, he is the lead reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve. The luminosity of his nose {{is so great that}} it illuminates the team's path through <b>inclement</b> winter <b>weather.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2011, the National Science Foundation granted $11 {{million to}} modify an A-10 for weather {{research}} for CIRPAS at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and {{in collaboration with}} scientists from the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology (SDSM), replacing SDSM's retired North American T-28 Trojan. The A-10's armor is expected {{to allow it to}} survive the extreme meteorological conditions, such as 200mph hailstorms, found in <b>inclement</b> high-altitude <b>weather</b> events.|$|R
25|$|Various {{organizational}} clothing items may be {{worn with}} the utility uniform during <b>inclement</b> or cold <b>weather,</b> {{to include the}} All Purpose Environmental Clothing System (APECS) parka and trousers, the Combat Desert Jacket, or rain poncho.|$|R
5|$|In the ride's debut year, Busch Gardens Williamsburg {{had lower}} than {{expected}} levels of attendance. This {{was attributed to}} prolonged periods of <b>inclement</b> <b>weather.</b> As a result of this, the park planned to re-launch Apollo's Chariot in 2000 {{in an attempt to}} drive attendance.|$|E
5|$|The {{provisional}} fixture {{list was}} released on 19 June 2003, but was subject {{to change in the}} event of clashes with other competitions, international football, <b>inclement</b> <b>weather,</b> or matches chosen for television coverage. Five of Arsenal's first eight fixtures were broadcast on Sky Sports, three of which were on the network's flagship programme Super Sunday.|$|E
5|$|As part of Romblon, Banton is {{classified}} under Type III of the Corona climatic classification system. This type of climate {{is described as}} having no prominent wet or dry seasons. The wet season, which usually occurs from June to November can extend up to December during {{the onset of the}} southwest monsoon. The dry season from January to May may sometimes have periods of rainfall or even <b>inclement</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
25|$|Archer, {{along with}} many other {{officers}} captured at Gettysburg, was eventually sent to the Johnson's Island prisoner of war camp on the coast of Lake Erie, where his health rapidly declined due to exposure to the <b>inclement</b> Ohio <b>weather.</b> He {{wrote a letter to the}} Confederate War Department in which he advocated a plot to overthrow the guards, but the conspirators would require assistance from the government to get the men back home.|$|R
25|$|Grey {{all-weather}} coat (which is a double-breasted trenchcoat with removable liner) {{is authorized}} for wear with all uniforms during <b>inclement</b> and cold <b>weather</b> (ceremonial units at Marine Barracks, 8th {{have their own}} special Dress-blue trenchcoat with red piping).|$|R
40|$|The {{homeless}} {{population in}} Anchorage, Alaska faces many unique challenges. Over {{the past several}} winters, a number of homeless individuals have succumbed {{to the effects of}} exposure despite available cold weather services. This study investigated individual experiences within the homeless population of Anchorage, Alaska during times of <b>inclement</b> winter <b>weather.</b> Self-determination theory was used to explore motivations of behaviors of the population and to uncover the reasons why this population does not use cold weather services offered by the Municipality of Anchorage. The research questions addressed participant awareness of available cold weather services, survival strategies during <b>inclement</b> winter <b>weather,</b> and barriers to cold weather service use. This phenomenological study examined those lived experiences. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit eligible individuals (n = 14) at a local soup kitchen, and participants engaged in semistructured interviews. Data analysis procedures used McCormack 2 ̆ 7 s lenses and horizontalization to reveal emerging themes. Key findings included a lack of knowledge of emergency services, various survival strategies, and self-imposed barriers to services. The implications of these emerging revelations may positively influence public health providers to modify education delivery methods and interventions used to reach the homeless population in Anchorage, Alaska, with the ultimate goal of preventing wintertime mortalities...|$|R
5|$|By 1918, New Zealand carried two aircraft, a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1½ Strutter, on flying-off ramps fitted {{on top of}} 'P' and 'Q' turrets. The Pup was {{intended}} to shoot down Zeppelins while the 1½ Strutter was used for spotting and reconnaissance. Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during <b>inclement</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} threat of strong {{thunderstorms}} and gusts, Florida was spared {{a direct hit}} from Nicole. The storm skirted the state with only showers; 12.71inches (323mm) of rain were recorded at North Key Largo, though the mainland received much smaller quantities. The storm flooded streets in Miami Beach and the northern Florida Keys, {{as well as one}} home. Similarly, <b>inclement</b> <b>weather</b> spread over the northwestern Bahamas without significant consequences.|$|E
5|$|Electronic {{tactical}} {{air navigation}} (TACAN) became an absolute necessity in Laos, where mountain peaks and unexpected <b>inclement</b> <b>weather</b> made flying extremely hazardous, especially for older aircraft. This problem was solved by establishing unmanned Air Force stations that broadcast continuous radio transmissions, allowing aerial navigation from fixed geographic reference points. The Air Force also emplaced TSQ-81 radar {{sites in the}} north and northeast to direct Rolling Thunder missions over North Vietnam.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{commissioned}} as a {{captain in the}} United States Air Force {{at the start of}} World War II and stationed in the Aleutian Islands as a war artist. The <b>inclement,</b> damp <b>weather</b> demanded that Pleissner work in watercolors because they dried faster than oil paints. But Pleissner recalled that even watercolors were difficult to use in the wet climate: “ I would go out to do these watercolors and it was so damn wet nothing would dry... I used to put out a few big washes and then run {{into and out of the}} huts where there was a fire and dry it and go out again.” ...|$|R
5000|$|On 6 November 1917, he {{was shot}} down again, this time by [...] "friendly" [...] fire from a Canadian ground machine gunner. Two days later, he set a D.V aflame and drove down another out of control. On 13 November, he {{destroyed}} a Junkers J.I. As he was poised tantalizingly {{on the brink of}} acedom, his squadron used the <b>inclement</b> flying <b>weather</b> of winter to shift to Italy to oppose the Austro-Hungarians. Once there, Williams became an ace on 10 January 1918, and followed up with two more wins in January. He would score once more while in 45 Squadron, on 27 March 1918.|$|R
50|$|By March 1944, the B-29 {{modification}} {{program had}} fallen into complete chaos, with absolutely no bombers being considered as combat-ready. Alarmed at {{the slow pace of}} bringing adequate numbers of Superfortress into service, General Hap Arnold, head of the Army Air Forces, directed that his assistant, Major General B. E. Meyer, personally take charge of the entire modification program. Most of the B-29s were still held up at the modification centers, awaiting conversion to full combat readiness. The program was seriously hampered by the need to work in the open air in <b>inclement</b> winter <b>weather,</b> by delays in acquiring the necessary tools and support equipment, and by the USAAF's general lack of experience with the B-29.|$|R
5|$|In cold or <b>inclement</b> <b>weather,</b> several {{nightjar}} {{species can}} slow their metabolism {{and go into}} torpor, notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks. The European nightjar has been observed in captivity {{to be able to}} maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 1992 Morris {{performed}} at the Concert for Life at Centennial Park in Sydney—a fund raiser for the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Centre—with Crowded House, Def FX, Diesel, INXS, Ratcat and Yothu Yindi. Due to <b>inclement</b> <b>weather</b> an expected attendance of 100,000 never eventuated and, with the event only raising $500,000, scandal was expressed in the media over funding distribution.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September 2006, Irwin was on {{location}} at Batt Reef, near Port Douglas, Queensland, {{taking part in}} the production of the documentary series Ocean's Deadliest. During a lull in filming caused by <b>inclement</b> <b>weather,</b> Irwin decided to snorkel in shallow waters while being filmed in an effort to provide footage for his daughter's television programme.|$|E
5000|$|On Friday, 11 February 1955, Lefaucheux was {{scheduled}} to give a presentation to Catholic students in Strasbourg. Despite <b>inclement</b> icy <b>weather,</b> Lefaucheux, an avid motorist, decided {{at the last minute}} to travel by car [...] - [...] placing his suitcase not in the trunk, but on the rear seat of his Renault Frégate. Approaching Saint-Dizier from the West, on the Route Nationale 4 (N4), he encountered a detour, which at the last moment he tried to follow. The road surface was covered with black ice, the car spun, rolled over and landed on its side in a field. Though the Frégate's passenger cell was largely intact, Lafaucheux's unsecured suitcase on the rear seat had struck him in the neck, killing him instantly. In his pocket, he carried a train ticket for the trip.|$|R
50|$|On 13 October 1972, a {{chartered}} Uruguayan Air Force twin turboprop Fairchild FH-227D {{was flying}} over the Andes carrying the Old Christians Club rugby union team from Montevideo, Uruguay, to play a match in Santiago, Chile. The trip had begun the day before when the Fairchild departed from Carrasco International Airport, but <b>inclement</b> mountain <b>weather</b> forced an overnight stop in Mendoza, Argentina. At the Fairchild's ceiling of 9000 m, the aircraft could not fly directly from Mendoza, over the Andes, to Santiago, {{in large part because}} of the weather. Instead, the pilots had to fly south from Mendoza parallel to the Andes, then turn west towards the mountains, fly through a low pass (Planchon), cross the mountains, and emerge on the Chilean side of the Andes south of Curicó before finally turning north and initiating descent into Santiago.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} daily atmospheric weather conditions on daily television use in the Netherlands for the period 1996 - 2005. The effects of the weather parameters are considered {{in the context of}} mood and mood management theory. It is proposed that <b>inclement</b> and uncomfortable <b>weather</b> conditions are associated with lower human mood, and that watching entertainment and avoiding informational programs may serve to repair such mood. We consequently hypothesize that people spend more time watching television if <b>inclement</b> and uncomfortable <b>weather</b> conditions (low temperatures, little sunshine, much precipitation, high wind velocity, less daylight) coincide with more airtime for entertainment programs, but that they view less if the same weather conditions coincide with more airtime devoted to information fare. We put this interaction thesis to a test using a time series analysis of daily television viewing data of the Dutch audience obtained from telemeters (T = 3, 653), merged with meteorological weather station statistics and program broadcast figures, whilst controlling for a wide array of recurrent and one-time societal events. The results provide substantial support for the proposed interaction of program airtime and the weather parameters temperature and sunshine on aggregate television viewing time. Implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Since Bret {{remained}} {{over the}} open Atlantic {{for most of}} its existence, its effects on land were limited. While moving little, the storm produced <b>inclement</b> <b>weather</b> and widespread cloudiness over much of the north-central Bahamas. Squalls off the eastern coast of Florida generated rough seas along coastlines, injuring a number of people. Although it stayed well offshore, the storm enhanced tropical moisture over Bermuda, causing beneficial rainfall in dry areas.|$|E
5|$|Spokane has {{an average}} Walk Score of 47.6, {{indicating}} most errands require a car, {{and an average}} Bike Score of 48.6. The extensive skywalk system covers thirteen blocks {{in the downtown area}} and is among the largest in the United States; it is used for pedestrian travel in cold and <b>inclement</b> <b>weather</b> and retail space as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} played in {{extremely}} cold and icy conditions, still the worst in Sun Bowl history. Three inches of snow fell {{on top of a}} layer of frozen rain the day before the game, and at kickoff the teams took the field under cloudy skies and in below-freezing temperatures. Despite the <b>inclement</b> <b>weather,</b> 15,000-seat Kidd Field was approximately half full, and bowl officials estimated the crowd at around 10,000 people.|$|E
5000|$|Christkindlesmarkt {{could be}} {{translated}} {{word for word}} as [...] "Christ Child Market". The Nuremberg Christkind or Christ Child, a young woman dressed in white and gold, with curly blond hair, a tall golden crown and angel-wing-like long golden sleeves, {{is an important part}} of the market. Initially impersonated by an actress, since 1969 the Christkind has been elected every second year among local girls between 16 and 19 years of age. A large number of competitors enter via the Internet, finally a jury chooses the next Christkind out of several finalists who have to be at least 1,60m tall and free from giddiness as the Christkind has to make her speech from the church balcony, secured with a rope, possibly in <b>inclement</b> winter <b>weather.</b> Besides the opening speech on every Friday evening, the Christkind appears in schools, hospitals etc. In 2015 Barbara Otto succeeded Teresa Treuheit.|$|R
50|$|Western {{pygmy possums}} {{have the ability}} to enter torpor during <b>inclement</b> or cold <b>weather,</b> {{enabling}} them to conserve energy and food reserves. During bouts of torpor, which may last for up to seven days at a time, body temperature falls to within one degree Celsius of ambient, and oxygen consumption to just 1% of normal. They sleep on their fronts, with their ears folded over their eyes, and their long tails coiled beneath their bodies. Compared with other mammals of similar size, they rouse from torpor unusually quickly.|$|R
500|$|Sea Mither is {{a spirit}} of summer days that quells the {{turbulent}} sea waters around the northern isles of Scotland. Shetland islanders, particularly fishermen, seek her protection from the Devil. Control of the seas is maintained by Teran, the spirit of winter, until Sea Mither arrives {{around the time of}} the vernal equinox in mid-March. Both spirits are invisible to humans. Teran is her arch-enemy and the pair fight bitterly, often for weeks as she tries to gain control. Their arguments cause gale force winds and heavy tumultuous seas as she tries to wrest control from him. Teran's screeches are carried by the howling gales as the two spirits try to oust each other. The period of the spring combat between the pair is termed the Vore tullye or the [...] "spring struggle". Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran, relegating him to the depths of the ocean; <b>inclement</b> summer <b>weather</b> is caused by Teran's attempts to escape.|$|R
