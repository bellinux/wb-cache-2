5|$|Writer and {{producer}} Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited {{his parents in}} St. Louis, Missouri {{after the release of}} Used Cars. Searching their basement, Gale found his father's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class. Gale thought about the president of his own graduating class, who was someone {{he had nothing to do}} with. Gale wondered whether he would have been friends with his father <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> to high school together. When he returned to California, he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept. Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when, in fact, she was highly promiscuous. The two took the project to Columbia Pictures, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.|$|E

25|$|Unauthorized {{productions}} {{and events}} featuring the show's characters have {{attracted the attention}} of the shows distributor. In February 2016, several Greene King pubs in the U.K. scheduled breakfast events with costumed characters modelled after the pups. Nickelodeon forced the chain to stop every event by threatening a lawsuit <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> ahead. There was some consumer backlash as a result, but the events were not held.|$|E

In some stories children are told that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> {{out in the morning}} they will die from the heat of the sun, and in the night <b>they</b> are told <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> out an animal called nyama will eat them.|$|R
25|$|Johnson {{was given}} a regular column in The Spectator, The Daily Telegraph sister publication; it {{attracted}} mixed reviews and was often thought rushed. In 1999, he was also given a column on new cars in the magazine GQ. His behaviour regularly annoyed his editors; those at GQ were frustrated by {{the large number of}} parking fines that Johnson acquired while testing cars for them, while he was consistently late in providing his columns for The Telegraph and The Spectator, forcing many staff to stay late to accommodate him; they related that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> ahead and published without his work included, he would get angry and shout at them with expletives.|$|E
25|$|The NBA {{responded to}} CBS' actions by {{returning}} to a schedule that started later --- usually the last weekend in October --- and ended in mid-to-late-April, resulting in the NBA Finals ending after sweeps. In the 1979–1980 and 1980–1981 seasons, the NBA had experimented with ending the regular season {{at the end of}} March, thereby ensuring that the Finals were played in early-to-mid-May; starting with the 1981–1982 season, a late April regular-season finale was held, resulting in the finals starting in late May and stretching into June (for example, while the 1980 Finals were slated for May 4 to 18 <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> seven games, and the 1981 Finals for May 5–17, the 1982 Finals were scheduled for May 27 to June 10).|$|E
25|$|Fannie stock plunged. Some {{worried that}} Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others {{worried about a}} {{government}} seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson {{as well as the}} White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic. Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.|$|E

60|$|I {{have seen}} that great men's little {{children}} must go no whither without their nurses be at hand. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> abroad, their nurses must <b>go</b> with them; <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to meals, their nurses must <b>go</b> with them; <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to bed, their nurses must go with them; yea, and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> fall asleep, their nurses must stand by them. O my brethren, those little ones that fear the Lord, they are {{the children of the}} highest, therefore they shall not walk alone, be at their spiritual meats alone, go to their sick-beds, or to their graves alone; the salvation of their God is nigh them, to deliver them from the evil. This is then the glory that dwells in the land of them that fear the Lord.|$|R
5000|$|Colours {{are often}} {{assigned}} simply {{with an eye}} toward making sure that no two trails that intersect use the same one, but it can go further than that. On all state land in New York's Catskill Park, for instance, primary trails, especially longer [...] "trunk trails" [...] that go great distances, use red markers <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> in a generally east-west direction and blue <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> north-south. Shorter spur, loop or connector trails generally use yellow blazes.|$|R
25|$|The duo {{spent most}} of the journey on Northmoor in the hold, where their Czech compatriots had created a {{sleeping}} area for them. The rest of the refugees spent their time on deck. However, Bozděch was concerned about their likelihood of survival {{in the event of a}} U-boat attack. The first attack came two days after the convoy left Gibraltar, resulting in the companying destroyers spreading out and dropping depth charges. The attack seemed to subside after a few hours, with man and dog staying below decks the whole time because of the risk of Ant's discovery <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> above decks. The submarine attack was followed up by a group of Junkers Ju 88s, when instead of remaining below decks, Bozděch took Ant up onto the upper deck; they were not discovered in the chaos. Northmoor was indirectly damaged by the action, as it developed an engine fault after steaming too fast and too long.|$|E
25|$|Finally a {{settlement}} {{seemed to have}} been reached when the rebel officers asked to see Mazaki on the 27th. Mazaki, accompanied by two other members of the SMC (Nobuyuki Abe and Yoshikazu Nishi), arrived at the Ministry of War at 16:00. Gathered there were all the rebel officers except Andō and Kurihara, who were in charge of the troops outside, and Kōno, who was still hospitalized. The rebels told Mazaki that they were entrusting everything to him. Mazaki thanked them, but explained that he could do nothing until they returned to their units. He also stated that he would fight them himself <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> against the Emperor's wishes. The rebels replied that if they received a formal order to return, they would of course obey it. Following the meeting, both Mazaki and the rebel officers were relieved. Mazaki believed the rebel officers would leave without violence and the rebels were apparently convinced that a Mazaki cabinet would be formed shortly after they did so. Kashii issued orders for the troops to stay the night in the buildings they had occupied and reported to the Emperor that the situation would be resolved by the morning.|$|E
500|$|Some of Soeman's {{characters}} are not identified as indigenous Indonesians, including Nona (her name being common among the ethnic Chinese) and Sir Joon (a Eurasian). This was, in part, {{a bid to}} attract readers of different cultural backgrounds, {{as well as those}} living in Singapore. It also served to soften Soeman's criticism. In an interview, Soeman recalled: [...] "My stories always challenged the stiff adat. So to show this, my characters were always outsiders, who could be better accepted <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> against adat. That was my strategy, as an author, so my stories could be accepted." ...|$|E

500|$|Keating and Rep. Aaron Schock jointly {{introduced}} the Equitable Access to Care and Health Act (H.R. 1814; 113th Congress) on April 29, 2013. The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code, {{with respect to}} minimum essential health care coverage requirements added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to allow an additional religious exemption from such requirements for individuals whose sincerely held religious beliefs would cause them to object to medical health care provided under such coverage. Individuals could file an affidavit to get this exemption, but would lose the exemption <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> on to later use healthcare. Schock and Keating wrote a letter in support of their bill saying, [...] "we believe the EACH Act balances a respect for religious diversity against the need to prevent fraud and abuse." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1923, the Victoria Police went on strike, and Monash and McCay {{established}} a Special Constabulary Force {{to carry out}} police duties. After the Chief Commissioner, Alexander Nicholson, resigned for ill-health in 1925, Chauvel recommended Blamey for the post. He became Chief Commissioner on 1 September 1925 for a five-year term, with a salary of £1,500 per annum (A$ in 2008 dollars). [...] Blamey set about addressing the grievances that had caused the strike, which he felt [...] "were just, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> the wrong way about them". Blamey improved pay and conditions, and implemented {{the recommendations of the}} Royal Commission into the strike. He attempted to introduce faster promotion based on merit, but this was unpopular with the Police Association, and was abandoned by his successors. As in the Army, he showed a willingness to adopt new ideas. He introduced police dogs, and increased the number of police cars equipped with two-way radios from one in 1925 to five in 1930. He also boosted the numbers of policewomen on the force.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{suffering}} a heavy defeat that could eliminate them, Rose worked out that if they batted first and declared within the first seven balls of their batting innings, it would not matter if they lost, as their bowling strike rate could not suffer sufficiently {{for them to be}} knocked out. There was no rule against declaring in one-day cricket, but Rose was aware that his plan was controversial. He discussed it with his teammates and there was no significant opposition–Derek Taylor, the wicket-keeper did not like the idea, but was not vociferous in the discussion. Rose sought clarification from Donald Carr, the chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), who administered cricket in England. Carr told Rose that his plan was legal, but against the spirit of the laws, and that he thought there would be repercussions <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> ahead with the plan. Roy Kerslake, the Somerset chairman, was with the team in Worcester and though he had reservations, he told Rose that he would [...] "support the team whatever their decision".|$|E

500|$|Starting from January 1909, the ATC sought {{authorization}} {{from baseball}} players {{for inclusion in}} the T206 series, which would feature 524 major league players, 76 of whom would later be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Wagner had been {{at the top of his}} game throughout the decade, and was even considered to be the game's greatest player at the time. He had appeared on advertisements for a number of other products such as chewing gum, gunpowder and soft drinks. Unsurprisingly, the ATC asked for Wagner's permission to have his picture on a baseball card. According to an October 12, 1912, issue of The Sporting News, Wagner did not give his consent to appear on the baseball card. In response to the authorization request letter sent by John Gruber, a Pittsburgh sportswriter hired by the ATC to seek Wagner's permission, Wagner wrote that he [...] "did not care to have his picture in a package of cigarettes." [...] He threatened to seek legal action against ATC <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> ahead and created his baseball card.|$|E
