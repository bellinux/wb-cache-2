Around 29 September 1376 he fell ill with a large abscess. After a brief period of recovery in February 1377, the king died of a stroke at Sheen on 21 June. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, King Richard II, son of the Black Prince, since the Black Prince himself had died on 8 June 1376.|$|E

The brothers attempted to assemble a live stage band that could replicate their studio sound. Lead guitarist Alan Kendall had come on board in 1971 but did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> until Mr. Natural. For that album, they added drummer Dennis Bryon, and they later added ex-Strawbs keyboard player Blue Weaver, completing the Bee Gees band that lasted through the late '70s. Maurice, who had previously performed on piano, guitar, harpsichord, electric piano, organ, mellotron and bass guitar, as well as mandolin and Moog synthesiser, now confined himself to bass onstage.|$|E
25|$|Unaware {{that the}} Crown Prince did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with {{the running of}} Army Group Crown Prince or the 5th Army, the Deuxième Bureau offered Zelle one million francs if she could seduce him and provide France with good {{intelligence}} about German plans. The fact that the Crown Prince had, before 1914, never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, and was now supposedly commanding both an army and an army group {{at the same time}} should have been a clue that his role in German decision-making was mostly nominal. Zelle's contact with the Deuxième Bureau was Captain Georges Ladoux, who was later to emerge as one of her principal accusers.|$|E
25|$|From the Hopkins Grammar School {{he went to}} Yale College, {{from which}} he was {{graduated}} with the class of 1861. There is scant information as to his four years at college. During that period he kept a diary from which he read extracts on the fifty-fifth reunion of his class, but this diary is not at present available. That the studious traits which he later manifested were not altogether lacking at this time may be inferred {{from the fact that}} he was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Skull & Bones. Such records as we have do not indicate that there was anything unusual about this young student who had among his classroom contemporaries the poet Edward Rowland Sill, and two others who like himself were later to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the life of the university, his friends Tracy Peck and Franklin Bowditch Dexter.|$|E

25|$|Matters are {{complicated}} further {{with the arrival}} of Jessica, a Bene Gesserit and the secret daughter of Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (though Jessica herself is unaware of her parentage). Jessica is presented to Leto as a gift from the Bene Gesserit, although the sisterhood has the ulterior motive of using the pair in their breeding program. At first, Leto refuses to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Jessica and tries to remain faithful to Kailea. However, as he and Kailea grow farther apart, he begins to seek out Jessica's company. Finally, Kailea is driven to make an attempt on Leto's life by having an explosive device planted on his skyclipper. At the last minute, Leto decides to take Victor and Rhombur along with him, and the boy dies instead. Leto is relatively unharmed, but Rhombur is reduced to little more than a charred lump of flesh. Fearing that Leto will guess that she is {{responsible for the death of}} their son and driven by guilt, Kailea kills her lady-in-waiting and then commits suicide by jumping out a window. The Tleilaxu offer to grow a ghola of Leto's deceased son in exchange for the barely alive body of Rhombur Vernius. Leto ultimately refuses, after much soul-searching, knowing that the Tleilaxu intend only harm towards House Vernius. Instead, Leto hires Dr. Wellington Yueh, an expert in the field of cybernetics, to fashion a cybernetic replacement body for Rhombur. Leto and Jessica fall deeply in love, leading Jessica to decide to conceive a son for Leto's sake, directly disobeying the Bene Gesserit's order that she have a daughter.|$|E
500|$|The {{music and}} sound effects {{received}} similar praise. GameSpot {{pointed out that}} [...] "explosions erupt with lots of satisfying, floor-rattling bass, lasers ping nicely, flamethrowers emit appropriate rumbling whooshes, and there's plenty of ambient beeping, hissing, and mechanical humming". Game Revolution praised the graphics for their [...] "modeling, colored lighting, incredible special effects, wonderful animation, [...] sheer overall feel". Victor Lucas of Electric Playground stated similar pros, but also admitted that the game's hardware requirements were relatively high. Criticism was leveled at the game's story. GameSpot considered it not compelling, while Jason Cross, writing for Computer Games Magazine, felt that it [...] "really doesn't <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with actual gameplay". PC Gamer reviewer Stephen Poole also criticized the Guide-Bot's efficiency, remarking that sometimes it can get lost or trapped while leading the player to a destination.|$|E
500|$|Zinta's next {{release of}} 2006 was Shirish Kunder's romantic musical Jaan-E-Mann, a story {{set in the}} United States about two men, played by Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar, who love the same woman. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and its {{eventual}} box office profit was poor. Zinta {{played the role of}} Piya, the cynosure of two men. She was mostly criticised for taking a role of minimal importance, though her performance was generally well received. Raja Sen labelled her role an [...] "ornament throughout," [...] but further stated that she [...] "comes vividly alive in the film's last scene, a moment that makes you lament why filmmakers today don't let the babyfaced actress have more fun instead of forcing her to sob copiously. She doesn't <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in Jaan-E-Mann, but looks appropriately attractive." [...] Zinta said that the film was a great relief after the more emotionally intense Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, as Jaan-E-Mann was [...] "easy, happy and much more simple".|$|E

500|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the first}} season in late May 2009, actor Kirk Acevedo {{announced}} he was [...] "fired" [...] off of the show from his Facebook page. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner denied it soon after, explaining that [...] "like all things on Fringe, there is more to this story than meets the eye" [...] and reminded viewers that an alternate version of his character had already appeared in a first season episode. Later that summer at Comic-Con in July he reiterated that [...] "rumors of Charlie's demise are premature," [...] and at the August Television Critics Association press tour he commented about Charlie possibly showing up in the previously visited parallel universe. [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] marked the actor's last appearance in the prime universe. In response to why the character was killed off, Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello reported that the [...] "storyline dictated. Charlie wasn't going to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this season, and rather than waste Kirk's time, they cut him loose". The character's doppelganger from the parallel universe returned in the season finale [...] "Over There".|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} and acting received a mixed reception. Stephen Godfrey of The Globe and Mail rated their performances highly: [...] "time has cemented Leonard Nimoy's look of inscrutability as Mr. Spock [...] DeForest Kelley as Dr. McCoy is as feisty as ever, and James Doohan as Scotty still splutters about his engineering woes. At a basic level, their exchanges {{are those of}} an odd assortment of grumpy, middle-aged men bickering about office politics. They are a relief from the stars, and a delight." [...] Godfrey's only concern was that the reunion of the old cast threatened to make casual viewers who had never seen Star Trek feel like uninvited guests. Martin considered the characters more likable than those in comparable science fiction films. Conversely, Arnold felt that the acting of the main cast (Shatner in particular) was poor; [...] "Shatner portrays Kirk as such a supercilious old twit that one rather wishes he'd been left behind that desk", he wrote. [...] "Shatner has perhaps the least impressive movie physique since Rod Steiger, and his acting style has begun to recall the worst of Richard Burton." [...] Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the actors did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the effects-driven film, and were [...] "limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at television monitors, usually in disbelief". Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta were more favorably received. Gene Siskel felt the film [...] "teeter towards being a crashing bore" [...] whenever Khambatta was not on screen, and Jack Kroll of Newsweek felt {{that she had the}} most memorable entrance in the film. [...] " [...] is sympathetic enough to make one hope she'll have a chance to show less skin and more hair in future films", Godfrey wrote.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Mark Braxton of Radio Times {{hailed the}} serial as [...] "Terry Nation's finest {{hour for the}} series", {{especially}} praising the creation of Davros. He was also positive towards Dudley Simpson's score and Davros's allies who were [...] "impeccably written and played" [...] from Nyder to Gharman. However, he was disappointed that Harry did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn noted that it contradicted some aspects of The Daleks but that it [...] " [...] the emotional target dead-on". He particularly praised Davros and Skaro. However, Bahn felt the [...] "major problem" [...] with the portrayal of the Daleks was that [...] "we're not given any choice but to view them as psychopathic murderers", and the Doctor came across as a [...] "catastrophically incompetent secret agent". DVD Talk's Stuart Galbraith gave Genesis of the Daleks {{four out of five}} stars, calling it as a [...] "real fan-pleaser" [...] and writing that Wisher was [...] "superb" [...] as Davros. While noting that the story [...] "is mostly concerned with action and suspense, which it does rather well", he felt it [...] "isn't especially original" [...] as it dealt with common time-travel issues, despite doing it in [...] "intelligent ways". In 2009, SFX listed the scene where the Daleks receive their first blaster as the thirteenth scariest moment of Doctor Who. The magazine also named the scene where Harry is attacked by a giant clam as one of the silliest Doctor Who moments, noting [...] "even the best Doctor Who stories have the occasional dropped stitch". Charlie Jane Anders of io9, in a 2010 article, listed the cliffhanger of Episode Four— in which the Doctor is forced to tell Davros how the Daleks will be defeated in the future— {{as one of the greatest}} Doctor Who cliffhangers.|$|E

500|$|John Beresford of TV Scoop {{felt that}} [...] "Meat" [...] finally {{provided}} [...] "a {{story that was}} well conceived, realised and paced" [...] opining that at last [...] "Torchwood came of age" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "easily the best Torchwood story so far." [...] He did have some problems such as [...] "really pathetic alien, the odd off-colour innuendo about alien [...] "meat" [...] and the lazy convenience of the amnesia pills" [...] but felt that these were relatively minor. The strongest points of the episode for him were the acting which he felt to be [...] "uniformly better than usual and on occasion almost incandescent" [...] and the dialogue which was [...] "so natural it didn’t actually sound like [...] "dialogue" [...] at all". Stephen James Walker, in his own analysis of the episode, gave a mostly favourable review. He criticised the alien space whale as the [...] "one less-than-wonderful" [...] aspect of the episode but praised the opening sequence {{and the use of the}} [...] "bleak industrial setting" [...] by director Colin Teague. He felt that the expanded role of Rhys was one of the most pleasing aspects of the scripts and praised the humorous interactions that constituted [...] "male bonding" [...] between him and Jack. He singled out a scene where Gwen turns [...] "a gesture of affection" [...] toward Rhys [...] "into a teasing come-on" [...] to Jack by making eye-contact with the latter whilst kissing the former as characteristic of the [...] "moral ambiguity" [...] which makes her [...] "such a great character". He also felt that whilst they did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Tosh, Owen and Ianto had some good scenes which further demonstrated [...] "Tregenna's adeptness at handling the show's regular characters".|$|E

2500|$|John Corrill {{recalled}} that [...] "the first presidency {{did not seem}} to <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with [...] at first", and some of the Danites clearly saw this sermon as a sign of approval. The matter was tabled until the following Sunday (June 17, 1838) when Sidney Rigdon preached his Salt Sermon, in which he likened the dissenters to [...] "salt that had lost its savor." [...] He went on to state that the dissenters would be [...] "trodden under the foot of men." [...] Corrill stated that [...] "although [...] did not give names in his sermon, yet it was plainly understood that he meant the dissenters or those who had denied the faith." [...] Rigdon's strongly worded sermon may have {{played a significant role in}} encouraging the dissenters to leave the county.|$|E
2500|$|In 1667, Johann Joachim Becher {{published}} his book Physica subterranea, which contained {{the first instance}} of {{what would become the}} phlogiston theory. In his book, Becher eliminated fire, water, and air from the classical element model and replaced them with three forms of earth: terra lapidea, terra fluida, and terra pinguis. [...] Terra pinguis was the element that imparted oily, sulphurous, or combustible properties. [...] Becher believed that terra pinguis was a key feature of combustion and was released when combustible substances were burned. Becher did not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with phlogiston theory as we know it now, but he had a large influence on his student Stahl. Becher's main contribution was the start of the theory itself, however much it was changed after him. Becher's idea was that combustible substances contain an ignitable matter, the terra pinguis.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the themes}} in the story {{involves}} the tension between destiny and self-determination. According to Richard Gillmore, the main characters are torn between a sense of inevitability, [...] "that the world goes on its way {{and that it does}} not <b>have</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with human desires and concerns", and the notion that our futures are inextricably connected to our own past actions. Enda McCaffrey details a character who refuses to acknowledge his own agency, noting that Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) ignores repeated reminders that he doesn't have to behave as he does and suggesting that by relegating the lives of Carla and the gas station clerk to a coin toss, he hands [...] "responsibility over to 'fate' in an act of bad faith that prevents him from taking responsibility for his own ethical choices." ...|$|E
