40|$|Saponin-based {{adjuvants}} (SBAs) {{are being}} used in animal and human (cancer) vaccines, as they induce protective cellular immunity. Their adjuvant potency is a factor of inflammasome activation and enhanced antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells (DCs), but how antigen cross-presentation is induced is not clear. Here we show that SBAs uniquely induce intracellular lipid bodies (LBs) in the CD 11 b+ DC subset in vitro and in vivo. Using genetic and pharmacological interference in models for vaccination and in situ tumour ablation, we demonstrate that LB induction is causally related to the saponin-dependent increase in cross-presentation and T-cell activation. These findings link adjuvant activity to LB <b>formation,</b> <b>aid</b> the application of SBAs as a cancer vaccine component, and will stimulate development of new adjuvants enhancing T-cell-mediated immunity...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the history of traditional Korean papermaking within its historical context: {{the relationship with the}} development of papermaking techniques in neighbouring countries were examined though primary focus was given to the development of materials and tools used. In order to understand the characteristics of historical Korean paper and the development of tools and materials used over time, surveys on Korean and Japanese collections at the British Library and a private Korean collection were carried out. Korean objects dated between the 12 th and the 18 th century were examined. The data collected from the surveys was compiled in a database and analysed. The data analysis revealed that the thickness of paper was closely related to the thickness of bamboo splints used in manufacture of papermaking screens. Research also included a summary of morphological characteristics and photomicrographs of fibres from nine indigenous plants which were used for traditional Korean papermaking. These standard fibre samples were used as reference to identify the fibres of unknown paper objects surveyed. This fibre identification confirmed the main material to be paper mulberry and, additionally, provided information on supplementary materials including rice straw, reed, hemp, and mechanical wood pulp of coniferous origin — a material that has not been recognised as one of the common supplementary materials in previous studies. In order to provide {{a better understanding of the}} materials and tools used in traditional papermaking in Korea, three papermaking experiments were carried out. Firstly, a papermaking experiment was conducted using a mucilaginous substance derived from the roots of Hibiscus Manihot, which has been employed as a <b>formation</b> <b>aid</b> for considerable time in Korea and Japan. Paper samples were then analysed to investigate the physical influence of the substance on the sample sheets. Secondly, a fixed laid screen was designed and sheets were produced using it. The intention here was to support a hypothesis which was proposed by the author in order to explain a possible chronological development of papermaking mould structure in China and its potential spread to neighbouring countries. The last experiment was conducted to simulate a technique of papermaking with reclaimed paper.

40|$|Transected axons fail to regrow in {{the mature}} central nervous system. Astrocytic scars are widely {{regarded}} as causal in this failure. Here, using three genetically targeted loss-of-function manipulations in adult mice, we show that preventing astrocyte scar formation, attenuating scar-forming astrocytes, or ablating chronic astrocytic scars all failed to result in spontaneous regrowth of transected corticospinal, sensory or serotonergic axons through severe spinal cord injury (SCI) lesions. By contrast, sustained local delivery via hydrogel depots of required axon-specific growth factors not present in SCI lesions, plus growth-activating priming injuries, stimulated robust, laminin-dependent sensory axon regrowth past scar-forming astrocytes and inhibitory molecules in SCI lesions. Preventing astrocytic scar formation significantly reduced this stimulated axon regrowth. RNA sequencing revealed that astrocytes and non-astrocyte cells in SCI lesions express multiple axon-growth-supporting molecules. Our findings show that contrary to the prevailing dogma, astrocyte scar <b>formation</b> <b>aids</b> rather than prevents central nervous system axon regeneration...|$|R

40|$|Contact-dependent growth {{inhibition}} (CDI) toxins are a recently identiﬁed family of polymorphic toxins, initially found in Escherichia coli. CDI toxins are found widely spread in Gram-negative bacterial species, including pathogenic strains, {{and have been}} shown to possess a wide range of toxin types which are effective against other bacteria. This research shows that the E. coli EC 93 CDI system confers a competitive advantage on bacteria growing in multi strain bioﬁlms with susceptible bacteria. This advantage is due to two factors, ﬁrstly the EC 93 CDI toxin was shown to be capable of inhibiting the growth of susceptible bacteria in a bioﬁlm and secondly the conserved region of the EC 93 CdiA protein was found to increase the rate of bioﬁlm formation. Analysis {{of the effects of the}} EC 93 and EC 869 o 11 CDI toxins at the single cell level showed that different classes of CDI toxins can act at different rates and with varying degrees of reversibility.

40|$|Amorphous and nanocrystalline W-based {{materials}} are candidate alloys where high toughness and abrasion resistance are required, such as for kinetic energy penetrators (KEPs). Using a bottom-up approach {{to produce a}} tungsten heavy alloy (WHA), W-based alloys, including W-Mo-Fe and W-Cr-Fe, have been produced using high-energy ball milling and consolidated with pulsed electric current sintering (PECS). Powder consolidation using PECS allows for fast consolidation and for high relative densities to be achieved after sintering {{at a fraction of}} the melting temperature. Rapid consolidation of the alloyed powders also reduces grain growth, resulting in improved mechanical properties. During consolidation of mechanically alloyed powders, the structure evolves with sintering conditions due to the residual stress introduced during ball milling and the addition of other component elements added to promote amorphization. Multiple nanoscale crystalline microstructures were seen in the W based alloys depending on processing conditions. Negligible porosity was achieved at nearly one third of homologous temperature, 1050 °C for W-Mo-Fe and 1200 °C for W-Cr-Fe, using nanocrystalline powders and consolidating with PECS. Specimens containing nanocrystalline microstructures showed extremely high hardness and improved mechanical properties over several baseline microcrystalline tungsten alloys. Consolidated alloys had improved hardnesses over baseline materials, up to 300 %. Intermetallic <b>formation</b> <b>aided</b> sintering by filling in pores and acting as a binder phase between nanocrystalline powder particles. At temperatures above 1500 °C, liquid-phase vi sintering characteristics were observed, including the formation of spheroidal grains and rapid grain growth.

The ballistic performance of these alloys under selected process parameters will be evaluated during subsequent studies and will determine whether or not these alloys can be used as effective KEPs...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are {{essential}} for bacteria to thrive in diverse environments and they also {{play a key role}} in virulence [11]. Trans-sRNAs affect the stability and/or translation of their target mRNAs through complementary base-pairing. The base-pairing interaction is not perfect and requires the action of an RNA binding protein, Hfq. Hfq facilitates these RNA-RNA interactions by stabilizing duplex <b>formation,</b> <b>aiding</b> in structural rearrangements, increasing the rate of structural opening, and/or by increasing the rate of annealing [18 - 21]. Hfq has two well characterized binding surfaces: the proximal surface, which binds AU rich stretches typical of sRNAs, and the distal surface, which binds (ARN) x motifs typically found in target mRNAs [30, 33, 36]. Studies on Hfq-RNA interactions have focused largely on sRNAs until the more recent discovery of an (ARN) x motif within the 52 ̆ 7 UTR of target mRNAs[36, 37]. The importance of this motif in facilitating Hfq-mRNA binding and its requirement for regulation of a couple well known target mRNAs led us to further characterize the motif in the work described in this thesis. We performed bioinformatic and in vitro analyses to investigate the prevalence, location, structural contexts, and Hfq-binding of (ARN) x motifs in known target mRNAs. We found that the known targets contain single stranded (ARN) x sequences in their 52 ̆ 7 UTRs that bind to Hfq. Two predominant structural contexts of the single stranded (ARN) x motifs became clear: they were either flanked by stem loop structures or within a loop of an internal bulge, multi-branch junction or hairpin. The key features of the motifs were then used as a bioinformatic tool on a genome wide scale to identify mRNAs that might bind to Hfq. We found that 21...|$|R
