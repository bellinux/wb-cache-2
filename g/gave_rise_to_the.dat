5|$|In 1613 Sigismund III Vasa {{reached an}} {{understanding}} with Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, based on which both sides agreed {{to cooperate and}} mutually provide assistance in suppressing internal rebellions.

5|$|The {{domestic}} cat {{is believed}} to have evolved from the Near Eastern wildcat, whose range covers vast portions of the Middle East westward to the Atlantic coast of Africa. Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago the animal <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> genetic lineage that eventually produced all domesticated cats, having diverged from the Near Eastern wildcat around 8,000 BC in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Alphonso Boone, the {{grandson}} of Daniel Boone, settled in what would later become Wilsonville in 1846 and established the Boones Ferry across the Willamette River in 1847. The ferry <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> community of Boones Landing, which eventually grew into Wilsonville. Originally, the area {{was part of what}} became Yamhill County, but was transferred to the current Clackamas County in 1855. The first post office was established in 1876 with the name, Boones Ferry.|$|E

5|$|As the freeholders {{shared the}} mineral royalties, the mines brought {{prosperity}} which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> remodelling and redevelopment {{of much of}} the village. Green Terrace, which includes the old post office, was built in the 1870s, and Main Street was transformed from a back lane into the high street. The village school, with working clock and bell tower, was built by the community in 1874, and the stone-built Ibbotson Institute, now the community hall, was completed in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly understood, the orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|In the 11th century, William the Conqueror {{brought the}} Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a {{predominantly}} white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound {{derived from the}} St. Hubert Hound which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds {{to give them an}} extra turn of speed. Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day beagle.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} known to {{hybridize}} with Cystopteris fragilis, Cystopteris protrusa, Cystopteris reevesiana, and Cystopteris tenuis.

50|$|The truncus arteriosus and bulbus cordis {{are divided}} by the aorticopulmonary septum. <b>The</b> truncus arteriosus <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{ascending}} aorta and the pulmonary trunk.

50|$|<b>The</b> PT <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medial plantar artery, lateral plantar artery, and <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fibular artery.

5|$|Iridium {{is found}} in meteorites in much higher {{abundance}} than in the Earth's crust. For this reason, the unusually high abundance of iridium in the clay layer at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Alvarez hypothesis {{that the impact of}} a massive extraterrestrial object caused the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species 66million years ago. Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Muni began {{service on}} December 28, 1912, when the A Geary-Park line was inaugurated, running between the Financial District and the Richmond District {{on the western}} side of the city. Expansion of the system and {{consolidation}} with other transit companies eventually made Muni the city's sole public transit operator in 1952, when it acquired the bankrupt California Street Cable Railroad. Subsequent changes and adjustments to the system <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lines in use today.|$|E
5|$|Nikephoros Komnenos {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{documented}} members of the Komnenos family, but nothing is known of his early life or his connection to the main branch of the family, which eventually <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> imperial dynasty. The Greek scholar Konstantinos Varzos suggested that he was born , and that he was the younger brother of the Komnenian dynasty's patriarch, Manuel Erotikos Komnenos, but neither assumption can be verified.|$|E
50|$|All bilaterian {{animals at}} an early stage of {{development}} form a gastrula, which is polarized, with one end called the animal pole and the other the vegetal pole. The gastrula has the shape of a disk with three layers of cells, an inner layer called <b>the</b> endoderm, which <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lining of most internal organs, a middle layer called <b>the</b> mesoderm, which <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bones and muscles, and an outer layer called <b>the</b> ectoderm, which <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin and nervous system.|$|R
50|$|Because each nucleus {{contains}} {{a large population}} of neurons, the dorsal column nuclei <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> characteristic bumps or tubercles when viewing the posterior side of the intact brainstem.

Predecessors in the 18th and 19th centuries include the Parrian Club, a dining society for former pupils of Samuel Parr's headship, and the Valpeian Club, after Edward Valpy.

5|$|The Osiris myth {{reached its}} basic form in or before the 24th century BCE.

5|$|The Witham {{originally}} {{flowed into}} The Wash at Bicker Haven, where {{the port of}} Drayton {{was established in the}} Welland estuary, and it was only as a result of massive flooding in 1014 that it diverted itself to flow into The Haven at Boston. This <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> growth of Boston as a port in the 12th and 13thcenturies, exporting wool and salt to the Hanseatic League, though Boston only received its charter in 1545.|$|E

5|$|The {{advent of}} {{photosynthesis}} in very basic forms of plant life worldwide allowed the sun's energy {{to be harvested}} to create conditions allowing for more complex life. The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ozone layer. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} yet more complex cells called eukaryotes. Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms. With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} appears on most {{official}} seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, {{and in the}} logos of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> urban legend that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.|$|E
5|$|The {{in-depth}} {{studies of}} the juridic classical works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> minds behind Justinian's juridic reforms.
