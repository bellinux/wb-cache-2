5|$|A Post Enumeration Survey (PES) {{was carried}} out to find the common <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{considered}} into account for future census enumeration activities. The results of the PES indicated that 92.7 per cent of total Zambian residents were captured in the 2010 census, leaving an under count of 7.3 per cent. The undercount was more in rural areas with an estimated 9.5 per cent {{of the total population}} and 3.8 per cent in the urban areas.|$|E

Chovanec didn't repeat his sentiment regarding the number of gun license holders, and instead specified that one of the <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> analyzed will be the issuing and revocation of licenses under the existing legislation.|$|E

Believing the demographic and salary <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> irrelevant, he accused CBS of bowing to the anti-establishment, anti-war faction {{at the height of}} the Vietnam War, saying his conservative political and social views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President Spiro Agnew and Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen, to appear on his program.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013 {{during an}} {{interview}} with Eddie Trunk, King declared that, while Hanneman still had not {{been involved with the}} album, the band was waiting for label <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved before recording. King stated that he and Lombardo had eight songs that they were working on, as well. When asked about whether or not Exodus guitarist Gary Holt, who had been filling in for Hanneman during live shows, would play on the record, King denied it, saying that he would handle all guitars except for Hanneman's lead parts. King also said that Hanneman had yet to offer up any material for the album. Araya later contradicted King's statement about Hanneman and stated that Hanneman had been working on material for the album. Shortly after Hanneman's death, Araya revealed that Hanneman had {{gone so far as to}} send Araya music that he had been working on, and Araya later said that some of this material—including an outtake from World Painted Blood—may make it onto the album.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{there were}} major <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> decided. Germany was still {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain and France. Dealing with the wartime allies was a major task for the high commissioner. West Germany, {{made up of the}} zones {{occupied by the}} three western powers, had been granted control of its own affairs, except for defense and foreign policy, in 1949. While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, the Eisenhower administration sought to reduce its defense spending by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant's staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in United States Information Agency (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.|$|E

5|$|Lynch {{conceived}} South of Nowhere {{from the}} idea of a teenager's coming out after hearing that his friend's son had come out to his parents. Lynch pitched the premise to The N and was commissioned to write the pilot. After the casting process was complete, the episode was filmed in October 2004, but when the show was picked up for a full season, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters and the pilot was shot again in July 2005 with the new cast. The premiere of the episode was promoted with branded MetroCards that were handed out to teenagers in Manhattan. Generally, critics reviewed the pilot positively, particularly commending its treatment of current social issues; however, some critics found the show's introduction of these <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forced and inauthentic.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the First World War left many <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> settled, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early interwar period, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered {{in its early years}} included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved, and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1930s {{tensions}} built between Germany and the United Kingdom {{as well as}} its allies. During late 1937, {{and throughout}} 1938, German demands for the annexation of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland led to an international crisis. In an attempt to avoid war, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler in September and brokered the Munich Agreement. The agreement averted war and allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland. While it had been intended as an agreement to reconcile differences, and for future <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved peacefully, relations between both countries soon deteriorated. On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying the remnants of the Czech state.|$|E

25|$|In the Anglo-Saxon System of {{labour market}} regulation, the government's {{legislative}} role {{is much more}} limited, which allows for more <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> decided between employers and employees and any union or employers' associations which might represent these parties in the decision-making process. However, in these countries, collective agreements are not widespread; only a few businesses and a few {{sectors of the economy}} have a strong tradition of finding collective solutions in labour relations. Ireland and the UK belong to this category, and in contrast to the EU core countries above, these countries first joined the EU in 1973.|$|E
