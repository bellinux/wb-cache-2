5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{has been}} mined around Worsley from {{as long ago}} as 1376, {{originally}} in bell pits. The coal seams in the area tend to be fairly thin, slanting downwards <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> south, and so deeper mining became necessary during the 17thcentury.|$|E

Thus, temperatures decrease <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> south due to the differences in latitudes.|$|E

5|$|The Žirmūnai {{elderate}} occupies 5.7km² or 1.4% of {{the total}} area of the municipality of Vilnius according to data used for the 2001 census. Žirmūnai is located north of central Vilnius, along the western bank of the River Neris, on a flat plain which rises to the north. The elderate extends for about 4.4kilometres <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> south, and is about 1.5kilometres across at its widest point. The southernmost point of the Žirmūnai elderate is only some 450metres from Vilnius' Cathedral Square, in {{the centre of the}} city. Žirmūnai is bordered by the elderates of Verkiai in the north and Šnipiškės in the west, and is separated from Vilnius' Old Town and Antakalnis by the Neris. Žirmūnai's western boundary is defined by the following streets (<b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> south): Verkių, Žvalgų, Kalvarijų, Žalgirio, and Rinktinės. The River Neris serves as Žirmūnai's northern, eastern and southern boundary. Žirmūnų Street is the district's main artery.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{seedlings}} grown from seed collected in 28 areas showed a north-south change in leaf shape and dimensions. Seedling leaves get longer and narrower southwards. Seedlings often have leaves with red-brown pigmentation which disappears in older plants, and this coloration becomes increasingly common towards the south. The changes in shape—leaves getting narrower and more robust <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> south and from lowland to montane—suggest adaptations to colder weather.|$|E

The NK 2nd Division, {{concentrated}} in the Sinban-ni area west of the river, had, in effect, attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Changnyong above and below Lake U-p'o.

Droughts, flash floods, cyclones, avalanches, landslides {{brought on by}} torrential rains, and snowstorms pose the greatest threats. Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, which usually track <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> south; they cause extensive property damage in North India and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice and wheat.|$|E

As well as a partial cloverleaf interchange that provides almost all directional movements, this four-level stack interchange features two flyovers that arc from south to east {{as well as a}} four lane mainline that curves <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> east, directing most westbound Highway420 traffic onto the Toronto-bound QEW.|$|E
5|$|Halmahera {{island in}} the north of Molucca {{archipelago}} has been formed by the movement of three tectonic plates resulting in two intersecting mountain ranges, which form four rocky peninsulas separated by three deep bays. A volcanic arc stretches <b>from</b> <b>north</b> <b>to</b> south in the west side of Halmahera, some of which are volcanic islands, for instance, Gamalama and Tidore. Gamalama's island name is Ternate and it has been the centre for spice trading since the Portuguese Empire opened a fort in 1512. Due to its location as the centre for spice trading during the Age of Discovery, historical records of volcanic eruptions in Halmahera have been available {{as far back as the}} early 16th century.|$|E
