The thermal modeling of buildings for design purposes needs a robust description of the thermal properties of installed phase change materials. A standard method would improve the thermal characterization of commercial products. The aim {{of the study is}} to develop a simple methodology to obtain reliable thermal data for phase change materials integrated in multilayered wallboards. The methodology modifies differential scanning calorimetry measurements on phase change material by <b>installation</b> <b>factors</b> to obtain the apparent specific heat vs. temperature for the wallboard layer embedding phase change material. Simple cubic cells were realized as reference devices to simulate a confined environment. A dynamic model of heat transfer was developed to simulate the thermal behavior of devices. <b>Installation</b> <b>factors</b> were calculated by regression of the monitored temperatures inside and outside the devices operating under real environmental conditions. The apparent specific heat of phase change material, measured by differential scanning calorimetry at different rates, resulted in a spread of curves vs. temperature. Mean curves were used as initial condition for regression. The mean calculation method did not significantly affect the installed resulted curve. A unique curve of apparent specific heat vs. temperature best fit data measured over a wide range of experimental devices and conditions. Good regression performances were observed for solid liquid and biphasic states with different thickness of the phase change material layer. The modification of differential scanning calorimetry measurements through <b>installation</b> <b>factors</b> improved the robustness of description. The proposed methodology could be a starting point for the definition of a reference standard for the characterization and comparison of wallboards embedding phase change material...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{outlines}} {{a framework}} for rapid capital and operating cost estimation of evolving biorefineries. The cost models are addressed to the biorefinery community and aim to assist chemists in selecting economically viable biorefinery routes and engineers in avoiding laborious flowsheeting with uncertain economic analyses at process conception. The models assist in early-stage decision making for budget allocation in a portfolio of different projects and estimation of budget overrun risks. Biorefineries are society’s alternative to fossil-based production and aim to produce bio-fuels and chemicals {{from a wide variety}} of biomass sources by optimising production and resources use. The emerging field of integrated biorefineries offers an abundance of possible products, technologies and production routes. The systematic screening of capital expenditure of each biorefinery pathway still relies on cost heuristics regressed from petrochemical processes under the assumption they could be applied to biorefineries. The thesis studies several established cost methods on biorefinery processes and concludes that most require a high level of process detail not suitable at the early R&D stage and at times, they produce questionable results. A cost estimating methodological framework is proposed to develop short-cut cost models and cost estimates for biorefineries. The framework sets the basis for the systematic cost modelling and estimating of biorefineries and is reproducible and extendable to other process groups. To address the uncertainty around the term “early-stage estimation”, technology development levels are benchmarked against cost estimation standards: Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 1 to 4 correspond to Class 5 cost estimates and Technology Readiness Level 5 corresponds to Class 4 cost estimates, each level requiring dedicated cost models within - 50 to + 100 % accuracy. Heuristic and reproducible cost models are developed for TRL 1 - 5 by mapping cost drivers from cost data inventories. The cost models produce probabilistic base estimates, i. e. point estimates that take into account the cost model’s uncertainty within 95 % certainty. The cost estimate is completed with uncertainty models that takes into account both statistical and technical challenges to produce a joint distribution of possible cost outcomes. The analysis is assisted by cost inventories that include commercial biorefinery costs gathered to that end. Three major biorefinery classes emerge from the data to classify biorefineries by type of employed technology: biochemical, chemical and thermochemical. Historical trends show that for the period 2000 – 2020, the US has been a pioneer in biorefineries construction (43 % of biorefineries), followed by France (9 %), Spain and Brazil (7 %), whereas bioethanol in the US and biodiesel in Europe dominate bio-production supported by favourable economic policies. At TRL 1, cost-capacity curves are developed for 11 biorefineries that allow estimation by power law relationships and statistical metrics to evaluate uncertainties within 95 % certainty range. New jobs vs capital cost curves are presented to estimate the social impact of future biorefineries in respect to job growth. The analysis shows that 1 st gen ethanol remains more cost-efficient than advanced biofuels, whereas synergies among existing plants can largely reduce capital costs. 2 nd gen ethanol biorefineries make the most positive impact by creating 1 new job per million euro invested. At TRL 2 - 3, biorefinery development is at a phase that allows application of the “Process Blocks Build-Up” estimating method; it is a modular approach which proposes probabilistic cost exponents and reference costs for segments found in 11 biorefinery types. The method addresses estimation of biorefineries beyond the state-of-the-art under the assumption that a new biorefinery is composed of blocks that resemble those found in state-of-the-art biorefineries. Differences in performance are accounted for with an efficiency factor for each block. Validation of the method shows it has an absolute average error of 27 %. At TRL 4, process development justifies a conceptual flow diagram and thus, the capital cost can be estimated from “Functional Unit” relationships, which postulate the capital cost as a function of the number of functional units and basic process parameters. The concept of the functional unit - established on petrochemical processes – is re-defined through examples to include unit operations commonly found in biorefineries. The percentage standard error of the estimate is used to model the 95 % certainty around the base estimate. Despite the advanced phase of development, the new correlations report an absolute average error of 50 %. The discrepancies are due to the uncertain and limited amount of data used in regression analysis. At TRL 5, <b>installation</b> <b>factors</b> (Lang factors) under uncertainty are proposed assuming the delivered equipment cost can be estimated. Factorial estimating is at the verge of early-estimating and reports an average absolute error of 12 %. The proposed <b>installation</b> <b>factors</b> (solid-fluid: 5. 9, fluid: 9. 5) are higher than the ones reported in common engineering handbooks, thus, confirming the research hypothesis that the offsites in biorefineries are capital intensive. The thesis introduces “Production cost estimating with uncertainty”, which assumes that the production cost elements can be expressed as a function of the raw materials, the utilities, the operating labour and the fixed capital investment and proposes modelling factors under uncertainty for each element. The cost models are validated across TRLs on two case studies; PHB from methane fermentation and FAME from in planta transesterification of castor seeds. The modular approach assists in estimating processes at low TRL based on little information and provides reasonable results. The short-cuts show good agreement with detailed techno-economic results from common engineering software (Aspen Process Economic Analyser). The cost models can be used interchangeably for rapid cost estimations and modelling work for various purposes...|$|R

The deterioration rate of a water distribution pipeline was calculated in terms of the deterioration rate due to pipeline information factors and the deterioration rate resulting from the <b>installation</b> environment/external <b>factors.</b> The hydraulic importance of water distribution pipelines was calculated by considering the importance of a single pipe failure caused by water leakage or an accident and that of a multiple pipe failure caused by a disaster, such as an earthquake.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{contributions in}} the field of satellite navigation with a focus on array processing and related implementation issues. For readers not familiar with GNSS, it also includes a brief overview of satellite navigation. Compared to {{the state of the art}} only ten years ago, modern GNSS receivers are very capable. One reason for this improvement is advances in the semiconductor industry that have increased both the available processing power and the energy efficiency. An active research community have also made important contributions resulting in more sophisticated algorithms. To improve receiver performance even further, auxiliary sensors such as gyros and accelerometers are becoming increasingly common. A related option involves using an antenna with several physical elements. This is known as an antenna array and is often used for radar, sonar and telecommunication applications. Array processing can also be used for GNSS and as such it is the primary focus of this thesis. An array allows for exploration of the spatial domain, in other words a receiver that may differentiate between signals depending on the direction of arrival. For GNSS, where interference and multipath (signal reflection off, for example, buildings or the ground) may be significant sources of error, this is an attractive solution. Although array processing have been the subject of extensive research efforts within other fields, there are several remaining issues with regards to how these techniques can be implemented in a GNSS receiver. With regards to array processing there are also properties unique to GNSS, such as multiple signal sources at known positions, that have not been explored sufficiently in previous efforts. In this thesis we show how these properties can be exploited to improve receiver performance in dynamic scenarios. In short, the orientation of the antenna platform is estimated accurately (typical variance around 1 °) using beamforming techniques. This information is then used to achieve a better estimate of the radio environment by allowing for longer integration periods when estimating the covariance matrices. A better estimate of the covariance matrices directly translates into improved receiver performance, especially so in areas of moderate levels of multipath/interference. Further, a method to calibrate GNSS array antennas using real signals is investigated in detail. Instead of resorting to electromagnetic simulations that requires precise knowledge about the antenna and <b>installation</b> <b>factors,</b> or RF chamber measurement that is expensive, it is shown how the array antenna can be calibrated using live signals. The accuracy of the resulting model is verified using real data. Also, the first implementation of an RF record and replay system is presented. With such a system data can be recorded in a specific environment, generally a time consuming task, and later played back into the antenna input of any GNSS receiver. Such systems are nowadays commercially available and have proven very useful for testing and validation of GNSS receivers. Throughout the thesis, the required receiver architecture and practical viability of the proposed algorithms are considered.

In the no-load condition, current dispatch has recorded 10 Amperes, and has increased the voltage at receiving end by 200 - 500 Volts, with leading power <b>factors.</b> <b>Installation</b> of the inductor to reduce cable loss dielectrics is done by changing the power factor (pf) to 0. 85 lagging. After installation of the inductor, which is 5 mH/ 700 kVAR, dielectric losses is reduced to 3. 57 %, which is from 105, 983 kW to 102, 195 kWh per month. The capacitive leakage current has also been reduced from 249. 61 Ampere to 245. 17 Ampere...|$|R
50|$|One line {{consists}} of a maximum of 4 line segments, each with a maximum of 64 bus devices. Each segment requires an appropriate power supply. Maximum segment length is 1000 m. 4 segments may be connected with line repeaters to establish a network length of 4000 m and 256 devices.The actual number of devices {{is dependent on the}} power supply selected and the power input of the individual devices.Note: Line repeaters may not be used on backbone or main lines.Note that KNX KNXnet/IP optionally allows the integration of KNX sub networks via IP. As shown above, this topology is reflected in the numerical structure of the individual addresses, which (with few exceptions) uniquely identify each node on the network. Note: Each line, including the main line, must have its own power supply unit. Installation restrictions may depend on implementation (medium, transceiver types, power supply capacity) and environmental (electromagnetic noise …) <b>factors.</b> <b>Installation</b> and product guidelines shall be taken into account.|$|R
40|$|Maintenance can be {{considered}} as a combined information and knowledge processing and management system. Effective knowledge, practices and experiences management is growing in importance, especially in advanced processes and management of advanced and expensive assets. Efforts of integrating maintenance knowledge management (MKM) processes with MKMM will be increasingly more important due to the increasing complexities of these overall systems – {{the context in which the}} performance measurements has been performed is also important input in the performance analysis. Integration of MKM in MPMM can result in higher quality of the decisions and actions in the maintenance processes and in the overall work to increase efficiency and decreasing costs in the organizations. Integration of MKM (Maintenance Knowledge Management – knowledge, experiences and practices management) with collaborative structures and interfacing abilities with qualified services for simulation, modeling and computations can be regarded as Intelligence-based Maintenance (iMaintenance). These infrastructures present in iMaintenance can further improve MPMM efforts due to possible utilization of more accurate property and context information and services – changes in <b>installations,</b> environmental <b>factors</b> etc. not easily integrated in current MPMM implementations. Integration of MPMM with iMaintenance solutions can also improve the interaction between management and the maintenance operators and also allow improved interaction and integration with production operators in the organization. MPMM can with this approach be integrated as a natural component in the overall ICT-based maintenance and collaboration solutions – the performance status reporting will be seen as a natural extension to the normal routines. In this context the usability of the end-user environments will be very important – especially when designing systems for mobile use by maintenance operators in the field.

40|$|A {{vapour barrier}} refers to any {{material}} used {{to restrict the}} movement of water vapour. It may {{take the form of}} a coating, membrane, or board, but is normally a sheet material designed to fulfil this one particular function. The correct selection of a vapour barrier is influenced largely by the peculiarities of the application for which it is intended, and involves consideration of other properties of the material in addition to its water vapour permeance. These properties vary widely with different vapour barriers, and no one material is necessarily suited to all applications. The conditions to which the vapour barrier is exposed after <b>installation</b> are a <b>factor,</b> but the circumstances during application are usually of most importance. The most important general principle to be followed in both design and installation is to reduce to a minimum the number of openings in the barrier. Where such openings are necessary, special care should be taken seal the barrier so as to approach complete continuity.
