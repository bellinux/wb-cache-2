"the {{realization}} that the cultural values of art and literature were being turned by capitalism <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can only describe as spiritual onanism and the discovery that communism, by solving the material problems of society, was the only path to a future creative renaissance, was the first impulse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1947, {{she went}} to live at the Abbey Art Centre, an artists' {{community}} located in New Barnet, Hertfordshire, near London. King was a fairly early resident there. Quite a number of Australian artists lived at the Abbey at various times. These included Robert Klippel, James Gleeson,Phillip Martin, , Noel Counihan and Bernard Smith, who became an art historian. Grahame King, whom King later married, arrived later in 1947. King's early works at the Abbey were figurative, but not realistic. But {{it was during this}} period that King [...] "made an arbitrary decision to move away from representational work". [...] "I could not see how I could do any more with the figure, so I decided to move <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call non-representational work. I don't like to call it abstraction as my work was not abstract in concept. I was groping for my own way." [...] She had two exhibitions in London, then spent six months in Paris, which she enjoyed. In September 1949, {{she went to}} New York.|$|E
2500|$|Lundgren {{had written}} the music and draft lyrics for [...] "Where Dreams Go to Die". He worked on the song with La Torre via Skype. They among others {{replaced}} Lundgren's poppier and more punk-sounding vocal melody by a different one proposed by La Torre, and lowered some chords to fit a melody line over it. Lundgren allowed La Torre to use whatever he wanted of the lyrics, but La Torre ultimately used them all while adding some lyrics of his own. [...] Lundgren and La Torre wanted to present a demo to the band that had already matured more into a song, which is why La Torre created a scratch drum part. He was uncertain how Rockenfield would respond to it, but outside of having no problem with it, {{by the time the}} drums were recorded, La Torre {{was surprised to find that}} Rockenfield had only made some changes in the verses and chorus to put in his signature drumming style, but he left the overall track intact. Rockenfield explained this, saying: [...] "They were so good that I kept them and translated them <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would do." [...] After that, Wilton added some guitar parts, including a small bridge, and Rockenfield contributed the orchestration, additional arrangements, and the intro track, [...] "X2".|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{rather a}} long story," [...] he began. [...] "I {{have been taken}} in, Midwinter. I've been imposed on by a person, who--I can't help saying it--who cheated me <b>into</b> {{promising}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> oughtn't to have promised, and doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had better not have done.

2500|$|In January 2000, Suzuki {{released}} [...] "Don't Need to Say Good Bye" [...] which debuted {{at number}} 5. A week later, Suzuki released her second studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol. 1, which sold 1,063,000 copies and debuted at number one.　Suzuki has said {{of this first}} period of her career {{that she was not}} free to do what she wanted and only followed what she was told, leaving her feeling [...] "pretty disheartened and down, like there was no future.". Suzuki had been writing lyrics from an early age and passing them to her manager and producers. The first song to feature them, with the help of Mitsuko and Tetsuya Komuro, was her tenth Sony single, [...] "Don't Need to Say Good Bye". The lyrics were influenced by events occurring in her personal life at that time, specifically her upcoming high school graduation and she has said [...] "it was more important to me than sales and chart rankings to know that I had put my thoughts and feelings <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was singing."　Three months after Infinity Eighteen Vol.1, Suzuki released her twelfth single, [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] in the beginning of April and third studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 at the end of April. [...] "Thank You 4 Every Day Every Body" [...] sold a total of 234,000 copies reaching number one and Infinity Eighteen Vol.2 sold a total of 427,000 copies reaching number two. [...] "Reality/Dancin' in Hip-Hop" [...] was Suzuki's 12th single released under the Sony Music Japan label, on 27 September 2000. It reached number 3 on Oricon weekly chart and sold a total of 211,000 copies. A compilation album of Suzuki's tracks, Fun for Fan, was released on 30 May 2001. It reached number 1 on the Oricon charts, despite the fact that by this point, Suzuki herself had vanished from the public eye and Sony had taken all of her previous singles and albums off CD shelves.|$|E

6000|$|... "And the visiting!" [...] I said. And then, alas! {{my tongue}} {{began to run}} away with me. He was falling back again <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> may call his company voice, and I pined {{to talk to the}} real Mr Crimble, little dreaming how soon that want was to be satiated.|$|E
6000|$|... "And when I {{raise my}} hand--so--you will throw <b>into</b> the room <b>what</b> <b>I</b> give you to throw, and will, {{at the same}} time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{want to give}} <b>into</b> your charge <b>what</b> <b>I</b> love most in the world.... George, {{have you}} thought at all what you're going to do now? I'm afraid you can't go back to Oxford.|$|R
6000|$|... "Farewell, my dear. I wish I {{had been}} a prettier woman. A more loving woman (toward you) I could not be. Even now I dread the sight of your dear face. Even now, if I allowed myself the luxury of looking at you, I don't know {{that you might not}} charm me <b>into</b> confessing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have done--before it is too late to save me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it's hard to tell. I suppose {{thinking}} {{too much}} {{has something to}} do with it. The fact is, Angut, that we've got <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call a fix, and I can't for the life of me see how we are to get out of it. Indeed I greatly fear that we shall never get out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Mr. Draconmeyer assented, [...] "I will proceed. After all, I am {{not sure}} that the {{personal}} element enters <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was about to say. I was going to propose not exactly an alliance--that, of course, would not be possible--but I was certainly going to suggest that you and I might be of some service to one another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We yielded, Mr. Burton," [...] he said, [...] "to {{the natural}} impulse of all {{business}} men. We {{tried to make}} the best bargain we could for ourselves.

We wish now to treat you with the utmost confidence. We wish to lay our whole scheme before you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{will not}} forget our {{appointment}} in Winnipeg," [...] said Haldane, {{as they drove}} away; and I stood still long after the vehicle had melted <b>into</b> the prairie. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> thought I do not remember; but {{it was with a}} dreamy calmness that, now the worst had passed, I returned to Crane Valley.|$|R
60|$|God! <b>into</b> <b>what</b> madness was <b>I</b> {{come that}} my eyes could so deceive me? It was the draught that stirred the air {{about the church}} and blew great shrouds of wax adown the taper's yellow sides. I manned myself to a more sober mood, and looked again.|$|R
60|$|I strove {{in vain to}} {{give some}} warning to my comrades so they might make their escape even though I was doomed; but he who held me {{seemingly}} understood that which was in my mind, for he forced me onward lest Pierre and Saul should over-run us, and thus for mayhap a distance of an hundred yards we advanced, I, a prisoner, forced to lead my comrades <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> felt certain was a shameful death.|$|E
6000|$|... "There will be more," [...] said Allen loftily. [...] "I {{never meant}} to be a burden, but ladies are so impatient, I suppose you do not wish to turn me out {{instantly}} to seek my fortune. No, mother, I do not mean to blame you. You have been sadly harassed, and no woman can ever enter <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have suffered. Put aside those bills. Long before Christmas, I shall be able to discharge them myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Awake me at daybreak, Rabecque," [...] said he drowsily. [...] "We must be {{stirring}} then. Have horse {{ready and}} clothes for me. I shall {{need you to}} wash me clean and shave me and make me what I was before your tricks and dyes turned me <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have been this week and more. Take away the light. At daybreak! Don't let me sleep beyond that as you value your place with me. We shall have brisk work to-morrow. At--daybreak--Rabecque!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I will {{go after}} them," [...] said Catherine; [...] "wherever they are I will go after them. It does not signify talking. If I {{could not be}} persuaded <b>into</b> doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it." [...] And with these words she broke away and hurried off. Thorpe would have darted after her, but Morland {{withheld}} him. [...] "Let her go, let her go, if she will go. She is as obstinate as--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Shortly afterwards, in {{his novel}} Nikolas Sigalos, he put similar sentiments into the musings of a fictional writer: [...] "The devil! ... Call this a language?

6000|$|... 'Father, I {{always knew}} it. In this strife I have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel <b>into</b> a demon. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> have learned has left me doubting, misbelieving, despising, regretting, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have not learned; and my dismal {{resource}} {{has been to}} think that life would soon go by, and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{care for}} you, {{but it can}} {{never be the same}} as it was before. What you've done, you've done. I wish I could help it, but I can't. I can't make myself over <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was twenty-four hours ago. I seem another person, in another world; it's as if I died, and came to life somewhere else. I'm sorry enough, if that could help, but it can't. Go and tell that girl the truth: that you came up here to me, and I sent you back to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 133. And {{every hour}} of my life, since that {{paragraph}} of 'Modern Painters' was written, has increased, I disdain to say my feeling, but say, with fearless decision, my knowledge, of the bitterness of the curse, which the habits of hunting and 'la chasse' have brought upon the so-called upper classes of England and France; until, from knights and gentlemen, they have sunk into jockeys, speculators, usurers, butchers by battue; and, the English especially, now, as a political body, <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have called them in the opening chapter of 'The Bible of Amiens,'--"the scurviest louts that ever fouled God's earth with their carcasses." ...|$|E
6000|$|On the whole, {{she entered}} <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> chose {{to tell her}} of our idyll with avidity, like a cat licking her {{whiskers}} over a dish of cream; and, strange to say--and so expansive a passion is that of love!--that I derived a perhaps equal satisfaction from confiding in that breast of iron. It made an immediate bond: from that hour we seemed to be welded into a family party; and I had little difficulty in persuading her to join us and to preside over our tea-table. Surely there was never so ill-matched a trio as Rowley, Mrs. McRankine, and the Viscount Anne! But I am of the Apostle's way, with a difference: {{all things to all}} women! When I cannot please a woman, hang me in my cravat! ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{really wanted}} it to be the first single but I never thought Capitol would agree to it, and I believe it was Punch (Andrews, Seger's manager and often co-producer) who talked them <b>into</b> it. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> liked about it was that it broke new ground for us. It really showed that we were unafraid to push the {{envelope}} of what we were doing before, which was basically pretty hot rock and roll, you know, with a few ballads thrown in." ...|$|R
5000|$|Francis Poulenc {{literally}} sang her praises, considering her {{an equal}} to Paul Éluard and Max Jacob, {{found in her}} writing [...] "a sort of sensitive impertinence, libertinage, and an appetite which, carried on <b>into</b> song is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> tried to express in my extreme youth with Marie Laurencin in Les Biches."
