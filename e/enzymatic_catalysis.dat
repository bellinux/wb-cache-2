5|$|The best-known role of {{proteins}} {{in the cell}} is as enzymes, which catalyse chemical reactions. Enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only {{one or a few}} chemical reactions. Enzymes carry out most of the reactions involved in metabolism, as well as manipulating DNA in processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription. Some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification. About 4,000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes. The rate acceleration conferred by <b>enzymatic</b> <b>catalysis</b> is often enormous—as much as 1017-fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase (78 million years without the enzyme, 18 milliseconds with the enzyme).|$|E

[...] As with heavy metals, these by-products of the pigments’ decomposition accumulate in the lymphatic system.

2500|$|Scanning {{electron}} microscope images indicate that G-actin has a [...] globular structure; however, X-ray crystallography shows {{that each of}} these globules consists of two lobes separated by a cleft. This structure represents the “ATPase fold”, which is a centre of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>catalysis</b> that binds ATP and Mg2+ and hydrolyzes the former to ADP plus phosphate. This fold is a conserved structural motif that is also found in other proteins that interact with triphosphate nucleotides such as hexokinase (an enzyme used in energy metabolism) or in Hsp70 proteins (a protein family that play an important part in protein folding). G-actin is only functional when it contains either ADP or ATP in its cleft but the form that is bound to ATP predominates in cells when actin is present in its free state.|$|E

For the case of membrane-bound enzymes acting on membrane-bound substrates with multiple enzymatic sites (such as tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors like the T-Cell receptor), ultrasensitive responses could be seen, crucially dependent on three factors: 1) limited diffusion in the membrane,2) multiple binding sites on the substrate, and3) brief <b>enzymatic</b> inactivation following <b>catalysis.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Michaelis-Menten {{equation}} {{has been}} used to predict the rate of product formation in enzymatic reactions for more than a century. Specifically, it states that the rate of an enzymatic reaction will increase as substrate concentration increases, and that increased unbinding of enzyme-substrate complexes will decrease the reaction rate. While the first prediction is well established, the second is more elusive. [...] Mathematically analysis of the effect of enzyme-substrate unbinding on enzymatic reactions at the single-molecule level has shown that unbinding of an enzyme from a substrate can reduce the rate of product formation under some conditions, but may also have the opposite effect. [...] As substrate concentrations increase, a tipping point can be reached where an increase in the unbinding rate results in an increase, rather than a decrease, of the reaction rate. The results indicate that enzymatic reactions can behave in ways that violate the classical Michaelis-Menten equation, and that the role of unbinding in <b>enzymatic</b> <b>catalysis</b> still remains to be determined experimentally.|$|E

40|$|Kinetic and {{spectroscopic data}} {{indicated}} that addition of the donor substrate hydroxypyruvate to the thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) -dependent enzyme transketolase (TK) led to the accumulation of the α-carbanion/enamine of (α,β-dihydroxyethyl) ThDP, the key reaction intermediate in <b>enzymatic</b> thiamin <b>catalysis.</b> The three-dimensional structure of this intermediate trapped in the active site of yeast TK was determined to 1. 9 -Å resolution by using cryocrystallography. The electron density suggests a planar α-carbanion/enamine intermediate having the E-configuration. The reaction intermediate is firmly held in place through direct hydrogen bonds to His- 103 and His- 481 and an indirect hydrogen bond via a water molecule to His- 69. The 4 -NH 2 group of the amino-pyrimidine ring of ThDP is within 3 Å distance to the α-hydroxy oxygen atom of the dihydroxyethyl moiety but at an angle unfavorable for a strong hydrogen bond. No structural changes occur in TK on formation of the reaction intermediate, suggesting that the active site is poised for catalysis and conformational changes during the enzyme reaction are not very likely. The intermediate is present with high occupancy in both active sites, arguing against previous proposals of half-of-the-sites reactivity in yeast TK...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmino-acid {{radicals}} {{play key}} roles in many <b>enzymatic</b> reactions. <b>Catalysis</b> often involves transfer {{of a radical}} character within the protein, as in class I ribonucleotide reductase where radical transfer occurs over 35 Å, from a tyrosyl radical to a cystein. It is currently debated whether this kind of long-range transfer occurs by electron transfer, followed by proton release to create a neutral radical, or by H-atom transfer, that is, simultaneous transfer of electrons and protons. The latter mechanism avoids the energetic cost of charge formation in the low dielectric protein, but it is less robust to structural changes than is electron transfer. Available experimental data do not clearly discriminate between these proposals. We have studied the mechanism of photoactivation (light-induced reduction of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor) of Escherichia coli DNA photolyase using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. Here we show that the excited flavin adenine dinucleotide radical abstracts an electron from a nearby tryptophan in 30 ps. After subsequent electron transfer along a chain of three tryptophans, the most remote tryptophan (as a cation radical) releases a proton to the solvent in about 300 ns, showing that electron transfer occurs before proton dissociation. A similar process may take place in photolyase-like blue-light receptors...|$|R

40|$|Nature excels at {{breaking}} down glycans into their components, typically via <b>enzymatic</b> acid–base <b>catalysis</b> to achieve selective cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Noting {{the importance of}} proton transfer in the active site {{of many of these}} enzymes, we describe a sequestered proton reagent for acid-catalyzed glycan sequencing (PRAGS) that derivatizes the reducing terminus of glycans with a pyridine moiety possessing moderate proton affinity. Gas-phase collisional activation of PRAGS-derivatized glycans predominately generates C 1 –O glycosidic bond cleavages retaining the charge on the reducing terminus. The resulting systematic PRAGS-directed deconstruction of the glycan can be analyzed to extract glycan composition and sequence. Glycans are also highly susceptible to dissociation by free radicals, mainly reactive oxygen species, which inspired our development of a free radical activated glycan sequencing (FRAGS) reagent, which combines a free radical precursor with a pyridine moiety that can be coupled to the reducing terminus of target glycans. Collisional activation of FRAGS-derivatized glycans generates a free radical that reacts to yield abundant cross-ring cleavages, glycosidic bond cleavages, and combinations of these types of cleavages with retention of charge at the reducing terminus. Branched sites are identified with the FRAGS reagent by the specific fragmentation patterns that are observed only at these locations. Mechanisms of dissociation as well as application of the reagents for both linear and highly branched glycan structure analysis are investigated and discussed. The approach developed here for glycan structure analysis offers unique advantages compared to earlier studies employing mass spectrometry for this purpose...|$|R

This includes multimolecular reactions and allows for <b>catalysis,</b> <b>enzymatic</b> reactions, multiple reaction products, nonmonotone rate functions, and non-closed autonomous systems. Our structural sensitivity analysis {{is based on the}} stoichiometry of the reaction network, only. It does not require numerical data on reaction rates. Instead, we impose mild and generic nondegeneracy conditions of algebraic type. From the structural data, only, we derive which steady-state concentrations are sensitive to, and hence influenced by, changes of any particular reaction rate - and which are not. We also establish transitivity properties for influences involving rate perturbations. This allows us to derive an influence graph which globally summarizes the influence pattern of the given network. The influence graph allows the computational, but meaningful, automatic identification of functional subunits in general networks, which hierarchically influence each other. We illustrate our results for several variants of the glycolytic citric acid cycle. Biological applications include enzyme knockout experiments, and metabolic control.
