40|$|The Atacama trench, {{the deepest}} {{ecosystem}} {{of the southern}} Pacific Ocean (ca. 8000 m depth) was investigated during the Atacama Trench International Expedition. Sediments, collected at three bathyal stations (1040 - 1355 m depth) and at a hadal site (7800 m) were analyzed for organic matter quantity and biochemical composition (in terms of phytopigments, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids), bacterial abundance, biomass and carbon production and extracellular enzymatic activities. Functional chlorophyll-a (18. 0 ± 0. 10 mg m - 2), phytodetritus (322. 2 mg m- 2) and labile organic carbon (16. 9 ± 4. 3 g Cm- 2) deposited on surface sediments at <b>hadal</b> <b>depth</b> (7800 m) reached concentrations similar to those encountered in highly productive shallow coastal areas. High values of bacterial C production and aminopeptidase activity were also measured (at in situ temperature and 1 atm). The chemical analyses of the Atacama hadal sediments indicate that this trench behaves as a deep oceanic trap for organic material.

40|$|High {{pressure}} and low temperatures, {{both of which}} are inherent to the deep ocean, are fundamental physical parameters to which organisms must adapt, but increased hydrostatic pressure is especially unique to the depths of the ocean. The elusive deep marine environment is home to a plethora of piezophilic ("pressure-loving") microorganisms with incredible physiological adaptations, but unfortunately they are yet still poorly understood. This study documents the selection of an Escherichia coli population, designated L 62 A, following experimental directed evolution using increasingly higher pressure treatments at 37 °C. After 62 transfers and 504 generations, a strain from the L 62 A population, AN 62 - 1 was obtained at 62 MPa (megapascals), correlating to a <b>hadal</b> <b>depth</b> of 6, 124 meters. Through detailed growth studies, it was determined that AN 62 - 1 is piezotolerant and, in contrast to its parental strain, can grow robustly at 59 MPa. AN 62 - 1 has unique colony and internal cell morphology, increased production of monounsaturated fatty acids, and a mutation in the acpP gene, which encodes acyl-carrier protein. This study provides a novel strain of E. coli for future investigations of high-pressure adaptation and demonstrates the feasibility of directed evolution to assess microbial growth adaptation as a function of hydrostatic pressur...|$|E

This area, characterised by very high concentrations of nutritionally-rich organic matter also at 7800 -m depth, displayed characteristics typical of eutrophic systems and revealed high nematode densities (> 6000 ind. 10 cm - 2). Nematode assemblages from the Atacama Trench displayed a different composition than at bathyal depths. At bathyal depths 95 genera and 119 species were found (Comesomatidae, Cyatholaimidae, Microlaimidae, Desmodoridae and Xyalidae being dominant), whereas in the Atacama Trench only 29 genera and 37 species were encountered (dominated by Monhysteridae, Chromadoridae, Microlaimidae, Oxystominidae and Xyalidae). The genus Monhystera (24. 4 %) strongly dominated at <b>hadal</b> <b>depths</b> and Neochromadora, and Trileptium were observed only in the Atacama Trench, but not at bathyal depths. A reduction of the mean nematode size (by ca. 67 %) was observed between bathyal and <b>hadal</b> <b>depths.</b> Since food availability was not a limiting factor in the Atacama Trench sediments, other causes {{are likely to be}} responsible for the reduction of nematode species richness and body size. The presence of a restricted number of families and genera in the Atacama Trench might indicate that hadal sediments limited nematode colonisation. Most of the genera reaching very high densities in Trench sediments (e. g., Monhystera) are opportunistic and were responsible for the significant decrease of the maturity index. The dominance of opportunists, which are known to be characterised by small sizes, might have contributed to the reduced nematode size at <b>hadal</b> <b>depths.</b> Shannon diversity and species richness decreased in <b>hadal</b> water <b>depth</b> and this pattern was more evident at genus than at species level. Epistrate feeders dominated and increased their relevance, determining a reduction of the index of trophic diversity at <b>hadal</b> <b>depths.</b> According to trophic diversity, taxonomic diversity and distinctness also decreased with depth. All diversity indices from the Atacama Slope and Trench were lower than in other equally deep areas world wide (e. g. Puerto Rico Trench).

40|$|AbstractDeep-sea {{trenches}} remain one of {{the least}} explored ocean ecosystems due to the unique challenges of sampling at great depths. Five submersible dives conducted using the DEEPSEA CHALLENGER submersible generated video of undisturbed deep-sea communities at bathyal (994 m), abyssal (3755 m), and <b>hadal</b> (8228 m) <b>depths</b> in the New Britain Trench, bathyal depths near the Ulithi atoll (1192 m), and <b>hadal</b> <b>depths</b> in the Mariana Trench Challenger Deep (10908 m). The New Britain Trench is overlain by waters with higher net primary productivity (~ 3 -fold) than the Mariana Trench and nearby Ulithi, and receives substantially more allochthonous input from terrestrial sources, based on the presence of terrestrial debris in submersible video footage. Comparisons between trenches addressed how differences in productivity regime influence benthic and demersal deep-sea community structure. In addition, the scavenger community was studied using paired lander deployments to the New Britain (8233 m) and Mariana (10918 m) trenches. Differences in allochthonous input were reflected in epibenthic community abundance, biodiversity, and lifestyle representation. More productive locations were characterized by higher faunal abundances (~ 2 -fold) at both bathyal and <b>hadal</b> <b>depths.</b> In contrast, biodiversity trends showed a unimodal pattern with more food-rich areas exhibiting reduced bathyal diversity and elevated hadal diversity. Hadal scavenging communities exhibited similar higher abundance but also ~ 3 -fold higher species richness in the more food-rich New Britain Trench compared to the Mariana Trench. High species- and phylum-level diversity observed in the New Britain Trench suggest that trench environments may foster higher megafaunal biodiversity than surrounding abyssal depths if food is not limiting. However, the absence of fish at our hadal sites suggests that certain groups do have physiological depth limits. Submersible video footage allowed novel in situ observation of holothurian orientation, jellyfish feeding behavior as well as lifestyle preferences for substrate, seafloor and overlying water. This study documents previously unreported species in the New Britain Trench, including an ulmariid scyphozoan (8233 m) and an acrocirrid polychaete (994 m), and reports the first observation of an abundant population of elpidiid holothurians in the Mariana Trench (10908 m).

Recent developments in accessing and sampling the hadal zone 6000 – 11, 000 m) have led to an acceleration in new findings in the deep subduction trenches, particularly in the Pacific Ocean. This study describes the discovery of two new species of snailfish (Liparidae) from the Mariana Trench; the ‘Mariana snailfish’ (6198 – 8076 m) and the ‘Ethereal snailfish’ (7939 – 8145 m). These new findings represent respectively the deepest known specimen caught with corroborating depth data, and the deepest fish seen alive.

The Nereus underwater vehicle is designed to perform scientific survey and sampling to the full depth of the ocean — signif-icantly deeper than the depth capability of all other present-day operational vehicles. For comparison, the second deepest underwater vehicle currently operational worldwide can dive to 7, 000 m maximum depth. Nereus operates in two different modes. For broad-area survey, the vehicle can operate untethered as an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of exploring and mapping the sea floor with sonars and cameras. Nereus can be converted at sea to become a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to enable close-up imaging and sampling.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{species of}} the genus Priapulus occur in rather cold water. Hence, their shallow-water {{distribution}} is restricted to northern and southern waters (fig. 1); {{there are only a}} few isolated records from sub-tropical localities. However, in deep water the genus apparently has a world-wide distribution (fig. 2). The northern species (P. caudatus De Lamarck) and the southern species (P. tuberculatospinosus Baird) from shallow water are well defined but the specimens from the deep sea present systematical problems. In my survey of the Priapulida (Van der Land, 1970) I could not answer the question of their identity, because I had seen only very few specimens from deep water and not a single one from the tropical deep sea. Meanwhile I could study the material collected during cruises of the Russian R. V. "Vitjaz" (10 specimens), the Danish R. V. "Galathea" (2 specimens), and the American R. V. "Vema" (1 specimen) and R. V. "Eltanin" (2 specimens), i. e., 15 of the 20 specimens known from abyssal and <b>hadal</b> <b>depths.</b> The results are given in the present paper, which should be considered an addendum to my earlier paper. MATERIAL Priapulids have not been obtained from the deep sea very often. Probably this is not due to their rarity but to their digging habits and their usually low population densities (they are predacious animals). Below are listed all specimens, to my knowledge, that have been taken from depths greater than 2000 m. Each specimen is given a number for easy reference.

40|$|Echinoderms {{are one of}} {{the main}} benthic {{invertebrate}} groups, especially in deep waters. Particularly, ophiuroids constitute a common component of megabenthic communities, widely distributed worldwide, from intertidal zone to <b>hadal</b> <b>depths.</b> Within this group, dense aggregations of different species, mostly belonging to suspension-feeder families such as Ophiothrichidae, Ophiactidae, Amphiuridae, Ophiocomidae and Ophiacanthidae, were described worldwide, both in shallow and deep waters and over different sea-bottom types. These aggregations were related with their social behavior, but also with favorable environmental conditions and sometimes were described associated with other suspension-feeders like deep-waters corals. During ten Spanish and Norwegian surveys carried out in Northwest Africa between 2002 and 2012 on board of R/V Vizconde de Eza and R/V Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, an intensive sampling program focused on the study of benthic communities was accomplished in the framework of EcoAfrik and FAO EAF-Nansen projects. In this work, we described, for first time in this area, the existence of ophiuroid sea-beds, mainly concentrated along the Saharan and Mauritanian slope The most impressive sea-beds, estimated in more than 3, 700, 000 individuals of Ophiacantha abyssicola by km 2, was recorded off Western Sahara between 410 and 520 m depth on muddy-bottoms. In addition, dense aggregations of Ophiotrix maculata were described for first time for this species at 410 m in the Saharan slope on living Lophelia pertusa, and also between 197 - 240 m depth on rocky bottom in the seamount off Mauritania. The particular oceanographic conditions in the Saharan-Mauritanian coast linked to the permanence of the upwelling conditions throughout the year, probably enhance the development of suspension-feeders communities and also of these ophiuroids sea-beds...|$|R
40|$|The {{nematode}} community {{structure of}} several shelf break and deep-sea {{stations in the}} North Atlantic and the Mediterranean is compared {{using data from the}} literature. Samples from 2 Mediterranean deep-sea canyons have a unique fauna of predatory and scavenging nematodes (e. g. Synonchiella, Halichoanolaimus, Gammanema) which comprise some 20 to 30 % of the community, while some of the typical deep-sea genera (Theristus, Acantholaimus) are only marginally present. The nematode generic composition of the other sites reveals a gentle transition from the shelf break (Bay of Biscay; Mediterranean) over the slope (Mediterranean) towards the continental rise, abyssal plain and <b>hadal</b> <b>depths</b> (Bay of Biscay, Puerto Rico Trench, HEBBLE site, Hatteras Abyssal Plain). At all these sites predators and omnivores are less abundant (< 10 %), while bacterial feeders (deposit and epistrate feeders) predominate. With increasing water depth, the genus Sabatieria becomes less dominant, while the genera Theristus, Acantholaimus and Halalaimus gain in importance. We suggest that this is caused by the growing importance of the oxic mineralization pathway at greater depth, As such the relative amount of organic matter that enters the suboxic and anoxic regions of the sediment diminishes with depth. These anoxic or suboxic regions are typically inhabited by Sabatieria. It is argued that larger fluxes of organic matter to the bottom in the Mediterranean canyon, compared to the other sites, allow for a higher trophic complexity of the nematode communities and a higher mean nematode biomass. Trends in nematode biomass, mean individual weight and nematode density are discussed.

40|$|Deep-sea soft sediments from trench {{systems and}} depths {{in the northwestern}} Pacific Ocean ranging from less than 300 to 10 897 m in depth have been {{analyzed}} for three target genera of actinomycetes: Micromonospora, Rhodococcus, and Streptomyces. Only culturable strains, recovered at atmospheric pressure on selective isolation media, have been examined to date. Maximum recoveries of culturable bacteria were greater that 10 (7) /ml wet g sediment, but actinomycetes comprised {{a small proportion of}} this population (usually less than 1 %). The target actinomycetes were isolated at all depths except from the Mariana Trench sediments. Actinomycete colonies were defined initially on the basis of colony morphologies, and preliminary identification then was made by chemotaxonomic tests. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PyMS) of deep-sea mycolic acid-containing actinomycetes gave excellent correspondence with numerical (phenetic) taxonomic analyses and subsequently was adopted as a rapid procedure for assessing taxonomic diversity. PyMS analysis enabled several clusters of deep-sea rhodococci to be distinguished that are quite distinct from all type strains. 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis has revealed that several of these marine rhodococci have sequences that are very similar to certain terrestrial species of Rhodococcus and to Dietzia. There is evidence for the intrusion of terrestrial runoff into these deep trench systems, and the inconsistency of the phenotypic and molecular taxonomies may reflect recent speciation events in actinomycetes under the high-pressure conditions of the deep sea. The results of DNA-DNA pairing experiments point to the novelty of Rhodococcus strains recovered from <b>hadal</b> <b>depths</b> in the Izu Bonin Trench. Biotransformation studies of deep-sea bacteria have focused on nitrile compounds.

40|$|We {{examined}} four multilocular agglutinated foraminiferan tests {{from the}} Challenger Deep, the deepest {{point in the}} world's oceans and well below the depth at which biogenic and most detrital minerals disappear from the sediment. The specimens represent undescribed species. Three are trochamminaceans in which imprints and other traces of dissolved agglutinated particles are visible in the orange or yellowish organic test lining. In Trochamminacean sp. A, a delicate meshwork of organic cement forms ridges between the grain impressions. The remnants of test particles include organic structures identifiable as moulds of coccoliths produced by the genus Helicosphaera. Their random alignment suggests that they were agglutinated individually rather than as fragments of a coccosphere. Trochamminacean sp. C incorporates discoidal structures with a central hole; these probably represent the proximal sides of isolated distal shields of another coccolith species, possibly Hayaster perplexus. Imprints of planktonic foraminiferan test fragments are also present in both these trochamminaceans. In Trochamminacean sp. B, the test surface is densely pitted with deep, often angular imprints ranging from roughly equidimensional to rod-shaped. The surfaces are either smooth, or have prominent longitudinal striations, probably made by cleavage traces. We presume these imprints represent mineral grains of various types that subsequently dissolved. X-ray microanalyses reveal strong peaks for Ca associated with grain impressions and coccolith remains in Trochamminacean sp. C. Minor peaks for this element are associated with coccolith remains and planktonic foraminiferan imprints in Trochamminacean sp. A. These Ca peaks possibly originate from traces of calcite remaining on the test surfaces. Agglutinated particles, presumably clay minerals, survive only in the fourth specimen (‘Textularia’ sp.). Here, the final 4 – 5 chambers comprise a pavement of small, irregularly shaped grains with flat surfaces and no obvious intervening cement. Our observations suggest that (1) small biogenic particles can reach the deepest parts of the ocean intact in rapidly sinking phytodetrital aggregates or faecal pellets and (2) some agglutinated foraminifera living at extreme <b>hadal</b> <b>depths</b> construct a test from biogenic or detrital particles, which subsequently dissolve, leaving imprints and other remnants in the organic matrix of the test. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{hadal zone}} {{is the common}} name for the deepest section of the ocean (6, 000 - 11, 000 m depth). It {{encompasses}} 45 % of the ocean’s depth range, and is mostly represented by oceanic trenches. Trench habitats lack sufficient sampling and the communities within are not well understood. Often, samples are derived from a single depth and thus the population dynamics of trench communities have not been analysed comprehensively. Scavenging amphipods are abundant and diverse taxa in the trench environment, and {{have been found in}} every trench sampled to date. They rapidly intercept and consume carrion falls at the deepest trench depths, and act as key prey items to predators in the shallower <b>depths</b> of the <b>hadal</b> zone. There appears to be a relationship of increasing abundance and decreasing diversity of scavenging amphipods with depth. However in the Tonga Trench, sampling of hadal amphipods has been limited, and these patterns remain unclear. The QUELLE (Quest for the Limit of Life) project in 2013 was led by The Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). As part of this project, the YOK 13 - 10 voyage examined scavenging amphipods in the Tonga Trench. The voyage used baited traps to sample depths of ˜ 6, 250 m and ˜ 10, 800 m from October 6 – October 21 in 2013. The main objectives of the present study were to: identify scavenging amphipod assemblages within the Tonga Trench and compare them to other trenches of the South Pacific; analyse the population structure of Hirondellea dubia between depths in the Tonga Trench; and identify a suitable total length proxy for H. dubia. Six species of amphipods were identified from depths of ˜ 6, 250 m and ˜ 10, 800 m in the Tonga Trench. At ˜ 6, 250 m Alicella gigantea, Eurythenes gryllus, H. dubia, Bathycallisoma schellenbergi, an alicellid species, and a gammarid species were recovered. In contrast, H. dubia was the only species recovered from ˜ 10, 800 m. The abundance of amphipods was higher at the ˜ 10, 800 m site while the diversity was much lower. The assemblage of scavenging amphipods in the Tonga Trench was similar to those from past sampling efforts in the same trench. There were also similarities to the assemblages in the adjacent Kermadec Trench, and together these observations support the classification of these two trenches as a single biogeographic province. The assemblages in the Peru-Chile Trench in the South East Pacific were more dissimilar sharing only a few species. The present study provides new Tonga Trench records of the vertical ranges of A. gigantea, E. gryllus, and H. dubia. It also extends the maximum known depth of H. dubia to 10, 807 m. This thesis expanded our current knowledge of A. gigantea, by reporting the first instance of this large amphipod in the Tonga Trench, and the second known instance of the species at <b>hadal</b> <b>depths.</b> An analysis of Hirondellea dubia population structure revealed ontogenetic vertical structuring in the Tonga Trench. Juveniles dominated the composition in the shallow end of the H. dubia vertical range, while very few juveniles were found at the deepest site. Juveniles were substantially smaller at ˜ 6, 250 m compared to ˜ 10, 800 m, and this may suggest that juveniles migrate down the trench slope with increasing age. The most likely mechanism for distributing juveniles to the shallower depths is the ascending migration of brooding females. However, this is still not certain as no brooding females were captured. The shallower depth provides a higher quality of food source and the reduced hydrostatic pressure allows for a faster metabolic rate. Thus, this distribution is likely driven by the distribution of food sources throughout the trench in combination with hydrostatic pressure. The dimensions of several established proxies for total length were evaluated for H. dubia. Pereonite 2 - 7 had the strongest correlation to total length, however it was highly distorted by dorsal curvature. Both the pereonite 2 - 7 and the pleosome were considered inaccurate due to sexual dimorphism making them inappropriate as proxies. Pereonite 1 was proportionately larger in juvenile lifestages. However, overall pereonite 1 was considered the strongest candidate for a proxy, this is because it was the least influenced by dorsal curvature and was a conspicuous segment that was easy to measure...|$|R
40|$|The Japan Trench {{is located}} under the {{eutrophic}} Northwestern Pacific while the Mariana Trench that harbors the unique hadal planktonic biosphere is located under the oligotrophic Pacific. Water {{samples from the}} sea surface to just above the seafloor at a total of 11 stations including a trench axis station, were investigated several months after the Tohoku Earthquake in March 2011. High turbidity zones in deep waters were observed at most of the sampling stations. The small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene community structures in the <b>hadal</b> waters (water <b>depths</b> below 6000 m) at the trench axis station were distinct {{from those in the}} overlying meso-, bathy and abyssopelagic waters (water depths between 200 and 1000 m, 1000 and 4000 m and 4000 and 6000 m, respectively), although the SSU rRNA gene sequences suggested that potential heterotrophic bacteria dominated in all of the waters. Potential niche separation of nitrifiers, including ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), was revealed by quantitative PCR analyses. It seems likely that Nitrosopumilus-like AOAs respond to a high flux of electron donors and dominate in several zones of water columns including shallow and very deep waters. This study highlights the effects of suspended organic matter, as induced by seafloor deformation, on microbial communities in deep waters and confirm the occurrence of the distinctive hadal biosphere in global trench environments hypothesized in the previous study.
