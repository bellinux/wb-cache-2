5|$|Shastry critiqued {{the work}} Śrībhārgavarāghavīyam in the January 2003 {{issue of the}} Sanskrit monthly Bhāratī. Shastry writes that the work has poetic excellence, variety of meters and dexterity of {{language}} which <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> hitherto in Sanskrit epics. Shastry finds the twentieth canto of the epic to be an excellent illustration of Sanskrit poetry in Prakrit verses, a style which was pioneered by Shastry's father.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in humans, and {{the toxicity}} depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a {{median lethal dose}} (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal {{studies have shown that}} chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behavior. The Lānai hookbill is only known to have eaten {{the fruit of the}} ōpuhe; however, it is unlikely that its unique bill would have developed to eat fruit, and {{it may have been a}} snail specialist. The hookbill <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> since 1918, and by 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields, destroying the bird’s habitat. The combination of habitat destruction and the introduction of feral cats and rats are thought to have led to the Lānai hookbill’s extinction.|$|E

Monaco returned to the contest in 2004, after over two decades out of the contest. However, the country failed to advance from the semi-final with each of its first three entries post-return, and withdrew after the 2006 Contest.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Simone biographical film were {{released}} {{at the end}} of 2005, to be based on Simone's autobiography I Put a Spell on You (1992) and to focus on her relationship in later life with her assistant, Clifton Henderson, who died in 2006; Simone's daughter, Simone Kelly, has since refuted the existence of a romantic relationship between Simone and Henderson on account of his homosexuality. Cynthia Mort, screenwriter of Will & Grace and Roseanne, has written the screenplay and directed the film, Nina, which stars Zoe Saldana in the title role. In May 2014, the film was shown to potential distributors at the Cannes Film Festival, but <b>has,</b> , <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> by reviewers.|$|E

5|$|The three serotypes of poliovirus, PV1, PV2, and PV3, {{each have}} a {{slightly}} different capsid protein. Capsid proteins define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity.

5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, {{or a combination of}} these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very happy couple.|$|E
5|$|In 19th Century Russia, Vladimir Durfe (Mark Damon) {{is a young}} nobleman {{who finds}} a {{beheaded}} corpse with a knife plunged into its heart. He takes the blade, and finds shelter in a small cottage. Durfe is approached by Giorgio (Glauco Onorato) who explains that the knife belongs to his father, who <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> for five days. Giorgio offers a room to Durfe and introduces him {{to the rest of}} the family: his wife (Rika Dialina), their young son Ivan, Giorgio's younger brother Pietro (Massimo Righi), and sister Sdenka (Susy Andersen). They all await the return of Gorca, who has gone to fight the wurdalak, a living cadaver who feeds on human blood, especially of close friends and family members. At midnight, Gorca (Boris Karloff) returns to the cottage with a sour demeanor and unkempt appearance. After the family goes to sleep, Ivan and Pietro are attacked by Gorca who flees the cottage with Ivan. Giorgio chases after Gorca but only returns with Ivan's corpse. Giorgio plans to stake and behead Ivan to prevent him from reviving as a Wurdalak, but is prevented from doing so by his wife. The two agree to give their son a burial.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E

5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog was first {{described}} as Rana aurea by Lesson in 1827. It has changed classification 20 times; {{it was first}} named Litoria aurea in 1844 by Günther, and changed another 9 times before being named again as Litoria aurea. The specific epithet aurea derived from the Latin aureus for 'golden'. The species is now classified within the Litoria aurea complex, a closely related group of frogs in the Litoria genus. This complex is scattered throughout Australia: three species occur in south-east Australia, one in northern Australia, and two in Southwest Australia. The complex consists of the green and golden bell frog (L. aurea), growling grass frog (L. raniformis), yellow-spotted bell frog (L. castanea), Dahl's aquatic frog (L. dahlii), spotted-thighed frog (L. cyclorhyncha) and the motorbike frog (L. moorei). The ranges of L. raniformis and L. castanea overlap with the green and golden bell frog; this, {{as well as physical}} similarities, may make it difficult to distinguish between the species, and until 1972, L. raniformis and the green and golden bell frog were regarded as the same, when electrophoretic studies proved them to be distinct. The tablelands bell frog <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> since 1980 and may now be extinct, although the large yellow spots present on its thighs help distinguish it from the green and golden bell frog. The growling grass frog, which is very similar to the green and golden bell frog, can only be readily distinguished by raised bumps on the dorsal surface. It has also been proposed that some populations of L. aurea located near Ulong, New South Wales, be a separate subspecies, L. a. ulongae, but this was not accepted.|$|E
