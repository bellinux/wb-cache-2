5|$|Sajak {{hosted the}} daytime series until January 9, 1989, {{when he left}} to host a late-night talk show for CBS. Rolf Benirschke, a former placekicker in the National Football League, was chosen as his {{replacement}} and hosted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than five months. Benirschke's term as host {{came to an end}} due to NBC's cancellation of the daytime Wheel after fourteen years, with its final episode airing on June 30, 1989. When the newly formatted daytime series returned on CBS on July 17, 1989, Bob Goen became its host.

5|$|Bennington served In the Pacific <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> {{than four}} years. For the most part, her duty {{consisted}} of cruising {{along the west}} coast protecting American interests in Latin America during the numerous political upheavals that occurred {{at that time in}} Central and South America. In addition, she made two extended cruises to the Hawaiian Islands. The first came after a group of pro-royalists attempted in January 1895 to stage a countercoup against the provisional government of the islands. Bennington departed Mare Island on 28 May, arrived at Honolulu on 5 June, and spent the next nine months protecting American interests in the islands. On 5 March 1896, she departed Honolulu, bound for San Francisco where she arrived on 16 March. The following day, the warship entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for five months of repairs.|$|E

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> {{than two}} years after her February 1899 arrival, Bennington served in the Philippine Islands in support of the Army's campaigns during the Philippine–American War. For the most part, her service in the islands {{consisted}} of patrol and escort duty – preventing rebel movement and stopping the importation of arms, as well as seeing American troops and supplies safely between the islands. Occasionally, Bennington did see action. On 10 September, she shelled a fort near Legaspi on the southeastern coast of Luzon. Two days later, she captured and destroyed the insurgent vessel Parao. Between 7 and 9 November, the warship supported an Army landing at San Fabian on the shores of Lingayen Gulf in northwestern Luzon. The gunboat began a four-month assignment as station ship at Cebu on 26 November and concluded that duty on 19 March 1900.|$|E

[...] IGN's Eric Goldman rated [...] "Journey to Regionals" [...] 8.5/10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] episode.

Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted that he [...] "went into the finale peeved at how incredibly messy last week's episode was", but overall he deemed the finale a success. Vanity Fair Brett Berk found [...] "Journey to Regionals" [...] a fulfilling, albeit [...] "pretty mediocre" [...] episode, describing it as having [...] "a sense of narrative cohesion that went beyond the writers’ usual throwing-flatware-down-the-garburator modality". Jean Bentley of MTV found the episode representative of the first season as a whole, explaining: [...] "Much like the entire first year of the show, the uneven episode started out with a promising, action-packed plot, impressed with a couple of flashy musical numbers, then got too cheesy for its own good and petered out with an overly sentimental song." [...] Fellow MTV writer Aly Semigran noted: [...] "I was hoping <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> excitement from the episode, though it all did feel very full circle for so many of our characters we've come to know and love.
