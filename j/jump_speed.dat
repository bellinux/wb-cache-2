50|$|On October 1, 2013, {{investigator}} Jöran Hägglund {{indicated that}} {{it is entirely possible}} to host the Winter Olympics in Stockholm. Hägglund estimated the implementation budget to 9.79 billion SEK (€ 1.13 billion) and the investment budget to 2.5 billion SEK (€ 290 million). The games will be concentrated entirely in the Stockholm area, and only eight of the alpine events are planned to be held in Åre. He also said that five investments are necessary; a new track to bobsleigh, luge and skeleton, improve the vertical drop fairly much in Flottsbrobacken, a new ski <b>jump,</b> <b>speed</b> skating venue and a cross country venue. The infrastructure and other ice venues already exists in Stockholm. The reason for this cost cut is that the Swedish government does not want to support the games with big money (several 100 million euros). However the IOC requires the government to guarantee support for cost overruns etc. A more thorough investigation showed that the cost estimation was uncertain. IOC requirements would demand reconstruction of several existing arenas, adding VIP lounges for IOC members and separate ones for media, restaurant kitchens etc.|$|E

40|$|PurposeAnterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) injuries commonly occur {{during the early}} phase of landing and cutting tasks that involve sudden decelerations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of jump height and <b>jump</b> <b>speed</b> on lower extremity biomechanics during a stop-jump task and the effect of cutting speed on lower extremity biomechanics during a side-cutting task. MethodsThirty-six recreational athletes performed a stop-jump task under 3 conditions: jumping fast, jumping for maximum height, and jumping for 60 % of maximum height. Participants also performed a side-cutting task under 2 conditions: cutting at maximum speed and cutting at 60 % of maximum speed. Three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data were collected. ResultsThe jumping fast condition resulted in increased peak posterior ground reaction force (PPGRF), knee extension moment at PPGRF, and knee joint stiffness and decreased knee flexion angle compared with the jumping for maximum height condition. The jumping for 60 % of maximum height condition resulted in decreased knee flexion angle compared with the jumping for maximum height condition. Participants demonstrated greater PPGRF, knee extension moment at PPGRF, knee valgus angle and varus moment at PPGRF, knee joint stiffness, and knee flexion angle during the cutting at maximum speed condition compared with the cutting at 60 % maximum speed condition. ConclusionPerforming jump landing at an increased <b>jump</b> <b>speed</b> resulted in lower extremity movement patterns that have been previously associated with an increase in ACL loading. Cutting speed also affected lower extremity biomechanics. <b>Jump</b> <b>speed</b> and cutting speed need to be considered when designing ACL injury risk screening and injury prevention programs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDebris {{distribution}} and dielectric fluid flow within the machining gap in {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) are important factors related to stable and precision machining. Hence understanding of the debris removal process is essential in improving EDM process. In this research, electrode jump motion with different jump heights and speeds was investigated to comprehend {{its effect on the}} fluid flow and debris-fluid interaction. A simplified fluid dynamics model characterizing the motion of the square shape electrode was established to study theoretically the effect of electrode <b>jump</b> <b>speed</b> on the debris-fluid flow. A setup to realize the electrode motion was designed. The Z-axis equipped with a linear motor was used to provide high speed jump function. The flow images were recorded by a high-speed camera, and the flow of the debris inside the hole was captured for analysis. Analytical results show that the fluid pressure at the bottom region of the electrode would reduce with the increase of electrode <b>jump</b> <b>speed.</b> Bubbles are generated once this pressure falls below the vapor pressure of the fluid. For the square shape electrode, it is found from the experiment that bubbles are prone to occur when the machining depth is increased. The result also shows that debris can be excluded easier when the electrode jump height is larger than 1 / 4 machining depth. Furthermore, using a large jump height incorporated with an electrode <b>jump</b> <b>speed</b> near the critical speed of bubble generation results in the most effective debris removal. On the other hand, the flow field of a high aspect ratio thin and flat electrode is {{different from that of the}} square electrode. There is no bubble generated during high-speed jump motion. The findings of this paper can be taken as the basis for choosing appropriate parameters of electrode jump motion in EDM deep cavity drilling...|$|E
40|$|Research {{examining}} kinematic {{parameters of}} the canine athlete is markedly behind equivalent human and equine research. With increasing participation and popularity, canine sports science needs to bridge this gap with comparable equine research. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine changes to specific kinematic parameters as hurdle height increases. Twenty border collies and border collie crosses were analysed jumping over a single hurdle at increasing heights, starting with a pole on the floor and increasing to a maximum height of 65 cm. Length of trajectory and <b>jump</b> <b>speed</b> were analysed, alongside apparent (without the use of markers) neck, lumbar spine and shoulder angles using Dartfish software. For each dog, the percentage of the hurdle height in relation to their height at the dorsal aspect of the scapula (withers) was used to normalise the dogs evenly. Overall <b>jump</b> <b>speed</b> decreased as percentage height increased (P < 0. 001), with a strong negative correlation between the two (r = - 0. 815).

Patients and Methods: Twenty-one healthy male college football players (age: 20. 14 ± 1. 65 years; body height: 179. 9 ± 8. 34 cm; body mass: 74. 4 ± 13. 0 kg; % body fat: 9. 45 ± 4. 8) underwent randomized controlled trials that involved standing in a half squat position (ST), ST with 30 % of bodyweight (ST + 30 %), whole body vibration at f = 50 Hz, A = 4 mm (WBV), and WBV with 30 % bodyweight (WBV + 30 % BW) after a standardized warm-up. Post measures of countermovement jump, 15 -m sprint, and modified t-test were utilized for analyses. Results: One way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant difference in the countermovement jump performance, F (3, 60 = 9. 06, η 2 = 2. 21, P = 0. 000. Post-hoc showed that WBV + 30 % BW posted significant difference compared to (P = 0. 008), ST + 30 % BW (P = 0. 000) and WBV (P = 0. 000). There was also a significant difference in the sprint times among interventions, F (3, 60) = 23. 0, η 2 = 0. 865, P = 0. 000. Post hoc showed that WBV + 30 % BW displayed significantly lower time values than ST (P = 0. 000), ST + 30 % BW (P = 0. 000) and WBV (P = 0. 000). Lastly, there was a significant difference in the agility performance across experimental conditions at F(2. 01, 40. 1) = 21. 0, η 2 = 0. 954, P = 0. 000.
