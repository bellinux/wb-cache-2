2500|$|In a 2010 Vanity Fair interview, Vilanch {{was asked}} {{for whom he}} wrote the Oscars show jokes, replying: [...] "I write across the board. Every year it breaks down differently, {{depending}} on the host, but as we {{get closer to the}} date, all of the writers tend to be writing over each other.

There's a lot of mileage involved in writing for the Academy Awards, you go through a lot of hoops." [...] When asked if he could see himself doing the job for another 21 years, he replied: [...] "Absolutely. It's the greatest show on Earth.
