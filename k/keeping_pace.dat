5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is a non-fiction book by Canadian {{academic}} Thomas Homer-Dixon. It {{was written}} {{over the course}} of eight years from 1992 to 2000 when it was published by Knopf. The book argues that the nature of problems faced by our society are becoming more complex and that our ability to implement solutions is not <b>keeping</b> <b>pace.</b> Homer-Dixon focuses upon complexities, unexpected non-linear results, and emergent properties. He takes an inter-disciplinary approach connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, and ecology.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} parts and {{derivatives}} of pygmy lorises in trade, {{such as the}} skin and the hair. All parts of the animal are used in traditional Khmer medicine. In Vietnam, medicine such as bone glue of monkey, is mainly produced by local people, but a smaller portion is also destined for restaurants or sold to visitors. The species is especially used for the assumed medicinal value of its hair. Traders have reported that they have difficulty <b>keeping</b> <b>pace</b> with demand—one trader claimed to have sold nearly 1,200 pygmy slow lorises during 2001–2002. In Cambodia, the deeply rooted tradition of using the Bengal and pygmy slow loris in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh.|$|E
5|$|Park's plan paid dividends. Bf 110s from ZG 26 {{were soon}} {{discovered}} by No. 56 Squadron and quickly found themselves under attack. In {{the short and}} sharp engagement, ZG 26 lost five Bf 110s and another damaged to No. 56 Squadron. Worse was to follow when No. 54 and 501 engaged the Messerschmitts. ZG 26 lost a further two shot down and two damaged to No. 54 Squadron. None of the RAF Squadrons reported any losses in these engagements. The Geschwader lost other machines to No. 151 and No. 46 Squadrons who arrived to join the battle. According to one source, the total losses of ZG 26 amounted to 12 destroyed and seven damaged throughout the entire day. Another source gives a list of 15 Bf 110s written off; 13 destroyed, two written off and six damaged on 18 August 1940. Whatever the actual losses, The Hardest Day marked {{the start of a}} decline in Bf 110 operations. Production was not <b>keeping</b> <b>pace</b> with losses, and there simply were not enough aircraft to go around.|$|E

25|$|Apple {{discontinued}} {{the use of}} PowerPC microprocessors in 2006. At WWDC 2005, Steve Jobs {{announced this}} transition, revealing that Mac OS X was always developed to run on both the Intel and PowerPC architectures. This was done in order to modernize the company's computers, <b>keeping</b> <b>pace</b> with Intel's low power Pentium M chips, especially for heat-sensitive laptops. The PowerPC G5 chip's heavy power consumption and heat output (the Power Mac G5 had to be liquid-cooled) also prevented its use in Mac notebook computers (as well as the original Mac mini), which were forced to use the older and slower PowerPC G4 chip. These shortcomings of the PowerPC chips were the main reasons behind Apple's transition to Intel processors, and the brand was revitalised by the subsequent boost in processing power available due to greater efficiency {{and the ability to}} implement multiple cores in Mac CPUs.|$|E
25|$|The 12th {{moved to}} Vogelsang Airfield (Y-61) Euren, Germany on 2 March 1945. During March, 320 {{missions}} were flown {{in support of}} the Third Army’s break through of the Siegfried Line. At this point, the squadron received an order stressing the fact that the 12th was a reconnaissance squadron and that engagements with the enemy should not be encouraged. Reconnaissance areas changed rapidly in <b>keeping</b> <b>pace</b> with Patton. During the first part of April, targets included Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Wurzburg, and Kassel. Later they were farther east – Gotha, Erfurt, Leipzig, and Chemnitz. Then the 12th moved south to Munich, Regensburg, and Nurnberg, and it finished the month by making long flights (with wing tanks) into Austria and Czechoslovakia, reconnoitering Prague, Pilsen, Linz, and Vienna. Although hostilities in general ceased in Europe on 7 May 1945, the 12th Squadron continued to fly photographic missions in support of Allied forces in Czechoslovakia, where the fighting did not stop until 10 May.|$|E

25|$|In what was, at the time, the most-watched NFL {{regular season}} game since 1996, the Patriots faced the Cowboys, the NFC's only {{remaining}} unbeaten team. The Patriots' first drive {{of the game}} spanned 74yards and ended in a 6-yard touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. After three punts, the Patriots' lead increased to 14–0 after another Brady touchdown pass, this one from 35yards out to Welker. In the second quarter, the Cowboys got on the scoreboard when they culminated a 64-yard, 10-play drive with a 38-yard field goal by Nick Folk. On their ensuing possession, the Patriots advanced 12yards before Brady was strip-sacked by defensive end Greg Ellis; defensive end Jason Hatcher recovered the ball and returned it 29yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 14–10. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 72-yard drive that ended on a 12-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Welker, his second of the day.

25|$|An {{intelligent}} {{transportation system}} (ITS) {{is a system}} of hardware, software, and operators that allow better monitoring and control of traffic in order to optimize traffic flow. As the number of vehicle lane miles traveled per year continues to increase dramatically, and {{as the number of}} vehicle lane miles constructed per year has not been <b>keeping</b> <b>pace,</b> this has led to ever-increasing traffic congestion. As a cost-effective solution toward optimizing traffic, ITS presents a number of technologies to reduce congestion by monitoring traffic flows through the use of sensors and live cameras or analysing cellular phone data travelling in cars (floating car data) and in turn rerouting traffic as needed through the use of variable message boards (VMS), highway advisory radio, on board or off board navigation devices and other systems through integration of traffic data with navigation systems. Additionally, the roadway network has been increasingly fitted with additional communications and control infrastructure to allow traffic operations personnel to monitor weather conditions, for dispatching maintenance crews to perform snow or ice removal, as well as intelligent systems such as automated bridge de-icing systems which help to prevent accidents.|$|E
25|$|Healthcare in Iran {{is based}} on three pillars: the public-governmental system, the private sector, and NGOs. The {{healthcare}} and medical sector's market value in Iran was almost US $24 billion in 2002 and is forecast to rise to US $96 billion in 2017. With a population of 80 million (2017), Iran {{is one of the}} most populous countries in the Middle East. The country faces the common problem of other young demographic nations in the region, which is <b>keeping</b> <b>pace</b> with growth of an already huge demand for various public services. The young population will soon be old enough to start new families, which will boost the population growth rate and subsequently the need for public health infrastructures and services. Total healthcare spending is expected to rise from $24.3 billion in 2008, to $96 billion by 2017, reflecting the increasing demand on medical services. Total health spending was equivalent to 6% of GDP in Iran in 2017. About 90% of Iranians have some form of health insurance. Iran is also the only country with a legal organ trade. However, the legal character of organ donations is deemed to be a gifting of organs and not their sale and purchase.|$|E
