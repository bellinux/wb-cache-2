However, reviewers had mixed experiences with its online component, and found Arcade mode lacking in replay value. According to the game's producer, Ryota Niitsuma, development difficulties {{and a lack}} of Wii fighting games were the reasons for its platform exclusivity; however, multiple critics questioned <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> best choice. Capcom announced in April 2010 that the game was a commercial success.|$|E

25|$|On February 17, 2010 in United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Papp {{appeared}} before the Hon. Gary L. Lancaster, Chief U.S. District Judge, and pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to distribute performance-enhancing drugs, specifically HGH and Erythropoietin (EPO). According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary McKeen Houghton, the retail value of the transactions brokered by Papp between Shandong Kexing Bioproducts Corp. and over 180 international clients approached $80,000USD from September 2006 to September 2007 None of the 187 customers, including cyclists, swimmers, runners, triathletes, mixed-martial artists and rowers, were identified in court. Houghton, Papp, and his attorney, William Ward, {{declined to comment on}} terms of the plea agreement, which had been sealed by the court – a measure often taken if a defendant is cooperating with the government in ongoing investigations, but neither Ward nor Houghton would say at the time <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> case.

25|$|In mid 2008 {{after the}} {{indictment}} had been served, {{it was discovered}} that the main police investigator in the preliminary investigation had started working for one of the plaintiffs, Warner Brothers, before the date of the indictment. Sunde's lawyer Peter Althin questioned the neutrality and reliability of the preliminary investigation in the event that the investigator had entered the new employment during the investigation, and suspected the job might have been a reward for good work in The Pirate Bay investigation. Althin believed that the investigation might have to be redone <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> case. The prosecutor Håkan Roswall responded that it wouldn't have posed problems for the investigation because the police were working under his directive, and the investigator's superior officer brushed off the incident as nothing remarkable. Warner Brothers commented merely that the investigator hadn't received any compensation during the time he worked for the Swedish police. According to Roswall, this type of concurrent employment would not be an individual incident, but that the decision of possible bias would be for the court to decide, and that the investigator is not a key witness in the case. The investigator could not be reached during the trial and was taken off the witness list.|$|E

30|$|With the two {{procedural}} norms {{described in}} the previous sections, we can now analyze whether these two norms are indeed beneficial to reconciling different responsibility conceptions.

500|$|Professor Michael Hicks, a Richard III specialist, {{has been}} {{particularly}} critical {{of the use of}} the mitochondrial DNA to argue that the body is Richard III's, stating that [...] "any male sharing a maternal ancestress in the direct female line could qualify". He also criticises the rejection by the Leicester team of the Y chromosome evidence, suggesting that it was not acceptable to the Leicester team to conclude that the skeleton was anyone other than Richard III. He argues that {{on the basis of the}} present scientific evidence [...] "identification with Richard III is more unlikely that likely". However, Hicks himself draws attention to the contemporary view held by some that Richard III's grandfather, Richard, earl of Cambridge, was the product of an illegitimate union between Cambridge's mother Isabella of Castile (a bastard daughter of Pedro the Cruel of Castile) and John Holland (brother in law of Henry IV of England), rather than Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (Edward III's fourth son). <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> case then the Y chromosome discrepancy with the Beaufort line would be explained but obviously still fail to prove the identity of the body. Hicks suggests alternative candidates descended from Richard III's maternal ancestress for the body (e.g. Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont, John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln) but does not provide evidence to support his suggestions. Philippa Langley, who commissioned the excavation refutes Hicks' argument on the basis that he does not taken into account all the evidence that points to the same conclusion.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, O'Hara {{made her}} fourth picture with Ford, The Long Gray Line, which she {{considered}} being [...] "by {{far the most}} difficult" [...] due to declining relations with John Ford. John Wayne had originally intended co-starring, but due to a conflicting schedule O'Hara recommended Tyrone Power in replacement. Malone notes that the Irish accents by O'Hara and Power are overdone, {{and that there is}} little trace of a Donegal accent in it. The film production marked the lowest point of O'Hara's relationship with Ford, and each day he would greet her with [...] "Well, did Herself have a good shit this morning?". He would ask the crew if she was in a good mood, and <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> case, he would say [...] "then we're going to have a horrible day" [...] and vice versa. He would provoke her by telling her to [...] "move her fat Irish ass". Their relationship deteriorated further when O'Hara reportedly saw him kissing an actor on set, and Ford knew that she thought he was a closeted homosexual. In The Magnificent Matador, O'Hara played a spoiled, wealthy American who {{falls in love with a}} brooding, tormented, about-to-retire matador (Anthony Quinn) in Mexico. Ava Gardner, who was dating a bullfighter in real life, Luis Miguel Dominguín, and Lana Turner were considered for O'Hara's part of Karen Harrison. The film was panned by the critics. One of her best-known roles came later year, playing Lady Godiva in Lady Godiva of Coventry. Contrary to what Universal claimed to the press, O'Hara was not nude in the film, wearing a [...] "full-length body leotard and underwear that was concealed by my long tresses".|$|E
500|$|The Bill was {{introduced}} in Parliament on 21 January 1963. Opposition to the Bill came from DMK members who objected to the usage of the word [...] "may" [...] instead of [...] "shall" [...] in section 3 of the Bill. That section read: [...] "the English language may...continue {{to be used in}} addition to Hindi". The DMK argued was that the term [...] "may" [...] could be interpreted as [...] "may not" [...] by future administrations. They feared that the minority opinion would not be considered and non-Hindi speakers' views would be ignored. On 22 April, Nehru assured the parliamentarians that, for that particular case [...] "may" [...] had the same meaning as [...] "shall". The DMK then demanded, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> case why [...] "shall" [...] was not used instead of [...] "may". Leading the opposition to the Bill was Annadurai (then a Member of the Rajya Sabha). He pleaded for an indefinite continuation of the status quo and argued that continued use of English as official language would [...] "distribute advantages or disadvantages evenly" [...] among Hindi and non-Hindi speakers. The Bill was passed on 27 April without any change in the wording. As he had warned earlier, Annadurai launched statewide protests against Hindi. In November 1963, Annadurai was arrested along with 500 DMK members for burning part XVII of the Constitution at an anti-Hindi Conference. He was sentenced to six months in prison. On 25 January 1964, a DMK member, Chinnasamy, committed suicide at Trichy by self-immolation, to protest the [...] "imposition of Hindi". He was claimed as the first [...] "language martyr" [...] of {{the second round of the}} anti-Hindi struggle by the DMK.|$|E
