Some goods, like orphan drugs, require special governmental incentives to be produced, but can't be classified as public goods since they don't fulfill the above requirements (non-excludable and non-rivalrous.) Law enforcement, streets, libraries, museums, and education are commonly misclassified as public goods, but they are technically classified in economic terms as quasi-public goods because excludability is possible, but they do still fit some {{of the characteristics of}} public goods.|$|E
2500|$|Although a {{thorough}} {{assessment of the}} net impacts on Peru's water resources is still lacking, some trends are discernible. The {{effects of climate change}} in Peru include more extreme weather conditions such as droughts and floods, El Niño Southern Oscillation, increased likelihood of flash fires, changes in the ability of ecosystems to store water, and the retreat of Andean glaciers. The effects of glacier retreat are different at the initial and final stages of glacier retreat—initially more water is available during the dry season, while flow declines below the initial level once the glacier has melted. (See [...] ). High mountain ecosystems, including páramos (unique wetlands of the Northern Andes) and snowcapped terrains are among the environments most sensitive to climate change. These ecosystems have unique endemic flora and provide numerous valuable <b>environmental</b> <b>goods</b> and services. Data recently made available suggest that climate impacts have already altered the circulation patterns responsible for producing and moving water vapor to the region. These changes have likely contributed to the disappearance of high-altitude water bodies, {{as well as to the}} increased occurrence of natural and human-induced mountain fires.|$|E

40|$|We analyze growth {{dynamics}} {{in an economy}} where a private good can be consumed {{as a substitute for}} a free access <b>environmental</b> <b>good.</b> In this context we show that environmental deterioration may be an engine of economic growth. To protect themselves against environmental deterioration, economic agents are forced to increase their labour supply to increase the production and consumption of the private good. This, in turn, further depletes the <b>environmental</b> <b>good,</b> leading economic agents to further increase their labour supply and private consumption and so on. This substitution process may give rise to self-enforcing {{growth dynamics}} characterized by a lack of correlation between capital accumulation and private consumption levels, on one side, and economic agents’ welfare, on the other. Furthermore, we show that agents’ self-protection consumption choices can generate indeterminacy; that is, they can give rise to the existence of a continuum of (Nash) equilibrium orbits leading to the same attracting fixed point or periodic orbit. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{studies have}} shown that firms that have adopted {{environmental}} standards and those that have obtained official quality certifications achieve higher labour productivity than firms that have not done so. Unlike previous studies, this paper analyzes the combined effect of implementing <b>environmental</b> <b>good</b> practices and obtaining quality certifications on apparent labour productivity using a sample of 106 hotels in Andalusia (Spain). To this end, a descriptive analysis and an econometric estimation of a production function were conducted based on data obtained from the Quality, Productivity and Competitiveness in the Hospitality Industry for Andalusia project. We applied a standard Cobb-Douglas production function to this data, and extended the function by introducing an indicator of the implementation of <b>good</b> <b>environmental</b> practice by hotels and four different types of quality certifications as additional explanatory variables. The econometric results indicate that labour productivity increases only when both the Q-mark is awarded and <b>environmental</b> <b>good</b> practices are implemented (by 18. 74 % and 7. 51 %, respectively). In conclusion, the positive response of consumers towards improving environmental and quality measures may be an incentive to invest in these measures...|$|R
