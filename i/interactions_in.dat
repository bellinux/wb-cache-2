5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal <b>interactions</b> <b>in</b> a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E

It was a descriptive qualitative research with a naturalistic approach. The setting of the {{research was}} SMPN 1 Prambanan Klaten. The methods of collecting the data were observation and in-depth interview. The data were {{in the form of}} words, clauses, and sentences. They included field notes and in-depth interview transcripts. The research instrument in this study was the researcher herself. The respondents were the English teacher and students of the bilingual class at SMPN 1 Prambanan. In reference to data analysis, the results are presented below. The description and discussion were based on the findings. The interactions between the teacher and the students were divided into three (1) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> the pre-teaching which was further divided into four, namely greeting, asking students’ condition, checking students’ attendance, and telling the materials that would be learnt by the students in the meeting; (2) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> whilst-teaching which was further divided into three, namely motivating students to learn, rewarding the students, and helping the students learn the material; and (3) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> post-teaching. The <b>interaction</b> between the teacher and a student was divided into three (1) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> pre-teaching; (2) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> whilstteaching which was further divided into two, namely discussing the material activity, and evaluating management activity which were divided into three, namely <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> evaluating based on random technique, interaction based on students’ seat, and <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> evaluating based on students’ attention; and (3) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> post-teaching. <b>Interaction</b> between student and student was focused on (1) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> pre-teaching; (2) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> whilst-teaching divided into two namely, discussing the material activity, and practicing English activity; and (3) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> post-teaching. <b>Interaction</b> between the student and the material was focused on (1) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> pre-teaching; (2) <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> whilst-teaching; and <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> post-teaching...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Urban-rural <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> China {{has evolved}} over time and {{presented}} features in different periods since 1949. The aim {{of this paper is}} to measure urban-rural <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> China in a 50 -year period from 1958 to 2007, and to see if it bears resemblance to the historical evolution. Design/methodology/approach – The paper historically reviews urban-rural <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> four periods after 1949. Then, it uses principal component analysis (PCA) and assesses this <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> the study period. Findings – The quantification of urban-rural interaction bears resemblances to its historical evolution. Reform and opening-up as well as the rural-favored policies contribute a lot to the increase of urban-rural interaction. Originality/value – The paper systematically reviews the evolution of urban-rural <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> China, and analyzes the features of this <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> different periods since 1949. It introduces PCA and measures urban-rural interaction.

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{contrast of}} disease rates (ICDR), {{a measure of}} deviation from an additive model of no interaction, is shown always to be zero or slightly negative when the assumptions of no <b>interaction</b> <b>in</b> the sufficient-component discrete causes model hold.

An example of parameterizing <b>interaction</b> <b>In</b> one such model is pre-sented.

5|$|Although {{the weak}} {{interaction}} was once described by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak <b>interactions.</b> <b>In</b> this theory, the weak interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. Interestingly, the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.|$|E

Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
