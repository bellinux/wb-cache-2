25|$|When {{modelling}} a bond option, {{or other}} interest rate derivative (IRD), it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that future {{interest rates are}} uncertain, and therefore, the discount rate(s) referred to above, under all three cases—i.e. whether for all coupons or for each individual coupon—is not adequately represented by a fixed (deterministic) number. In such cases, stochastic calculus is employed.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> {{early that}} these drugs are causing DIL like {{symptoms}} and discontinue {{use of the}} drug. Symptoms of drug-induced lupus erythematosus generally disappear days to weeks after medication use is discontinued. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will quicken the healing process. Corticosteroids may be used if more severe symptoms of DIL are present.|$|E

Within this anthology, black women speak to power differentials and intersectionality in their essay. As Hazel Carby states, [...] "The fact that black women are subject to the 'simultaneous' oppression of patriarchy, class, and 'race' is the prime reason for not employing parallels that render their position and experience not only marginal but also invisible." ...|$|R

25|$|Chronic {{pulmonary}} reactions {{caused by}} nitrofurantoin include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or both. This uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting {{the drug and}} is usually related to its total lifetime dose. This reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises {{as it can be}} reversible if the drug is stopped early.|$|E
25|$|Time. A {{key factor}} in guerrilla {{strategy}} is a drawn-out, protracted conflict that wears down {{the will of the}} opposing counter-insurgent forces. Democracies are especially vulnerable to the factor of time. The counter-insurgent force must allow enough time to get the job done. Impatient demands for victory centered around short-term electoral cycles play {{into the hands of the}} guerrillas, though it is equally <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> when a cause is lost and the guerrillas have won.|$|E
25|$|In {{understanding}} Maya medicine, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> {{that the}} Maya equated sickness with the captivity of one’s soul by supernatural beings, angered by some perceived misbehavior. For this reason, curing a sickness involved elements of ritual, cleansing and herbal remedy. Research of Maya ethno-medicine shows that though supernatural causes {{are related to}} illness, {{a large percentage of}} Maya medical texts are devoted to the treatment of symptoms based upon objective observations of the effects of certain plants on the human system. Herbal remedies were ingested, smoked, snorted, rubbed on the skin, and even used in the form of enemas to force rapid absorption of a substance into the blood stream. Cleansing techniques included fasting, sweating and purging flushed substances out of the body.|$|E

25|$|Most {{ingested}} cholesterol is esterified, and esterified cholesterol {{is poorly}} absorbed. The body also compensates for any absorption of additional cholesterol by reducing cholesterol synthesis. For these reasons, cholesterol in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if {{any effect on}} concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. However, during the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol, as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various lipoproteins (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase. It is also <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize,</b> however, that the concentrations measured in the samples of blood plasma vary with the measurement methods used. Traditional, cheaper methods do not reflect (a) which lipoproteins are transporting the various fat molecules, nor (b) which cells are ingesting, burning or exporting the fat molecules being measured as totals from samples of blood plasma.|$|E
25|$|In {{the media}} and popular science, quantum non-locality is often portrayed as being {{equivalent}} to entanglement. While {{it is true that}} a pure bipartite quantum state must be entangled in order for it to produce non-local correlations, there exist entangled states that do not produce such correlations, and there exist non-entangled (separable) quantum states that present some non-local behaviour. A well-known example of the first case is the Werner state that is entangled for certain values of , but can always be described using local hidden variables. In short, entanglement of a two-party state is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be non-local. Moreover, it was shown that, for arbitrary number of party, there exist states that are genuinely entangled but admits a fully local strategy. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a precedent to non-locality as well as to quantum teleportation and to superdense coding, whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the foundations and interpretations of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{problems}} encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to “input and output” issues than to intellectual impairment. Problems with eye movement control {{make it difficult for}} people with A-T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make it seem that they do not know the answers to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase of the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A-T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A-T are often very conscious of their appearance, and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and mental fatigue. As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.|$|E

This system encourages intuitive entries of mathematical formulas using a user-friendly handwriting interface. We have implemented two basic operations specialized for correcting formula structures. One of the operations is "move and resize " of selected characters. This is because the position {{and the size of}} mathematical symbols are quite <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognizing</b> the meanings of formulas. The other operation makes it possible to select a block consisting of several characters and symbols. These two operations enable more flexible and efficient correction {{of the structure of the}} mathematical formulas. The experimantal results showed that a user can easily and efficiently correct wrong formulas by using the proposed functions. 1...|$|R

50|$|Polish sources use {{a variety}} of terms for olęder {{settlers}}: Hollendrzy, Holędrzy, Holendrzy, Olędrzy, and Olendrzy. These are interchangeable, and derive from the first settlers from the Netherlands, who moved into Ducal Prussia and Royal Prussia beginning in the 16th century. It is <b>important,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that over time the term lost its ethnic meaning, and therefore Olendrzy refers to all settlers living under the legal regime introduced by the Dutch colonists, including most notably the Vistula Germans.|$|R

2500|$|An adult may be {{expected}} to cope with the death of a parent in a less emotional way; however, the loss can still invoke extremely powerful emotions. This is especially true when the death occurs at an important or difficult period of life, such as when becoming a parent, at graduation, or at other times of emotional stress. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the effects that the loss of a parent can cause, and to address these effects. For an adult, the willingness to be open to grief is often diminished.
