500|$|In April 2012 Ryan Paul of Ars Technica used Web as {{an example}} to his {{criticism}} of GNOME 3.4 design decisions: [...] "Aside from the poor initial <b>discoverability</b> of the panel menu, this model works reasonably well for simple applications. [...] Unfortunately, it doesn't scale well in complex applications. The best example of where this approach can pose difficulties is in GNOME's default Web browser. [...] Having the application's functionality split across two completely separate menus does not constitute a usability improvement." [...] This was addressed in later versions, with a single unified menu.|$|E
500|$|The {{brothers}} {{stated that}} they created a live action feature in 2000 that made its way into comedy film festivals, {{and that they were}} planning to create a feature each year, hoping that one feature would soon help the brothers break into Hollywood. Despite winning young filmmaker awards, they soon {{came to the conclusion that}} this method would not be the best path, and decided their future would be on the internet, which they viewed at the time as the new film festival. The brothers created their first website in 2003, and uploaded their first web video in 2004. They broke their features into 10-to-15-minute chunks to showcase the feature to an audience. The brothers used their website and early online works as a <b>discoverability</b> tool that would launch them into traditional film. In 2004, the brothers created a feature-length live-action comedy, titled G.I. Joe: The Epic Saga, before beginning to upload more sketch and comedy content onto websites such as MySpace. The duo then moved from Orlando, Florida to Los Angeles, where they continued to upload more videos on their YouTube channel, which was created on June 4, 2007. New York wrote that the two entered the YouTube community as [...] "low-paid video producers for other companies, but kept making their own videos on the side." [...] Their earlier videos contain mature social satire humor.|$|E
2500|$|By way of {{example of}} how to clarify conceptions, he {{addressed}} conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. In clearness's second grade (the [...] "nominal" [...] grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real {{as the object of}} such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite community of inquirers think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which would be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction. Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and <b>discoverability</b> of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and <b>discoverability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, {{multiple}} {{media outlets}} reported that apps had decreased significantly in popularity. Recode wrote that [...] "The app boom is over", {{an editorial in}} TechCrunch stated that [...] "The air of hopelessness that surrounds the mobile app ecosystem is obvious and demoralizing", and The Verge wrote that [...] "the original App Store model of selling apps for a buck or two looks antiquated". Issues included consumer [...] "boredom", a lack of app <b>discoverability,</b> and, as stated by a report from 2014, a lack of new app downloads among smartphone users.|$|E
2500|$|Apart from {{searching for}} content by name, apps {{can also be}} searched through {{keywords}} provided by the developer. When searching for apps, users can press on suggested search filters, helping them to find apps matching the determined filters. For the <b>discoverability</b> of apps, Play Store consists of lists featuring top apps in each category, including [...] "Top Free", {{a list of the}} most popular free apps of all time; [...] "Top Paid", a list of the most popular paid apps of all time; [...] "Top Grossing", a list of apps generating the highest amounts of revenue; [...] "Trending Apps", a list of apps with recent installation growth; [...] "Top New Free", a list of the most popular new free apps; [...] "Top New Paid", a list of the most popular new paid apps; [...] "Featured", a list of new apps selected by the Google Play team; [...] "Staff Picks", a frequently-updated list of apps selected by the Google Play team; [...] "Editors' Choice", a list of apps considered the best of all time; and [...] "Top Developer", a list of apps made by developers considered the best. In March 2017, Google added a [...] "Free App of the Week" [...] section, offering one normally-paid app for free. In July 2017, Google expanded its [...] "Editors' Choice" [...] section to feature curated lists of apps deemed to provide good Android experiences within overall themes, such as fitness, video calling and puzzle games.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Discoverability</b> is {{the ability}} of something, {{especially}} a piece of content or information, to be found. <b>Discoverability</b> is a concern in library and information science, many aspects of digital media, software and web development, and in marketing, since a thing cannot be used if people cannot find it or don't understand what it's for. Metadata, or [...] "information about information," [...] such as a book's title, a product's description, or a website's keywords, affects how discoverable something is. Organizing information by putting it into alphabetical order or including it in a search engine {{is an example of how}} to improve <b>discoverability.</b> <b>Discoverability</b> is related to, but different from, accessibility and usability, other qualities that affect the usefulness of a piece of information.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{security}} experts feel that including the [...] "Discoverability" [...] element {{as the last}} D rewards Security through obscurity, so some organizations have either moved to a DREAD-D [...] "DREAD minus D" [...] scale (which omits <b>Discoverability)</b> or always assume that <b>Discoverability</b> is at its maximum rating.|$|E

50|$|Apart from {{increasing}} the reuse {{potential of the}} services, <b>discoverability</b> is also required to avoid development of solution logic that is already contained in an existing service. To design services that are not only discoverable but also provide interpretable information about their capabilities, the service <b>discoverability</b> principle provides guidelines that could be applied during the service-oriented analysis phase of the service delivery process.|$|E

5000|$|In {{relation}} to audiovisual content, {{according to the}} meaning given by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission {{for the purpose of}} the <b>Discoverability</b> Summit, <b>discoverability</b> can be summed up to the intrinsic ability of given content to [...] "stand out of the lot", or to position itself so as to be easily found and discovered. A piece of audiovisual content can be a movie, a TV series, music, a book (eBook) or even an audio book.|$|E
50|$|Even {{before the}} user’s intervention, <b>discoverability</b> {{is the prime}} factor {{of a piece of}} {{audiovisual}} content’s discovery in the various digital modes of content consumption (e.g. Netflix for movies, Spotify for music, Audible for audio books, etc., though the concept can also more generally be applied to content found on Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram and others). It involves more than a content’s mere presence on a given platform; it can involve key words (tags), search algorithms, positioning within different categories, metadata, etc. Thus, <b>discoverability</b> enables as much as it promotes.|$|E

50|$|The core {{idea of the}} use of {{learning}} objects is characterized by the following: <b>discoverability,</b> reusability, and interoperability. To support <b>discoverability,</b> learning objects are described by Learning Object Metadata, formalized as IEEE 1484.12 Learning object metadata. To support reusability, the IMS Consortium proposed a series of specifications such as the IMS Content package. And to support interoperability, the U.S. military's Advanced Distributed Learning organization created the Sharable Content Object Reference Model. Learning objects were designed {{in order to reduce the}} cost {{of learning}}, standardize learning content, and to enable the use and reuse of learning content by learning management systems.|$|E
50|$|For {{audiovisual}} content {{broadcast on}} digital media, <b>discoverability</b> includes the underlying concepts of information science and programming architecture, which {{are at the}} very foundation {{of the search for}} a specific product, information or content.|$|E

50|$|Some {{publishers}} have {{feared that}} making books available for loan may deter people from buying the books. However, ebook lending {{has the potential}} to increase the <b>discoverability</b> of books, encouraging readers to try out new authors and genres, resulting in increased purchases.|$|E
50|$|Developers should design robust {{programs}} by designing for transparency and <b>discoverability,</b> because code that {{is easy to}} understand is easier to stress test for unexpected conditions that may not be foreseeable in complex programs. This rule aims to help developers build robust, reliable products.|$|E
50|$|Digital {{content is}} {{difficult}} to organize and categorize. Websites, forums and publishers all have different standards for metadata, or information about the content, such as its author and date of creation. The perpetuation of different standards of metadata can create problems of access and <b>discoverability.</b>|$|E

50|$|Findability {{is similar}} to, but {{different}} from <b>discoverability,</b> which {{is defined as}} the ability of something, especially a piece of content or information, to be found. It is different from web search in that the word 'find' refers to locating something in a known space while 'search' is in an unknown space or not in an expected location.|$|E
50|$|Developers should {{design for}} {{visibility}} and <b>discoverability</b> by {{writing in a}} way that their thought process can lucidly be seen by future developers working on the project and using input and output formats that make it easy to identify valid input and correct output. This rule aims to reduce debugging time and extend the lifespan of programs.|$|E
50|$|Learning Object Metadata is a data model, usually {{encoded in}} XML, used to {{describe}} a learning object and similar digital resources used to support learning. The purpose of learning object metadata is to support the reusability of learning objects, to aid <b>discoverability,</b> and to facilitate their interoperability, usually {{in the context of}} online learning management systems (LMS).|$|E
