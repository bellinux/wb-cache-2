50|$|Typically, {{there is}} one FDC for a battery of six guns, in a light {{division}}. In a typical heavy division configuration, there exist two FDC elements capable of operating two four-gun sections, {{also known as a}} split battery. The FDC computes firing data—fire direction—for the guns. The process consists of determining the precise target location based on the observer's location if needed, then computing range and direction to the target from the guns' location. These data can be computed manually, using special protractors and slide rules with precomputed firing data. Corrections can be added for conditions such as a difference between target and howitzer altitudes, propellant temperature, atmospheric conditions, and even the curvature and rotation of the Earth. In most cases, some corrections are omitted, sacrificing accuracy for speed. In recent decades, FDCs have become computerized, allowing for much faster and more accurate computation of firing data. The FDC at the battalion level is responsible for recording friendly and enemy positions, tracking available battery munitions, and determining the optimal response <b>for</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>a</b> target identified by the FO.|$|E

It is thus common wisdom that visualization tools should play a prominent role in the chemistry discovery cycle, and they do indeed. But looking at them with a non-chemist’s eye reveals that they implement some interesting visualization ideas, but fall short on the perceptual support side and, more important, on the implementation of human-computer interaction (HCI) ideas. In this work we substantiate those findings with a tool survey and an inventory of chemistry representation methods.
