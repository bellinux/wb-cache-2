5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> {{as if they are}} walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
5|$|Shimura mainly {{found her}} characters' names by looking through name dictionaries, {{although}} she also took {{the names of}} acquaintances and slightly changed them, and even used train station names for side characters appearing only once. Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes for the female characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls in their early teens, especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, her characters <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> very different from each other, her panels are too white, and there is much pathos.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E

He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at her. She saw his {{forehead}} was swollen and inflamed with the sun. Very gently she wiped from it the glistening sweat. He closed his eyes, and she wiped his cheeks and his mouth. Still he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at her. She bent very close to him, feeling her heart crushed with grief for him.|$|R

5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E

25|$|Professional photographers {{prefer to}} use ambient light or {{indirect}} flash, as the red-eye reduction system does not always prevent red eyes— for example, if people look away during the pre-flash. In addition, people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> natural with small pupils, and direct lighting from close to the camera lens is considered to produce unflattering photographs.|$|E

25|$|Numbers {{can count}} (3nbsp&apples), order (the 3rdnbsp&apple), or measure (3.5nbsp&feet high); as {{the history of}} {{mathematics}} has progressed from counting on our fingers to modelling quantum mechanics, multiplication has been generalized to more complicated and abstract types of numbers, and to {{things that are not}} numbers (such as matrices) or <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> much like numbers (such as quaternions).|$|E
25|$|Egg scatterers: scatter {{adhesive}} or non-adhesive eggs {{to fall to}} the substrate, into plants, or {{float to}} the surface. These species <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> after their brood and even eat their own eggs. These are often schooling fish which spawn in groups or pairs, often laying {{a large number of}} small eggs. The fry hatch quickly.|$|E
25|$|An {{improved}} {{knowledge of}} the action of reverse transcriptase has led to better nucleoside analogues to treat HIV infections. One of these drugs, lamivudine, has been approved to treat hepatitis B, which uses reverse transcriptase {{as part of its}} replication process. Researchers have gone further and developed inhibitors that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like nucleosides, but can still block reverse transcriptase.|$|E

After a while Raphael Manfredi took over as the main software architect, and the client has been in active development ever since. Versions released after July 2002 <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like the original Nullsoft client.|$|E
25|$|The term {{preimplantation}} {{genetic screening}} (PGS) {{is used to}} denote procedures that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> for a specific disease but use PGD techniques to identify embryos at risk. The PGD allows studying the DNA of eggs or embryos to select those that carry certain mutations for genetic diseases. It is useful when there are previous chromosomal or genetic disorders {{in the family and}} within the context of in vitro fertilization programs.|$|E
25|$|As in {{some other}} species in the genus Elymnias, the common palmfly has a precostal cell in the hindwings and a tuft of androconial scales on the dorsal discal cell of the hindwings. Some populations of this {{butterfly}} species are sexually dimorphic: males and females <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> alike. In sexually dimorphic populations, males have black upperside forewings with small blue patches and mimic Euploea species, while the females mimic butterfly species of the genus Danaus.|$|E

25|$|Cold cured or cold pour dentures, {{also known}} as {{temporary}} dentures, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> very natural, are not very durable, tend to be highly porous and are only used as a temporary expedient until a more permanent solution is found. These types of dentures are inferior and tend to cost much less due to their quick production time (usually minutes) and low cost materials. It is not suggested that a patient wear a cold cured denture {{for a long period}} of time, for they are prone to cracks and can break rather easily.|$|E
25|$|Parthian art was Iranian art {{made during}} the Parthian Empire from 247 BC to 224 AD, based in the Near East. It has a mixture of Persian and Hellenistic influences. For some time after {{the period of the}} Parthian Empire, art in its styles {{continued}} for some time. A typical feature of Parthian art is the frontality of the people shown. Even in narrative representations, the actors <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at the object of their action, but at the viewer. These are features that anticipate the art of medieval Europe and Byzantium.|$|E
25|$|Hispanics with mostly Caucasoid or Negroid {{features}} may not {{be recognized}} as such in the United States {{in spite of the}} ethnic and racial diversity of most Hispanic American populations. Hispanics who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like the stereotypical Hispanic may have their ancestral status questioned or even challenged by others. Actors Martin Sheen, Alexis Bledel and Cameron Diaz, for example, are Hispanic even though they may be presumed not to be so because, being white, they do not fit the stereotype. If Hispanics with mostly Caucasoid features are to be considered Hispanic, they have stereotypical Mediterranean/Southern European appearance - olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes.|$|E

25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to look through the entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.|$|E
25|$|A pottery {{inscription}} of the Longshan culture {{discovered in}} Dinggong Village, Zouping County, Shandong contains eleven symbols that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> like the direct ancestor of Chinese characters. Chinese scholar Feng Shi (馮時) argued in 1994 that this inscription {{can be interpreted}} as written by the Longshan people. Other scholars, like Ming Ru, are doubtful about attributing a Neolithic date to the inscription. The authenticity of these inscriptions is hotly disputed due to their appearance on a broken ceramic ware, an unusual feature among prehistorical text, as well as its unexpected relation to the Yi script, a modern writing system associated with an ethnic group in the southwestern China, thousands of miles and thousands of years apart from the Longshan culture in northern China.|$|E
25|$|Hadith (reports of Muhammad's sayings {{and deeds}} from {{those close to}} him in his lifetime) on the subject are inconsistent, with {{different}} writers interpreting the Prophet in different ways. Shariah (Islamic law) defines sodomy outside marriage as adultery or fornication or both, and it thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars. In practice, few modern Muslim countries have legal systems based fully on Shariah, and {{an increasing number of}} Muslims <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> to shariah but to the Quran itself for moral guidance. For sodomy within marriage, the majority of Shiite interpreters hold that (1) anal intercourse, while strongly disliked, is not haram (forbidden) provided the wife agrees; and (2), if the wife does not agree, then it is preferable to refrain.|$|E
