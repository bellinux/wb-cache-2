2500|$|The {{building}} exterior was {{in later}} years painted a warm grey, as shown in existing photographs. This was performed during an ambitious remodeling of the building between June and August 1870 where the original high pulpit was cut down and in its place, a platform was added three feet high, twenty feet wide and between eight and ten feet deep. [...] This platform was again supported by two Corinthian columns. Matching curving banistered stairways were also added on each side {{at that time that}} led to the pulpit backed by a crimson curtain. All pews were lowered by three inches, black walnut railings added and the pew seats were upholstered in a crimson color. The ceiling was in a fresco painted by Sig. Garibolda. Anyone entering the church came through one of three great doors opening into the spacious vestibule, and visitors walked up the circular stairways at either end to the balcony around three sides of the high, square sanctuary. [...] Such heat as there was came from wood stoves; the building was illuminated by oil lamps. Foot-warmers containing hot coals were indispensable for comfort during winter months. One such coal <b>foot</b> <b>warmer</b> that was used can be viewed in the Historical Hall located in the current building on Symphony Circle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>foot</b> <b>warmer,</b> whose glowing coals {{are visible}} beneath {{the hem of}} the woman's skirt, was a {{pictorial}} code of the time, and represented the woman's marital status. A <b>foot</b> <b>warmer</b> wholly under the skirt indicated a married woman who was unavailable, {{as it does in}} The Proposition; a <b>foot</b> <b>warmer</b> projecting halfway out from under the skirt with the woman's foot visible on it indicated one who might be receptive to a male suitor; and a <b>foot</b> <b>warmer</b> that is not under the woman at all, and empty of coals, indicated a single woman. This code can also be seen in Vermeer's The Milkmaid and Dou's The Young Mother.|$|E
5000|$|Vermeer's {{painting}} {{is even more}} understated, although the use of symbols remains: one of the Delft tiles {{at the foot of}} the wall behind the maid, near the <b>foot</b> <b>warmer,</b> depicts Cupid [...] - [...] which can imply arousal of a woman or simply that while she is working she is daydreaming about a man. Other amorous symbols in the painting include a wide-mouthed jug, often used as a symbol of the female anatomy. The <b>foot</b> <b>warmer</b> was often used by artists as a symbol for female sexual arousal because, when placed under a skirt, it heats the whole body below the waist, according to Liedtke. The coals enclosed inside the <b>foot</b> <b>warmer</b> could symbolize [...] "either the heat of lust in tavern or brothel scenes, or the hidden but true burning passion of a woman for her husband", according to Serena Cant, a British art historian and lecturer. Yet the whitewashed wall and presence of milk seem to indicate that the room was a [...] "cool kitchen" [...] used for cooking with dairy products, such as milk and butter, so the <b>foot</b> <b>warmer</b> would have a pragmatic purpose there. Since other Dutch paintings of the period indicate that foot warmers were used when seated, its presence in the picture may symbolize the standing woman's [...] "hardworking nature", according to Cant.|$|E

5000|$|Dorchester Pottery's wares {{evolved over}} the years from {{primarily}} agricultural products to decorated tablewares. Mash feeders and chicken fountains were cast from molds for the farmer.

5000|$|The {{moveable}} kotatsu {{was created}} later, originating from {{the concept of}} hori-gotatsu. This kotatsu came about with the popular use of tatami matting in Japanese homes. Instead of placing the charcoals in the irori, they were placed in an earthen pot which {{was placed on the}} tatami making the kotatsu transportable. This more modern style kotatsu is known as the oki-gotatsu.

50|$|A {{variation}} of the heating table, the kotatsu, is very popular in Japan and {{dates back to the}} fourteenth century. A kotatsu is a low, wooden table frame covered by a futon, or heavy blanket, upon which a table top sits. Underneath is a heat source, often built into the table itself. Kotatsu are used almost exclusively in Japan, although similar devices are used elsewhere. This early ancestor to the modern kotatsu was called a hori-gotatsu. The word hori-gotatsu (掘り炬燵) is derived from the kanji 掘り (hori) meaning ditch, digging, 炬 (ko) meaning torch or fire, and 燵 (tatsu) meaning <b>foot</b> <b>warmer.</b> There are two kinds of kotatsu used in Japan today, electric or charcoal, however the electric is more popular.|$|E
5000|$|Despite its {{traditional}} title, the picture clearly shows a kitchen or housemaid, a low-ranking indoor servant, {{rather than a}} milkmaid who actually milks the cow, in a plain room carefully pouring milk into a squat earthenware container (now commonly known as a [...] "Dutch oven") on a table. Also on the table are various types of bread. She is a young, sturdily built woman wearing a crisp linen cap, a blue apron and work sleeves pushed up from thick forearms. A <b>foot</b> <b>warmer</b> {{is on the floor}} behind her, near Delft wall tiles depicting Cupid (to the viewer's left) and a figure with a pole (to the right).

5000|$|The {{history of}} the kotatsu begins in the Muromachi era during the fourteenth century. Its origins begin with the Japanese cooking hearth, known as the irori. Charcoal was the primary method of cooking and heating in the {{traditional}} Japanese household and was used to heat the irori. By the fourteenth century in Japan, a seating platform {{was introduced to the}} irori and its cooking function became separated from its seating function. On top of the wooden platform a quilt was placed, known as an oki that trapped and localized the heat of the charcoal burner. This early ancestor to the modern kotatsu was called a hori-gotatsu. The word hori-gotatsu (...) is derived from the kanji [...] (hori) meaning ditch, digging, [...] (ko) meaning torch or fire, and [...] (tatsu) meaning <b>foot</b> <b>warmer.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Vermeer {{painted over}} two items {{originally}} in the painting. One {{was a large}} wall map (a Rijksmuseum web page calls it a painting) behind {{the upper part of}} the woman's body. (A wall map may not have been very out of place in a humble workroom such as the cold kitchen where the maid toiled: large maps in 17th-century Holland were inexpensive ways of decorating bare walls.) He originally placed a large, conspicuous clothes basket (the Rijksmuseum web page calls it a [...] "sewing basket") near the bottom of the painting, behind the maid's red skirt, but then the artist painted it over, producing the slight shift in tone (pentimento) on the wall behind the <b>foot</b> <b>warmer.</b> The basket was later discovered with an X-ray. Other Vermeer paintings also have images removed. Some art critics have thought the removals may have been intended to provide the works with better thematic focus.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, three PCM based foot warmers of {{cylindrical}} and rectangular {{in shape}} were designed, developed and fabricated to store solar energy during sunshine hours.

By trial experiment, it was {{found out that the}} surface temperature of the storage units of the <b>foot</b> <b>warmer</b> should be between 37 Â°C– 41 Â°C for heating the feet. Therefore, commercial grade lauric acid (Melting Point 42. 2 Â°C, Latent Heat of Fusion 181 Ã— 103 J/kg) was used as a latent heat storage material. Experiments were conducted during a winter season to study the latent heat storage units and the thermal performance of the rectangular shaped <b>foot</b> <b>warmer</b> was found better than the cylindrical shaped with the same storage capacity.

40|$|Throughout the 24 -hour day, the {{occurrence}} of sleep and wakefulness {{is closely related to}} changes in body temperatures. Changes in skin temperature may causally affect the ability to initiate and maintain sleep. First, we briefly summarize a previously proposed neurobiological mechanism that couples skin temperature to sleep propensity. Next we review previous findings on the relation between skin temperature and sleep-onset latency, indicating that sleep propensity can be enhanced by warming the skin to the level that normally occurs prior to - and during - sleep. Finally, we present new data indicating age- and insomnia-related changes in the sleep-onset latency response to <b>foot</b> <b>warming,</b> and evaluate whether different methods of <b>foot</b> <b>warming</b> could provide an applicable strategy to address sleep complaints. Foot temperature manipulations included footbaths before sleep onset (1), and heatable bed socks applied either before (2) or after lights-off (3). In adults, sleep-onset was accelerated by warm and neutral bed socks after lights-off and correlated to the increase in foot temperature. This increase was attenuated in elderly subjects. In elderly subjects without sleep difficulties, sleep onset could be accelerated with neutral bed socks after lights-off and a warm footbath prior to lights-off. In elderly insomniacs, none of the treatments accelerated sleep onset. We illustrate that elderly subjects show an attenuated increase in foot temperature after lights-off and lose the relationship between pre-sleep heat-loss activation and sleep latency. The sensitivity of sleep propensity to <b>foot</b> <b>warming</b> changes with age and is attenuated in age-related insomnia. ...|$|R
