5|$|<b>Flash</b> memory can be {{programmed}} and erased {{only a limited}} number of times. This is often referred to as the maximum number of program/erasecycles (P/Ecycles) it can sustain over the life of the <b>flash</b> memory. Single-level cell (SLC) <b>flash,</b> designed for higher performance and longer endurance, can typically operate between 50,000 and 100,000 cycles. , multi-level cell (MLC) <b>flash</b> is designed for lower cost applications and has a greatly reduced cycle count of typically between 3,000 and 5,000. Since 2013, triple-level cell (TLC) <b>flash</b> has been available, with cycle counts dropping to 1,000 program-erase (P/E) cycles. A lower write amplification is more desirable, as it corresponds to a reduced number of P/Ecycles on the <b>flash</b> memory and thereby to an increased SSD life.|$|E
5|$|After degenerating into {{a remnant}} low on September10, {{moisture}} {{associated with the}} former tropical cyclone spread across the Southwestern United States. Aided by above-average water vapor levels and the aforementioned upper-level trough, scattered thunderstorms developed across the region on September14. Two major incidents of <b>flash</b> flooding resulted in 21deaths in Utah, the deadliest <b>flash</b> flood event in the state's history. The previous deadliest event was on August13, 1923, when seven people died near Farmington. <b>Flash</b> floods occur annually in Washington County, Utah, {{with an average of}} one to two <b>flash</b> flood days per year since 1950.|$|E

50|$|Counter-flashing (or cover <b>flashing,</b> cap <b>flashing)</b> is a {{term used}} when there are two {{parallel}} pieces of <b>flashing</b> employed together such as on a chimney, where the counter-flashing {{is built into the}} chimney and overlaps a replaceable piece of base <b>flashing.</b> Strips of lead used for <b>flashing</b> an edge were sometimes called an apron, and the term is still used for the piece of <b>flashing</b> below a chimney. The up-hill side of a chimney may have a small gable-like assembly called a cricket with cricket <b>flashing</b> or on narrow chimneys with no cricket a back <b>flashing</b> or back pan <b>flashing.</b> <b>Flashing</b> may be let into a groove in a wall or chimney called a reglet.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{impact of}} hot <b>flashes</b> on sleep {{is of great}} {{clinical}} interest, but results are inconsistent, especially when both hot <b>flashes</b> and sleep are measured objectively. Using objective and subjective measurements, we examined the impact of hot <b>flashes</b> on sleep by inducing hot <b>flashes</b> with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. METHODS: The gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist leuprolide was administered to 20 healthy premenopausal volunteers without hot <b>flashes</b> or sleep disturbances. Induced hot <b>flashes</b> were assessed objectively (skin conductance monitor) and subjectively (daily diary) during 1 -month follow-up. Changes from baseline in objective sleep quality (actigraphy) and subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) were compared between women who developed and women who did not develop objective hot <b>flashes</b> and, in parallel analyses, subjective hot <b>flashes.</b> RESULTS: New-onset hot <b>flashes</b> were recorded in 14 (70 %) women and reported by 14 (70 %) women (80 % concordance). Estradiol was universally suppressed. Objective sleep efficiency worsened in women with objective hot <b>flashes</b> and improved in women without objective hot <b>flashes</b> (median decrease, 2. 6 %; median increase, 4. 2 %; P = 0. 005). Subjective sleep quality worsened more in those with subjective hot <b>flashes</b> than in those without subjective hot <b>flashes</b> (median increase in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 2. 5 vs 1. 0; P = 0. 03). Objective hot <b>flashes</b> were not associated with subjective sleep quality, nor were subjective symptoms linked to objective sleep measures. CONCLUSIONS: This experimental model of induced hot <b>flashes</b> demonstrates a causal relationship between hot <b>flashes</b> and poor sleep quality. Objective hot <b>flashes</b> result in worse objective sleep efficiency, whereas subjective hot <b>flashes</b> worsen perceived sleep quality...|$|R

5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping <b>Flash!</b> 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping <b>Flash!</b> 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping <b>Flash!</b> 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping <b>Flash!</b> 2 was not designed to be a technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|At CZW's High Stakes on May 11, 2002, CZW held a Four Way {{match for}} the CZW World Heavyweight and CZW Iron Man Championships, in which then-CZW World Heavyweight Champion Justice Pain and then-Iron Man Champion Adam <b>Flash</b> defended against The Messiah and Mondo. If a {{champion}} was pinned by another competitor, then they lost their championship in the encounter. Mondo ended up pinning <b>Flash</b> to win the Iron Man Championship in the bout. On July 13, 2002 at CZW's Deja Vu, <b>Flash</b> and Pain fought to a double pinfall for the CZW Iron Man and World Heavyweight Championships, which Pain held. Due to the double pinfall, <b>Flash</b> won the Iron Man Championship, while Pain retained the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{relationship}} between mental workload and occurrence of hot <b>flashes.</b> Twelve women with moderate to severe menopausal hot <b>flashes</b> participated in the study. Subjects participated in both a mental arithmetic task (Task) and control (Non-task) experiments. We measured heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, near infrared spectroscopy, skin temperature, and skin potential level. The incidence of hot <b>flashes</b> was greater in Task than in Non-task. No significant differences between before, during and after hot <b>flashes</b> emerged for the percentage of correct responses and reaction time. However, the percentage of correct responses for two subjects among the ten who experienced hot <b>flashes</b> in Task substantially declined during hot <b>flashes.</b> Chest skin temperatures increased in both Task and Non-task during hot <b>flashes,</b> and regional oxygen saturation was significantly higher in Non-task than in Task. The present study suggested that mental workload under time pressure might be a risk factor for menopausal hot <b>flashes,</b> and the performance of most people who experienced hot <b>flashes</b> was not affected by hot <b>flashes,</b> however, work-related difficulties due to cognitive disturbance during hot <b>flashes</b> might arise in some people...|$|R
50|$|The hot-flash event may be {{repeated}} {{a few times}} each week or every few minutes throughout the day. Hot <b>flashes</b> may begin to appear several years before menopause starts and last for years afterwards. Some women undergoing menopause never have hot <b>flashes.</b> Others have mild or infrequent <b>flashes.</b> The worst sufferers experience dozens of hot <b>flashes</b> each day. In addition, hot <b>flashes</b> are often more frequent and more intense during hot weather or in an overheated room, the surrounding heat apparently making the hot <b>flashes</b> themselves both more likely to occur, and more severe.|$|R
50|$|The <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow was {{introduced}} {{not because of}} a perceived {{lack of understanding of}} the circular green. For turning drivers, there is no perceptible difference between the <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow and the circular green, because both mean the same thing; however, the meaning of the <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow is different for drivers who are not making the indicated turn. To the driver turning left, the <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow means exactly the same as a Yield Sign, and a <b>flashing</b> red arrow means exactly the same as a Stop sign. Left turning drivers facing a <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow are allowed to make a left turn if there is a gap in oncoming traffic, however when facing a <b>flashing</b> red arrow drivers must come to a complete stop before making a left turn. (However, the MUTCD requires that a traffic study be performed before installing a <b>flashing</b> red arrow signal) With the <b>flashing</b> yellow arrow or <b>flashing</b> red arrow, opposing straight-ahead traffic has a circular green at the same time. With the steady green arrow, opposing traffic must have a circular red.|$|R
5|$|Due to its popularity, Sony {{produced}} two sequels to Jumping <b>Flash!,</b> including one spin-off. A direct sequel, Jumping <b>Flash!</b> 2—also developed by Exact—was released worldwide for the PlayStation the following year; it continued {{the story of}} Robbit and the subsequent {{rise and fall of}} Baron Aloha. The game received positive reviews upon release, with critics particularly praising its updated features. Robbit Mon Dieu was released exclusively in Japan for the PlayStation in 1999, and was the final instalment in the series. It was met with mixed reviews, and following Exact's merger with SCEI in 2000, the series came to an end. Both Jumping <b>Flash!</b> and Jumping <b>Flash!</b> 2 were re-released via the PlayStation Network in 2007 and 2009, respectively. A loose spin-off titled Pocket MuuMuu was released exclusively in Japan for the PocketStation in 1999 before Exact's closure.|$|E

5|$|In December 2010, the Western New York <b>Flash,</b> {{previously}} {{part of the}} W-League, {{joined the}} WPS for the 2011 season. Shortly after, the <b>Flash</b> announced they had signed Harris. She appeared in the team's debut in the league on April 17, 2011 against the Boston Breakers. She made eighteen appearances for the <b>Flash</b> in the regular season, allowing eighteen goals and helping the <b>Flash</b> rank number one {{at the end of}} the season. Harris made the start in the 2011 WPS Championship on August 27, 2011 against the Philadelphia Independence. The game was tied 1–1 after regulation and extra time, leaving the outcome of the match to be decided by penalty kicks. Both the Independence and the <b>Flash</b> made their first four shots. However, Harris blocked the shot by Philadelphia's Laura del Rio, clinching the championship for the <b>Flash.</b> She was named the 2011 Coast Guard Goalkeeper of the Year following a successful 2011 season.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} their first to receive public appreciation. Boxleiter first {{understood}} its potential when publishers fought for the bid to the game. At the time, it was solely designed for <b>Flash</b> and not iOS, though {{they were interested in}} making bigger games outside the <b>Flash</b> market. They announced the game in mid August 2010, where they revealed that the game would release on <b>Flash</b> (through Kongregate) and iOS simultaneously, which happened on August 29, 2010. Joe Bergeron, a programmer who had previously worked on Dinowaurs with Mikengreg, helped with the iOS version of the game. Solipskier made around $70,000 in its first two months (as compared to $15,000 from the <b>Flash</b> release), which let them work in other non-Flash mediums in the future. They released an Android version three months later.|$|E
