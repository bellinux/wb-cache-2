40|$|One-Dimensional {{modeling}} of dual mode scramjet and ramjet flowpaths {{is a useful}} tool for scramjet conceptual design and wind tunnel testing. In this thesis, modeling tools that enable detailed analysis of the flow physics within the combustor are developed as part of a new one-dimensional MATLAB-based model named VTMODEL. VTMODEL divides a ramjet or scramjet flow path into four major components: inlet, isolator, combustor, and nozzle. The <b>inlet</b> <b>module</b> provides two options for supersonic inlet one-dimensional calculations; a correlation from MIL Spec 5007 D, and a kinetic energy efficiency correlation. The kinetic energy efficiency correlation also enables the user to account for inlet heat transfer using a total temperature term in the equation for pressure recovery. The isolator model also provides two options for calculating the pressure rise and the isolator shock train. The first model is a combined Fanno flow and oblique shock system. The second model is a rectangular shock train correlation. The combustor module has two options for the user in regards to combustion calculations. The first option is an equilibrium calculation with a “growing combustion sphere...|$|E
40|$|Air staging {{strategy}} is a proven technology to provide efficient biomass combustion with less gaseous and particulate emissions. In this study, two different secondary air distribution modules are employed at two different axial positions {{from the bed}} surface in a 15 kW fixed-bed laboratory scale combustion system includes grate and underfeed bed stocker. The effects of air staging on temperature, burning rate, gaseous and particulate emissions have been assessed over a selected primary air flow rate {{and a range of}} secondary air flow rates. Secondary air <b>inlet</b> <b>module</b> with uniform distribution of air results in 50 % CO reduction by shifting the combustion to a more fuel lean environment and high temperature in the post-combustion zone. Remarkable decrease in particulate matters smaller than 1 μm is achievable through adjusting a uniform secondary air module in an appropriate distance from the bed. The non-uniform secondary air configuration increases the gaseous and particulate emissions than the uniform configuration. These results emphasise the need for further studies to better understand the effect of air staging on particulate and gaseous emissions...|$|E

30|$|The same figure {{depicts the}} {{temperature}} {{variation in the}} chimney and the membrane <b>module</b> <b>inlet</b> with time. It is evident that the same pattern with CO 2 /NO concentrations variations exists, which indicates that temperature and concentration curves are strongly correlated as they both {{are affected by the}} different steps of the furnace operation. When chimney’s temperature falls below 90  °C, it is anticipated that bricks’ firing process has already been stalled and tunnel’s cooling is in progress. Below this temperature there is also a decrease of the CO 2 /NO concentrations, while for higher temperatures these concentrations increase. A slight hysteresis of the temperature response may be attributed to gaseous accumulation within the tunnel, and most importantly due to the thermal inertia of the tunnel walls material to endure the high temperatures imposed by the process. The gaseous components are cooled before entering the membrane module not to exceed 40  °C, so that the <b>module’s</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature remains constant over time.|$|R

40|$|Active {{propulsion}} {{is required}} in order to further develop the capabilities of small satellites like CubeSats. At TU Delft a micropropulsion system is being developed based on a Vaporizing Liquid Microthruster (VLM), using liquid water as propellant. This research presents the manufacturing, characterization and testing of an existing VLM-design. It focuses on the thruster component of the propulsion system, which is called the MEMS-VLM. The breadboard model consists of an <b>inlet</b> <b>module,</b> multiple heating chamber modules and a nozzle, integrally manufactured using MEMS-technology. The heating chamber modules consist of flow channels etched in silicon, of which the walls support silicon carbide heaters. These heaters are suspended {{in the center of the}} cross-section. The nozzle is a two-dimensional convergent-divergent duct. Characterization and testing of the MEMS-VLMis done in a bottom-up approach. First, the geometry and electrical properties of the flow channels and heaters are characterized, after which the performance of the heating chamber and the nozzle are independently studied by models and experiments. In order to facilitate manufacturing, minor changes are implemented to the design of the nozzle, electrical interface and fluidic interface. With these changes, successful manufacturing of theMEMS-VLM is achieved. Microscope images show significant but acceptable deviations between design dimensions and manufacturing results. Furthermore, resistance measurements of the heaters indicate partial mechanical failures in 20 out of 154 measured heaters. The thermal behavior of the heating chamber is studied by means of analytical models for conduction and radiation and a one-dimensional steady state model for convection. The conduction study shows that the chamber wall temperature is homogeneous, while the suspended heaters formhot spots. The convection model is used to study whether sufficient heat transfer can be expected to fully vaporize the propellant flow. It is found that at a chamber wall temperature as little as 10 K above the boiling point, full vaporization can be expected. An experimental setup is made to test the heating chamber, ultimately attempting to validate the design and the performance models. The ability to power the heaters with constant current and measure the mass flow, pressure and dissipated power is demonstrated. Furthermore, amethod to determine the local chamber temperature based on the resistance of the heaters is presented. However, current leaks and partial mechanical failures are detected in the heaters during tests with nitrogen gas, which compromise the ability to operate with liquid water. Hence, full validation of the heating chamber models could not be achieved. With respect to future designs it is recommended to change to metallic heaters, which are placed outside the chamber. The silicon chamber wall then serves as a heat exchanger. It is furthermore recommended to change the capping wafer material to glass, so that the boiling process can be studied optically. A second experimental campaign is done to determine the performance of the nozzle, which is described by the discharge factor CD, the Isp-efficiency ´I sp and the thrust coefficient CF. Nozzle performance tests are carried out in vacuum, using gaseous nitrogen as propellant. The pressure is adapted in order to match the Reynolds number in the nozzle throat to the designed operating conditions. At a measurement Reynolds numbers of Rem ¼ 1400 the performance quality factors are found to be CD ¼ 0. 68 § 0. 06 (discharge factor), ´I sp ¼ 0. 3 § 0. 05 (Isp-efficiency) and CF ¼ 0. 33 § 0. 06 (thrust coefficient). The poor performance is primarily explained by excessive friction and rarefaction losses in the divergent section of the nozzle and are expected to improve when increasing the Reynolds number and when decreasing the expansion ratio. Design validation of the MEMS-VLM could not be achieved, as on various aspects the design is rejected. Nonetheless, the experimental approach has been successful in revealing critical design recommendations and demonstrating the ability to test a microthruster, improving the understanding and advancing the development of micropropulsion at TU Delft.

The combination of the state-of-art with the constraints inherent to hatcheries has turned the design into a closed, artificially illuminated and external-loop airlift configuration based on a succession of elementary modules, each one being composed of two transparent vertical interconnected columns. The liquid circulation is ensured pneumatically (air injections) {{with respect to a}} swirling motion (tangential <b>inlets).</b> A single <b>module</b> of the whole photobioreactor was built-up to investigate how parameters, such as air sparger type, gas flow rate, tangential inlet, column radius and height can influence radiative transfer, hydrodynamics, mass transfer and biological performances.

The hydrodynamics of the liquid phase was modeled in terms of global flow behavior (circulation and mixing times, Péclet number) and of swirling motion decay along the column (Particle Image Velocimetry).

40|$|Improving {{efficiency}} {{is the main}} target for improving rapidly developing water desalination technologies such as air gap membrane distillation (AGMD). While the system is dominated by heat and mass transfer resistances in the air gap specifically, very {{little is known about}} the impact of variations in the air gap, including air gap spacers and module tilting. AGMD experiments were performed by varying <b>inlet</b> temperature, <b>module</b> inclination angle, and gap spacer to identify the effect on the permeate production rate of the system. While AGMD is potentially one of the most efficient types of membrane distillation, experimenting with the tilt angle of the module so as to rotate the membrane and condensation plate off the vertical, provides a method to alter the behavior of the film condensation layer and its associated thermal resistance. In this study, we confirm the previous work of Warsinger et al. (2014) through the added enhancement of visualization of condensation in the air gap by use of a clear and conductive sapphire condensation plate. Additional experiments were run observing the effect of changing the orientation of the mesh spacer holding the air gap in the vertical orientation. Numerical modeling is also conducted to understand and potentially verify the experimental results. As predicted, the results maintain that at near vertical and at non-extreme positive angles (< 15 ° from the vertical), there is no significant difference in the permeate production output of the system due to tilting the module. At declined and extremely inclined tilt angles, the air gap in the module behaves as a "permeate gap", or a flooded system, resulting in the air gap saturated with liquid water. At negative tilt angles past 30 °, it was found that condensate tends to fall on the membrane, causing thermal bridging, and as a result, significantly increasing the overall production of permeate condensate. It was also found that the orientation of the mesh spacer holding the air gap apart does not have a significant effect on the permeate production rate. by Lucien L. Morales. Thesis: S.

40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by the American Society of Civil Engineers {{and can be found}} at: [URL] one-dimensional (1 D) hydrologic-hydraulic model for simulating dual drainage in urban areas is presented. It consists of four modules: (1) rainfall-runoff transformation, (2) 1 D flow routing on a street network, (3) flow interception at street inlets, and (4) flow interaction between surface water on the streets and the underground storm-water system by interfacing with the EPA-SWMM 5 engine (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency-Storm Water Management Model). The hydrologic model (first module) transforms rainfall to runoff using the kinematic wave approximation and simulates the infiltration process with the Green-Ampt method. The street network model (second module) is based on a finite-volume shock-capturing scheme that solves the fully conservative Saint-Venant equations and can be used to model both subcritical and supercritical flows. The <b>inlet</b> model (third <b>module)</b> computes the amount of water intercepted by inlets. The formulation of boundary conditions at the street crossings is generalized and can be used for any number of streets, any combination of inflowing and outflowing streets, and flow regime (e. g., subcritical and supercritical flows). Flow interaction between surface water on the streets and underground storm-water system is achieved by interfacing the proposed model with EPA-SWMM 5. This interaction allows flow to enter from streets to the underground storm-water system and vice versa. The proposed model has several potential applications such as the identification of critical zones for flooding (e. g., zones with high water depths and flow velocities) in urban developments and can be used to take appropriate measures for drainage control (e. g., to increase number and/or size of inlets), to determine the consequences of different degrees of inlet clogging, and to assess flooding hazards through the application of suitable hazard criteria. A summary of criteria used for storm-water hazard assessment is presented. To demonstrate the dual-drainage model’s potential, an application is performed in a catchment of the metropolitan area of Chicago, Illinois. The results obtained are promising and show that the model can be a useful tool for storm-water management and flooding hazard assessment in urban areas...|$|R

40|$|Presented is a {{computer-based}} {{tool that}} connects several disciplines {{that are needed}} in the complex and integrated design of high performance reusable single stage to orbit (SSTO) vehicles. Every system is linked to every other system, {{as is the case}} of SSTO vehicles with air breathing propulsion, which is currently being studied by NASA. An RBCC propulsion system integrates airbreathing and rocket propulsion into a single engine assembly enclosed within a cowl or duct. A typical RBCC propulsion system operates as a ducted rocket up to approximately Mach 3. Then there is a transition to a ramjet mode for supersonic-to-hypersonic acceleration. Around Mach 8 the engine transitions to a scramjet mode. During the ramjet and scramjet modes, the integral rockets operate as fuel injectors. Around Mach 10 - 12 (the actual value depends on vehicle and mission requirements), the inlet is physically closed and the engine transitions to an integral rocket mode for orbit insertion. A common feature of RBCC propelled vehicles is the high degree of integration between the propulsion system and airframe. At high speeds the vehicle forebody is fundamentally part of the engine inlet, providing a compression surface for air flowing into the engine. The compressed air is mixed with fuel and burned. The combusted mixture must be expanded to an area larger than the incoming stream to provide thrust. Since a conventional nozzle would be too large, the entire lower after body of the vehicle is used as an expansion surface. Because of the high external temperatures seen during atmospheric flight, the design of an airbreathing SSTO vehicle requires delicate tradeoffs between engine design, vehicle shape, and thermal protection system (TPS) sizing in order to produce an optimum system in terms of weight (and cost) and maximum performance. To adequately determine the performance of the engine/vehicle, the Hypersonic Flight <b>Inlet</b> Model (HYFIM) <b>module</b> was designed to interface with the RBCC engine model. HYFIM performs the aerodynamic analysis of forebodies and inlet characteristics of RBCC powered SSTO launch vehicles. HYFIM is applicable to the analysis of the ramjet/scramjet engine operations modes (Mach 3 - 12), and provides estimates of parameters such as air capture area, shock-on-lip Mach number, design Mach number, compression ratio, etc., based on a basic geometry routine for modeling axisymmetric cones, 2 -D wedge geometries. HYFIM also estimates the variation of shock layer properties normal to the forebody surface. The thermal protection system (TPS) is directly linked to determination of the vehicle moldline and the shaping of the trajectory. Thermal protection systems to maintain the structural integrity of the vehicle must be able to mitigate the heat transfer to the structure and be lightweight. Herein lies the interdependency, in that as the vehicle's speed increases, the TPS requirements are increased. And as TPS masses increase the effect on the propulsion system and all other systems is compounded. The need to analyze vehicle forebody and engine inlet is critical to be able to design the RBCC vehicle. To adequately determine insulation masses for an RBCC vehicle, the hypersonic aerodynamic environment and aeroheating loads must be calculated and the TPS thicknesses must be calculated for the entire vehicle. To accomplish this an ascent or reentry trajectory is obtained using the computer code Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories (POST). The trajectory is then used to calculate the convective heat rates on several locations on the vehicles using the Miniature Version of the JA 70 Aerodynamic Heating Computer Program (MINIVER). Once the heat rates are defined for each body point on the vehicle, then insulation thicknesses that are required to maintain the vehicle within structural limits are calculated using Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer (SINDA) models. If the TPS masses are too heavy for the performance of the vehicle the process may be repeated altering the trajectory or some other input to reduce the TPS mass. E-PSURBCC is an "engine performance" model and requires the specification of inlet air static temperature and pressure as well as Mach number (which it pulls from the HYFIM and POST trajectory files), and calculates the corresponding stagnation properties. The engine air flow path geometry includes inlet, a constant area section where the rocket is positioned, a subsonic diffuser, a constant area afterburner, and either a converging nozzle or a converging-diverging nozzle. The current capabilities of E-PSURBCC ejector and ramjet mode treatment indicated that various complex flow phenomena including multiple choking and internal shocks can occur for combinations of geometry/flow conditions. For a given input deck defining geometry/flow conditions, the program first goes through a series of checks to establish whether the input parameters are sound in terms of a solution path. If the vehicle/engine performance fails mission goals, the engineer is able to collaboratively alter the vehicle moldline to change aerodynamics, or trajectory, or some other input to achieve orbit. The problem described {{is an example of the}} need for collaborative design and analysis. RECIPE is a cross-platform application capable of hosting a number of engineers and designers across the Internet for distributed and collaborative engineering environments. Such integrated system design environments allow for collaborative team design analysis for performing individual or reduced team studies. To facilitate the larger number of potential runs that may need to be made, RECIPE connects the computer codes that calculate the trajectory data, aerodynamic data based on vehicle geometry, heat rate data, TPS masses, and vehicle and engine performance, so that the output from each tool is easily transferred to the model input files that need it...|$|R
