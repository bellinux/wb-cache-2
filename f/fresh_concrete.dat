40|$|The {{adaptability}} {{to cement}} pastes and <b>fresh</b> <b>concretes</b> of aminosulphonic acid-based superplasticizer (ASP) and its water reducing ratio and compatibility with Naphthalene based superplasticize (FDN) {{have been investigated}} at a given content of ASP. The adaptability to cement pastes was determined by measuring the fluiditiy with time of superplasticized cement pastes, and the adaptability to <b>fresh</b> <b>concretes</b> and compatibility with FDN was evaluated by measuring the fluidity, bleeding, and hardening and mechanical property et. al. of <b>fresh</b> <b>concretes</b> with ASP. The {{results show that the}} fluidities at 120 min of cement pastes, with 1. 6 % of ASP, are over 140 mm, and it increases with the increase of ASP. There is a positive relationship between the water reducing ratios of ASP and its content, and the highest of the water reducing ratio(the highest value is 28 %). Moreover, the simultaneous addition of ASP and FDN can effectively decrease the bleeding of concrete. Adding the water reducing agent to concretes is an important method to prepare high-performance concrete [1 - 2]. However, the drawback of slump-loss of the concretes, which was, is and will be improved. The ASP, the high efficient water reducing admixture developed after FDN and polycarboxylic based superplasticizers, has the following advantages: low slump loss, low alkali content, lo...|$|R

Simultaneous physical and chemical structural effects provoke the ageing of the skeleton. In addition, the displacements are large and the hydromechanical properties evolve locally with the porosity. All these phenomena are here addressed through an ageing nonlinear model accounting for the sample size effect experimentally observed on the bleeding capacity. The characteristic time scaling of the ageing effect {{is found to be}} dependent mainly upon the amount of cement in the mix-design and the temperature.

When the moulding process was finished, all the specimens were immediately coated with a plastic membrane which had been brushed with oil to minimize the influence of water evaporation on cement hydration and strength growth. Demoulding started as soon as the specimens were cured in the curing room for 24  h, and then the specimens were cured by the method of sprinkling water until the 28  days age was reached.|$|R

Finally, this amplification of the structuration is estimated using modelling initially developed for spherical inclusions and aggregates...|$|R
