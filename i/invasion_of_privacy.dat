5|$|Several {{days later}} Herb Caen, a {{columnist}} at The San Francisco Chronicle, exposed Sipple as gay {{and a friend}} of Milk's.

Sipple, however, was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother, a staunch Baptist in Detroit, now refused to speak to him. Although he had been involved with the gay community for years, even participating in Gay Pride events, Sipple sued the Chronicle for <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>privacy.</b> President Ford sent Sipple a note of thanks for saving his life. Milk said that Sipple's sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the White House.|$|E

He expands on his claim that some of the indignities currently defined as gender discrimination under sexual harassment law are better conceived as <b>invasions</b> <b>of</b> <b>privacy,</b> and he explores the distinction between offenses against honor and offenses against dignity. Finally, he discusses the tensions between privacy and free speech, insisting that the most appropriate remedies for social misunderstanding are often social rather than legal...|$|R
