In this study, natural rubber vulcanisates were cured with conventional (CV), efficient (EV) and Dicumyl Peroxide (DCP) <b>curing</b> <b>systems</b> at 160 oC using a laboratory-size two roll mill. The tensile, tear and swelling were tested before and after ageing for 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 days at 100 oC.

After ageing, the CV system vulcanisates, which contained predominantly polysulfidic linkages, showed drastically reduced tensile strength and elongation at break and tear due to crosslink breakage. Crosslink reformation into a stable network inhibited their ability to undergo strain-induced crystallisation at longer durations of ageing. The EV system vulcanisates showed comparable swelling index percentages before and after ageing while the peroxide <b>curing</b> <b>system</b> exhibited increased swelling uptake with longer ageing times.

40|$|Importance of inter{{molecular}} forces (interactions {{of molecular}} chains) in the characteristic mechanical behavior of elastomers is studied. To {{focus on the}} microstructure of sulfur vulcanized rubbers, different network structures of NR/SBR elastomeric blends are investigated. The main difference of these structures comes from the ratio of sulfur to accelerator content in the <b>curing</b> <b>systems.</b> This ratio specifies the proportion of poly-sulfidic crosslinks in comparison with mono or di-sulfidic ones. In this study, three different <b>curing</b> <b>systems</b> (conventional, semiefficient, and efficient systems) are used to vulcanize the NR/SBR elastomeric blends. The vulcanized samples are exposed to uniaxial tensile tests to {{examine the effect of}} the <b>curing</b> <b>systems</b> on the material stress-strain behavior. The Exp-Ln hyperelastic model is utilized to formulate the mechanical behavior of the tested elastomers by dividing it into two independent (and also competitive) mechanisms; the entropic conformations of the molecular chains and the interactions of molecular chains. An exponential term is proposed to the former mechanism and a logarithmic term accounts for the latter one. Application of this model to the experimental data obtained from samples <b>cured</b> by different <b>systems</b> makes it possible to relate the material parameters of the model to the physical properties of the material molecular network especially to strength of the intermolecular forces. Furthermore, the <b>curing</b> <b>system</b> may affect the amount of physical entanglements.
