5|$|After graduating, Synge {{decided that}} <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{professional}} musician {{and went to}} Germany to study music. He stayed in Coblenz during 1893 and moved to Würzburg in January 1894. Partly because he was shy about performing in public, {{and partly because of}} doubt about his ability, he decided to abandon music and pursue his literary interests. He returned to Ireland in June 1894, and moved to Paris in January 1895 to study literature and languages at the Sorbonne.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} the University of Virginia, {{where he played}} basketball and baseball; {{he was a member}} of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. His brother Bill also played baseball for Virginia. During the off-season, umpire Cy Rigler worked as an assistant coach for the University. He recognized Rixey's talent and tried to sign him to the Philadelphia Phillies. Rixey originally declined, saying <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> chemist, but Rigler insisted, even offering a substantial portion of the bonus he received for signing a player. With his family in financial trouble, Rixey accepted the deal. The National League, upon hearing of the deal, created a rule that prohibits umpires from signing players. Neither Rixey nor Rigler received any signing bonus.|$|E

5|$|In December, City manager Stuart Pearce {{publicly}} {{stated that}} Samaras {{would have to}} 'toughen up', if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> success in the Premier League. He said that Samaras' all round game wasn't good enough, {{and that he would}} need to learn to pass the ball better and compete more effectively. Some fans had criticised Pearce for signing Samaras, along with other foreign players, who had not settled in well enough to the English game. On 2 January, Samaras came on as a half-time substitute, and scored twice, as they beat Everton 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Rodriquez had {{initially}} refused {{to audition for}} the series as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of the 2000 drama The Street instead. After being contacted repeatedly by All Souls producers, he read for the parts of Fortado and Sterling; {{he had to go}} through the lines a total of five times. During the audition, he met and talked to Aaron Spelling. After failing to be cast in The Street, Rodriquez committed to portraying Fortado. He said that his main attraction to the television project was the ability to work on a show produced by Spelling. While filming the episodes in a wheelchair, Rodriquez said that he gained an increased awareness and appreciation for handicapped people.|$|E

Max leaves, but {{on the day of}} Donna's abortion, he arrives at her home with flowers and asks if he can accompany her to her procedure. While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that when he said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> grandfather, he meant sometime far in the future. The two agree {{that this is one of}} the nicest Valentine's Days they have ever had. After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then they watch Gone with the Wind together.|$|E

5|$|He grew up moving between council flats before {{settling}} in a three-bedroom semi-detached on a council estate in Cranford, Hounslow, he {{was fond of}} animals in his early life, and enjoyed reading the comic strips of Dan Dare. His parents separated after Audrey discovered Bill had had an affair that started while he was stationed in the army during World War II. He began attending Hounslow College and stayed there through his early teenage years. He was influenced by Elvis Presley by hearing his records at home and at the local youth club. He switched to go to Acton County Grammar School (now Acton High School) to take his O Levels, where he was in the same class as Pete Townshend, but became distracted from studies after leaving the local cinema having watched a Presley film, deciding that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rock'n'roll singer. He subsequently took a job manufacturing ice machines in Hounslow.|$|E
5|$|Though {{he would}} later become indelibly {{associated}} with Stoke City, Matthews grew up supporting that club's local rivals Port Vale. His father wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a boxer, but Stanley decided {{at the age of}} 13 that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> footballer. After a rigorous training session that made Matthews vomit, his mother, Elizabeth, stood firm and made Jack realise that his son, who had one more year at school, should follow his passion of football. His father conceded that should he be picked for England Schoolboys then he could continue his footballing career; around this time his school football master picked Matthews as an outside-right, rather than as his then-preferred position of centre-half. Matthews played for England Schoolboys against Wales in 1929, in front of around 20,000 spectators at Dean Court, Bournemouth.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{was born}} in Orangeville, Ontario, the son of Judy Copeland, a single parent who worked two jobs to support her son. To this day, he has never met his father or seen a picture of him. He became {{interested}} in professional wrestling at a young age; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart. As a teenager, Copeland attended WrestleMania VI sitting in the eleventh row at ringside. He was cheering on WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan against The Ultimate Warrior, and he credits this match with making him realize <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> wrestler. When he was 17, he won an essay contest with his local gym, and his prize was free wrestling training with Sweet Daddy Siki and Ron Hutchison in Toronto. He put his wrestling aspirations aside to help pay the bills. He held numerous jobs and then attended Humber College, where he graduated {{with a degree in}} radio broadcasting, then received training.|$|E

5|$|He never {{attended}} {{school and was}} illiterate for some years of his early life. He learned {{to read and write}} reportedly out of curiosity after reading and hearing comic books and stories of Kalimán and Porfirio Cadena, El Ojo del Vidrio on the local radio station. In his autobiography, Moreno González said that as a child he believed he had the superhuman ability of speaking telepathically with animals like Kalimán did in the comics. He said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hero like the comic characters. As a child, he was accustomed to seeing gunmen near his home, and played las guerritas ("war games") for fun. While playing the game, he often pretended to be dead, only to say later on that he had been wounded in the game but that he had managed to survive. At the age of twelve, he moved to Apatzingán and made a living by selling matches, peeling onions, working at a melon field, and throwing out the trash from several booths at a marketplace. As a teenager in the late 1980s, Moreno González migrated illegally to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually began selling marijuana. After some years, he moved to Texas and in 1994 was arrested for drug trafficking charges in McAllen. Nearly a decade later in 2003, the U.S. government charged him with conspiracy to distribute five tons of narcotics and issued an arrest warrant. Moreno González then fled back to Mexico.|$|E
