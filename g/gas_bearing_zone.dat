Lithological interpretation and effects of rock minerals and fluids have been assessed. The Eocene reservoirs are mainly sandstone with inferred clay matrix up to 20 % and some calcareous cementation. Some of these reservoirs are very clean with clay content as low as 5 – 10 %. Sands are interpreted to be continuous in most of the blocks. However, there is some shale intercalations observed in many cases. A wide range of variation is found in water saturation with lowest value observed at 5 %. The effective porosity for these sands is varying in the range of 15 – 22 % for most of the wells. The effect of gas in the reservoir sands are very well understood in the log response for most of the wells. <b>Gas</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>zone</b> showed very big cross over for neutron-density curves and is also supported by very high resistivity.

Externally pressurized <b>gas</b> <b>bearings</b> provide a simple solution to overcome excessive drag and allowing rub-free operation during transient response events. Some commercial MTM currently implements <b>gas</b> foil <b>bearings,</b> a costly proprietary technology with few, if any, proven reliable predictive design models. The thrust {{of this research is}} to investigate conventional bearings of low cost, easy to manufacture (common materials) and easy to install and align. Flexure pivot tilting pad bearings offer little or no cross-coupled stiffnesses with enhanced rotordynamic stability. These bearings, modified for hydrostatic pressurization, demonstrated superior rotordynamic performance over other simple <b>gas</b> <b>bearing</b> configurations. The test rig comprises of a rigid rotor, 0. 825 kg and 28. 6 mm in diameter, supported on two hybrid flexure pivot hybrid <b>gas</b> <b>bearings,</b> each with four pads and 60 % pivot offset and 0. 6 mm feeding holes. Experimental results show that external pressurization stiffens the <b>gas</b> <b>bearings,</b> increasing the system critical speed while reducing the modal damping. Most importantly, the tests demonstrate that external pressurization is not needed for super critical speed operation. In practice, the supply pressure could be shut off at high speeds with substantial savings in operational efficiency. In addition, controlling the feed pressure while the rotor passes through its critical speeds can eliminate high amplitude motions because of the bearings? inherent little damping. In 2007, the test rig integrates an inexpensive automatic air pressure regulator to control the supply pressure into the <b>gas</b> <b>bearings.</b> The measured system dynamic response determines the regulator control scheme with a programmed schedule over a rotor speed region enclosing the system critical speeds. Rotor speed coast-down tests with controlled supply pressure into the bearings demonstrate the effective elimination of large rotor motion amplitudes while crossing the system critical speeds. The simple on-off supply pressure control, i. e. a sudden increase in pressure while approaching a critical speed, is the best since it changes abruptly the bearing stiffness coefficients and moves the system critical speed to a higher speed. A rotordynamic analysis, integrating bearing force coefficients predicted by an existing TRC computational model, forwards critical speeds in agreement with the test results. Predicted rotor synchronous responses for the cases with controlled supply show an excellent correlation with the measured responses.

In the present paper both the technolo-gies are combined with the aim of developing a new kind of hybrid permanent magnetic- <b>gas</b> <b>bearing.</b> This new kind of machine element is intended to exploit the benefits of the two technologies while minimizing their drawbacks. The poor start-up and low speed operation performance of the <b>gas</b> <b>bearing</b> is balanced by the properties of the passive magnetic one.

40|$|In {{this study}} an aerostatic journal bearing for {{reciprocating}} free pistons {{was designed for}} application with thermoacoustic engines. By {{taking advantage of the}} maxima and minima of the oscillating pressures inside the engine's cavity, the bearing does not rely on external pressurization by a pump, but is internally pressurized. The fluid film lubricated bearing is established by the continuous flow of gas in the clearance gap from a high pressure reservoir that is charged with gas from the engine's cavity to low pressure reservoirs that are drained to the engine's cavity both inside the engine's piston. A numerical model of this bearing is developed based on a laminar first order resistance-capacitance flow network of the flow in the bearing channels and clearance gap. This model was used to make design decisions and allowed to predict the pressures in the clearance gap and reservoirs and the performance of the bearing. In addition to the <b>gas</b> <b>bearing</b> for the radial suspension, a centering mechanism is integrated in the design to ensure an axially centered oscillation of the piston. This mechanism is first studied separately from the <b>gas</b> <b>bearing</b> using a numerical modeling, which was then validated in experiments with a piston in a cylinder resonating between two gas springs in sliding contact without including a <b>gas</b> <b>bearing.</b> For the validation of the <b>gas</b> <b>bearing,</b> an experimental set-up was built based on a multipiece hollow graphite free piston resonating in a closely fitted glass cylinder between two gas springs on a shaker table at 56. 5 Hz.
