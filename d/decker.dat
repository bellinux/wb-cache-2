5|$|Chuck and Hartley go to Volkoff Industries, and Hartley reveals to Vivian {{that he went}} {{undercover}} voluntarily, {{resulting in}} his transformation into the villainous Volkoff. Chuck gives up the discs from Casey so Vivian and her father can start a new life. Chuck returns with the antidote to Burbank, California, where <b>Decker</b> is waiting for him. A standoff occurs, but as Chuck is backed up by a superior force made up of his friends, family, the C.A.T. Squad (Mini Andén and Mercedes Masöhn), and Volkoff's Spetsnaz paratroopers, <b>Decker</b> is forced to stand down. Using the information about Alexei as leverage against <b>Decker,</b> Chuck delivers the antidote.|$|E

50|$|Prior to Here Come the Double <b>Deckers,</b> Century Films {{produced}} a film serial for the Children's Film Foundation called The Magnificent Six and 1/2. The series {{was very similar}} to the Double <b>Deckers,</b> and essentially acted as a blueprint for the latter. Like the Double <b>Deckers,</b> Six and a Half centred on the adventures of seven children, who had similar personalities to the characters in Double <b>Deckers.</b> Many of the crew members from the Six and a Half series also worked on the Double <b>Deckers,</b> including producer Roy Simpson, director and writer Harry Booth, writer Glyn Jones, and choreographer Arnold Taraborrelli (who designed the title cards for Six and a Half). In addition, future Double <b>Deckers</b> cast members Brinsley Forde and Michael Audreson were among the stars of Six and a Half, and Melvyn Hayes appeared in a few episodes. Six and a Half also featured several gags and plotlines that would later be reused in Double <b>Deckers.</b>|$|R

As they leave the hospital, Chuck, Casey, Mary, and Hartley are captured by <b>Decker</b> and taken to Castle, a government base under the big-box store Buy More, where <b>Decker</b> suppresses the Intersect in Chuck's mind. Casey helps Chuck and Hartley escape, giving Chuck discs containing clean fabricated identities for him and Sarah.|$|E
5|$|Kirk takes {{command of}} the ship citing his experience, angering Captain Willard <b>Decker,</b> who had been {{overseeing}} the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of Enterprises new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the Vulcan Enterprise science officer Sonak, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and improperly calibrated engines almost destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer <b>Decker.</b> Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, he felt a consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud.|$|E

Patrick, who had served on the staff of Admiral William F. Halsey in the South Pacific Area. Patrick did not get along smoothly with Krueger or the rest of the Sixth Army staff, and in May 1944 Patrick was appointed to command the 158th Regimental Combat Team, and <b>Decker</b> became chief of staff.|$|E

5|$|In {{his address}} to the state {{legislature}} in January 1898, Bradley advocated {{the repeal of the}} state's Separate Coach Law, which provided separate streetcars for whites and blacks. He appointed substantial numbers of blacks to patronage positions in government beyond the janitorial jobs they usually received. He named Edward E. Underwood as the first black person on the board of trustees for Kentucky State College (later the University of Kentucky). Because of his devotion to black advancement, Bradley was the only white person included in William <b>Decker</b> Johnson's 1897 compilation Biographical Sketches of Prominent Negro Men and Women of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, Persis Khambatta {{was hired}} to portray Ilia. She had been {{required}} to wear a bald cap for her screen test, although {{at this point the}} character also wore elaborate headgear in some footage. Roddenberry was insistent on this as a character attribute, but others such as Eisner hated the idea of a bald female character. His notes said that while a bald female character would be an interesting addition, it may prevent the audience from feeling at ease with Ilia and so the style may need to be given to a different character entirely. The auditions by this time were not held under the pretence that they were to play a part in a television series, but were openly talking about Star Trek becoming a feature film. The casting for Willard <b>Decker</b> had been delayed, both because of a slight delay in the production but also because the writers were no longer sure that the character was needed at all. This was despite auditions being conducted {{at the same time that}} Gautreaux was cast as Xon, during which, in his second audition with Barrett, he also read lines against ten actors competing for the role of <b>Decker.</b>|$|E

By 1962, when the base was again deactivated, only 128 of the original 668 buildings remained. The General Services Administration (GSA) wanted to sell the base {{to the town of}} Wendover, leaving only the bombing ranges and radar site with the Air Force. The base was renamed <b>Decker</b> Field, and again declared surplus in 1972.

5|$|Double deck buses show an {{intermediate}} points display, {{as well as}} a final destination. The company's double <b>decker</b> buses are unique in Scotland in still displaying the destination at both the front and rear. In early mornings and late evenings, some services are curtailed to the city centre or to early termini, in the transition to the night bus service. In such cases, 'Part Route' is displayed in the intermediate display. Certain routes have all day short working termini, and minor diversions which are often indicated through the use of internal or external 'tram boards'. Since 2006 double-deck deliveries feature a 'Route Diverted; intermediate display, used when road closures cause a service to be diverted from its normal route.|$|E

5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five double <b>decker</b> buses {{based on}} the Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built {{at either end of the}} tunnel; there was also a ladder built into the side of the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
