40|$|Abstract — VANETs is a {{technology}} that provides communication between moving vehicles. VANETs are highly dynamic in nature due to mobility of vehicles. This dynamic nature causes topological change in the network, which may affect the communication and security of vehicular adhoc network. Due to non-centralized infrastructure, self-driving and Ad-Hoc nature of VANETs it`s vulnerable to different severe attacks. The wormhole attack {{is one of the}} denial-of-service attack that affects the communication in the network. It enables an intruders to capture data packets at one location and tunnels them to another location forming a wormhole link in-between the legitimate nodes <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>vehicles</b> of the network. In this paper, the ANODR secure routing protocol is implemented on vehicular adhoc network for secure data transmission between communicating parties <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>Vehicles</b> from severe wormhole attack.

Through these interactions a vehicle can share its domain-specific information – acquired from service providers and infrastructure – with other vehi-cles in the convoy. Such interactions are subject to defined agreements and constraints between the entities (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>vehicle</b> to vehicle, vehicle to service providers, and so on), which may need to adapt with the changes of requirements. Also a driver may want to automate certain interactions to reduce distraction during driving. A cooperative convoy telematics system should support collaboration (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> allow drivers to share specific travel information) and coordination, {{and be able to}} cope with the changes. In this paper, we address these issues and demonstrate how our interaction-relationship modeling technique can be ex-ploited to develop a telematics system provides such flexibility.
