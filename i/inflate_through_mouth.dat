50|$|Balls {{in those}} days were not spherical, but more plum-shaped. This was because a pig's bladder was <b>inflated</b> by <b>mouth</b> <b>through</b> the snapped stem of a clay pipe then encased in panels of {{stitched}} leather. As such, the individual bladder dictated the shape of each ball.|$|R
50|$|The {{ancestor}} of these suits was already invented in 1872 by Clark S Merriman to rescue steamship passengers. It {{was made from}} rubber sheeting and became famous by the swim records of Paul Boyton. It was essentially a pair of rubber pants and shirt cinched tight at the waist with a steel band and strap. Within the suit were five air pockets the wearer could <b>inflate</b> by <b>mouth</b> <b>through</b> hoses. Similar to modern-day drysuits, the suit also kept its wearer dry. This essentially allowed him to float on his back, using a double-sided paddle to propel himself, feet-forward. Additionally he could attach a small sail to save stamina while slowly drifting to shore (because neither emergency radio transmitters nor rescue helicopters were invented yet).|$|R
50|$|In October 1931, {{a design}} for water wings {{appeared}} in the magazine Modern Mechanix. They were made of rubber, consisted of two parts, were worn on the upper arms, and <b>inflated</b> <b>through</b> a valve. They were first demonstrated in public on the beaches of Los Angeles, California, USA.|$|R
50|$|A closed SMB, <b>inflated</b> <b>through</b> a valve, {{is likely}} to be more reliable, by {{remaining}} inflated, than an open ended buoy which seals by holding the opening under water. A decompression buoy is not intended to be used to lift heavy weights: for this purpose divers use a lifting bag.|$|R
50|$|The loose-weave {{nature of}} the outer fiber shell also enables PAMs to be {{flexible}} and to mimic biological systems. If the surface fibers are very badly damaged and become unevenly distributed leaving a gap, the internal bladder may <b>inflate</b> <b>through</b> the gap and rupture. As with all pneumatic systems {{it is important that}} they are not operated when damaged.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} floats for {{children}} are inflatable rings (where the user swims {{in the middle}} of it) and the inflatable armbands (they are placed around the user's arms). After being <b>inflated</b> <b>through</b> a valve, they are much less dense than water because they are composed mainly of air, surrounded by a thin layer of synthetic material.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} case reports of {{complications}} of ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. Extrusion of the peritoneal {{end of the}} shunt <b>through</b> <b>mouth</b> is extremely rare. There are few case reports. We are reporting one such case. A 1 -year male child was admitted with the peritoneal end of ventriculo-peritoneal shunt coming out <b>through</b> <b>mouth</b> since 6 hours after an episode of vomiting. He was conscious and had no neurological deficits. The anterior fontanelle was depressed. There was no infection. The peritoneal end of the shunt was removed <b>through</b> the <b>mouth.</b> Shunt revision was performed. The patient was discharged 10 days after the revision without any complications. At 1 -year follow-up the patient is doing well. Possible mechanisms of bowel perforation are discussed. Pulling the peritoneal end <b>through</b> <b>mouth</b> {{is probably the best}} way of management as small spontaneous gut perforation seals off spontaneously. It also decreases the possibility of infection, other morbidities, and hospital stay...|$|R
60|$|Goatskin rafts are {{extensively}} {{used on the}} Tigris and elsewhere. These are <b>inflated</b> <b>through</b> one of the legs: {{they are}} generally lashed to a framework of wood, branches, and reeds, {{in such a way}} that the leg is accessible to a person sitting on the raft: when the air has in part escaped, he creeps round to the skins, one after the other, untying and re-inflating them in succession.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} {{compared}} four different sites and {{conditions for the}} measurement of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) in 38 spontaneous breathing tracheotomised patients. Of the patients, 28 had {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The four different conditions were: 1) <b>through</b> a cuff <b>inflated</b> cannula (condition A); 2) <b>through</b> the <b>mouth</b> with a deflated cannula (condition B); 3) <b>through</b> the <b>mouth</b> with a phonetic uncuffed cannula (condition C); and 4) <b>through</b> the <b>mouth</b> after stoma closure (condition D). Five trials in each condition were performed using a standardised method. The measurement of both MIP and MEP differed significantly depending on the condition of measurement. MIP taken in condition A was significantly higher when compared with conditions B, C and D. MEP in condition A was significantly higher when compared with condition B and D. In condition A the highest frequency of the best measurement of MIP and MEP was observed at the fourth and fifth effort, respectively. The same results were obtained after the selection of only COPD patients. In conclusion, respiratory muscle assessment differs significantly depending on measurement condition. Measurement <b>through</b> <b>inflated</b> cannula tracheotomy yields higher values of both maximal inspiratory and maximal expiratory pressure...|$|R

500|$|Bo's {{model of}} {{economic}} growth won national and international praise for seamlessly combining foreign investment and state-led growth. However, Bo's critics called the model of [...] "red GDP" [...] – subsidized infrastructure, housing and public works projects – unsustainable and a drain on the city's budget. Some civil servants complained {{that they were not}} getting salaries on time. Chongqing received a disproportionately high share (some $34 billion) of stimulus money from Beijing in 2008. Political rivals such as Bo's predecessor Wang Yang also suggested that economic figures in Chongqing were [...] "rigged"—artificially <b>inflated</b> <b>through</b> unnecessary construction and public works projects.|$|R

50|$|Analysis of the {{population}} report, and a similar report published by NGC, has allowed rarity estimates {{to be made of}} specific coins.
