25|$|In pre-modern times, {{environmental}} issues were not widely discussed, though Ashoka banned {{the burning of}} forests and promoted the planting of trees in his edicts. Bhikkhu Bodhi, an American Theravada monk, has been outspoken {{about the issue of}} environmental crisis. Bodhi holds that the root of the current ecological crisis is the belief that increased production and consumption to satisfy our material and sensual desires leads to well being. The subjugation of nature is directly opposed to the Buddhist view of non-harming and dwelling in nature. Buddhist activists such as Ajahn Pongsak in Thailand and the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement have worked for reforestation and environmental protection. The Dalai Lama also professes the close relationship of human beings and nature, saying that since humans come from nature, {{there is no point in}} going against it. He advocates that a clean environment should be considered a basic human right and that it <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>responsibility</b> as humans to ensure that we do all we can to pass on a healthy world to those who come after us.|$|E

A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that [...] "the Portuguese government is appealing for a halt to the violence and respect for the law." [...] Portas later called for the detained civilian leadership to be released. Defence Minister José Pedro Aguiar-Branco said that the Portuguese military was ready to evacuate its citizens. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>responsibility</b> and our job to ensure adequate preparedness in the event that the evacuation be necessary." [...] Portugal also issued a travel warning for its citizens. On 15 April, it was announced that two naval vessels and an aircraft {{were on their way to}} somewhere in West Africa ready for a possible evacuation of 4,000–5,000 Portuguese citizens.

500|$|In May 2014, before Music Key {{service was}} launched, the {{independent}} music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were [...] "undervalued" [...] {{in comparison to}} other streaming services, and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service. In {{a statement to the}} Financial Times in June 2014, Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals {{to be included in the}} paid service [...] "to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms." [...] Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that [...] "while we wish that we had [...] 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>responsibility</b> to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience." [...] The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service. However, YouTube itself has not confirmed the deal.|$|E
