40|$|Despite various <b>policing</b> {{strategies}} <b>in</b> {{the recent}} past, the police alone {{have not been}} able reduce crime in Soshanguve. Research into how partnerships <b>in</b> <b>policing</b> can assist <b>in</b> finding solutions to crime prevention is limited. The police have come to realise that they need the active involvement and cooperation of and support from the community and other role players to prevent crime. This research has as its aim the identification of the challenges in establishing partnerships <b>in</b> <b>policing</b> the Soshanguve policing area. A qualitative approach was adopted. An interview schedule with predetermined questions was designed, piloted and used in focus group interviews with participants who are actively involved <b>in</b> partnerships <b>in</b> <b>policing</b> <b>in</b> the area. Interviews were conducted with 45 participants in three focus group interviews to obtain their views, opinions and perceptions of partnerships <b>in</b> <b>policing.</b> The collected data was transcribed verbatim (using words and phrases of the participants), analysed and interpreted. The data was analysed and interpreted using manual open coding, with the aim of identifying and examining patterns of similarities or differences in the data. A literature study was conducted {{to gain a better understanding}} of partnerships <b>in</b> <b>policing.</b> Research indicates that partnerships <b>in</b> <b>policing</b> have been effectively implemented in other parts of the world and can be implemented in South Africa in general and in Soshanguve in particular. Factors that inhibit partnerships <b>in</b> <b>policing</b> between the police and the community as well as in other environments were identified. These factors include among others, lack of trust, communication and cooperation. Recommendations are made to all concerned; particularly to the South African Police Service management on how partnerships <b>in</b> <b>policing</b> can be effectively implemented.

5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not <b>in</b> <b>police</b> custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E

Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.|$|E

The main campus is located at Majorstuen in Oslo, while the secondary campus is located at Mørkved in Bodø. In addition the college has training centers in Kongsvinger and Stavern. Police officer training is a three-year bachelor's degree, where the first and third year take place at the college and the second year is on-the-ground training <b>in</b> <b>police</b> districts.|$|E

In order to counterbalance the monosexual tradition of thought, the author seeks to introduce the reader to information on policewomen in Estonia and look at their issues from a female perspective. In addition, the survey of Estonian policewomen and their status enlarges the picture of women <b>in</b> <b>policing</b> to include those in Estonia...|$|R

5|$|Hastings {{claimed that}} {{there was no mention of}} the case <b>in</b> <b>police</b> records held by {{archives}} in Adelaide, but that instead, the incident had been related to him by residents of the district who had known Brown. He also placed it as having occurred between 1860 and 1870. Foster et al. note that this date is highly unlikely, as frontier violence in the district began when squatters arrived in 1843, and was tapering off by 1848 when the murders occurred. By the 1860s, Aboriginal labour was highly sought after by pastoralists in the district due to the exodus of white labourers to the Victorian gold rush.|$|E

The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–1964 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald <b>in</b> <b>police</b> custody.

40|$|Police shootings of unarmed African Americans, {{including}} Michael Brown, Sean Bell, and Oscar Grant, sparked nationwide protests, debate, and consciousness-raising {{about race}} <b>in</b> <b>policing.</b> These high-profile shootings provide pressing reason for an in-depth analysis of race, policing, and policy. This article details the deleterious consequences that racial disparities <b>in</b> <b>policing</b> {{have on the}} lives of racial minorities. In trying to understand the source of this disparate treatment, it highlights what empirical social science knows about racial bias <b>in</b> <b>policing,</b> emphasizing how contemporary forms of racial bias can contribute to racially disparate outcomes. The article makes a distinction between what research reveals about the existence of racial bias <b>in</b> <b>policing</b> and perceptions of racially biased policing. Existing racial bias is not always accurately identified nor perceived, which makes it harder to enact change. Examining how to counteract its potential influence, it reviews empirically based interventions to address both police behavior and community perceptions regarding race <b>in</b> <b>policing.</b> From a policy perspective, the article considers the use of police body-worn cameras as a means to promote equitable policing. It concludes with recommendations based on scientific literature, arguing that effective policies must address both the perception of and actual biased policing...|$|R

London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it.
