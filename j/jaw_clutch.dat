50|$|The {{vehicle is}} driven by {{traction}} units. Each unit consists of traction container on the vehicle roof and of four traction motors, which drive wheels of one driving bogie. Individual wheel drive on respective bogies secures perfect use of adhesive conditions and ideal ride both in bends and on straight lines. There are three-phase synchronous motors with permanent magnet excitation on rotor. They are fixed to the bogie framework from the wheels outside. The traction motors don't use a gear box - they drive tram wheels directly through a mechanically disconnectable <b>jaw</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
60|$|Red war was inevitable--not {{first on}} Jerry's part, but on Borckman's part. Borckman felt the abysmal urgings of the beast, as a beast, {{to prove himself}} master of this four-legged beast. Jerry felt his jowl and <b>jaw</b> <b>clutched</b> still more harshly and hardly, and, with {{increase}} of harshness and hardness, he was flung farther down the deck, which, on account of its growing slant due to heavier gusts of wind, had become a steep and slippery hill.|$|R
60|$|She {{was opening}} the door with her latch-key, and missed the sudden sagging of Freddie's <b>jaw,</b> the sudden <b>clutch</b> at his breast-pocket, and the look of horror and anguish that started into his eyes. Freddie was appalled. Finding himself at the police-station penniless with the {{exception}} of a little loose change, he had sent that message to Derek, imploring assistance, as the only alternative to spending the night in a cell, with Jill in another. He had realized that there was a risk of Derek taking the matter hardly, and he had not wanted to get Jill into trouble, but there seemed nothing else to do. If they remained where they were overnight, the thing would get into the papers, and that would be a thousand times worse. And if he applied for aid to Ronny Devereux or Algy Martyn or anybody like that all London would know about it next day. So Freddie, with misgivings, had sent the message to Derek, and now Jill's words had reminded him that there was no need to have done so. Years ago he had read somewhere or heard somewhere about some chappie who always buzzed around with a sizable banknote stitched into his clothes, and the scheme had seemed to him ripe to a degree. You never knew when you might find yourself short of cash and faced by an immediate call for the ready. He had followed the chappie's example. And now, when the crisis had arrived, he had forgotten--absolutely forgotten!--that he had the dashed thing on his person at all.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical Design Handbook {{oriented}} {{standard part}} library system of jaw clutches is developed based on SolidWorks. The system {{consists of three}} elements, namely a dimension parameter database, a user interface, and a modeling function module. The <b>jaw</b> <b>clutch</b> dimension parameter database is designed based on national standards. According to designers ’ thinking habit, a visual user interface is customized to make easy use of the dimension parameter database. The data relationship between the modeling function module and dimension parameter database is established by using parametric program driven method. The <b>jaw</b> <b>clutch</b> standard part library with characteristics of friendly user interface and expansible database is easy to use. The approach adopted in the paper {{can be used to}} develop other general 3 D standard part library on SolidWorks...|$|E
30|$|As {{explained}} above, the tool/end effector {{is driven}} {{by a pair of}} active and passive mechanisms. Hereafter, this active–passive pair is called the rotational meshing actuator. Furthermore, for simplicity, the active and passive actuator components are called the A-Gear and P-Gear, respectively. Positive clutch and friction clutch are two typical mechanisms of rotation transmission. The friction clutch enables connection with high-speed rotation, but its friction surface should be finished with high accuracy. On the other hand, positive clutches such as the <b>jaw</b> <b>clutch</b> have a simple mechanical structure, but are unsuitable for high-speed operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the review of}} garlic peeling machine with the related search. The study specifies factors influencing the garlic peeling process and recommends a design options for garlic peeling machine. These {{are based on a}} systematic study of the garlic peeling process. For which we consider literatures reviews & some of them are explained. In the present investigation, in the recent past human powered flywheel motor concept has been used for chaff cutter, bricks making, wood turning, cloth washing and turmeric polishing. The machine uses bicycle technology, with speed increasing gearing and a flywheel, which drive the process unit through a spiral <b>jaw</b> <b>clutch</b> and torque increasing gearing. Pedal power is used transmit this power to run the machine by the operator. Power can be transmitted through crank chain to free wheel to the working unit. This human powered flywheel motor concept (HPFM) provide new era in the human powered agriculture processing, harvesting, post harvested operations equipments. Considering social, cultural and environmental factor as well as in many rural operations utilizing unskilled worker and in Vidharbha region there is more problem of electricity so this kind of HPFM concept is helpful in driving various rural machines. The machine is economically viable, can be adopted for human powered process units which could have intermitted operation without affecting the end product.

40|$|There {{is almost}} no water left {{on earth that}} is safe to drink without {{purification}} after 20 - 25 years from today. This is a seemingly bold statement, but it is unfortunately true. Only 1 % of Earth’s water is in a fresh, liquid state, and nearly {{all of this is}} polluted by both diseases and toxic chemicals. For this reason, purification of water supplies is extremely important. Keeping these things in mind, we have designed a model which will convert the dirty/saline water into pure/ potable water using the renewable source of energy (i. e., Human power). The machine consists of a human-powered flywheel motor using a bicycle-drive mechanism with speed-increasing gearing and a flywheel, which drive the process unit though a spiral <b>jaw</b> <b>clutch</b> and torque increasing gearing. The operator puts energy into the flywheel at a convenient power level for about one minute. After enough energy is stored, pedaling is stopped and the energy in the flywheel is made available to the process unit. Pedal power is the transfer of energy from a human source {{through the use of a}} foot pedal and crank system. This technology is most commonly used for transportation and has been used to propel bicycles. Less commonly pedal power is used to power agricultural and hand tools and even to generate electricity by using the generator. This electricity is used for distillation of water in evaporator. The basic mode of the heat transfer involved is convection and The results are obtained by evaporation of the dirty/ saline water and fetching it out as pure/drinkable water. The designed model produces 1. 5 litres of pure water from 14 litres of dirty water during six hours. The efficiency of plant is 64. 37 %...|$|E
