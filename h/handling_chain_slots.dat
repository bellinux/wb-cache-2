40|$|Abstract—TDMA MAC {{protocols}} {{suffer from}} two drawbacks that have reduced its practical appeal, especially for infrastructure-less wireless networks: {{the need for}} time synchronization, {{and the use of}} frames. While there has been extensive research towards achieving the required time synchronization, the frames are assumed to be inherent in TDMA. In this paper we present a framework for frameless TDMA based on a new concept we refer to as a <b>slot</b> <b>chain.</b> A <b>slot</b> <b>chain</b> is a series of slots with a starting slot and inter-slot period that is chosen to match a given capacity request. The key challenge in using <b>slot</b> <b>chains</b> instead of frames is ensuring that <b>slot</b> <b>chains</b> representing arbitrary capacity requests are conflict free. We present an algorithm for interleaving <b>slot</b> <b>chains</b> in a conflict-free manner. The algorithm is optimal for a class of requests called geometric and is z-approximate for general requests, where z can be made arbitrarily small. We show that any TDMA MAC protocol can readily replace using frames with using <b>slot</b> <b>chains.</b> Our simulation analysis shows that using <b>slot</b> <b>chains</b> results in much better capacity utilization when traffic is heterogeneous – as much as 100 % in some cases.

40|$|In {{response}} {{to the establishment of}} the East Gippsland Vegetable Industry Board, a major new initiative in fresh vegetable production, marketing and a research program was initiated. It was to examine a number of factors highlighted by the Boston Consulting Group that were inhibiting the industry from becoming world competitive. These factors included the size of individual production units, transport and handling procedures, postharvest care, yield and a poor understanding of the <b>handling</b> <b>chain</b> and market intelligence (Boston Consulting Group, 1992 c). As part of the research program, this study was initiated to analyse the <b>handling</b> <b>chain</b> for fresh horticultural produce. Its purpose was to provide a detailed understanding of the conditions affecting the development of a quality management program. As will be seen in the following literature review, well controlled and operated <b>handling</b> <b>chains</b> are difficult to establish in Australia. Therefore, it is important that this aspect of horticulture be thoroughly understood {{so that it can be}} operated efficiently. Such a requirement is rendered more important when it is considered that East Gippsland is at least 300 km from any major port or distribution centre. This report through the use of a range of methods (i. e. pilot study, survey and case study) puts forward the thesis that for the long term sustainability of the fresh produce industry in Australia, it is necessary that procedures be established to enable market signals to be better disseminated to all players along the <b>handling</b> <b>chain.</b> This lack of information flow makes it difficult for suppliers to ensure that the product consistently satisfies consumer requirements. Other problems related to material handling, transport efficiency, storage facilities, training needs and quality control procedures are related to the fragmented nature of the industry. The survey showed a correlation between how well a producer understood the complexity of the <b>handling</b> <b>chain</b> and how he resolved other quality related problems. In overcoming this central issue, three case studies were undertaken to define different kinds of solutions. While this study makes a number of recommendations, the real challenge for operators in this industry is to put into place as quickly as possible a series of actions that will integrate customers needs into the whole production-distribution-supply system. This suggests the need for a more coordinated approach to quality management such as TQM (Total Quality Management). To be successful in implementing such a program in this industry frequent communication and co-operation within the whole <b>handling</b> <b>chain</b> would be needed. In order to achieve the desired industry commitment to quality, there are four major which need to be addressed when implementing TQM: (a) Importance of regular timely customer feedback (b) Formalisation of handling procedures for the entire <b>handling</b> <b>chain</b> (c) Importance of education and training (d) Avoid the confusing aspects of Quality Assurance (QA) and Total Quality Management (TQM) in quality management...|$|R

On top of this, postharvest research is dealing with large sources of biological variation. This paper outlines a general model approach of how {{to account for the}} propagation of biological variation when analysing experimental postharvest data gathered at dynamic {{temperature conditions}}. The proposed technique was applied to experimental data on colour change of tomatoes cv. 'Tradiro'. The previously developed multivariate stochastic approach was combined with a transformation of real time into physiological time to account for the effect of dynamic temperature conditions. The developed model has the capability to describe the complex batch behaviour showing propagation of biological variation in tomato colour as a function of time and dynamically changing temperature during postharvest storage. This makes the current approach extremely suitable for application in real life situations when evaluating and optimising a logistic <b>handling</b> <b>chain.</b> (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

Both physical and digital evidence is an important part in the process of investigation and courtroom. However, <b>handling</b> the <b>chain</b> of custody for digital evidence is more difficult than the handling of physical evidence.

3000|$|Even {{though we}} can use owl:equivalentProperty to create the fictitious {{property}} in ontology, <b>slot</b> <b>chains</b> in HyProb-Ontology do the trick easily. Whilst the continuous property is an attribute of the domain class of the <b>slot</b> <b>chain,</b> the fictitious property exists in the range class of the last item in the <b>slot</b> <b>chain.</b> In essence, CG fuzzification of continuous quantities is achieved in HyProb-Ontology using implicit relations between continuous quantities and their corresponding discrete properties. Thus, for a property chain X.σ [...].Q; Y.Q is considered a fictitious discrete equivalent of X.P if only the continuous domain of X.P corresponds to the discrete domain of Y.Q, and Y is the range class of the last reference <b>slot</b> in the <b>chain.</b> As shown in Fig. 5, with a typical oneM 2 M (Sneps-Sneppe and Namiot 2012) framework for example, <b>slot</b> <b>chains</b> can provide the dependence {{of the value of}} a temperature sensor(continuous quantity) on the temperature states of a room(discrete states). As an advantage, the adoption of <b>slot</b> <b>chains</b> in this approach can greatly simplify the process of semantic annotation in the generic oneM 2 M functional model for M 2 M applications. For instance, hasTemperature, which gives the interpretation of the continuous value of the property, hasValue, of a temperature sensor is inherently discrete. Clearly, these are two equivalent properties that represent the same phenomenon differently using discrete and continuous quantities. Therefore, hasTemperature can be the fictitious discrete equivalent, and also the only parent of hasValue in the dependency model.|$|R
