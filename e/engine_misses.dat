5000|$|In {{addition}} to designing and building sailboats, Johnson {{was also an}} inventor. He was the first aviator in Minnesota to achieve a take off from a level surface in a powered airplane. He built his airplane in his back yard and flew it from the frozen lake. From the St. Paul Dispatch January 26, 2010: [...] "WHITE BEAR MAN FLIES OVER LAKE. Inventor, Johnson, soars about 200 feet, then <b>engine</b> <b>misses</b> fire, and he falls." [...] The crash landing destroyed the fragile aircraft. Johnson built a second airplane, but {{did not have the}} funds to buy a suitable engine. His wife told him that flying airplanes was too dangerous, ending his attempts.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to detect the “knock” in Diesel engines which {{deteriorate}} the engine performance adversely. The methodology introduced in the present work suggests a newly developed approach towards analyzing the vibration analysis of diesel engines. The method is based on fundamental relationship between the engine vibration pattern and the relative characteristics of the combustion process in each or different cylinders. Knock in diesel engine is detected by measuring the vibration generated by the engine using The DC- 11 FFT analyzer with accelerometer. Knock in diesel engine is mainly due to the <b>engine</b> <b>miss.</b> A diesel <b>engine</b> <b>miss</b> results from one or more cylinders when the fuel is not burning properly. Improper fuel burning is caused by Injection system problems which include, Faulty injectors, clogged fuel filters, incorrect Injection timing, Low engine compression, injection system leaks, Air leaks, faulty injection pump etc. <b>Engine</b> <b>miss</b> causes rapid combustion with very high pressures generating a rumble or dull clattering sound. Abnormally loud sound with violent vibration is called “knocking or detonation”. Engine cylinder vibration in FFT form is monitored at each load the cylinder excitation frequencies are compared with the base line frequencies using diesel oil. Time wave forms on the cylinder head are also recorded to analyze the combustion. Since the very combustion in the cylinder is the basic exciter, the vibration study of the engine cylinder through the measured FFT and time waveforms are the representatives of combustion propensity. Vibration accelerometer is mounted on the cylinder head, preferably on the bolt connecting the head and the cylinder to record the engine vibrations using DC- 11 data logger which directly gives the spectral data in the form of FFT, the overall vibration levels. This FFT data recorded is collected by On-Time window based software designed by e-predict Inc., Argentina. The Time waveforms are obtained on the cylinder head by DC- 11 in the OFF-ROUT mode and are presented in graphic form by Vast DOS- based software, designed by VAST, Inc., Russia...|$|R

2500|$|On January 21, the NTSB found {{evidence}} of soft-body damage in the right engine along with organic debris including a feather. The left engine also evidenced soft body impact, with: [...] "dents on both the spinner and inlet lip of the engine cowling. Five booster inlet guide vanes are fractured and eight outlet guide vanes are missing." [...] Both <b>engines,</b> <b>missing</b> large portions of their housings, {{were sent to the}} manufacturer for examination. On January 31, the plane was moved to Kearny, New Jersey. The bird remains were later identified by DNA testing to be Canada geese, which typically weigh more than engines are designed to withstand ingesting.|$|R
50|$|Once {{again it}} was Mario Andretti on pole with James Hunt second and Gunnar Nilsson {{third on the}} grid. Hunt got the best start and led into the first corner from John Watson and Jacques Laffite, with Andretti {{dropping}} down to fourth. However, Watson passed Hunt on the fifth lap and started to build a gap until Andretti got up to second and began to reel him in. During the final few laps, leader Watson and Andretti were running nose-to-tail but Watson held him off till the last lap when his <b>engine</b> <b>missed</b> a beat and immediately Andretti was past. Andretti thus took the win ahead of a crestfallen Watson and Hunt.|$|R

50|$|On September 23, 1981, a Ronson Aviation Bell 206B {{helicopter}} and a Seminole Air Charier Piper PA-34 airplane collided in flight over East Rutherford, about 2 nautical {{miles south of}} the Teterboro Airport. The airplane had a flight plan to Teterboro from Syracuse, New York. The helicopter was inbound to Teterboro from Woodbridge, NJ. The two aircraft collided at about 650 feet. The helicopter fell into the Meadowlands Sports Complex parking lot, and both persons aboard were killed. The airplane, with about 8 feet of its left wing and its right <b>engine</b> <b>missing,</b> made a gear-up landing in a marsh about seven-tenths of a mile east of the collision point.

5000|$|The {{downfall}} of CNAC's operations came on 9 November 1949, when {{managing director of}} CNAC, Colonel CY Liu, {{and general manager of}} CATC (Central Aviation Transport Corporation), Colonel CL Chen with a skeleton crew defected - by unauthorised take- offs of 12 aircraft, from Hong Kong Kai Tak Airport to Communist-controlled China. The lead aircraft ( [...] Convair 240) was welcomed with pomp and ceremony in Beijing, while the other 11 landed safely in Tianjin. All aeroplanes were being pursued by KMT fighter planes - but on the day were shielded by heavy cloud cover. The remaining airline staff with their families ( [...] a total of 3,400 [...] ) sneaked into China by land or sea later. The ideology behind the defection was nationalism- as they believed there should only be : one, strong China. Today the original Convair 240 ( [...] with one <b>engine</b> <b>missing)</b> is on display at a Military Aviation Museum in Beijing.|$|R

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{a proposal to}} improve web document retrieval by facing the main problems in document searching: first, traditional web search <b>engines</b> <b>miss</b> documents {{that are relevant to}} the user query and retrieve many that are not. Second, the query formulation is not as accessible as it could be, and some users have difficulties in expressing boolean queries. To improve the quality of Internet search engines, two main approaches have typically been adopted: One is the creation of a metasearch engine that makes use of multiple search engines by unifying both the query language and the type of results returned by the different search engines; the other one involves applying NLP techniques for query extensions in order to handle morphological, lexical, semantic and syntactic variations. Focusing on the second approach, we present the research project MESIA (project CAM 07 T/ 0017 / 1998) for the Madrid Local Government web site (www. comadrid. es). Its main goal is to exploit general purpose linguistic resources to extend user queries in order to enhance the answers provided by AltaVista search engine. 1...|$|R
50|$|In early 1981, Randy Roth met Janis Miranda, also a {{divorced}} single parent, and they married that March. She {{had come from}} an impoverished upbringing in Texas, raised by a mother who labored to support her several children after their alcoholic father abandoned them. Marrying a serviceman, {{she gave birth to}} a daughter Jalina while stationed in Germany, but the marriage ended in divorce and Janis took her infant child to the West Coast seeking to begin a new life. Randy insisted on ample life insurance for his new wife as they were buying a house together and he told her he {{wanted to be able to}} pay the mortgage if the worst should come to pass. Janis had been extremely excited about her new husband, but after a few months, her friends started to notice that she was acting very strange and wary of everything. Shortly after the wedding, her Ford Pinto vanished and was later discovered in a field with its <b>engine</b> <b>missing.</b> She and Randy collected insurance money from the incident.|$|R

The command {{to shut down the}} rocket's second stage <b>engine</b> was <b>missing</b> from the flight control system, and consequently the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage from separating from the Briz-KM, and as a result the rocket was unable to achieve orbit. It reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.
