3000|$|The DSC {{data also}} show that the {{enthalpy}} of the transition increases as pH increases. Two phenomena contribute for the total enthalpy: the ordering of biopolymer chain into the β-spiral structure, corresponding to a reversing exothermic event, {{and the destruction of}} the ordered hydrophobic hydration structures around the polymer chain, which represent a non-reversing endothermic event [29, 38]. The endothermic process contributes with more than three times than the <b>exothermic</b> <b>component</b> for the total enthalpy. The more hydrophobic is the polymer, the higher is the registered ΔH due to the increasing in water molecules dedicated to hydrophobic hydration. The higher the pH, the more hydrophobic the ELP becomes and, consequently, the higher the ΔH values. The addition of salt to the solution facilitates self-assembly of the polymer due to a variation on the electrostatic interactions, decreasing the T [...]...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{self-assembly}} thermodynamics of pH-sensitive di-block and tri-block gradient copolymers of {{acrylic acid}} and styrene was studied {{for the first}} time using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) performed at varying pH. We were able to monitor each step of micellization as a function of decreasing pH. The growth of micelles is a multi-stage process that is pH dependent with several <b>exothermic</b> and endothermic <b>components.</b> The first step of protonation of the acrylic acid monomer units was accompanied mainly by conformational changes and the beginning of self-assembly. In the second stage of self-assembly, the micelles become larger and the number of micelles becomes smaller. While solution acidity increases, the isothermal calorimetry data show a broad deep minimum corresponding to an exothermic process attributed to an increase in the size of hydrophobic domains and an increase in the structure's hydrophobicity. The minor change in heat capacity (ΔCp) confirms the structural changes during this exothermic process. The exothermic process terminates deionization of acrylic acid. The pH-dependence of the ζ-potential of the block gradient copolymer micelles exhibits a plateau in the regime corresponding to the pH-controlled variation of the micellar dimensions. The onset of micelle formation and the solubility of the gradient copolymers were found to be dependent on the length of the gradient block...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, a {{thermodynamic}} {{analysis was performed}} using an isothermal titration microcalorimeter to measure changes in the enthalpy of mixing (ΔmixH) of water in microemulsion systems formed by soybean lecithin, isooctane and butanol. These energies were important to determine the driving forces associated {{with the formation of}} reverse micelles. It was observed that the titration curves of water in pure isooctane and in isooctane with soybean lecithin present values of ΔmixH equal to − 9. 46 × 10 − 3 kJ/mol and − 5. 68 × 10 − 3 kJ/mol, respectively. This shows that water does not form intermolecular interactions with these <b>components.</b> <b>Exothermic</b> behavior, with values of ΔmixH ranging from + 2. 17 kJ/mol to − 1. 63 × 10 − 2 kJ/mol, was observed from the titration curve of water in systems formed by soybean lecithin, isooctane and butanol. These values were associated with the water dissolution process, where the formation of reverse micelles had been observed in the evaluated systems. Differences in behavior of ΔmixH for the water curves were observed in systems formed by butanol and soybean lecithin, only pure butanol and butanol with isooctane. The curve of the system containing soybean lecithin, butanol and isooctane clearly shows that the formation of aggregates occurred in this system (reverse micelles). Finally, it was also noted that soybean lecithin did not suffer any degradation process, since the energy involved in the process of water titration in the systems containing the same substance was considered low. Thus, soybean lecithin may be used without problems in this type of system...|$|R

Enthalpies of formation are reported for two salts of aluminum centered ϵ-Keggin clusters, Al 13 selenate, (Na(AlO 4) Al 12 (OH) 24 (SeO 4) 4 • 12 H 2 O) and Al 13 sulfate, (NaAlO 4 Al 12 (OH) 24 (SO 4) 4 • 12 H 2 O). The measured enthalpies of solution, ΔHsol, at 28 [*]°C in 5  N HCl for the ε-Al 13 selenate and sulfate are − 924. 57 (±  3. 83) and − 944. 30 ( ±  5. 66)  kJ·mol- 1, respectively. The enthalpies of formation from the elements, ΔHf,el, for Al 13 selenate and sulfate are − 19, 656. 35 ( ±  67. 30)  kJ·mol- 1, and − 20, 892. 39 ( ±  70. 01)  kJ·mol- 1, respectively. In addition, ΔHf,el for sodium selenate decahydrate was calculated {{using data from}} high temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry measurements: − 4, 006. 39 ( ±  11. 91)  kJ·mol- 1. The formation of both ε-Al 13 Keggin cluster compounds is <b>exothermic</b> from oxide-based <b>components</b> but energetically unfavorable {{with respect to a}} gibbsite-based assemblage. To understand the relative affinity of the ϵ-Keggin clusters for selenate and sulfate, the enthalpy associated with two S-Se exchange reactions was calculated. In the solid state, selenium is favored in the Al 13 compound relative to the binary chalcogenate, while in 5  N HCl, sulfur is energetically favored in the cluster compound compared to the aqueous solution. This contribution represents the first thermodynamic study of ε-Al 13 cluster compounds and establishes a method for other such molecules, including the substituted versions that have been created for kinetic studies. Underscoring the importance of ε-Al 13 clusters in natural and anthropogenic systems, these data provide conclusive thermodynamic evidence that the Al 13 Keggin cluster is a crucial intermediate species in the formation pathway from aqueous aluminum monomers to aluminum hydroxide precipitates...|$|R
