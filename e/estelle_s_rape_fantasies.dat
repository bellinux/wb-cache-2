40|$|In this dissertation, I adopt a praxical {{theory of}} rhetorical space to {{identify}} and examine how members of The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality draw on or invoke rhetorical spatiality in their research published in the Journal of Sex Research. My specific research questions were: (1) What types of rhetorical spaces do sexologists create? and, (2) What rhetorical strategies do sexologists use to create rhetorical spaces? The dissertation is divided into five chapters that present different investigations of the production of rhetorical space in The Journal of Sex Research. Chapter One introduces the theoretical and methodological foundation for the examination of rhetorical space in the Journal of Sex Research. Chapter Two incorporates Edward Soja’s (1993) theory of thirdspace into the literature on rhetorical space to examine how sexologists create rhetorical cyberthirdspaces that represent and regulate sexualities in online environments. In particular,the second chapter presents three rhetorical cyber-thirdspaces (erotic oasis, pornosphere, and Jim Crow Cyb) created by sexologists publishing in the Journal of Sex. Each of these three rhetorical cyber-thirdspaces represents and perpetuates a different theory of the causes and consequences of sexuality on the Web {{in relation to the}} argument that the Internet has democratized sexuality. The rhetorical cyber-thirdspaces differ, however, with respect to the implications of the democratization of sexuality identified by the scholars conducting the research on the cyberspace. Chapter Two also examines how problems associated with research design (theoretical ambiguity, conceptual ambiguity, methodological formalism, exaggeration of causal events, extrapolation from limited cases, proxy evidence, misplaced concreteness, and self-testing) inform the construction of rhetorical cyber-thirdspaces in the Journal of Sex Research. Chapter Three draws on Ernest Bormann’s (1972, 1980. 1986, 2001, and 2006) theory of symbolic convergence and fantasy theme analysis to examine how sexologists invoke the imagination as a reinvention device in arguments regarding the nature and effects of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies.</b> Specific attention is directed toward how sexologists have created a new rhetorical vision of the <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> that sexualizes or eroticizes rape, {{while at the same time}} maintaining the assumption that women are not willful rape victims. And Chapter Four examines how the editors and contributors to a special issue of the Journal of Sex Research devoted to the medicalization of sexuality draw on spatial rhetorics, particularly spatial metaphors and appeals to contextualization, to encourage sexologists to broaden their disciplinary boundaries. The dissertation ends with a conclusion, in Chapter Five, which argues that rhetorical space functions as an invention strategy that sexologists use to create or support arguments about sexual social control, agency, or disciplinary boundaries with respect to cyberspace, imaginative space, and disciplinary space...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> {{of a female}} undergraduate sample (N = 355) using a sexual fantasy checklist, a sexual <b>fantasy</b> log, a <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> scenario presentation, and measures of personality. Results indicated that 62 % of women have had a <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy.</b> For these women, the median <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> frequency was about four times per year, with 14 % of participants reporting that they had <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> {{at least once a}} week. Further, <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> exist on a continuum between erotic and aversive, with 9 % completely aversive, 45 % completely erotic, and 46 % both erotic and aversive. Women who are more erotophilic, open to fantasy, and higher in self-esteem tended to have more frequent and erotic <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> than other women. The major theories that have been proposed to explain why women have <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> were tested. Results indicated that sexual blame avoidance and ovulation theories were not supported. Openness to sexuality, sexual desirability, and sympathetic activation theories received partial support...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{existence}} of <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> within a sample of female university students and investigates {{whether there is a}} relationship between <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> and the way individuals make attributions about the victims of rape. Participants completed a questionnaire which included measures of erotic and aversive <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies,</b> <b>rape</b> myth acceptance, rape victim empathy and specific attributions about a victim of rape presented in a vignette. The findings indicate that <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> are more common than previously thought, with 53. 4 per cent of participants reporting having experienced some form of sexually coercive fantasy at least once a year. The findings also indicate that there is positive correlational relationship between general <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> and the way individuals make attributions about individual rape victims, with people who experience <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> allocating a greater amount of blame to the victim in a specific rape scenario.

40|$|Fantasies are images or {{scenes that}} produce enjoyable feelings- they {{can range from}} brief {{thoughts}} or images to stories with detailed plotlines. They may deal with actual past experiences, purely imagined experiences, or a mixture of both. They can be non-sexual – e. g. fantasising about becoming a millionaire or being a world-famous rock star, {{and they can be}} sexual – fantasising about kissing your favourite celebrity, about having sex with a colleague or a friend, and so on. Some people fantasise during sex about being out-of-control or being forced to have sex against their will. There are many theories as to why people have <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> and it is an area that is still very much taboo and hush-hush in society. Some people believe that having a <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> means that the person fantasising wants to be raped, some people believe that fantasising about rape means you are masochistic, some people believe that a rape survivor should not find fantasising about rape sexually arousing. Many survivors working through their sexual healing who have <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> experience a lot of shame and confusion – they may feel disgusted with themselves for having a <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy,</b> they may feel that enjoying fantasising about rape invalidates the trauma that they went through, they may question if they actually wanted to be raped and so on.

50|$|The story {{centers around}} its narrator, {{a woman named}} Estelle, {{discussing}} her feelings and <b>fantasies</b> on <b>rape.</b> She recounts a story about her lunch break with her co-workers, where they discuss their <b>fantasies</b> of <b>rape</b> over a card game. While her friends all have romanticized <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies,</b> Estelle breaks the trend by having humorous turns of events in her fantasies that help her thwart the rape attempt. In her stories she manages to escape rape in many ways, from having the rapist help her get lemon juice to squirt in his eyes, to helping the rapist {{get to the bottom}} of his emotional problems. Concerned that her <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> are abnormal, she continues to share more and more stories, none involving an actual rape.|$|R

50|$|The {{publisher}} {{has been}} criticised for {{books that are}} considered low-brow and formulaic, although this has also been cited {{as one of the}} reasons for their success.

2500|$|Romance novelist Jaid Black (pseudonym for Tina Engler) {{said that}} [...] "many of my female readers enjoy <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies,</b> key word being fantasies. They {{certainly}} wouldn't {{want it to}} happen in real life, but enjoy the escapism and total lack of control provided by 'forced seduction' scenes in erotic romance novels". According to one reader of romance, women readers are quite capable of separating fantasy from reality: [...] "In real life {{there is no such thing}} as forced seduction. When a woman says no in real life, that means no, because in real life, rape is about violence and power. Rape in real life involves no pleasure for the woman". Alison Kent, author of the Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Erotic Romance, says the theme is rare in modern romance novels; Linda Lee also cites scholarship to conclude that [...] "by the mid-1980s, the <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> was rejected". However, forced seduction has been used as a plot point in post-1980s romance novels.|$|R
40|$|This article {{critically}} examines rape {{scenes in}} two {{films of the}} new extreme cinema, Gaspar No 2 ̆ 7 s Irrversible (2002) and Catherine Breillat 2 ̆ 7 s A ma sur!/Fat Girl (2001). On the surface, No 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> disturbing long-take <b>rape</b> scene is clearly designed to foster empathy with the woman 2 ̆ 7 s experience and to induce a physical aversion to rape. However, a deeper examination of the scene 2 ̆ 7 s ambiguous techniques reveals that they actually work to split the viewer 2 ̆ 7 s identification between the rapist and the woman he attacks. One function of this split is to lead the viewer who is presumed to be male along an emotional path from lustful aggression towards empathic understanding. Similarly, the film also provides audiences with a transitional figure a male character who is almost raped as someone with whom they can identify on the way towards identifying with the female. But this male character ultimately serves as a negative example when he moves to take revenge an act which is shown to be {{an extension of the}} rape, part of the same masculinist ideology or myth of male inviolability perpetuated through the violation of others. Furthermore, the revenge is revealed as being the male character 2 ̆ 7 s denial of his own complicity in the rape and of his own participation in rape culture. The rape scene in Breillat 2 ̆ 7 s A ma sur! also induces in the viewer a split identification with the rapist and with the female subjected to attack in this case a young girl who disturbingly seems to acquiesce to the assault. This scene is best understood as a <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> that shows how the girl has internalized oppressive notions of femininity and female sexual response. In this fantasy, it is the girl 2 ̆ 7 s own subjectivity that is split between the attacker and herself as willing victim, between the man 2 ̆ 7 s sadism and her own feminine desire to be punished. The <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> could thus be seen as an acting out of the same old gender story in which the girl (or the viewer) is forced to make a choice between two polarized or untenable positions: identifying masochistically with the victim or identifying against herself with the sadistic rapist. However, this <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> could also be viewed as a working through of gender stereotypes. It is possible to see the split subject of the <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> not as someone who is torn between masculine sadism and feminine masochism, but instead as someone who simultaneously occupies both positions and therefore neither as someone who occupies an undefined and unconventional space beyond sadomasochism...|$|R
5000|$|Briana Lawrence {{was shocked}} by the manga, appreciating the {{brutality}} of the setting, highlighting that the rape scenes are not an unrealistic <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy.</b> [...] She found that the series was extremely condensed and hard-hitting all the time. [...] Melinda Beasi describes the manga as being intense, melodramatic and deeply unbelievable, and appreciates the masculine character designs. [...] Sandra Scholes feels that it is gritty and dark.|$|R
5000|$|Rhett and Scarlett's bedroom scene (Chapter 54) {{is often}} {{read as a}} rape {{that was meant to}} suggest Reconstruction fear of black-on-white rape in the South. Since the late 20th century, critics have {{suggested}} the book was built around <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies.</b> [...] In one interpretation of the scene, the [...] "dandified dangerous lover" [...] carries Scarlett up the stairs into her first encounter with the erotic. [...] In another interpretation, a marital rape occurs.|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{the term}} sexual {{minority}} is {{applied only to}} groups who practice consensual sex: for example, it would be unusual to refer to rapists as a sexual minority, but the term would generally include someone whose sexuality gave a major, fetishized role to consensual playing out of a <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy.</b> Also, someone who very occasionally incorporates of consensual kink or same-sex activity into a largely vanilla, heterosexual sex life would not usually {{be described as a}} sexual minority.|$|R
5000|$|One critic {{claimed that}} the genre {{promotes}} misogyny and the sexual submission of women to men. Julie Bindel writes [...] "I would {{go so far as}} to say it is misogynistic hate speech." [...] She describes a typical Mills & Boon novel as a <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> structured around [...] "the 'gender dance'—man chases woman, woman resists, and, finally, woman submits in a blaze of passion." [...] Bindel further condemns Mills & Boon for perpetuating misogynistic propaganda.|$|R
50|$|Deviant and sadistic {{sexual fantasies}} are {{believed}} to be the underlying risk factors for sexual crimes. 70-85% of sexual offenders extensively engage in deviant sexual fantasies, and certain themes can be attributed to types of sex crimes. For example, serial sexual murderers have more <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> than non-serial sexual murderers and 82% of offenders that use a weapon engage violent sexual fantasies. Offenders that report deviant sexual fantasies have also been found to be more dangerous than offenders that do not.|$|R
5000|$|Rape Scene is {{the third}} album by Thighpaulsandra. The album was {{recorded}} live in the studio, and is credited to [...] "Thighpaulsandra with Siôn Orgon and Martin Schellard".

2500|$|Lunsing {{suggests}} that younger Japanese gay {{men who are}} offended by [...] "pornographic" [...] content in gay men's magazines may prefer to read yaoi instead. Some gay men, however, are {{put off by the}} feminine art style or unrealistic depictions of LGBT culture in Japan and instead prefer gei comi, which some perceive to be more realistic. Lunsing notes that some of the yaoi narrative elements criticized by homosexual men, such as <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies,</b> misogyny, and characters' non-identification as gay, are also present in gei comi.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> is a theme {{commonly}} found in yaoi manga. Anal intercourse is understood {{as a means of}} expressing commitment to a partner, and in yaoi, the [...] "apparent violence" [...] of rape is transformed into a [...] "measure of passion". While Japanese society often shuns or looks down upon women who are raped in reality, the yaoi genre depicts men who are raped as still [...] "imbued with innocence" [...] and are typically still loved by their rapists after the act, a trope that may have originated with Kaze to Ki no Uta. Rape scenes in yaoi are rarely presented as crimes with an assaulter and a victim: scenes where a seme rapes an uke are not depicted as symptomatic of the [...] "disruptive sexual/violent desires" [...] of the seme, but instead are a signifier of the [...] "uncontrollable love" [...] felt by a seme for an uke. Such scenes are often a plot device used to make the uke see the seme as more than just a good friend and typically result in the uke falling in love with the seme. <b>Rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> themes explore the protagonist's lack of responsibility in sex, leading to the narrative climax of the story, where [...] "the protagonist takes responsibility for his own sexuality".|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} use of the <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> in Japanese male-male {{pornography}} through an analysis of Nitro+CHiRAL’s DRAMAtical Murder and DRAMAtical Murder: re:connect as case studies of the larger genre and cultural history. The thesis puts Western and Japanese scholars in conversation with one another to encourage more academic attention to the emerging fields of Boys Love (BL) and pornographic video gaming. The methodology relies on intersections between gaming, sexuality, and trauma studies to deconstruct the DRAMAtical Murder series’ embodiments of rape with critical consideration to both the victim and the perpetrator...|$|R
5000|$|Leroy Douresseaux, {{writing for}} Comic Book Bin, {{felt that the}} {{characters}} were underdeveloped, and that despite the characters' [...] "equally masculine" [...] depiction, that Black Sun was {{a good example of}} yaoi using the <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> device, finding that the sex scenes were so plentiful that they became [...] "tedious". [...] Danielle Van Gorder, writing for Mania Entertainment, felt that the writing was weak and that the romance between the characters amounted to Stockholm syndrome, but that the series' primary draw was its many [...] "graphic" [...] sex scenes and [...] " [...] gorgeous art".|$|R
5000|$|In <b>Rape</b> <b>Fantasy</b> and Terror Sex We Trust is {{the sixth}} {{full-length}} album by Joan of Arc, released in 2003 on Perishable Records. The songs {{were recorded in}} the same sessions as So Much Staying Alive and Lovelessness, and the album {{is thought to be}} something of a companion album to that record. The title track was created as an attempt by Tim Kinsella to capture the effect Bauhaus' The Sky's Gone Out had on him [...] "when he was 10yrs old and accidentally bought it before he was ready to hear it". This {{is one of the few}} Joan of Arc albums not to receive a vinyl release.|$|R
50|$|One form {{of sexual}} roleplaying is the <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy,</b> also called ravishment or forced sex roleplay. In BDSM circles (and {{occasionally}} outside these circles as well), some {{people choose to}} roleplay rape scenes—with communication, consent and safety being especially crucial elements. Though consent is a crucial component of any sexual roleplay, the illusion of non-consent (i.e. rape) is important to maintaining this type of fantasy. Due to this, the usage of a safeword is a necessary safety measure, given that words that would normally halt sexual activity (i.e. stop) are often disregarded in these scenes. Continuing with the sexual roleplay after a safeword has been used constitutes assault, {{as the use of}} a safeword indicates the withdrawal of consent.|$|R
5000|$|Selfish Love {{carries an}} 18+ age advisory. Kristy L. Valenti, writing for The Comics Journal, felt that <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> {{played a part}} in the unwillingness of Ryuya, and enjoyed the {{portrayal}} of [...] "fag hag" [...] Azusa. Mike Dungan found the [...] "near-rape" [...] of Ryuya confronting, [...] "killing any enjoyment" [...] Dungan had for the first volume. [...] He felt the manga improved with the character development of Orito, and that Ryuya's growing love for Orito made amends for the first volume's portrayal. He also enjoyed the character of Azusa, expressing a wish for a volume about her. [...] Janet Crocker, writing for Animefringe, noted the lack of explicit sex in the title.|$|R

50|$|She adds: Child's Play is {{loosely based}} around {{paedophilia}} and sexually deviant habits. It {{has a few}} harrowing scenes, but they're not there for shock value. They raise some interesting questions: what {{is the root of}} sexually deviant habits? Is it nature or nurture, and if it's nature, to what extent can we blame those who practice those habits? The book also examines the psyche behind female sexuality and discusses certain discomforting phenomena like <b>rape</b> <b>fantasies</b> for example. All of this is wrapped up in a good bonafide thriller that is genuinely absorbing so it's up to the reader how deeply they {{want to look at the}} underlying themes. In 2011 the Telegraph commented that her two controversial novels, Life Love and Assimilation and Child’s Play drew condemnation from the British Bangladeshi community.|$|R
5000|$|Studies {{have found}} <b>rape</b> <b>fantasy</b> {{is a common}} sexual fantasy among both men and women. The fantasy may involve the fantasist as either the one being forced into sex or being the perpetrator. A 1974 study by Hariton and Singer found that being [...] "overpowered or forced to surrender" [...] was the second most {{frequent}} fantasy in their survey; a 1984 study by Knafo and Jaffe ranked being overpowered as their study's most common fantasy during intercourse. In 1985, Louis H. Janda who {{is an associate professor}} of psychology at Old Dominion University said that the sexual <b>fantasy</b> of being <b>raped</b> is the most common sexual fantasy for women. A 1988 study by Pelletier and Herold found that over half of their female respondents had fantasies of forced sex.|$|R
