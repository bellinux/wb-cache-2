500|$|Copsey {{stated that}} [...] "Tyndall {{may have been}} a rousing speaker, but his {{tactical}} intelligence and vision left much to be desired". The East London BNP activist Eddy Butler noted that at a 1986 party rally in Dewsbury, Tyndall [...] "lost them completely. He knew how to talk to a small room of nationalists, but he didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to a thousand Yorkshire young geezers. He hadn't got a clue about normal people or normal politics. He'd go on about the Britain of Sir Francis Drake; you'd think 'what's he on about?'".|$|E

60|$|Sir Abraham said he {{had seen}} them. This poor little clergyman, cowed into such an act of extreme {{weakness}} by a newspaper article, was to Sir Abraham so contemptible an object, that he hardly <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him as to a rational being.|$|R
2500|$|Harpole {{adds that}} [...] "whereas many {{directors}} disliked rehearsals or advising actors on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> build their character, Lumet excelled at both." [...] He could thereby more easily give his performers a cinematic showcase for their abilities {{and help them}} deepen their acting contribution. Actor Christopher Reeve, who co-starred in Deathtrap, {{also pointed out that}} Lumet <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> technical language: [...] "If you want to work that way– he <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> Method, he <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> improvise, and he does it all equally well." ...|$|R
50|$|Eyre’s men serve a feast to the {{apprentices}} of London. Margery {{reports that}} the King is on his way. Lacy asks Eyre to beg his pardon of the King.

6000|$|... "That {{is telling}} me to go, I suppose?" [...] said, Fraser, looking at her frankly. [...] "I wish I <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you.

2500|$|The {{examples}} of embedding {{were limited to}} one level of depth, so that to say [...] "He really <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about making arrows", {{you would need to}} use more than one sentence.|$|R
2500|$|Outside {{her acting}} career, Gabor {{was known for}} her extravagant Hollywood lifestyle, her glamorous personality, and her many marriages. [...] In total, Gabor had nine husbands, {{including}} hotel magnate Conrad Hilton and actor George Sanders. She once stated, [...] "Men have always liked me and I have always liked men.

2500|$|He was a {{polarizing}} figure; many on {{the right}} wished to see him disbarred, while {{many on the}} left admired him as a [...] "symbol {{of a certain kind}} of radical lawyer." [...] Even some other civil rights lawyers regarded Kunstler as a [...] "publicity hound and a hit-and-run lawyer" [...] who [...] "brings cases on Page 1 and wins them on Page 68." [...] Legal writer Sidney Zion quipped that Kunstler was [...] "one of the few lawyers in town who <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the press.

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of HNP is to {{accommodate}} users who have connected the A and B devices (see below) {{in the wrong direction}} for the task they want to perform. For example, a printer is connected as the A-device (host), but cannot function as the host for a particular camera, since it does not understand the camera's representation of print jobs. When that camera <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the printer, the printer will use HNP to switch to the slave role, with the camera becoming the host so pictures stored on the camera can be printed out without reconnecting the cables. The new OTG protocols cannot pass through a standard USB hub since they are based on electrical signaling via a dedicated wire.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is not young," [...] {{reasoned}} Lady Montfort to herself, [...] "but {{his mind}} and manner are young, and that is everything. I am sure I meet youth every day who, compared with Lord Roehampton, could have no chance with my sex--men who can neither feel, nor think, nor converse. And then he is famous, and powerful, and fashionable, and <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> women. And this must all tell with a banker's daughter, dying, of course, to be a grande dame. It will do. He may not be young, but he is irresistible. And the father will like it, for he told me in confidence, at dinner, that he wished Lord Roehampton to be prime minister; and with this alliance he will be." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do you not? I know I do. I {{think that}} {{young men in}} society {{are bound to be}} agreeable, and that they should not be there if they do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> pleasantly, and to give {{something}} in return for all the trouble we take for them." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Steven Hassan, a {{licensed}} mental health counselor with experience on cults, [...] "Partly what's {{going on with}} the people on the Internet who are indoctrinated, they spend lots of hours on the computer. Videos can have them up all night for several nights in a row. Molyneux <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> like he <b>knows</b> what he's talking about, despite very little academic research. He cites this and cites that, and presents it as the whole truth. It dismantles people's sense of self and replaces it with his sense of confidence about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> fix the world." ...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the support}} of both Congressional Democrats and Republicans, Gioia gained a $20.1 million {{increase}} in his agency's budget and {{for the remainder of}} his tenure, silenced the perpetual requests from conservatives to defund the agency.

He <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Congress and to the arts community, and to state and federal agencies and to the complex, gigantic, fire-breathing beast called the White House," [...] said David Gelernter of Yale University. Bill Kauffman called Gioia [...] "the best poet in government service since President Tyler sent John Howard Payne, who wrote 'Home! Sweet Home!' to Tunis." [...] In November 2006, Business Week magazine profiled Gioia as [...] "The Man Who Saved the NEA". Five years after Gioia left office, The Washington Post referred to him as one of [...] "two of the NEA's strongest leaders".|$|R

500|$|In 2002, George Roca {{produced}} and directed a concert {{film about the}} band titled Nobody <b>Knows</b> <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> Children.

Its 2004 release was suppressed by the band's management, however, after they discovered that Roca had been showing it at the Seattle Film Festival without permission. According to the band, the film was [...] "not up to the standards our fans have come to expect"; even so, it remains a highly prized bootleg.|$|R

50|$|Her white face, beautiful, unmarked by any flaw of skin or feature, stared blankly back at him. He fancied {{that she}} had cringed, her slim body {{pressing}} further into the wall behind her.

Then, when it was all over, he straightened her against the wall so that she would be ready to die for him again. It was the best thing in his life, just knowing she was there, waiting until the next time... But one day she wasn't there waiting...|$|R
