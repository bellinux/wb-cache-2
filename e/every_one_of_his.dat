5|$|Donald Fagen of Steely Dan has {{favored the}} sound of the Rhodes over the Wurlitzer Electric Piano, because he felt it was a {{technically}} superior instrument. Steely Dan has featured the Rhodes in almost all of their albums after 1975, and Fagen has also used the Rhodes in all of his solo albums and continues to play it at <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> touring performances since 1994.|$|E

Statistically, Raonic is among the strongest servers in the Open Era, winning 91% of service games to rank third all-time. Aided by his serve, he plays an all-court style with an emphasis on short points. <b>Every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> singles titles has been won on hard courts.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{fell ill}} again in September 1863. From September 27 through March 1864, he {{suffered}} recurring attacks of fever and chills every three days, symptomatic of tertian malaria. Despite his illness, Ross {{never missed a}} day of duty, and in early 1864 {{he was promoted to}} brigadier general, becoming the ninth-youngest general officer of the Confederate Army. Following his promotion, unit morale improved, and <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men re-enlisted.|$|E

25|$|Jackson's eldest son, Billy (born 1995), {{has made}} cameo {{appearances}} in almost <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's films since his birth, namely The Frighteners, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, King Kong, The Lovely Bones, {{and the third}} film of The Hobbit trilogy. His daughter, Katie (born 1996), appears in all the above films except The Frighteners. Walsh makes a short cameo in The Frighteners as a woman walking next to Cyrus and Stuar just prior the scene featuring their son Billy.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with his}} first book Tergiversaciones in 1925, <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{published}} books of poetry that was directed by him were named in order as mamotretos, which in Spanish loosely refers to a bulky jumbled collection of writings that could be loosely interpreted as a tome. The name was both an example of de Greiff's masterful use of language and his humbleness towards his work and himself. His eighth and last mamotreto would be Nova et Vetera, published a year before his death, and was a collection of new and old found poems of his from even before Panida.|$|E
25|$|Brunswick sent 5,723 {{troops to}} North America, of whom 3,015 {{did not return}} home {{in the autumn of}} 1783. Some losses were to death or desertion, but many Brunswickers became {{familiar}} with America during their time with the Convention Army, and when the war ended, they were granted permission to stay by both Congress and their officers. Many had taken the opportunity to desert as the Convention Army was twice marched through Pennsylvania German settlements in eastern Pennsylvania. As the Duke of Brunswick received compensation from the British for <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soldiers killed in America, it was in his best interest to report the deserters as dead, whenever possible. The Duke even offered six months' pay to soldiers who remained or returned to America.|$|E

25|$|Lester was a {{right-handed}} batsman {{used for}} many years by Leicestershire as an opening batsman and a right-arm leg-break and googly bowler who amassed more than 300 rather expensive first-class wickets despite rarely {{being used as a}} front-line bowler. <b>Every</b> single <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 373 first-class matches between 1937 and 1958 was played for Leicestershire.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, he was shot, which {{affected}} his control of his right-hand. His temporary fix to this possibly long-term problem was to work together with Cristina during <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> surgeries so that she could take over in case he might have trouble with his hand. The arrangement fell apart after Cristina, reacting to growing stress after George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) caught onto their secret, went to the Chief and confessed everything. Initially, he was engaged in a cold war with Cristina, where neither of them spoke. However, after she broke the silence, he proposed to her and she accepted his proposal. Before their secret was revealed, Burke was to become the next Chief of Surgery, but he had to compete with his fellow attendings for the position. He has since recovered from the injury, after Derek operated on him. For the remainder of the season, Preston and Cristina prepared for the wedding and experienced normal stresses that result from such a process, such as meeting each other's parents.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{performed}} [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] at <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{relatively few}} solo concerts, {{starting with the}} two Concert for Bangladesh shows at New York's Madison Square Garden on 1 August 1971. The recording released on the subsequent live album {{was taken from the}} evening show and begins with Harrison's spoken [...] "Hare Krishna" [...] over his opening acoustic-guitar chords. Among the 24 backing musicians was a [...] "Soul Choir" [...] featuring singers Claudia Linnear, Dolores Hall and Jo Green, but it was Harrison who sung the end-of-song Guru Stotram prayer in his role as lead vocalist, unlike on the studio recording (where it was sung by the backing chorus); the slide guitar parts were played by Eric Clapton and Jesse Ed Davis.|$|E
500|$|Kettner's Book of the Table of 1877, {{describing}} Francatelli as [...] "a type of all {{the great}} French cooks", asserted that he [...] "gives a most elaborate recipe for aspic jelly; and he is so satisfied with it that, having to prepare a cold supper for 300 people, he works it up in <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 56 dishes which are neither sweet nor hot. The book further argues that [...] "this {{is the result of}} science—this the height of art. It produces, with such elaborate forms and majestic ceremonies, an aspic jelly without aspic, that, exhausted in the effort, it can proceed no further, and seems to think that here at last, in this supreme sauce, we have a sure resting-place—the true blessedness—the ewigkeit." ...|$|E
5000|$|TVLine named Monaghan the [...] "Performer of the Week" [...] for {{the week}} of February 4, 2017, for his {{performance}} in this episode.

500|$|... {{offers a}} {{different}} theory: The Acra {{was still standing}} in 139BCE when AntiochusVII Sidetes demanded it back from Simon, along with Jaffa and Gezer, two Hellenized cities Simon had captured. Simon was willing to discuss the two cities but {{made no mention of}} the Acra. It was at this point that he must have sealed its fate, as a way to deny the Seleucids any future claim or hold on Jerusalem. Thus, when AntiochusVII subdued the city during Hyrcanus I's reign, each and <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> demands were met—except the one demanding the stationing of a Seleucid garrison in the city. Hyrcanus may have been able to reject, and Antiochus to drop, this demand because there was nowhere to billet the garrison, as the Acra would no longer have been standing. This explanation places the razing of the Acra somewhere in the 130sBCE.|$|E
500|$|Actor Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode as Brad Goodman. It was Brooks' third {{appearance}} on the show after playing Jacques in [...] "Life on the Fast Lane" [...] and Cowboy Bob in [...] "The Call of the Simpsons". He would later guest star as Hank Scorpio in [...] "You Only Move Twice", Tab Spangler in [...] "The Heartbroke Kid", and Russ Cargill in The Simpsons Movie. Executive producer David Mirkin describes Brooks as [...] "really weird to direct" [...] because [...] "almost <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> takes is flawless, but each one has different material. He makes up the stuff as he goes." [...] He uses {{a combination of the}} jokes in the script and his own material and because many of his takes are different, it is difficult for the producers to decide which lines to use. Goodman was based on the American self-help author John Bradshaw, who popularized such psychological ideas as the [...] "wounded inner child" [...] and the dysfunctional family.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} watched by over 900,000 people in total; the MCC took home a larger profit than on any {{previous}} tour. Allen was treated sympathetically by press and public. The Wisden {{review of the}} tour suggested: [...] "It would be churlish to criticise Allen's captaincy. During the first two Tests, almost <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> moves succeeded instantly... No doubt, Allen had studied his opponents carefully and knew their weaknesses, and if his tactics were not always dictated by accepted principles they certainly proved very successful. Those who attributed {{so much of the}} England captain's success to good luck were inclined to overlook the many stratagems exploited by him". In the Test series, he scored 150 runs at 18.75 and took 17 wickets at 30.94. During the tour, Allen struck up a friendship with Bradman and encouraged his team to fraternise with the Australian team. He clashed over tactics with one of his team, Joe Hardstaff; the pair never got along thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|Emilita's friend {{reported}} her missing. The police became suspicious {{when they}} found out Reeves had two dead wives.

500|$|Most of Hoffman's notable roles came in {{independent}} films, including particularly original ones, {{but he also}} featured in several Hollywood blockbusters. He generally played supporting roles, appearing in both dramas and comedies, but was noted {{for his ability to}} make small parts memorable. Peter Bradshaw, film critic for The Guardian, felt that [...] "Almost <b>every</b> single <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> credits had something special about it".|$|R
500|$|During this tour, Bryan spoke almost {{exclusively}} on the silver question, and attempted to mold the speeches to reflect local issues and interests. [...] He did not campaign on Sundays, but on most other days spoke between 20 and 30 times. [...] Crowds assembled hours or days ahead of Bryan's arrival. [...] The train bearing The Idler pulled in after a short journey from the last stop, and after he was greeted by local dignitaries, Bryan would give a brief speech addressing silver {{and the need for}} the people to retake the government. [...] The shortness of the speech did not dismay the crowds, who knew his arguments well: they were there to see and hear William Jennings Bryan—one listener told him that he had read <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> speeches, and had ridden [...] to hear him, [...] "And, by gum, if I wasn't a Republican, I'd vote for you." [...] After a brief interval for handshakes, the train would pull out again, to another town down the track.|$|E
500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's {{going to get his}} ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's going to change the image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry. I'm {{going to make sure that}} <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teeth are broken, that his arms are broken and his legs are broken. He's not going to be able to walk out of the Octagon by himself. I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards. And I know that he’s listening, so the game’s over. No more shit talking. It’s on now." [...] This caught some by surprise, who perceived his remarks as out of character.|$|E
500|$|The reviews {{were not}} uniformly negative. Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle {{wrote that the}} film [...] "effectively presented" [...] the [...] "wary, uncomprehending relationship" [...] between the humans and the Psychlos. A review at JoBlo's Movie Reviews was also positive; Berge Garabedian wrote, [...] "Despite {{starting}} off like a bad Star Trek episode, this film eventually graduates {{to a higher level}} with great special effects, some really slick bad-ass aliens, an intriguing premise, and a good flow of loud, campy fun." [...] Luke Thompson of New Times LA wrote: [...] "Think Independence Day without the ponderous build-up or self-importance. Imagine how much more enjoyable the other blockbuster-of-the-moment, Gladiator, might have been if Joaquin Phoenix had addressed <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rivals as 'Rat brain.'" [...] Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote positively of the interaction between Travolta and Whitaker in the film, comparing them to Abbott and Costello. Axmaker wrote that they provide [...] "…much-needed comic relief in an otherwise humorless paean to freedom." [...] Axmaker also wrote positively of the production design used in the film, commenting that the director had created [...] "a world of crumbling dead cities and empty malls turned into human hunting grounds…" [...] Hap Erstein of The Palm Beach Post commented: [...] "…production designer Patrick Tatopoulos contributes some good work, imagining the ruins of Denver and Washington, D.C., with echoes of Planet of the Apes." [...] In her book I Love Geeks: The Official Handbook, Carrie Tucker lists Battlefield Earth as a cult classic in the [...] "so bad, it's good" [...] genre.|$|E
5000|$|Karmen {{was born}} in the Bronx, New York. Steve was unique among jingle writers. Unlike other composers, who were paid a flat price for their jingles, Steve was the only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> peers to receive {{royalties}} <b>every</b> time <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jingles was performed on TV or Radio. His informal industry title [...] "The King of Jingles" [...] may have been given to him because of this extraordinary business ability to retain publishing rights.|$|R
