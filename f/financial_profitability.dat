Studien tar även hänsyn till branschspecifika faktorer, vilket tidigare forskning saknat. För att besvara studiens syfte har en kvantitativ forskningsmetod använts. Den teoretiska referensramen består av institutionell teori, legitimitetsteori och intressentteori, vilket hypoteserna formulerats utifrån. Studien analyserar hur omfattningen på hållbarhetsredovisningar år 2013 påverkat företagens finansiella lönsamhet år 2014. Företagens finansiella lönsamhet mäts med nyckeltalen ROE och ROA. Studien använde sig utav en regressionsanalys, där de oberoende variablerna var företagens bransch, företagens ålder, balanslikviditet, omsättning samt CSR antal ord. Det empiriska resultatet påvisade att det inte förekom något samband gällande hållbarhetsredovisningens påverkan på företagens finansiella lönsamhet. Studien visade heller inget samband gällande företagens bransch och dess påverkan på företagens finansiella lönsamhet. Studiens frågeställning besvaras således med att det inte finns något samband gällande hållbarhetsredovisningens påverkan på företagens finansiella lönsamhet. Slutsatsen stöds även av studiens kontrollvariabler, företagens ålder, balanslikviditet samt omsättning. Resultatet talar för att vid en regressionsanalys av ROE och ROA skall ingen av de valda variablerna inkluderas i modellen. Resultat skall tolkas med försiktighet.
