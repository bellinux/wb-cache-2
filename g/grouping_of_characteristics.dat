40|$|ABSTRACT—Molecular {{biologists}} often {{search for}} the important information from the databases in different directions of different uses Pattern Matching an automated data analysis technique, usually performed on a computer, by which a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristic</b> properties <b>of</b> an unknown object is compared with the comparable <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> a set of known objects, to discover the identity or proper classification of the unknown object. The sequence pattern match algorithm proposed in this paper searches for matches between patterns. With the increasing need for instant information, pattern matching {{will continue to grow}} and change as needed from time to time. To extract pattern from a large sequence it takes more time, in order to reduce searching time an approach is proposed that reduces the search time with accurate retrieval of the matched pattern from the given sequence of any size, the greedy method is used here to perform the pattern matching...|$|R
