5|$|Abebe {{was invited}} to the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich as a special guest, and {{received}} a standing ovation during the opening ceremony. His countryman Mamo Wolde did not match his back-to-back Olympic marathon victories, finishing third behind Frank Shorter of the United States and Karel Lismont of Belgium. After Shorter received his gold medal, <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> Abebe's hand.|$|E
5|$|The Madison Square Garden {{audience}} {{reacted with}} wild applause and demonstrations {{for half an}} hour. On the final night, Kennedy arrived late after Carter's acceptance speech and while <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> Carter's hand, he failed to raise Carter's arm in the traditional show of party unity. Carter's difficulty in securing the assistance of Kennedy supporters during the election campaign contributed to his November defeat by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} match saw Irwin R. Schyster face Mabel. When Schyster charged at Mabel {{before the}} bell, Mabel used his strength to block Schyster and to then powerslam him. Schyster {{was not able}} to use much offense due to the size of his opponent. He scored the win, however, when <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> the ropes as Mabel was about to attempt a maneuver from the top rope. Mabel fell to the mat, allowing I.R.S. to pin him.|$|E

5|$|Reagan {{was sworn}} in as {{president}} for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the White House. At 73 years of age, he was the oldest person to ever have been sworn into a second term. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the Capitol rotunda the following day. January 21 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the coming weeks <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> up his staff somewhat, moving White House Chief of Staff James Baker to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, a former Merrill Lynch officer, Chief of Staff.|$|E
5|$|They found {{albatross}} chicks {{and seals}} to eat, {{but despite the}} relative comfort of the island compared to the small boat, they still urgently needed to reach the whaling station at Husvik {{on the other side}} of the island to fetch help for the men on Elephant Island. It was clear that McNish and Vincent could not continue, so Shackleton left them in the care of Timothy McCarthy camped in the upturned James Caird, and with Worsley and Crean made the hazardous trip over the mountains. McNish took screws from the James Caird and attached them to the boots of the men making the journey to help them grip the ice. He also fashioned a crude sledge from driftwood he found on the beach, but it proved too clumsy to be practical. When Shackleton's party set off on 18 May 1916, McNish accompanied them for a few hundred yards but he was unable to go any further. <b>He</b> <b>shook</b> hands with each of the men, wished them good luck and then Shackleton sent him back. Putting McNish in command of the remaining men, Shackleton charged him to wait for relief and if none had come by the end of winter to attempt to sail to the east coast. Once Shackleton's party had crossed the mountains and arrived in Husvik, he sent Worsley with one of the whaler's ships, Samson, to pick up McNish and the other men. After seeing the emaciated and drawn McNish on his arrival at the whaling station, Shackleton recorded that he felt that the rescue had come just in time for him.|$|E

25|$|On 8 April 2005, the {{alphabetic}} ordering of leaders during {{the funeral of}} Pope John Paul II resulted in Katsav sitting near Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who, like Katsav, {{was born in the}} Iranian province of Yazd. Katsav told the press that <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> Khatami's hand and spoke to him in Persian. Khatami later denied this.|$|E
25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> his head in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E

25|$|The Spurs' {{first round}} playoff {{series with the}} Mavs was a {{breakout}} series for Hill. He was ineffective in Game 1, scoring 0 points in 17 minutes after coming back from an ankle injury. <b>He</b> <b>shook</b> off his tentativeness {{in the next few}} games, scoring 7 and 17 points in Games 2 and 3. Then, Hill led the Spurs to a Game 4 victory on a night when the Spurs' Big Three of Duncan, Parker, and Ginobili shot a combined 9-of-34 from the field. Hill scored a career playoff high 29 points, shooting 11-16 from the field and 5-6 from downtown. Hill averaged 22.3 points in the series, helping the Spurs to win the series in six games.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, 1860, Melville {{boarded the}} clipper Meteor for California, {{with his brother}} Thomas at the helm. After a shaky trip around Cape Horn Melville {{returned}} alone to New York via Panama in November. Turning to poetry, he submitted a collection of verse to a publisher in 1860, {{but it was not}} accepted. In 1861 <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> hands with Abraham Lincoln. In 1862, Melville met with a road accident which left him seriously injured. He also suffered from rheumatism. In 1863 he bought his brother Allan's house at 104 East 26th Street in New York City and moved there. Allan for his part bought Arrowhead. On March 30 his father-in-law died.|$|E
25|$|The Russian plans {{included}} {{not only}} incorporation of Ukraine, but also {{recovery of the}} lands lost by Russia further north. The Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate, worried by the new configuration, were now inclined to support the Commonwealth. With the Tatars the Polish units waged a destructive raid into Ukraine and fought in early 1655 the victorious Battle of Okhmativ against combined Russian and Ukrainian forces. Later that year Khmelnytsky counterattacked, took Lublin and reached the Vistula, but was forced to acknowledge John Casimir's supremacy again when his efforts were thwarted by the Tatars. Until his death in 1657 the Cossack leader, despite the Pereyaslav treaty, conducted independent policy, intent on {{taking advantage of the}} calamities that had befallen upon the Commonwealth, but also considered an improvement of the relationship with the great power that <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> up ("fatally wounded", according to historian Timothy Snyder).|$|E

500|$|Lee {{was also}} arrested but was {{released}} without charge {{after two days}} when the investigation cleared him of any involvement in Lody's espionage. He complained about his treatment and the British authorities' refusal to let him see an American consul, and promised to take the matter up with the US State Department on his return. An [...] officer named R.H. Price smoothed things over with him on his release on 4 October, explaining what had prompted his arrest and paying his fare back to his hotel. Price reported, [...] "I think he was quite soothed and <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> hands with me on parting." [...] Lee was unaware {{that the police had}} already recommended that both he and [...] "Inglis" [...] should be court-martialled and shot if found guilty.|$|E
500|$|Everyone who was {{fortunate}} enough to be in the audience agreed that it was the musical event of their lives, and after the performance of the last number there was an ovation to the composer which I have never seen equalled anywhere, the entire audience rose to their feet and shouted with enthusiasm, and probably the calmest man in the whole hall was the composer himself; he bowed repeatedly with that distinction of manner which was so typical of him... As calm as Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome. Some people declared that he wept. Personally I do not think that he did, but there were tears in his eyes as <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> our hands and thanked us for what he was pleased to call the [...] "honor we had done him".|$|E
500|$|On 27 March 1918, again near Tul Karem, Drummond {{and another}} pilot {{scrambled}} {{to attack a}} German scout. As his wingman dealt with the intruder, Drummond, flying a Nieuport, single-handedly engaged six other German aircraft that had suddenly appeared. After he had destroyed one and [...] "sent another down in a spin", Drummond developed engine trouble and had to land behind enemy lines. Finding his engine firing again, he took off before he could be captured by Turkish troops and gained a start over the four still-circling German scouts, [...] "who had also concluded that the fight was over". Drummond was forced to land three more times in enemy territory—once in a cavalry camp where he [...] "carried away a line full of washing" [...] with his undercarriage in his escape—before <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> off {{all but one of}} the pursuing fighters and landed safely behind Allied lines. He was awarded a Bar to his DSO for his [...] "gallant and successful" [...] actions.|$|E

500|$|While {{serving as}} museum chair, Marcus was once called upon by Fred Florence, then {{chairman}} of a major local bank and a fellow Temple Emanu-El leader, to explain his inclusion of [...] "a lot of Communist art" [...] he'd been told would be included in an upcoming DMFA [...] "Sports in Art" [...] exhibit, co-sponsored by Sports Illustrated and United States Information Agency as a fund-raiser for the 1956 Olympic team. Artists represented in the show included four supposed Communist supporters, Leon Kroll, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Ben Shahn, and William Zorach. Asking Florence to indicate which pieces were being questioned, Marcus dismissed each claim one by one: [...] "I don't know how anybody could think hitting a baseball was communist," [...] Marcus said when shown Shahn's [...] "The National Pastime." [...] His response to Zorach's [...] "Fisherman" [...] was similar, as <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> his head and remarked, [...] "I don't think too many people think fishing is communist either." [...] Marcus followed up by going to local newspapers The Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times-Herald and getting the publishers of both to agree {{that they would not}} stand for censorship in the arts.|$|E
500|$|The episode created {{speculation}} {{about whether or}} not Mulder was actually dead. An article in the Wall Street Journal discussed fan theories behind Mulder's madness while a cartoon ran in The New Yorker a few weeks later surrounding Mulder's [...] "death". [...] Series creator Chris Carter noted that [...] "the whole plot line of 'Gethsemane' revolved around a hoax, but there are actually huge revelations in this show. And it's an amazing thing that we could get people to believe that Mulder could actually kill himself because his belief system was stolen from him". UGO Networks listed the episode at number 21 in a countdown of [...] "TV's Best Season Finales", noting that it [...] "rocked the core of the series' entire mythology". Den of Geek's John Moore felt that the episode was [...] "one of the finest season-enders" [...] of the series, noting that it [...] "ended by completely pulling the carpet out from under the fans". Moore listed the character of Michael Kritschgau as the seventh-best villain of the series, adding that <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> [...] "what we knew about the show to its core" [...] by [...] "provid nourishment to a seed of doubt that had been playing on Mulder's mind for the entire season".|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} George's health was deteriorating. He had a mental illness, characterised by acute mania, which was {{possibly}} {{a symptom of}} the genetic disease porphyria, although this has been questioned. A study of samples of the King's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a possible trigger for the disease. The source of the arsenic is not known, {{but it could have been}} a component of medicines or cosmetics. The King may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. At the end of the parliamentary session, he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate. It was the furthest he had ever been from London—just short of 100miles (150km)—but his condition worsened. In November he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, causing him to foam at the mouth and making his voice hoarse. His doctors were largely at a loss to explain his illness, and spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia. Treatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards, and the King's doctors, who included Francis Willis, treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm, or applying caustic poultices to draw out [...] "evil humours".|$|E
