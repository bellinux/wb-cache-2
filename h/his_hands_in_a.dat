This {{represented}} the third fight between them, with Pinto being victorious in their two previous encounters, {{both of which}} took place {{while they were still}} amateurs. The fight was televised by HBO from San Juan, Puerto Rico. During this card Cotto utilized a defensive stance with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> high position instead of his usual aggressive orthodox stance. Over the course of the fight Cotto scored three knockdowns and won the World Boxing Organization Junior Welterweight Championship by knockout in the sixth round.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, Stephen Strange, an {{acclaimed}} but arrogant neurosurgeon, badly injures <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car accident, {{leaving him}} unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer {{tries to help}} him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange eventually learns of Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained full use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She eventually agrees to train Strange, despite his arrogance, which reminds her of Kaecilius.|$|E

25|$|Major Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, {{claimed in}} his memoirs to have {{discovered}} bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly {{running out of the}} basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before. Ripper author Martin Fido thought it unlikely that the culprit would wait to wash <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semi-public place about forty minutes after the crime, and Smith's memoirs are both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect. There is no mention of the sink in the official police reports.|$|E
500|$|According to an {{interview}} with Bernard's trainer Bouie Fisher, prior to the fight members of Hopkins' team visited the Trinidad dressing room in what is considered a normal boxing custom to watch the taping of Trinidad's hands before his gloves were placed on. The Hopkins camp claimed that Trinidad's hands were wrapped in an incorrect fashion, and threatened to cancel the fight unless they were wrapped correctly. Fisher also stated that the Chief Inspector of the NYSAC insisted to Trinidad's camp {{that they needed to}} re-wrap <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> correct fashion. [...] Additionally, according to the New York State Athletic Commission, Layering [...] (which is layers of gauze, then layers of tape, then more gauze and tape) is illegal.|$|E

2500|$|Just {{before the}} battle, Red Cloud {{called for the}} Lakotas' most {{powerful}} [...] "half-man," [...] a hermaphrodite who was believed to have special powers, to give advice from the butte overlooking the proposed ambush site. The half-man rode on his pony in a crazed manner four times between the braves gathered on the butte and Lodge Trail Ridge, each time gathering more [...] "soldiers" [...] into <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prophetic manner. When he returned to Red Cloud the fourth time, he declared that in his vision he had a hundred blue-coat soldiers in each hand — too many to hold. The Lakota saw this as the good medicine that won the battle and thereafter called it the [...] "Battle of the Hundred-in-the-Hands." [...] A total of eighty-one American soldiers and civilians died in the battle.|$|E
