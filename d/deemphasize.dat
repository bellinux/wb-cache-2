5|$|Gudovac {{had been}} part of a common South Slav state since November 1918, when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was proclaimed. At its creation, the Kingdom {{included}} six million Serbs, 3.5 million Croats and one million Slovenes, among others. Being the largest ethnic group, the Serbs favoured a centralized state; Croats, Slovenes and Bosnian Muslims did not. The Vidovdan Constitution, approved on 28 June 1921 and based on the Serbian constitution of 1903, established the Kingdom as a parliamentary monarchy under the Serbian Karađorđević dynasty. Belgrade was chosen as the capital of the new state, assuring Serb and Orthodox Christian political dominance. In 1928, Croatian Peasant Party (Hrvatska seljačka stranka, HSS) leader Stjepan Radić was shot and mortally wounded {{on the floor of the}} country's parliament by a Serb deputy. The following year, King Alexander proclaimed the 6 January Dictatorship and renamed his country Yugoslavia to <b>deemphasize</b> its ethnic makeup. Yugoslavia was divided into nine administrative units called banates (banovine), six of which had ethnic Serb majorities. In 1931, Alexander issued a decree allowing the Yugoslav Parliament to reconvene on the condition that only pro-Yugoslav parties were allowed to be represented in it. Marginalized, far-right and far-left parties thrived. The Ustaše, a Croatian fascist movement, emerged as the most extreme of these. The movement was driven by a deep hatred of Serbs. In 1932, the Ustaše launched the so-called Velebit uprising, attacking a police station in Lika. The police responded harshly to the attack and harassed the local population, leading to further animosity between Croats and Serbs. In 1934, an Ustaše-trained assassin killed Alexander while he was on a state visit to France. Alexander's cousin, Prince Paul, became regent and took up the king's responsibilities until Alexander's son Peter turned 18.|$|E

500|$|Slade and Kolderie {{suggested}} that the band <b>deemphasize</b> the roots rock influences heard on Not Forever, Just for Now and convinced them to replace the harmonica parts with pedal steel guitar. For this, Slade and Kolderie recruited guitarist Rich Gilbert of Human Sexual Response for the recording. The tracks were recorded using little overdubbing; only a few banjo and acoustic guitar parts were later added to the songs. At the suggestion of Slade and Kolderie, No Depression was recorded on eight-track, so [...] "the music would compress and [...] "jump" [...] off the tape during playback". The recording sessions occurred before Uncle Tupelo officially became affiliated with Giant Records, so there was little input from the label.|$|E

These processes seldom occur in self-help groups, though they frequently occur in professionally directed groups.|$|R
500|$|In 1910, {{the first}} vitamin complex was {{isolated}} by Japanese scientist Umetaro Suzuki, who succeeded in extracting a water-soluble complex of micronutrients from rice bran and named it aberic acid (later Orizanin). He published this discovery in a Japanese scientific journal. When {{the article was}} translated into German, the translation failed to state {{that it was a}} newly discovered nutrient, a claim made in the original Japanese article, and hence his discovery failed to gain publicity. In 1912 Polish-born biochemist Casimir Funk, working in London, isolated the same complex of micronutrients and proposed the complex be named [...] "vitamine". It was later to be known as vitamin B3 (niacin), though he described it as [...] "anti-beri-beri-factor" [...] (which would today be called thiamine or vitamin B1). Funk proposed the hypothesis that other diseases, such as rickets, pellagra, coeliac disease, and scurvy could also be cured by vitamins. Max Nierenstein a friend and reader of Biochemistry at Bristol University reportedly suggested the [...] "vitamine" [...] name (from [...] "vital amine").). The name soon became synonymous with Hopkins' [...] "accessory factors", and, {{by the time it was}} shown that not all vitamins are amines, the word was already ubiquitous. In 1920, Jack Cecil Drummond proposed that the final [...] "e" [...] be dropped to <b>deemphasize</b> the [...] "amine" [...] reference, after researchers began to suspect that not all [...] "vitamines" [...] (in particular, vitamin A) have an amine component.|$|E

Many {{of the songs}} in the book are hymns that use words, meters, and stanzaic forms familiar from elsewhere in Protestant hymnody. However, Sacred Harp songs are quite different from [...] "mainstream" [...] Protestant hymns in their musical style: some tunes, known as fuguing tunes, contain sections that are polyphonic in texture, and the harmony tends to <b>deemphasize</b> the interval of the third in favor of fourths and fifths. In their melodies, the songs often use the pentatonic scale or similar [...] "gapped" [...] (fewer than seven-note) scales.|$|E
2500|$|Style guides codify {{rules to}} {{minimize}} inconsistency, {{the ultimate goal}} of which is to have the style unnoticed by the reader (that is, to avoid catching the reader's eye, either with trivial differences or with a lot of superfluous hyphens). The style guide rules allow exceptions to avoid awkwardness. For example, a guide will typically say to follow dictionary X's style for any word entered therein, and for words not entered, to close up by default and thus hyphenate only to avoid awkwardness. Such a rule successfully codifies almost all choices and thus leaves little to discretion except a few rare or neologistic words, which are safely hyphenated. This ensures high intradocument and interdocument consistency. Rules about avoiding doubled vowels or doubled consonants are often mentioned in style guides. These appropriately cascade only downstream, not upstream, of the [...] "follow dictionary X" [...] rule, because most dictionaries close up many well-established doubled-letter pairs. (For example, any style that follows Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary thus closes up preempt, reexamine, <b>deemphasize,</b> nonnegotiable, posttransfusion, and hundreds of others.) As mentioned earlier, the definition of [...] "awkwardness" [...] for any given word is inherently subjective but nonetheless also subject to consensus. For example, reexamine and <b>deemphasize</b> are accepted as nonawkward by a broad consensus; to prefer the hyphenated styling is a matter of opinion, but to insist that the solid styling is awkward would be considered pedantic by many educated readers. However, some doublings attract smaller majorities than others in such a consensus; with the /coworker example (mentioned earlier) or with antiinflammatory/, many readers may consider solid styling nonawkward whereas plenty of others don't, and in such cases, dictionary styles may vary (Dorland's, antiinflammatory; Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary, [...] ). Tripled letters rarely occur, but when they do, the hyphen is considered mandatory (thus , not shelllike).|$|E
2500|$|The Bristol {{sessions}} of 1927 are {{often called the}} [...] "Big Bang of Country Music," [...] as many music historians consider them {{the beginning of the}} country music genre. [...] The popularity of such musicians as the Carter Family, who first recorded at the sessions, proved to industry executives that there was a market for [...] "mountain" [...] or [...] "hillbilly" [...] music. [...] Early recorded country music (i.e., late 1920s and early 1930s) typically consisted of fiddle and banjo players and a predominant string band format, reflecting its Appalachian roots. [...] Due {{in large part to the}} success of the Grand Ole Opry, the center of country music had shifted to Nashville by 1940. [...] In subsequent decades, as the country music industry tried to move into the mainstream, musicians and industry executives sought to <b>deemphasize</b> the genre's Appalachian connections, most notably by dropping the term [...] "hillbilly music" [...] in favor of [...] "country." [...] In the late 1980s, artists such as Dolly Parton, Ricky Skaggs, and Dwight Yoakam helped to bring traditional Appalachian influences back to country music.|$|E

2500|$|The 1949 Communist {{revolution}} in China saw the Communist Chinese recognition of Mongolian independence, and promised {{a new era}} of communist fraternity between the Chinese, Mongolian, and Soviet governments. In the same year, Soviet diplomat Anastas Mikoyan visited the Chinese Communist headquarters in Xibaipo to negotiate a new Sino-Soviet treaty. Chinese leader Mao Zedong inquired {{about the possibility of a}} Greater Mongolia under Chinese control; Soviet premier Joseph Stalin replied, through Mikoyan, that since Outer Mongolia would never voluntarily give up its independence, the only way a Greater Mongolia would come about would be through the loss of Chinese territory. Mao subsequently abandoned any hope of a Chinese-led Greater Mongolia. China and the Soviet Union applied different ethnic policies to their Mongol minorities. While Russia encouraged local identities - Buryat instead of Buryat-Mongol, and Kalmyk instead of Kalmyk-Mongol, China encouraged its Mongols to <b>deemphasize</b> their tribal and local identities and to identify simply as [...] "Mongol". The Mongolian communist government promoted the idea that all Mongols should be assimilated to the Khalkha subgroup, rejecting the idea of an inclusive Greater Mongolia state as disloyal to Mongolia.|$|E
2500|$|Étienne Gilson (1884–1978), the key {{proponent of}} this {{approach}} to Thomism, tended to {{emphasize the importance of}} historical exegesis but also to <b>deemphasize</b> Aquinas's continuity with the Aristotelian tradition, and like Cornelio Fabro of the Neo-scholastic school, to highlight the originality of Aquinas's doctrine of being as existence. He was also critical of the Neo-Scholastics' focus on the tradition of the commentators, and given what he regarded as their insufficient emphasis on being or existence accused them of [...] "essentialism" [...] (to allude to the other half of Aquinas's distinction between being and essence). Gilson's reading of Aquinas as putting forward a distinctively [...] "Christian philosophy" [...] tended, at least in the view of his critics, to blur Aquinas's distinction between philosophy and theology. Jacques Maritain (1882–1973) introduced into Thomistic metaphysics the notion that philosophical reflection begins with an [...] "intuition of being," [...] and in ethics and social philosophy sought to harmonize Thomism with personalism and pluralistic democracy. Though [...] "existential Thomism" [...] was sometimes presented as a counterpoint to modern existentialism, the main reason for the label is the emphasis this approach puts on Aquinas's doctrine of existence. Contemporary proponents include Joseph Owens and John F. X. Knasas.|$|E
