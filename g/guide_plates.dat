5000|$|In {{common with}} the Schneider designs the Putilov guns had {{hydraulic}} recoil absorption and pneumatic recuperation. The gun had variable recoil, at less than 12° elevation the recoil length was 1800 1800 mm, at greater than 16° elevation the recoil length was reduced to 1000 mm. The 152mm guns barrels were designed to be detached from the carriage for transport and <b>guide</b> <b>plates</b> were added to muzzle to help with removal/installation of the barrel. The barrel transport cart and the gun carriage required teams of 10 horses to move them. Later in the war the Russian army started using tractors, often imported American Allis-Chamers types, to move these guns as a train. It took a trained crew 20 - 30 minutes to ready the gun for firing from the transport configuration. The gun's wheels could be fitted with hinged flat plates, similar to the French [...] "ceinture de roues", to permit towing on soft ground. The Russian projectiles were a little lighter than the French equivalent weighing 38.6 kg for the shrapnel projectile and 41 kg for the high explosive projectile.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{design for the}} 335 series engines is its most definitive aspect. All {{cylinder head}}s were two-valve heads that use large ports with poly-angle or 'canted' valves. [...] This resulted in the intake and exhaust valves being at separate angles. Canting the valves allowed for very large valves to be installed, while reducing the port length and minimizing sharp turns within the port. The end result was a cylinder head that had valves and ports much larger and freer flowing than the Ford Windsor V8s, {{and in some cases}} larger than some of the Ford FE and 385 Series V8s. [...] This same basic cylinder head design was used on the Ford Boss 302 engine, after it was modified to work with the Windsor engine block. [...] Most 335 series engines used stamped rocker arms with cast fulcrums that made for a nonadjustable valve train.

50|$|The {{wide and}} large port heads with {{staggered}} valve placement give the Boss 302 high power capabilities. Because of the pent-roof {{design of the}} heads, the Boss also had forged pop-up pistons to achieve the desired 10.5:1 compression ratio. Early units were typically characterized by very large intake (2.23 inches) and exhaust (1.70 inches) valves sitting in a small quench style combustion chamber. Exhaust valves were sodium-filled to aid cooling. Valve springs were dual units with an inner and outer spring to minimize harmonic resonance at high RPM. The heads feature steel spring seats, screw-in rocker studs, pushrod <b>guide</b> <b>plates</b> to aid in pushrod stability at high RPMs, and adjustable rocker arms. Fuel was provided by a Holly 780cfm manual choke carburetor. The taller intake required a thinner spacer. Ford used a phenolic spacer that incorporated an aluminum tube for the PCV hose, and also helped isolate the carburetor from {{the heat of the}} intake. Ignition was handled by a dual point distributor firing then unique 14mm AF 32 Autolite sparkplugs specified because of their smaller size (5/8 inch wrench vs. 13/16 inch wrench) so as to fit within the tight confines of the combustion chamber alongside the very large valves.|$|E
5000|$|The Boss 351 was {{the most}} potent {{high-performance}} variant of the 351C available only in the 1971 Boss 351 Mustang. Rated at 330 bhp (246 kW), it was fitted with a four-barrel Autolite model 4300-D spreadbore carburetor, an aluminum intake manifold, solid lifters, dual-point distributor, a six-quart oil pan, and cast-aluminum valve covers. Forged domed pistons gave an 11.3:1 nominal (11.1:1 advertised) compression ratio which made premium fuel necessary. It had four-bolt main bearing caps selected for hardness and a premium cast-iron crankshaft selected for hardness (90% nodularity). The cylinder head was modified for better airflow, used screw-in studs with adjustable rocker arms, and except for the water passages were basically the same heads used on the Boss 302. [...] The valvetrain used hardened and ground push rods with <b>guide</b> <b>plates,</b> and single grove-hardened valve split locks. The forged connecting rods were shot-peened and magnafluxed for strength, and used improved durability 180,000 PSI 3/8-inch nuts and bolts. The R-code Boss 351 Mustang was only installed in the 1971 Boss 351 Mustang, and it came equipped with Ram Air induction.

5000|$|For 1968 only, {{a special}} {{high-performance}} {{version of the}} 302 was offered for the Shelby GT350. Its main features included an angled, high-rise aluminum or iron intake manifold, a larger Holley four-barrel carburetor, and bigger valves of 1.875 in intake and 1.6 in exhaust. It had a longer-duration camshaft, still with hydraulic lifters. The block was made in Mexico. [...] "Hecho en Mexico" [...] casting marks {{are present in the}} lifter valley, and its main strength was the appearance of much larger and stronger two-bolt main bearing caps on the engines bottom end - the same as the HP-289, but not made from nodular iron rather Fords standard material. The heads had special close-tolerance pushrod holes to guide the pushrods without rail rocker arms or stamped steel <b>guide</b> <b>plates.</b> The combustion chambers also featured a smaller quench design for a higher compression ratio and enhanced flow characteristics. Additionally, high-flow cast exhaust manifolds similar to those on the 289 Hi-Po K-code engine further improved output. Heavy-duty connecting rods with high-strength bolts and a nodular iron crankshaft were also included in this package. Rated power (SAE gross) was estimated at [...] at 6,000 rpm and 333 lbft Nm at 3,800 rpm. The package, which cost $692 including some other equipment, was not popular and did not return for 1969. This engine was not a factory engine. Rather, like all Shelby Mustang engines, it was modified by Shelby American in their capacity as a vehicle upfitter. This special engine is well documented in the Ford factory engine repair manual for 1968 Mustangs and Fairlanes. This engine block is considered the strongest production 302 block other than the Boss 302 and the Trans Am 302. The Mexican 302 block was produced through to the mid-1990s and even showed up in Ford cars, trucks, and vans throughout the 1970s and early 1980s (Mexican-made 302 engines were often used by the USA car plants when CEP1 could not produce enough engines and many Ford replacement engines were Mexican).|$|E

5000|$|In 1966, General Motors {{designed}} a special [...] engine {{for the production}} Z/28 Camaro in order for it to meet the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans-Am Series road racing rules limiting engine displacement to [...] from 1967 to 1969. It {{was the product of}} placing the 283 cu in 3.00 in stroke crankshaft into a [...] bore 327 cu in cylinder-block. The 1967 302 used the same nodular cast-iron crankshaft as the 283, with a forged-steel crank that was also produced. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a crankshaft bearing diameter transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the [...] diameter small-journal to a [...] large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from [...] to [...] The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used 3/8 in diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal's 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of heavier crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm [...] diameter harmonic balancer. It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel 'pink' connecting rods, floating-pin in `69, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings. Its solid-lifter cam, known as the [...] "30-30 Duntov" [...] cam named after its /0.030 in hot intake/exhaust valve-lash and Zora Arkus-Duntov (the first Duntov cam was the / 1957 grind known as the '097, which referred to the last three digits of the casting number) the [...] "Father of the Corvette", was also used in the 1964-1965 carbureted 327/365 and fuel injected 327/375 engines. It used the '202' / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump `461 heads, pushrod <b>guide</b> <b>plates,</b> hardened 'blue-stripe' pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the LT-1 350 cu in 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were equipped with until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet 'log' design to clear the Camaro chassis's front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube {{in the front of the}} intake manifold next to the thermostat housing from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome [...] drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a crankcase breather on a [...] vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. A 'divorced' exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster engine warm-up. Its single-point distributor had an ignition point cam designed to reduce point bounce at high rpm along with a vacuum diaphragm to advance ignition timing at idle and part-throttle for economy and emissions. Pulleys for the balancer, alternator, water-pump, as well as optional power-steering, were deep-groove to retain the drive belt(s) at high rpm. In 1969, the 302 shared the finned cast-aluminum valve covers with the LT-1 350 Corvette engine. Conservatively rated at [...] (SAE gross) at 5800 rpm and [...] at 4800, actual output with its production 11:1 compression ratio was around [...] with [...] primary x 3.00 in secondary Sanderson tubular headers that came in the trunk when ordered with a 1967 Z/28, and associated carburetor main jet and ignition timing tuningneeded.

A stock 1968 Z/28 with the close-ratio transmission, optional transistorized-ignition and 4.88 gear, fitted with little more than the factory cowl plenum cold-air hood induction and headers, was capable of running 12.9 second/ 1/4-mile times on street tires.|$|E

This study investigated a customized <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> for osteotomy placement in TKAs {{with the aid of}} the statistical shape model technique using weight-bearing lower-extremity X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images of the knee. Methods: From October 2014 to June 2015, 42 patients who underwent a TKA in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital were divided into a <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> group (GPG, 21 cases) and a traditional surgery group (TSG, 21 cases) using a random number table method. In the GPG group, a <b>guide</b> <b>plate</b> was designed and printed using preoperative three-dimensional measurements to plan and digitally simulate the operation. TSG cases were treated with the conventional method. Outcomes were obtained from the postoperative image examination and short-term follow-up. Results: Operative time was 49. 0 ± 10. 5 min for GPG, and 62. 0 ± 9. 7 min in TSG. The coronal femoral angle, coronal tibial angle, posterior tibial slope, and the angle between the posterior condylar osteotomy surface and the surgical transepicondylar axis were 89. 2 ± 1. 7 °, 89. 0 ± 1. 1 °, 6. 6 ± 1. 4 °, and 0. 9 ± 0. 3 ° in GPG, and 86. 7 ± 2. 9 °, 87. 6 ± 2. 1 °, 8. 9 ± 2. 8 °, and 1. 7 ± 0. 8 ° in TSG, respectively.

Because the wind blows into the backward of the solar water heater system, the heat collecter is damaged by the stronger wind pressure gradient induced between the upper and lower. This study was using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) method to investigate the flowfield over a suspended and ground solar water heater during the wind speed about 30 m/s, and compared the results with the experimental data for validation. Simulations of 60 % solar water collector model with different tilt angles and 40 % model with different <b>guiding</b> <b>plate</b> were also done in this study to investigate the effect of the <b>guide</b> <b>plate.</b> The result shows that the 3 D flowfield effect is clear, and 2 D model can not simulated the flowfield.

The cornner vortices generated and interacted from the collector-side, and the separation bubbles is extending in spanwise. The larger tilt angle of the solar collector causes the larger pressure difference in the leading edge. The <b>guiding</b> <b>plate</b> avoids the inflow directly hit the bottom of the solar collector, and it can efficiently reduce the leading edge pressure difference.
