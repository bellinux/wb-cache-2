5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E

25|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator is a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> gauge {{with the pressure}} reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed {{is derived from the}} difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or stagnation pressure, and the static pressure. The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The static pressure measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the position error correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.|$|E

40|$|Buffeting is an {{aeroelastic}} phenomenon which plagues high performance aircraft at high angles of attack. For the F/A- 18 at high angles of attack, vortices emanating from wing/fuselage leading edge extensions burst, immersing the vertical tails in their turbulent wake. The resulting buffeting of the vertical tails {{is a concern}} from fatigue and inspection points of view. Previous flight and wind-tunnel investigations to determine the buffet loads on the tail did not provide a complete description of the spatial characteristics of the unsteady <b>differential</b> <b>pressures.</b> Consequently, the unsteady <b>differential</b> <b>pressures</b> {{were considered to be}} fully correlated in the analyses of buffet and buffeting.

The glycerin- and water-saturated sam-ples were much more compliant at low frequencies than at high frequencies. The measured bulk moduli of the tested rocks at low frequencies (0. 02 – 0. 1 Hz) were much lower than the values predicted by the Gassmann equation.

40|$|Twin {{screw pumps}} (TSPs) are {{commonly}} used for multiphase boosting systems to enhance oil and gas production. TSPs are a positive displacement pump that can efficiently handle fluids {{with a wide range}} of gas volume fractions (GVFs). The present study has developed a model to predict the performance of TSPs for varying GVFs, pump speeds, suction <b>pressures,</b> and <b>differential</b> <b>pressures.</b> A two-phase compressible flow model is used to determine the rate of leakage backflow through clearances within the pump. The model incorporates the possibility of choking due to sonic flow. Hydraulic imbalances cause rotor deflection, and the model accounts for increased leakage flowrates due to the induced eccentric rotation. The model was validated with experimental data from a Colfax MR- 200 TSP, and there is good agreement in most test cases. However, cases with low speeds and high <b>differential</b> <b>pressures</b> were not as reliable. This may be due to uncertainty of the rates of gas infiltration into the clearances at low pump speeds. The study reveals that pump performance is generally better when operating at high pump speeds, high GVF, low suction <b>pressures,</b> or low <b>differential</b> <b>pressures.</b> Linear pressure distributions throughout the pump?s chambers generally indicate lower volumetric efficiency compared to steep, concave pressure distributions. The effects of rotor deflection are generally small, but in a few cases they should not be ignored. Choking occurred at the circumferential, flank, and root clearances in 18 %, 13 %, and 99 % of the test cases, respectively. The presence of choked leakage flow marginally improved the pump performance...|$|R
