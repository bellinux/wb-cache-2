5|$|The 2005 Texas vs. Ohio State {{football}} game, played September 10, 2005, was {{the first-ever}} meeting between The University of Texas at Austin and The Ohio State University <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>college</b> football game. The two teams {{came into the}} game ranked No. 2 and No. 4, respectively. It was the second game of the 2005 season for both teams. Schools have become increasingly conservative in scheduling non-conference opponents of a high caliber, so a meeting of two top-five teams in the country was unusual {{this early in the}} season. For either team, winning the game would boost their chances of ultimately playing in the BCS National Championship Game while the loser likely faced the end of their national championship hopes.|$|E

5|$|Two high-powered {{parliamentary}} commissions in 1852 issued {{recommendations for}} Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, {{was a key}} member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The Commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunity given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to {{all members of the}} University. It recommended that Fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>college.</b>|$|E
