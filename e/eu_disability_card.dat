40|$|There are {{altogether}} two aims of {{the practical}} part of this thesis. The primary aim was {{to find out what}} are the opinions, personal experience and satisfaction of those who obtain social benefits and use the ZTP (severe health <b>disability)</b> <b>cards.</b> The second aim was to discover which social services are used most often by those who carry a card. These aims were achieved {{on the basis of the}} research question which was whether the degree of the card is sufficient for its owners and also by means of ten questions that were given to various respondents during semi-structured interview. As for the most convenient form, I chose qualitative research for this thesis. The technique of the above mentioned semi-structured interview was applied deliberately and the research population consisted of five respondents who own the TP (health <b>disability)</b> <b>card,</b> ZTP (severe health <b>disability)</b> <b>card</b> or ZTP/P (severe health disability requiring special care) card. The respondents were three women and two men. Nobody of the addressed refused to give the interview. The conversations took place from December 2016 until the first half of February 2017. After finishing the research it is obvious that claim to the severe health <b>disability</b> <b>card</b> has any person from the age of 1 year, regardless of gender. Most of the respondents are satisfied with their kind of card which emerges from the owning of the highest degree of the ZTP/P (severe health disability requiring special care) card. Nevertheless, it has turned out that persons with a health disability do not take advantage of these cards in its entirety which I reckon is due to insufficient information, regarding the possibilities of its use...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring {{recent years}} {{disability}} {{policy at the}} European level has changed from a formerly disregarded branch of traditional social policy into a modern policy formation which comprises not only social protection and labour market integration, but also equal rights and non-discrimination. In the light of this evolution, {{against the background of}} an ongoing research project the paper explores these questions: what kind of a political body is the European Union (EU) ? What kind of impact does it have on disability policy? How did <b>EU</b> <b>disability</b> policy evolve? What are the relations between social policy and equal rights policy? Do different welfare regimes operate at the EU level? The article presents results of a systematic analysis of disability related policy documents of the EU covering the period from 1958 until 2005. The documentary analysis shows that from the late 1970 s up {{to the middle of the}} 1990 s <b>EU</b> <b>disability</b> policy has centred around labour market integration. During the last decade, however, the equal rights approach has got more and more dominant. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research...|$|R

As 16 % of the EU population is statutorily disabled, there are considerable implications for beach management. Common research examples given of beach users include swimmers, anglers and water-sport enthusiasts – but rarely people with learning disabilities (LD). This paper assessed the viewpoints {{of a group of}} beach users with LD and considered their appreciation of three different coastal classifications in South Wales, UK. Because of the nature of their disabilities, the research applied a participatory photo-interpretation methodology (photovoice) at these three beach locations. The research then compared the LD ranking of beach issues with rankings provided by members of the general public at the same beaches. The results demonstrated some similarities between LD and general public coastal needs, but identified the need for specific considerations to be made by beach managers for LD users. These included informed self-advocacy, use and application of signage, instructive access and a requirement for baseline information gathering. The research proposes an Integrated Coastal Access Model (ICAM) from which Coastal Zone Management (CZM) and gatekeepers can consider the needs of people with LD within coastal strategies. Finally, this research also highlighted the use of photovoice in coastal research projects and the need for innovative methodological considerations when researching certain groups...|$|R

40|$|EU law offers great {{potential}} for advancing the rights and interests of disabled people living within the European Union, but this potential {{is yet to be}} fully realised. A major step forward in this regard is the recently adopted Framework Directive for equal treatment in employment and occupation – a measure constituting the first European law on disability discrimination. Through a brief outline of what may be described as the two main strands of EU activity from which an advancement in disability rights can be gained, namely the ‘human rights’ and the ‘design for all’ strands, this presentation seeks to place the Framework Directive within the broader context of an evolving <b>EU</b> <b>disability</b> policy. Falling squarely within the ‘human rights strand’, this directive is examined both in terms of its importance to disabled people as a European law, as well as its place within the wider disability agenda of the European Union. By so doing, this presentation aims to provide the audience with a greater awareness of the potential proffered by EU law for the advancement of disability rights and, as a result, a greater facility to fully exploit that potential. Whilst the nature of the question set for this presentation necessitates a generic approach to disability, specific reference will be made to learning disabilities where pertinent. </p...|$|R

40|$|Control {{over the}} production, the {{circulation}} {{and the use}} of statistical knowledge is inextricably linked to bureaucratic forms of domination. The historiography of the building of the modern State insists on the tight relationship between the capacity to collect and utilise statistical knowledge and the consolidation of bureaucratic domination. The creation of statistical categories symbolically unifies territories, social groups and practices. Similarly, the European Union has invested heavily in harmonising statistical categories, thereby providing institutions and actors with uniform descriptive languages. However, unlike statistical constructs of the Nation States of the 18 th and 19 th Centuries, European statistical categories are generated in a context of pre-existing statistical categories structuring public policies and social practice and institutions. The article will be empirically based on the emergence of <b>EU</b> <b>disability</b> policy which managed to carve out a new arena for policy discussion and coordination form the 1990 s on. Although this policy does not imply a transfer of sovereignty, the statistical unification of this social group at the European level and the structuring of interest groups and expert groups can be interpreted as an exercise of rescaling which has transformed the definition of disability as a policy problem and operated a shift in resources and legitimacies among stakeholders. Despite the successful creation of a unified statistical category, the article will look into some reasons for the limited use of disability statistics in policy making, but then show how alliances put in place by the Commission with interest groups and expert circles institutionalised a new European sector for policy discussion...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which European Union (EU) law and policy reflect an approach to disability consistent with Critical Disability Theory (CDT). Before examining the four policy areas selected for study, the thesis identifies the antecedents of CDT in critical social theory and Critical Legal Studies and then develops its parameters. CDT centres disability, adopts a social model of disability, interprets concepts of equality and rights in ways which promote social inclusion and identifies disabled people as primary actors in the production of knowledge about disability and the development of progressive disability policy. The fundamental elements of <b>EU</b> <b>disability</b> policy are identified and assessed against CDT’s approach to disability. That policy, based on a social model of disability and the active participation of disabled people in the formulation and implementation of disability policy, is expressed in language which is quite consistent with CDT. The first area of EU law and policy examined is the prohibition against discrimination based on disability. The promise and limitation of the Employment Equality Directive and the proposed directive related to the provision of goods and services are considered in light of inherent limitations in EU law arising from its liberal conception of rights, the competencies of the EU and exceptions and exemptions in the directives themselves. The three other areas of EU law and policy examined against CDT are the European Social Fund, transport policy and the social inclusion Open Method of Coordination. These policy areas provide examples of the variety of policy instruments which are utilised by the EU to advance its disability policy. The thesis reveals the different elements of CDT which are reflected to different degrees in each of these policy areas and assesses {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} EU policy to transform the social condition of disabled people.

40|$|The {{ideology}} of Emancipatory Disability Research (EDR) {{reflected in the}} phrase ‘Nothing about us without us’, was first put forward in the 1990 s. Although it aimed to place research control {{in the hands of}} the ‘researched’, i. e., people with disability, this rarely happens even today, 25 years later. The Community Action Research on <b>Disability</b> (<b>CARD)</b> programme in Uganda embraced and modified the EDR approach, recognising the need for including people with disability in the research process from concept to outcome, and nurturing participation and collaboration between all the stakeholders in achieving action-based research. The research teams always included people with disability and staff from Disabled People’s Organisations (DPOs) as well as academics and service providers. It endeavoured to generate and carry out research around issues that mattered to people with disability and their families. Leadership roles were assigned by team members. The objectives of the CARD programme were: (1) to fund teams to carry out action-based research on disability in Uganda; (2) to develop research and administrative capacity to manage the initiative within the academic registrar’s office at Kyambogo University; (3) to incorporate new knowledge generated from the studies into the ongoing local community-based rehabilitation and special education courses; and, (4) to ensure wide dissemination of research findings to all stakeholder groups. CARD ran for 5 years, commissioning 21 action research studies in the field of disability and community-based services. This paper describes the process, presents the 12 completed studies, examines the extent to which the objectives were achieved and evaluates the experiences of the participating research teams, particularly in relation to the inclusion of its members with disability. It concludes with recommendations for future initiatives designed to promote validity, good value and inclusive approaches in disability research...|$|R

Promoting the right to the city, any excluded, the Municipality of Milan supports the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006) and the <b>EU</b> <b>Disability</b> Strategy 2010 - 2020. These documents highlight an innovative concept of the disability, extended from a matter of strictly social policies to a matter of legal and human right: «Promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities» (UN Convention, 2006). At the same time, the importance of the accessibility is confirmed as prerequisite for any action aimed at social inclusion. The principle of accessibility has as a corollary the "universal design", promoted by the Convention as «design of products, environments, programmes and services to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design». In order to ensure an accessible Milan, Departments and Sectors of the Municipality in partnership with associations of persons with disabilities, cooperatives, foundations, institutions and government agencies, including Lombardy Region, Regional Emergency Utility, Azienda Trasporti Milanesi, have worked with spirit of collaboration and cross-disciplinary, bringing together resources and expertises. The efficiency of the process has produced tangible results, which this paper will illustrate. Actions taken for the elimination of architectural and communication barriers are identified with the realization of 10 tourist and cultural itineraries in Milan, the online site EXPOFACILE and the educational and awareness actions addressed to commercial categories of hospitality. Among the qualifying elements: the reference to the principles of the Universal Design, the co-design with stakeholders, allowing to design starting from the needs identified by people with disabilities and to offer them the opportunity to control and verify the implemented projects, the promotion of the cultural dimension of disability.

The <b>EU</b> <b>disability</b> strategy 2010 - 2020 aims at eliminating barriers, preventing discrimination and empowering people with disabilities to enjoy fully their rights and participation in society on equal terms with others. The present study on Supported Employment for people with <b>disabilities</b> in the <b>EU</b> and EFTA-EEA has been initiated to enhance further the possibilities {{of people with disabilities}} to participate on the open labour market. COWI and its partners, Work Research Institute, Norway and the European Union of Supported Employment (EUSE) were tasked with mapping the use of Supported Employment in 30 countries; undertaking an in-depth study of six selected countries on the look for policy recommendations; and producing a compendium of good practices. In addition, a directory of supporting services (an address book) was produced. The findings and recommendations were validated at an expert meeting. For this study, Supported Employment is defined as a scheme that supports people with disabilities or other disadvantaged groups in obtaining and maintaining paid employment in the open labour market. Supportive measures must include assistance to the employee before, during, and after obtaining a job as well as support to the employer. Key to this is the job coach function.
