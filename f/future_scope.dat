40|$|MANET {{is a kind}} of Ad hoc {{network with}} mobile, {{wireless}} nodes. Because of its special characteristics like dynamic topology, hop-by-hop communications and easy and quick setup, MANET faced lots of challenges allegorically routing, security and clustering. The security challenges arise due to MANETs self-configuration and self-maintenance capabilities. In this paper, we present an elaborate view of issues in MANET security. Based on MANETs special characteristics, we define three security parameters for MANET. In addition we divided MANET security into two different aspects and discussed each one in details. A comprehensive analysis in security aspects of MANET and defeating approaches is presented. In addition, defeating approaches against attacks have been evaluated in some important metrics.

Inverse problems dealing with vibration response utilize the response signals {{to find out}} input factors and/or certain structural properties. Due to certain drawbacks of traditional solutions to inverse problems, ANNs have gained a major popularity in this field. This paper reviews some earlier researches where ANNs were applied to solve different vibration-based inverse parametric identification problems. The adoption of different ANN algorithms, input-output schemes and required signal processing were denoted in considerable detail. In addition, {{a number of issues}} have been reported, including the factors that affect ANNs’ prediction, as well as the advantage and disadvantage of ANN approaches with respect to general inverse methods Based on the critical analysis, suggestions to potential researchers have also been provided for <b>future</b> <b>scopes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Batish 1 and Sanjeev Kumar 2 Processability {{of metal}} matrix {{composite}} depends upon the appropriately chosen elements, their properties, distribu-tions and interface between them. The ductile property of matrix embedded with ceramics reinforced particles serves to reduce the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and increase strength and modulus. High tool cost in traditional machining process results in limiting the application of these materials in advance technologies; hence, electric discharge machining process is a widely accepted machining option for geometrically complex-shaped components.
