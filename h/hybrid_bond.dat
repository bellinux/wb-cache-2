40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the test results}} of the experimental behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened with the newly proposed <b>hybrid</b> <b>bonding</b> technique, which is the wise combination of plate bonding and near surface mounting (NSM) technique. Many {{studies have focused on}} the experimental behavior of RC beams strengthened with externally bonded steel plates. However, the presence of high interfacial shear stresses {{at the end of the}} plate may reduce the resistance to failure of the strengthened structure. Recently, to a certain extent, the development of the near surface mounted strengthening technique can reduce the problem of this premature end debonding failure. However, the application of this method may be limited due to the absence of sufficient width and clear cover of the existing unstrengthened deficit beam. The hybridization bonding method could eliminate the limitations of these two methods to some extent. As data on the performance of structures strengthened with the <b>hybrid</b> <b>bonding</b> method are not available, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the experimental behavior of RC beams strengthened with the <b>hybrid</b> <b>bonding</b> method. Seven medium-sized beams (one control and six strengthened) were tested. Steel plates and bars were used for strengthening. The failure load, failure mode, deflection, strain and cracking behavior are discussed. The test results confirm that the proposed <b>hybrid</b> <b>bonding</b> is the most effective strengthening technique without significantly hampering the ductility and its performance is 32 higher than that of corresponding plate bonding method through improvement of the bond performance.

40|$|Models of {{physical}} systems {{have to be}} based on physical principles such as conservation of energy and continuity of power. These principles are inherently enforced by the bond graph modeling formalism. Often, however, physical components may be best modeled as piecewise continuous with discrete mode changes, which leads to a violation of continuity principles. To support such hybrid models, bond graphs can be extended by facilitating a dynamic model structure, resulting in <b>hybrid</b> <b>bond</b> graphs. Behavior generation then requires computing continuous-time evolution, detecting the occurrence of events, executing the discrete state changes and re-initializing the continuous-time state. This paper presents a comprehensive representation of these different aspects of behavior using hybrid process algebra. The behavior of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>bond</b> graph can then be studied using a uniform representation while a direct correspondence with the elements of the bond graph is maintained. Additionally, non-determinism can be included in <b>hybrid</b> <b>bond</b> graph semantics which may alleviate the modeling task without being detrimental to the required analyses. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAdhesively bonded assemblies, unlike riveted or bolted joints, do {{not require}} holes, {{which can lead to}} large stress {{concentrations}} in composites. For this reason adhesive bonding is attracting attention particularly when weight is critical. But failure in adhesively bonded assemblies involving composites is often associated with crack initiation in the adhesive or delamination of the composite plies close to the adhesive joint caused by interlaminar or through-thickness stresses. Such assemblies are often characterized by large stress concentrations, which make the analysis of their behaviour for industrial applications difficult. As the mechanical behaviour of adhesives and of composites are quite complex, a large database of experimental results under various loading conditions is necessary to develop accurate numerical models. Unfortunately, few experimental devices allow out-of-plane loading to be studied, except for specific loadings or by using thick composite specimens which are not always representative of industrial applications.

40|$|Hybrid {{models are}} those {{containing}} continuous and discontinuous behaviour. In constructing dynamic systems models, it is frequently desirable to abstract rapidly changing, highly nonlinear behaviour to a discontinuity. Bond graphs {{lend themselves to}} systems modelling by being multi-disciplinary and reflecting the physics of the system. One advantage {{is that they can}} produce a mathematical model in a form that simulates quickly and efficiently. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>bond</b> graphs are a logical development which could further improve speed and efficiency. A range of <b>hybrid</b> <b>bond</b> graph forms have been proposed which are suitable for either simulation or further analysis, but not both. None have reached common usage. A <b>Hybrid</b> <b>bond</b> graph method is proposed here which is suitable for simulation as well as providing engineering insight through analysis. This new method features a distinction between structural and parametric switching. The controlled junction is used for the former, and gives rise to dynamic causality. A controlled element is developed for the latter. Dynamic causality is unconstrained so as to aid insight, and a new notation is proposed. The junction structure matrix for the <b>hybrid</b> <b>bond</b> graph features Boolean terms to reflect the controlled junctions in the graph structure. This hybrid JSM is used to generate a mixed-Boolean state equation. When storage elements are in dynamic causality, the resulting system equation is implicit. The focus of this thesis is the exploitation of the model. The implicit form enables application of matrix-rank criteria from control theory, and control properties {{can be seen in the}} structure and causal assignment. An impulsive mode may occur when storage elements are in dynamic causality, but otherwise there are no energy losses associated with commutation because this method dictates the way discontinuities are abstracted. The main contribution is therefore a <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Bond</b> Graph which reflects the physics of commutating systems and offers engineering insight through the choice of controlled elements and dynamic causality. It generates a unique, implicit, mixed-Boolean system equation, describing all modes of operation. This form is suitable for both simulation and analysis.
