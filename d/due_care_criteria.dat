40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the prevalence, development, stance, and communication of written institutional ethics policies on euthanasia in Flemish hospitals. METHODS: Cross-sectional mail survey of general directors of all hospitals (n= 81) in Flanders, Belgium. RESULTS: Of the 81 hospitals invited to participate, 71 (88 %) completed the questionnaire. Of these, 45 (63 %) had a written ethics policy on euthanasia. The Belgian Act on Euthanasia and centrally developed guidelines of professional organisations {{were the most}} frequently mentioned reasons for and sources used in developing ethics policies on euthanasia in hospitals. Up to one-third of hospitals reported that they developed the policy upon request from physicians or nurses, or after being confronted with a euthanasia request. Development and approval of institutional ethics policies occurred within a multidisciplinary context involving clinicians, ethicists, and hospital administrators. The majority of hospitals restrictively applied the euthanasia law by introducing palliative procedures in addition to legal <b>due</b> <b>care</b> <b>criteria.</b> Private Catholic hospitals, in particular, {{were more likely to}} be restrictive: euthanasia is not permitted or is permitted only in exceptional cases (in accordance with legal <b>due</b> <b>care</b> <b>criteria</b> and additional palliative care procedures). The majority of hospitals took the initiative to communicate the policy to hospital physicians and nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Since the enactment of the Belgian Act on Euthanasia in 2002, the debate on how to deal with euthanasia requests has intensified in Flemish hospitals. The high prevalence of written institutional ethics policies on euthanasia and other medical end-of-life decisions is one possible outcome of this debate. status: publishe...|$|E

Most guidelines stated that the attending physician is responsible for the decision to grant or refuse an EAS request. <b>Due</b> <b>care</b> <b>criteria</b> were described in the majority of guidelines, but aspects relevant for assessing these criteria were not always described. Half of the guidelines described the role of the nurse in the performance of euthanasia. Compared with hospital guidelines, nursing home guidelines were more often stricter than the law in excluding patients with dementia (30 % vs 4 %) and incompetent patients (25 % vs 4 %). As from 2002, the guidelines were less strict in categorically excluding patients groups (32 % vs 64 %) and in particular incompetent patients (10 % vs 29 %). Healthcare institutions should accurately state the boundaries of the law, also when they prefer to set stricter boundaries for their own institution. Only then can guidelines provide adequate support for physicians and nurses in the difficult EAS decision-making process...|$|E
5000|$|Euthanasia in the Netherlands is {{regulated}} by the [...] "Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act" [...] from 2002. It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with <b>criteria</b> of <b>due</b> <b>care.</b> These <b>criteria</b> concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life.

40|$|A pivotal <b>due</b> <b>care</b> <b>criterion</b> for lawful {{euthanasia}} in the Netherlands is {{that doctors}} must {{be convinced that}} a patient requesting for euthanasia, suffers unbearably. Our study aims {{to find out how}} doctors judge if a patient suffers unbearably. How do doctors bridge the gap from 3 rd person assessment to 1 st person experience? We performed a qualitative interview study among 15 physicians, mainly general practitioners, who participated earlier in a related quantitative survey on the way doctors apply the suffering criterion. Results show that doctors follow different 'cognitive routes' when assessing a patients suffering {{in the context of a}} euthanasia request. Sometimes doctors do this imagining how she herself would experience the situation of the patient ('imagine self). Doctors may also try to adopt the perspective of the patient and imagine what the situation is like for this particular patient ('imagine other'). Besides this we found that the (outcome of the) assessment is influenced by a doctor's private norms, values and emotions considering (the performance of) euthanasia. We conclude by arguing why doctors should be aware of both the 'cognitive route' followed as well as the influence of their own personal norms on the assessment of suffering in the context of euthanasia requests.

40|$|Background: An {{important}} principle {{underlying the}} Dutch Euthanasia Act is physicians' responsibility to alleviate patients' suffering. The Dutch Act states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts {{in accordance with}} <b>criteria</b> of <b>due</b> <b>care.</b> These <b>criteria</b> concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the presence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life. To demonstrate their compliance, the Act requires physicians to report euthanasia to a review committee. We studied which arguments Dutch physicians use to substantiate their adherence to the criteria and which aspects attract review committees' attention. Methods: We examined 158 files of reported euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide cases that were approved by the review committees. We studied the physicians' reports and the verdicts of the review committees by using a checklist. Results: Physicians reported that the patient's request had been well-considered because the patient was clear-headed (65 %) and/or had repeated the request several times (23 %). Unbearable suffering was often substantiated with physical symptoms (62 %), function loss (33 %), dependency (28 %) or deterioration (15 %). In 35 %, physicians reported {{that there had been}} alternatives to relieve patients' suffering which were refused by the majority. The nature of the relationship with the consultant was sometimes unclear: the consultant was reported to have been an unknown colleague (39 %), a known colleague (21 %), otherwise (25 %), or not clearly specified in the report (24 %). Review committees relatively often scrutinized the consultation (41 %) and the patient's (unbearable) suffering (32 %); they had few questions about possible alternatives (1 %). Conclusion: Dutch physicians substantiate their adherence to the criteria in a variable way with an emphasis on physical symptoms. The information they provide is in most cases sufficient to enable adequate review. Review committees' control seems to focus on (unbearable) suffering and on procedural issue...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands, {{euthanasia}} {{is legal}} {{for patients with}} early Alzheimer’s. Euthanasia in general has been legal in the Netherlands since the 1980 s, but legalization was only codified with legislation in 2002. The first case involving Alzheimer’s occurred in 2004. The legislation is structured on six <b>due</b> <b>care</b> <b>criteria,</b> which were normatively and legally developed first in the courts and now by Regional Review Committees. The normative justification for the law is variously described, but taking it to consist of four basic principles - self-determination, the duty to protect life, the professional duty to relieve suffering, and dignity - facilitates analysis of cases involving early Alzheimer’s. Early Alzheimer’s was anticipated as a difficult and unique case dilemma for the normative justification of euthanasia in the Netherlands. As an illustrating example, a case is presented. The patient in the case {{was able to make}} a competent request for euthanasia and claimed to be suffering unbearably and hopelessly. The nature of his suffering can be summarized as a sense of impending disintegration of his self. Accepting a conception of self reliant upon one’s cognitive faculties allows for euthanasia in early Alzheimer’s to maintain coherence with the normative justification for the law...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The Dutch Euthanasia Act (2002) {{states that}} {{euthanasia}} is not punishable if the attending physician acts {{in accordance with}} the statutory <b>due</b> <b>care</b> <b>criteria.</b> These criteria hold that: there should be a voluntary and well-considered request, the patient's suffering should be unbearable and hopeless, the patient should be informed about their situation, there are no reasonable alternatives, an independent physician should be consulted, and the method should be medically and technically appropriate. This study investigates whether physicians experience problems with these criteria in medical practice. Methods: In 2006, questionnaires were sent to a random, stratified sample of 2100 Dutch physicians (response rate: 56 %). Physicians were asked about problems in their decision-making related to requests for euthanasia or assisted suicide after enforcement of the 2002 Euthanasia Act. Results: Of all physicians who had received a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide (75 %), 25 % had experienced problems in the decision-making with regard to {{at least one of the}} criteria of due care. Physicians who had experienced problems mostly indicated to have had problems related to evaluating whether or not the patient's suffering was unbearable and hopeless (79 %) and whether or not the patient's request was voluntary or well considered (58 %). Discussion: Physicians in The Netherlands most frequently reported problems related to aspects in which they have to evaluate the patient's subjective perspective(s). However, it can be questioned whether placing emphasis on these subjective aspects is an adequate fulfilment of the duties imposed on physicians, as laid down in the Dutch Euthanasia Ac...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{examined}} {{the association between}} quality of care and 30 day mortality in a nationwide cohort of patients hospitalized with hip fracture. Methods We used data from The Danish National Indicator Project, a quality improvement initiative with participation of more than 90 % of Danish hospital departments caring for patients with hip fracture between August 16, 2005 and August 15, 2006. Quality of care was {{measured in terms of}} meeting five specific criteria: early assessment of the patient's nutritional risk, systematic pain assessment during mobilization, assessment of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) before the fracture, assessment of ADL before discharge, and initiation of treatment to prevent future osteoporotic fractures. The association between meeting each of the quality of <b>care</b> <b>criteria</b> for the patient and 30 day mortality was examined using logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Results 6, 266 patients hospitalized with an incident episode of hip fracture were included in the study. For four of the five quality of <b>care</b> <b>criteria,</b> patients who met the criterion had substantially lower 30 day mortality after hip fracture. The adjusted mortality odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 0. 42 (95 % CI, 0. 30 to 0. 58) for assessment of ADL before discharge (excluding deaths during hospitalization) to 0. 72 (95 % CI, 0. 52 to 1. 00) for systematic pain assessment. We found an inverse dose-response relationship between the number of quality of <b>care</b> <b>criteria</b> met and 30 day mortality; the lowest mortality was found among patients for whom all five quality of <b>care</b> <b>criteria</b> were met, as compared with patients for whom no quality of <b>care</b> <b>criteria</b> were met: adjusted mortality OR 0. 18 (95 % CI, 0. 09 to 0. 36).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Euthanasia is {{performed}} worldwide, {{regardless of the}} existence of laws governing it. Belgium became the second country in the world to enact a law on euthanasia in 2002. Healthcare institutions bear responsibility for guaranteeing the quality of care for patients at the end of life, and for ensuring support for caregivers involved. Therefore, institutional ethics policies on end-of-life decision-making, especially on euthanasia, may be useful. METHODS: A cross-sectional mail survey of general directors of Catholic hospitals and nursing homes in Belgium was used to describe the prevalence and content of written ethics policies for competent terminally ill, incompetent terminally ill, and non-terminally ill patients. RESULTS: Of the 298 targeted institutions, 81 % of hospitals and 62 % of nursing homes returned complete questionnaires. Of these, 79 % of hospitals and 30 % of nursing homes had a written ethics policy on euthanasia. Of hospitals 83 % and of nursing homes 85 % permitted euthanasia for competent terminally ill patients only in exceptional cases in accordance with legal <b>due</b> <b>care</b> <b>criteria</b> and provisions outlined by the palliative filter procedure. Euthanasia for incompetent terminally ill patients was prohibited by 27 % of the hospitals and by 60 % of the nursing homes. For non-terminally ill patients, these figures were 43 and 64 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Catholic healthcare institutions in Belgium (Flanders) made great efforts to develop written ethics policies on euthanasia. Only a small group of institutions completely prohibited euthanasia. Most of the institutions considered euthanasia to be an option if all possible alternatives (e. g., palliative filter procedure, which contains more rigorous criteria than those in the Belgian Euthanasia Act), have been thoroughly investigated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Based on an ethnographic {{fieldwork}} {{done at the}} Dutch “right to die” organisation in the Netherlands, I {{explore and}} discuss the Western perception on autonomy, identity, and independency in relation to old age. After about thirty years of debate, the Netherlands legalised assisted dying in 2002. The law was first and foremost {{for those who were}} terminally ill or had a chronic illness. The Dutch “right to die” organisation, NVVE, had an essential role in the legalisation of assisted dying in the Netherlands. With influence within politics and frequently having a place in the Medias spotlight, NVVE has grown to be an organisation that expands all over Netherland. are an essential part of this thesis. To be able to receive assisted dying, one needs to fulfil the <b>due</b> <b>care</b> <b>criteria.</b> Several groups within the Dutch society feels discriminated because of the criterions. By making the law available for those who experience unbearable suffering, the people diagnosed with dementia, individuals with a mental illness or those who are tired of life, are not able to request and receive assisted dying. The baby boom generation will be and are responsible for the biggest group of elders in our time. Their ideals concerning independency, identity, and autonomy tends to influence {{the way we think about}} our health and becoming old. What happens when these factors are threatened by old age? The fear of dying without autonomy, control, and identity has led to a new conception death. The fact that many Dutch citizens cannot reives assisted dying has led the NVVE to invent a new legitimised concept - the autonomous route. This method is especially relevant for elders in the fourth age. Consequently, the society could lose some of its diversity were the elders or people diagnosed with dementia will be ones who suffer. To be in control and keep autonomy are important factors when dying a good and dignified death. However, the need to state what is considered a “good” or a “bad” death has led the organisation to push boundaries...|$|E
40|$|In many European {{countries}} {{there is}} a public debate about the acceptability and regulation of euthanasia. In 2002, Belgium became the second country after the Netherlands to enact a law on euthanasia. Although euthanasia rarely occurs, {{the complexity of the}} clinical-ethical decision making surrounding euthanasia requests and the need for adequate support reported by caregivers, means that healthcare institutions increasingly need to consider how to responsibly handle euthanasia requests. The development of written ethics policies on euthanasia may be important to guarantee and maintain the quality of care for patients requesting euthanasia. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence, development, position, and communication of written ethics policies on euthanasia in Flemish nursing homes. Data were obtained through a cross-sectional mail survey of general directors of all Catholic nursing homes in Flanders, Belgium. Of the 737 nursing homes invited to participate, 612 (83 %) completed the questionnaire. Of these, only 15 % had a written ethics policy on euthanasia. Presence of an ethics committee and membership of an umbrella organization were independent predictors of whether a nursing home had such a written ethics policy. The Act on Euthanasia and euthanasia guidelines advanced by professional organizations were the most frequent reasons (76 % and 56 %, respectively) and reference sources (92 % and 64 %, respectively) for developing ethics policies on euthanasia. Development of ethics policies occurred within a multidisciplinary context. In general, Flemish nursing homes applied the Act on Euthanasia restrictively by introducing palliative procedures in addition to legal <b>due</b> <b>care</b> <b>criteria.</b> The policy was communicated to the consulting general practitioner and nurses in 74 % and 89 % of nursing homes, respectively. Although the overall prevalence of ethics policies on euthanasia was low in Flemish nursing homes, institution administrators displayed growing awareness of bearing responsibility for stimulating dialogue and reflection about how to deal with euthanasia requests within their institution.

40|$|IMPORTANCE Right to Die NL, an {{organization}} in the Netherlands that advocates for the option of euthanasia, founded the End-of-Life Clinic in 2012 to provide euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide for patients who meet all legal requirements but whose regular physicians rejected their request. Many patients whose requests are rejected have less common situations, such as a psychiatric or psychological condition, dementia, or being tired of living. OBJECTIVE To study outcomes of requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide received by the clinic and factors associated with granting or rejecting requests. DESIGN Analysis of application forms and registration files from March 1, 2012, to March 1, 2013, the clinic's first year of operation, for 645 patients who applied to the clinic with a request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide and whose cases were concluded during the study period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A request could be granted, rejected, or withdrawn or the patient could have died before a final decision was reached. We analyzed bivariate and multivariate associations with medical conditions, type of suffering, and sociodemographic variables. RESULTS Of the 645 requests made by patients, 162 requests (25. 1 %) were granted, 300 requests (46. 5 %) were refused, 124 patients (19. 2 %) died before the request could be assessed, and 59 patients (9. 1 %) withdrew their requests. Patients with a somatic condition (113 of 344 [32. 8 %]) or with cognitive decline (21 of 56 [37. 5 %]) had {{the highest percentage of}} granted requests.
