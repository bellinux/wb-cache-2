40|$|Many hierarchically modular {{systems are}} {{structured}} {{in a way}} that resembles an hourglass. This "hourglass effect" means that the system generates many outputs from many inputs through {{a relatively small number of}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>modules</b> that are critical for the operation of the entire system, referred to as the waist of the hourglass. We investigate the hourglass effect in general, not necessarily layered, hierarchical dependency networks. Our analysis focuses on the number of source-to-target dependency paths that traverse each vertex, and it identifies the core of a dependency network as the smallest set of vertices that collectively cover almost all dependency paths. We then examine if a given network exhibits the hourglass property or not, comparing its core size with a "flat" (i. e., non-hierarchical) network that preserves the source dependencies of each target in the original network. As a possible explanation for the hourglass effect, we propose the Reuse Preference (RP) model that captures the bias of new <b>modules</b> to reuse <b>intermediate</b> <b>modules</b> of similar complexity instead of connecting directly to sources or low complexity modules. We have applied the proposed framework in a diverse set of dependency networks from technological, natural and information systems, showing that all these networks exhibit the general hourglass property but to a varying degree and with different waist characteristics.

40|$|Laser axotomy {{followed}} by time-lapse microscopy is a sensitive assay for axon regeneration phenotypes in C. elegans 1. The main difficulty of this assay is the perceived cost ($ 25 - 100 K) and technical expertise required for implementing a laser ablation system 2, 3. However, solid-state pulse lasers of modest costs (<$ 10 K) can provide robust performance for laser ablation in transparent preparations where target axons are "close " to the tissue surface. Construction and alignment {{of a system}} can be accomplished in a day. The optical path provided by light from the focused condenser to the ablation laser provides a convenient alignment guide. An <b>intermediate</b> <b>module</b> with all optics removed can be dedicated to the ablation laser and assures that no optical elements need be moved during a laser ablation session. A dichroic in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>module</b> allows simultaneous imaging and laser ablation. Centering the laser beam to the outgoing beam from the focused microscope condenser lens guides the initial alignment of the system. A variety of lenses are used to condition and expand the laser beam to fill the back aperture of the chosen objective lens. Final alignment and testing is performed with a front surface mirrored glass slide target. Laser power is adjusted to give a minimum size ablation spot (< 1 um). The ablation spot is centered with fine adjustments of the last kinematically mounted mirror to cross hairs fixed in the imaging window. Laser power for axotomy will be approximately 10 X higher than needed for th...|$|E

40|$|The maximal {{subgroup}} of unipotent upper-triangular matrices of the finite general linear groups are a fundamental family of $p$-groups.

40|$|A {{parallel}} {{distributed processing}} (PDP) model is proposed to account for choice reaction time (RT) performance in diverse cognitive and perceptual tasks such as the Stroop task, the Simon task, the Eriksen flanker task, and the stimulus–response compatibility task that are interrelated in terms of stimulus–stimulus and stimulus– response overlap (Kornblum, 1992). In multilayered (input–intermediate–output) networks, neuron-like nodes that represent stimulus and response features are grouped into mutually inhibitory modules that represent stimulus and response dimensions. The stimulus–stimulus overlap is implemented by a convergence of two input modules onto a common <b>intermediate</b> <b>module,</b> and the stimulus–response overlap by direct pathways representing automatic priming of outputs. Mean RTs are simulated in various simple tasks and, furthermore, predictions are generated for complex tasks based on performance in simpler tasks.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present a set of tools that {{can be helpful in}} the design, {{development}} and test of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems based on DSP boards. The architecture of the system presented allows the user to concentrate on ASR design problems rather than on the DSP board interfacing problem.

For a system based on linguistic principles, TU is a process requiring a pipeline of interleaved independent modules which deliver to the Semantic Processing Modules the preferred structural representation according to parsing strategies. These strategies can in turn access semantic information limited though to lexical and dictionary lookup. Semantic interpretation requires an <b>intermediate</b> <b>module</b> for Discourse processing, which takes as input the DAG structure produced by the parser, and the Discourse Model as asserted by the system, {{with the task of}} choosing the most relevant entity and make it the object of referential processes.

30|$|Another {{compromise}} {{adopted to}} address this problem was suggested by Iguchi et al. (2008; hereafter IG 08). Their approach was based on dynamical downscaling of realistic aerosol fields from large-scale aerosol (and chemical) transport model simulations to small-scale CRM simulations. The basic numerical framework of aerosol downscaling was similar to that of dynamical downscaling for standard prognostic variables such as wind velocity, temperature, and vapor-mixing ratio. Initial and time-variant aerosol boundary conditions were prepared using four-dimensional output from the large-scale simulation. However, aerosol size distribution spectra were incompletely resolved in the large-scale aerosol transport model. This deficiency might be problematic for accurate calculation of the activated CCN number concentration on the basis of Köhler theory on the CRM side. To deal with this problem in a reasonable manner, the authors proposed the use of an additional <b>intermediate</b> <b>module.</b> The intermediate aerosol loading module complemented the information of the aerosol size distribution spectra in the dynamical downscaling framework. The aerosol size distribution spectra and their total number/mass concentrations should be as realistic as possible, such as those observed at times and locations pertaining to the simulations.|$|E
