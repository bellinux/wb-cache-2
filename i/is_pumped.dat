5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E

50|$|Dune {{water is}} {{drinking}} water which has <b>been</b> <b>pumped</b> {{up from the}} dunes. Fresh rainwater filters through the sandy dunes and floats {{on top of the}} salt water from where it can <b>be</b> <b>pumped</b> up, purified, and used as fresh drinking water.|$|R
5|$|Although {{called an}} offstream storage {{reservoir}} by USBR, the reservoir floods {{part of the}} San Luis Creek valley. San Luis Creek, however, is not the primary water source for the reservoir. Downstream of San Luis Reservoir is O'Neill Forebay, which is intersected by the Delta-Mendota Canal, a separate CVP facility. Water <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> from the canal into the Forebay and uphill into San Luis Reservoir, which functions as an additional water source during dry periods.|$|E
5|$|Multiple utility {{companies}} serve the county. Electricity {{is provided by}} the Harrison Rural Electric Membership Cooperative (REMC) and Duke Energy. Natural gas {{is provided by the}} Indiana Utilities Corporation in Corydon and several small distributors provide rural service. Land-line telephone service is provided exclusively by Verizon. Cable television is provided by Insight Communications {{in some parts of the}} county. Water <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> from a number of corporations, the largest being South Harrison Water Corporation and Ramsey Water Inc.|$|E
5|$|The city draws {{its water}} supply from the Kiskatinaw River, 18km (11mi) west of town. Before {{reaching}} the city, the water <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> through a settling pond, two storage ponds, and a treatment plant {{where it is}} flocculated, filtered, and chlorinated. The city also provides drinking water for Pouce Coupe and rural residents. Sewage is processed by a lagoon system east of town and released into the Pouce Coupe River.|$|E

50|$|Early mining {{was done}} by hand and {{extracted}} salt rock crystals as a solid. To improve efficiency, fresh water would <b>be</b> <b>pumped</b> into a cavern. After several weeks of absorbing salt from the walls, the water <b>was</b> <b>pumped</b> out to a processing plant in Hallein.|$|R
50|$|These {{completion}} techniques {{may allow}} {{for more than}} 30 stages to <b>be</b> <b>pumped</b> into the horizontal section of a single well if required, which {{is far more than}} would typically <b>be</b> <b>pumped</b> into a vertical well that had far fewer feet of producing zone exposed.|$|R
5|$|The heart pumps blood with {{a rhythm}} {{determined}} {{by a group of}} pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.|$|E
5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects {{in the right}} and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Water <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> to {{the summit}} at {{the western end of}} the locks, from Wilton Water, by the {{restored}} Crofton Pumping Station. The original steam-powered pumping station is preserved and contains one of the oldest operational Watt-style beam engines in the world, dating from 1812. The steam engines still pump water on selected weekends, but for day-to-day operation electric pumps are used, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound.|$|E

50|$|Condensate (fresh water) {{from all}} the tubes in all the stages must <b>be</b> <b>pumped</b> out from the {{respective}} pressures of the stages to the ambient pressure. The brine collected {{at the bottom of}} the last stage must <b>be</b> <b>pumped</b> out since it has substantially lower pressure than the ambient pressure.|$|R
50|$|Note: {{reciprocating}} <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> cyclic, rotary <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> typically continuous.|$|R
5|$|Commercial sashimi tuna steaks {{may have}} their {{coloration}} fixated {{by the use}} of flushing with carbon monoxide (CO), whereby CO <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> into bags containing the tuna, which is then stored at 4° Celsius. The duration of time for color fixation to occur varies per the size of the meat. For example, a two-inch tuna steak takes twenty-four hours for color fixation to be completed using this process. When utilized, color fixation using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing of tuna steaks for storage. In Japan, color fixation using CO is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{springs in}} the Senchal Range provide most of Darjeeling's water supply. Water {{collected}} is routed through stone conduits to two lakes that were constructed in 1910 and 1932, {{from where it}} is piped to the town after purification at the Jorebungalow filtration plant. During the dry season, when water supplied by springs is insufficient, water <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> from Khong Khola, a nearby small perennial stream. Increasing demand {{has led to a}} worsening shortfall in water supply; just over 50% of the town's households are connected to the municipal water supply system. Various efforts made to augment the water supply, including the construction of a third storage reservoir in 1984, have failed to yield desired results.|$|E
5|$|On most crude-oil tankers, {{a special}} crude oil washing (COW) system {{is part of}} the {{cleaning}} process. The COW system circulates part of the cargo through the fixed tank-cleaning system to remove wax and asphaltic deposits. Tanks that carry less viscous cargoes are washed with water. Fixed and portable automated tank cleaning machines, which clean tanks with high-pressure water jets, are widely used. Some systems use rotating high-pressure water jets to spray hot water on all the internal surfaces of the tank. As the spraying takes place, the liquid <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> out of the tank.|$|E

50|$|According to the Water Supply Commission of Pennsylvania, in 1914 the {{colliery}} {{was still}} {{operated by the}} Kingston Coal Co., producing about 225 tons of coal per day. Slush and waste water <b>were</b> <b>pumped</b> into three boreholes, rather than into Brown's Creek, and washwater <b>was</b> <b>pumped</b> from the Susquehanna River, 23,000,000 gallons in four months.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{metering}} <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> piston-driven. Piston <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> {{positive displacement}} <b>pumps</b> which can <b>be</b> designed to <b>pump</b> at practically constant flow rates (averaged over time) against {{a wide range}} of discharge pressure, including high discharge pressures of thousands of psi.|$|R
5|$|The Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), is a {{subsidiary}} of Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA), established 23 April 1978 under the Development of Cities Act 1976. 2015 estimates indicate that WASA provides about 72% of the city's sewerage services and about 60% of their water services. The existing production capacity of WASA is , almost {{all of which is}} drawn from wells located in the old beds of the Chenab River. From the wells, water <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> to a terminal reservoir located on Sargodha Road. Water is normally supplied for a total of about 8 hours per day to the majority of the city. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has provided financial and hardware equipment to help improve the water and sanitation conditions in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{systemic}} {{heart has}} muscular contractile walls {{and consists of}} a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.|$|E
5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E

5|$|Water is {{essential}} to a thermal power station, heated to create steam to turn the steam turbines. Water used in the boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on site. Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from the nearby River Ouse. Water <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> from the river by a pumphouse on the river, north of the station. Once it has been through the condenser, the water is cooled {{by one of the}} natural draft cooling towers, with two towers serving each generating set. Once cooled, the water is discharged back into the river.|$|E
5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood <b>is</b> <b>pumped</b> through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
