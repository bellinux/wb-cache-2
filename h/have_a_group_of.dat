25|$|Multiple mating is {{also seen}} in wattled jacanas where females <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> males close by for mating. Copulations are easily seen in jacanas facilitating the {{observation}} of females copulating continuously with various males. The continuous copulations and the close proximity to mates have allowed the females to fly in within minutes leading to the expected sperm mixing and allowing the most viable sperm to fertilize most of the clutch or to increase genetic diversity for benefits in disease resistance. Snow and Andrade (2005) concluded that the redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti) increases their ability to manipulate the paternity of their offspring by using the spermathecae to store multiple sperms. Additionally, a study on leaf-cutting ants (Acromyrmex echinatior) supported the hypothesis that sperm mixing indeed occurs in polyandrous social insects. It was further found that the eggs in the queen ants showed to be completely mixed and used randomly during egg laying.|$|E

[...] The scene additionally suggests [...] "a more positive view of the Church than found in Hugo's novel" [...] as it provides outcasts such as Esmeralda with both shelter and sanctuary.|$|E

2500|$|Probiotic {{treatment}} of bacterial vaginosis is the application or ingestion of bacterial species {{found in the}} healthy vagina to cure the infection of bacteria causing bacterial vaginosis. This treatment {{is based on the}} observation that 70% of healthy females <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> bacteria in the genus Lactobacillus that dominate the population of organisms in the vagina. Currently, the success of such treatment has been mixed since the use of probiotics to restore healthy populations of Lactobacillus has not been standardized. [...] Often, standard antibiotic treatment is used {{at the same time that}} probiotics are being tested. [...] In addition, some groups of women respond to treatment based upon ethnicity, age, number of sexual partners, pregnancy, and the pathogens causing bacterial vaginosis. In 2013 researchers found that administration of hydrogen peroxide producing strains, such as L. acidophilus and L. rhamnosus, were able to normalize vaginal pH and rebalance vaginal flora, preventing and alleviating bacterial vaginosis.|$|E

2500|$|By this time, however, Odoacer had to {{have lost}} all hope of victory. A {{large-scale}} sortie out of Ravenna {{on the night of}} 9/10 July 491 ended in failure with the death of his commander-in-chief Livilia along with the best of his Herulian soldiers. On 29 August 492, the Goths were about to assemble enough ships at Rimini to set up an effective blockade of Ravenna. Despite these decisive losses, the war dragged on until 25 February 493 when John, bishop of Ravenna, was able to negotiate a treaty between Theoderic and Odoacer to occupy Ravenna together and share joint rule. After a three-year siege, Theoderic entered the city on 5 March; Odoacer was dead ten days later, slain by Theoderic while they shared a meal. Theoderic had plotted to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> his followers kill him while the two kings were feasting together in the imperial palace of Honorius [...] "Ad Laurentum" [...] ("At the Laurel Grove"); when this plan went astray, Theoderic drew his sword and struck him on the collarbone.

[...] Theoderic was said to have stood over the body of his dead rival and exclaimed, [...] "There certainly wasn't a bone in this wretched fellow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Li Zhi's {{two older}} {{brothers}} by Empress Zhangsun, Li Chengqian the Crown Prince and Li Tai the Prince of Wei, were locked in an intense rivalry, as Li Tai was favored by Emperor Taizong for his talent {{and was trying to}} displace Li Chengqian. [...] Li Chengqian, in fear, entered into a conspiracy with the general Hou Junji, his uncle Li Yuanchang (李元昌) the Prince of Han, the imperial guard commander Li Anyan (李安儼), and his brothers-in-law Zhao Jie (趙節, who was also his cousin) and Du He (杜荷) to overthrow Emperor Taizong. [...] The plot was discovered in 643, and Emperor Taizong deposed Li Chengqian. [...] He was initially going to make Li Tai the new crown prince, but later began to believe that Li Tai's machinations were responsible for Li Chengqian's downfall. [...] The powerful chancellor Zhangsun Wuji – Empress Zhangsun's brother—suggested that he make Li Zhi crown prince, a possibility that Li Tai was apprehensive about. [...] Li Tai tried to intimidate Li Zhi, who had been friendly with Li Yuanchang, by pointing out to Li Zhi that Li Yuanchang {{had been part of the}} plot and that he should be concerned for himself. [...] When Emperor Taizong noticed Li Zhi worrying about this and was told by Li Zhi of Li Tai's intimidation, Emperor Taizong's mind became set. [...] He exiled Li Tai, and on 30 April, 643, he created Li Zhi the new crown prince. [...] He made Zhangsun and two other senior chancellors, Fang Xuanling and Xiao Yu, senior advisors to Li Zhi, and made another chancellor, Li Shiji, the head of Li Zhi's household. [...] At the advice of another key official, Liu Ji, who pointed out that the crown prince needed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> well-learned scholars that he was close to, Emperor Taizong appointed Liu, as well as Cen Wenben, Chu Suiliang, and Ma Zhou, to serve as Li Zhi's friends and advisors.|$|E

6000|$|Nevertheless, {{there is}} another faculty in the savage, to which I have already alluded, common to him and to at least the higher vertebrates--fancy; the power of {{reproducing}} internal images of external objects, whether in its waking form of physical memory--if, indeed, all memory be not physical--or in its sleeping form of dreaming. Upon this last, which has played so very important a part in superstition in all ages, I beg you to think a moment. Recollect your own dreams during childhood; and recollect again that the savage is always a child. Recollect {{how difficult it was}} for you in childhood, how difficult it must be always for the savage, to decide whether dreams are phantasms or realities. To the savage, I doubt not, the food he eats, the foes he grapples with, in dreams, are as real as any waking impressions. But, moreover, these dreams will be very often, as children's dreams are wont to be, of a painful and terrible kind. Perhaps they will be always painful; perhaps his dull brain will never dream, save under the influence of indigestion, or hunger, or an uncomfortable attitude. And so, in addition to his waking experience of the terrors of nature, he will have a whole dream-experience besides, of a still more terrific kind. He walks by day past a black cavern mouth, and thinks, with a shudder--Something ugly may live in that ugly hole: what if it jumped out upon me? He broods over the thought with the intensity of a narrow and unoccupied mind; and a few nights after, he has eaten--but let us draw a veil before the larder of a savage--his chin is pinned down on his chest, a slight congestion of the brain comes on; and behold he finds himself again at that cavern's mouth, and something ugly does jump out upon him: and the cavern is a haunted spot henceforth to him and to all his tribe. It is in vain that his family tell him that he has been lying asleep at home all the while. He has the evidence of his senses to prove the contrary. He must have got out of himself, and gone into the woods. When we remember that certain wise Greek philosophers could find no better explanation of dreaming than that the soul left the body, and wandered free, we cannot condemn the savage for his theory. Now, I submit that in these simple facts we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> [...] "true causes" [...] which are the roots of all the superstitions of the world.|$|E
