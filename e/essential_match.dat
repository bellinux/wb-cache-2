A conditio sine qua non for a solution of this are very robust object recognition schemes.

Comparisons of the DNA sequences of unrelated ARS elements from {{different regions of the}} genome have revealed no significant DNA sequence conservation.

In the cases of ARS 305, ARS 307, and ARS 309, previously identified functional elements were found to be conserved in their S. carlsbergensis homologs.

However, autophagy induction is slow relative to the reduction of nutrient uptake, suggesting that cells must engage additional adaptive mechanisms to respond initially to growth factor depletion. We describe an acute biophysical response to growth factor withdrawal, characterized by a simultaneous decrease in cell volume and increase in cell density, which occurs before autophagy initiation and is observed in both FL 5. 12 Bcl-xL cells depleted of IL- 3 and primary CD 8 + T cells depleted of IL- 2 that are differentiating toward memory cells.

40|$|As the {{incidence}} of water deficit and heat stress increases in many production regions there is an increasing requirement for crops adapted to these stresses. Thus it is <b>essential</b> to <b>match</b> water supply and demand, particularly during grain-filling. Here we integrate Grime’s ecological strategies approach with traditional drought resistance/yield component frameworks describing plant responses to water deficit. We demonstrate that water use {{is a function of}} both short and longer term trade-offs between competing demands for carbon. Agricultural crop adaptation is based on escape. Rapid growth rates and high reproductive investment maximize yield, and stress is avoided through a closely regulated, climate-appropriate annual phenology. Crops have neither the resources nor morphological capacity to withstand long periods of intense water deficit. Thus, under terminal drought, yield potential is traded off against drought escape, such that drought postponing and/or tolerance traits which extend the growing season and/or divert source from reproductive sinks are maladaptive. However, these traits do play a supporting role against transient water deficits, allowing longer season cultivars to survive by mining water through deeper roots, or restricting transpiration. Recognizing these trade-offs made within escape-strategy limits will allow breeders to integrate complementary adaptive traits to transient and terminal water deficits...|$|R
