5|$|Community ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the woolly hare(Lepus oiostolus),but is now {{treated as a}} separate species. Cai and Feng (1982) and Wang(1985) elevated it to species status based on morphological and ecological differences from the woolly hare. In 2005, {{it was found that}} molecular phylogenetics indicated the Yunnan hare and the woolly hare to be sister taxa, and they may exhibit allopatric speciation or parapatric speciation. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be related to the Indian hare (Lepus nigricollis) and probably be its northern form.|$|E
5|$|The {{main belt}} armour would {{normally}} taper {{to a lesser}} thickness {{along the side of}} the hull towards bow and stern; <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> taper up from the central citadel towards the superstructure. The deck was typically lightly armoured with 2 to 4inches of steel. This lighter armour was to prevent high-explosive shells from wrecking the superstructure of the ship.|$|E

However, because nonspecific duct widening is common <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be <b>also</b> coincidental finding in many processes.|$|R
5|$|The Permanent Court of International Justice was {{provided}} {{for by the}} Covenant, but not established by it. The Council and the Assembly established its constitution. Its judges were elected by the Council and the Assembly, and its budget {{was provided}} by the latter. The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> give an advisory opinion on any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or the Assembly. The Court was open to all {{the nations of the world}} under certain broad conditions.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Potemkin's {{scheme to}} develop a Russian {{presence}} in the rapidly disintegrating state of Persia failed. Plans for a full-scale invasion had previously been cut back and a small unit sent to establish a trading post there was quickly turned away. Potemkin focused instead on Russia's southern provinces, where he was busy founding cities (including Sevastopol) and creating his own personal kingdom, including his brand new Black Sea Fleet. That kingdom was about to expand: under the Treaty of Kuçuk Kainarji, which had ended the previous Russo-Turkish war, the Crimean Khanate had become independent, though effectively under Russian control. In June 1782 it was descending again into anarchy. By July 1783, Potemkin had engineered the peaceful annexation of the Crimea and Kuban, capitalizing {{on the fact that}} Britain and France were fighting elsewhere. The Kingdom of Georgia accepted Russian protection a few days later with the Treaty of Georgievsk searching for protection against Persia's aim to reestablish its suzerainty over Georgia; the Karabakh Khanate of Persia initially looked as though <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>also,</b> but eventually declined Russian help. Exhausted, Potemkin collapsed into a fever he barely survived. Catherine rewarded him with one hundred thousand roubles, which he used to construct the Tauride Palace in St. Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Townsend {{subsequently}} then {{reported that}} he was facing a force of at least battalion-strength with support weapons—likely D445 Battalion—while the level of proficiency indicated that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> include North Vietnamese Army (NVA) elements. However, due to earlier warnings that the Viet Cong were preparing to attack Nui Dat that evening, {{prior to the start}} of the operation Graham had ordered Townsend to return to base that afternoon, and this restriction remained extant. Likewise, with Operation Renmark scheduled to start the following morning, A Company 5 RAR—then at Dat Do protecting the artillery—would also need to be released before nightfall, adding to the requirement to conclude the operation that afternoon. Regardless, this restriction had only served to make B Company's task all the more difficult, with Mackay facing demands to complete the action while at the same time not become decisively engaged and unable to withdraw his company. At 16:17 Townsend was ordered to prepare his battalion for a helicopter extraction which was due to begin an hour later, while at 17:15 he was ordered to break contact immediately, however this proved impossible as 5 Platoon remained in heavy contact. Mackay now estimated that he would be unable to get forward to support the beleaguered platoon for a further 30 minutes; however, by 17:50 he realised that the Viet Cong had moved between them and A Company. Yet even while the Viet Cong continued to heavily engage both A and B Companies, the remainder of the Australian battalion and the APCs were beginning to line up on the landing zone in preparation for returning to Nui Dat. The order was finally rescinded when it became clear that both companies were unable to break-off the engagement. Meanwhile, a number of bush fires were now burning through the area, detonating discarded ammunition and adding to the noise of the battle.|$|E

50|$|In {{academic}} circles, Bernard is revered more as {{a philosopher}} than as a medical doctor. This might be because his major writing, even if written in his youth, {{is more of a}} philosophical nature than anything else. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> be <b>also</b> {{due to the fact that}} Bernard is generally eclipsed by his more well-known contemporary, Joseph Demarco.|$|R
25|$|Frederick Busch {{asserts that}} Mailer {{has created a}} voice that speaks about Sam, and <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> {{represent}} Mailer in some ways. The problem, states Busch, is Mailer wants to speak about his own difficulties writing, but needs to objectify his voice {{in order to create}} fiction and not autobiography. Thus, he not only analyzes the characters' feelings, but also his own.|$|E
25|$|This {{would have}} the {{opposite}} effects: expand the area available for tropical species; kill temperate species or force them to migrate towards the poles; possibly cause severe extinctions of polar species; often make the Earth's climate wetter on average, mainly by melting ice and snow and thus increasing {{the volume of the}} water cycle. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> cause anoxic events in the oceans (see below).|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} {{trials and}} flight tests in 2010 led ADE to further improve the bomb's accuracy. The Indian Air Force is upgrading {{a large number}} of unguided bombs to this standard based on the successful results. Sudarshan will be in service with the IAF bombers squadrons of Mig-27 and SEPECAT Jaguar. Also, several other fighters in the IAF could carry these bombs for the air-to-ground attack tasks like Su-30MKI, Mirage-2000 and MiG-29. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be used by the Indian Army for its long range artillery strike weapon and Indian Navy from an on-board launcher.|$|E
50|$|Ras il-Wardija was {{probably}} first inhabited in the Bronze Age, in around 1500 BC. In around the 3rd century BC, during the Punic period, a religious complex (probably a nymphaeum) {{was established in}} the area. Since the site is clearly visible from the sea, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>also</b> served as a beacon for ships travelling between the Maltese Islands and North Africa.|$|R
50|$|Bernard Weish or Bernard Weiss (or Bernhard, or Weis, {{depending}} on who cited him) was a fictional linguist invented by unknown(s) in order to back the theories that differentiate between Valencian and the Catalan language, but <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be <b>also</b> possible the reversed possibility: it was created by an opposer of the Language secessionism to ridicule it and the Blaverists did not realise it.|$|R

25|$|As in 1691, five large armies {{were created}} for the five major fronts of the war: Flanders, the Moselle, the Rhine, Piedmont, and Roussillon. To these was added a further force in Flanders to attack {{what was to be}} France’s major goal for 1692, the {{important}} Sambre–Meuse fortress of Namur. The capture of the fortress would not only give control of the vicinity to France, but <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> inspire the Dutch to make peace; if its capture did not lead to immediate talks, it would nevertheless be an important pawn at any future negotiations.|$|E
25|$|The Bridge of Asses (Pons Asinorum) {{states that}} in {{isosceles}} triangles the angles {{at the base}} equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. Its name {{may be attributed to}} its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.|$|E
25|$|The raid on Babylon {{could not}} have been {{intended}} to exercise sovereignty over the region; it was simply too far from Anatolia and the Hittites' center of power. It is thought, however, that the raid on Babylon brought an end to the Amorite dynasty of Hammurabi and allowed the Kassites to take power, and so might have arisen from an alliance with the Kassites or an attempt to curry favor with them. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be that Mursili undertook the long-distance attack for personal motives, namely as a way to outdo the military exploits of his predecessor, Hattusili I.|$|E
25|$|Murdoch {{was more}} of an {{off-side}} player whose drives and cut strokes were regarded as among the best of his day; but his leg-side play was reputedly not so strong, and his ability against good spin bowling was not as impressive as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be. <b>Also,</b> he was believed to be lacking in command against top-class pace bowling on difficult wickets; if conditions, were perfect, however, his batting often followed suit.|$|R
50|$|To summarize, {{mathematical}} {{modeling and}} theoretical analysis of large-scale electrophysiological activity provide tools for predicting the spread and migration of hypersynchronous brain activity, {{which can be}} useful for diagnostic evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> be <b>also</b> useful for predicting migration and spread of electrical activity over large regions {{of the brain that}} occur during deep sleep (Delta wave), cognitive activity and in other functional settings.|$|R
25|$|A {{possible}} explanation for the origin of the Milbanke Sound Group is that it reflects a northern extension of the north-west trending subduction-related Garibaldi Volcanic Belt further south. This in turn is a segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc in the United States, which includes Mount Baker and Mount St. Helens. However, there is currently not enough data to support this suggestion. <b>Its</b> origins <b>might</b> <b>also</b> result from other tectonic processes that are currently not understood.|$|R
25|$|This custody {{occurred}} in a period when, urged on by Bishop Clement, King Alexander II of Scotland had become more assertive in the area, particularly in relation to overlordship over its MacDougall ruler, Eóghan of Argyll. The events of that decade thus may have induced Eóghan, at Clement's urging, to send a kinsman to be trained as a Dominican, and Laurence was indeed {{the first of three}} Dominican bishops of Argyll in the following century, another of whom {{appears to have been a}} MacDougall also. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be noted that the bishopric of Dunblane was partly dedicated to St Laurence, after whom Laurence may have been named.|$|E
25|$|Robert Skidelsky {{offered an}} {{endorsement}} of Corbyn's proposals to carry out QE through a National Investment Bank with minor quibbles. As the policy would change the central bank's focus on stabilising prices, however, {{it has been argued}} it would increase the perceived risk of investing in the UK and raise the prospect of increased inflation. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> clash with Article 123 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty which prevents central banks from printing money to finance government spending and could cause a legal battle with the European Court of Justice, although {{it has been argued that}} money wouldn't be printed and would be issued in the form of bonds.|$|E
25|$|Breakfast (quraac) is an {{important}} meal for Somalis, who often start the day with some style of tea (shahie) or coffee (qaxwa). The tea is often {{in the form of}} haleeb shai (Yemeni milk tea) in the north. The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread (canjeero or canjeelo) similar to Ethiopian injera, but smaller and thinner. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>also</b> be eaten with a stew (maraqe) or soup. Qado or lunch is often elaborate. Varieties of bariis (rice), the most popular probably being basmati, usually serve as the main dish alongside goat or lamb. Spices like cumin, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and garden sage are used to aromatize these different rice delicacies. Somalis eat dinner as late as 9 pm. During Ramadan, supper is often served after Tarawih prayers; sometimes as late as 11 pm.|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "papé" [...] {{might come}} from Latin Pape, an old Roman term for [...] "emperor", or [...] "father". The double mention of [...] "papé" [...] {{together}} with [...] "Satan" [...] (here {{interpreted as the}} fallen angel Satan) and the break (the comma) in the hendecasyllable, gives it a tone of a prayer or an invocation to Satan, {{although there is no}} apparent verb. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> be <b>also</b> an invocation of the evil within the intruders.|$|R
