25|$|The outsole is {{the layer}} in {{direct contact with}} the <b>ground.</b> <b>Dress</b> shoes often have leather or resin rubber outsoles; casual or work-oriented shoes have outsoles made of natural rubber or a {{synthetic}} material like polyurethane. The outsole may comprise a single piece, or may be an assembly of separate pieces, often of different materials. On some shoes, the heel of the sole has a rubber plate for durability and traction, while the front is leather for style. Specialized shoes will often have modifications on this design: athletic or so called cleated shoes like soccer, rugby, baseball and golf shoes have spikes embedded in the outsole to improve traction.|$|R

After McDonald's death, his widow sold part of the land to Seargent George MacDonald (no relation), who in turn sold it to Henry Bowerman and Charles Campbell. Bowerman developed an orchard and vineyard on the land, and he built the Broadoaks homestead on the hill immediately west of present-day Rydalmere East Public School, with sweeping views of Parramatta River. The remainder of McDonald's land was purchased by E. B. Miller, who built Rose Farm in Honor Street.|$|R

50|$|Before Life {{looks at}} girls from The Cape Flats, (a vast area {{outlying}} Cape Town, {{often described as}} apartheid's dumping <b>ground,)</b> <b>dressed</b> up for their Matric Dance (South Africa's equivalent of The Prom). In this area, still haunted by all the attendant problems of poverty and displaced communities, the night is a seminal moment for most matriculants and their families. For many families, the youngster {{may be the first}} member of their family ever to have completed school, previous generations having been disadvantaged by the apartheid era education system and economic conditions. For others, especially in the cases of more impoverished families, it may primarily be a night of fantasy escapism, a chance to live out their dreams through costume and styling, their first and possibly their last real opportunity to dress up no holds-barred and be the centre of attention. Through her use of stage lighting the youngsters against their home backdrops, de Clermont raises questions about whether such hinterlands can be merely backdrops or whether these environments will in fact swallow the youngster back up, once the spotlights have been switched off.|$|R
