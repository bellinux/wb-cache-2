25|$|Though Paules {{highlights}} the positive consequences of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> {{for a specific}} population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of participant observation research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that casino waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> in the workplace. Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous tipping system, both casino owners and customers control waitresses' behavior and appearance for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management {{makes it difficult to}} change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.|$|E
25|$|According to Larson and Yao (2005), empathy should {{characterize}} physicians' {{interactions with}} their patients because, despite advancement in medical technology, the interpersonal relationship between physicians and patients remains essential to quality healthcare. Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians consider empathy {{a form of}} <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> Specifically, according to Larson and Yao (2005), physicians engage in <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> through deep acting by feeling sincere empathy before, during, and after interactions with patients. On the other hand, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians engage in surface acting when they fake empathic behaviors toward the patient. Although Larson and Yao (2005) argue that deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when sincere empathy for patients is impossible. Overall, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians are more effective and enjoy more professional satisfaction when they engage in empathy through deep acting due to <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Emotional</b> <b>labor</b> {{also affects}} women by perpetuating {{occupational}} segregation and the gender wage gap. Job segregation, {{which is the}} systematic tendency {{for men and women}} to work in different occupations, is often cited as the reason why women lack equal pay when compared to men. According to Guy and Newman (2004), occupational segregation and ultimately the gender wage gap can at least be partially attributed to <b>emotional</b> <b>labor.</b> Specifically, work-related tasks that require emotional work thought to be natural for women, such as caring and empathizing are requirements of many female-dominated occupations. However, according to Guy and Newman (2004), these feminized work tasks are not a part of formal job descriptions and performance evaluations. The emotion work expected of many female employees is essentially invisible and uncompensated while the employer gains profit more generally. Thus, according to Guy and Newman (2004), ignored and uncompensated <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> is at least one underlying cause for both occupational gender segregation and the gender wage gap.|$|E

A total number of three hundred and fifty participants who were selected randomly answered the questionnaires. Two hundred eighty nine questionnaires were used for analysis. The instrument to measure employees ‟ emotional intelligence was the MSEIS 1 (Schutte, Malouff, & Hall, 1998), and the Grikson 2 (1983) was used to gather information about employees ‟ job satisfaction. Also, Alen and Mayer's questionnaire (1990) was considered in order to collect employees ‟ commitment data.

Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and identity. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used humor or exaggeration to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.|$|E
25|$|When public administrators perform <b>emotional</b> <b>labor,</b> many {{scholars}} argue administrators {{are dealing with}} significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The {{reason for this is}} because they are {{on the front lines of}} the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers.

40|$|Vaccines {{are often}} heralded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} success stories of modern medicine. Yet public concerns have surfaced recently, in part because of the declining incidence of many target diseases, but also in response to increasing questions about safety. Public health messages designed to encourage vaccination often assume that parents are unaware of the risks and consequences of the diseases; that those who harbor doubts or reserva-tions about vaccine safety are irrational, <b>emotional,</b> or <b>laboring</b> under misconceptions; or that skeptics are being manipulated by a well-orchestrated campaign by antivaccination groups. This project explores how parents assess probabilistic information on vaccine risks and benefits and what may drive them to consider some possible outcomes as worst cases, leading them to deviate from official recommendations. Semistructured interviews with 20 parents indicate that parents employ both probabilistic and possibilistic thinking, but that the contextual factors that influence their interpretation of that information vary. Trust is an especially important contextual factor; parents struggling with vaccination decisions describe the importance of trust at multiple levels—in the vaccine, in their doctor, and in the broader public health policy network...|$|R

25|$|According to Martin (1999), {{police work}} {{involves}} {{substantial amounts of}} <b>emotional</b> <b>labor</b> by officers, who must control their own facial and bodily displays of emotion {{in the presence of}} other officers and citizens. Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically masculine work that focuses on fighting crime, policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much anger, sympathy, or other emotion while dealing with danger on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work. While being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective interpersonal skills to gain citizen trust and compliance.

40|$|The cases {{discussed}} here represent {{very few of}} the guardianship arrangements that characterized intergenerational and interracial households in territorial Washington, yet the patterns they illustrate correspond with other evidence that allows historians to track the distribution of Indian and mixed- race children in the Puget Sound region. Th e 1880 federal census schedules for counties bordering the Puget Sound reveals the informal guardianship of Native women’s children in ninetytwo households. Among these extralegal arrangements were forty- two households headed by white men, some single like Ed Boggess and others married to white women like Phoebe Judson, who classified the indigenous and/or métis minors in their homes as “adopted” children or as boarders, laborers, and servants. Thirty- five interracial households housed children not fathered by the white head of household but related in some way to adult Indian women in the home. Like the Franks and the Fitzgeralds, these métis families reported minor wards as extended kin— nieces, in- laws, and cousins— and occasionally as family “visitors” or “adopted” children. Fourteen indigenous households reported children not their own, usually as extended kin or simply as children with other surnames, leaving their relationships undefined, as William and Annie Newton did. Though these households comprise a mere 1 percent of those enumerated in Puget Sound counties, they affirm that citizen, métis, and Native families valued the economic and <b>emotional</b> <b>labors</b> Indian women’s children provided. Some of these household heads no doubt exploited the minors in their homes, using them much as indentured servants, while others ensured their survival at the peak of settler-colonist dispossession in the Pacific Northwest, treating them much like their own kin. In combination with the guardianship cases discussed above, they also affirm the flexibility of guardianship as a localized and temporary arrangement, and they confirm métis and Native families’ ability to use guardianship as a means to retain custody of minor relatives. Among the arrangements formalized in probate courts and reported in census schedules, the slim majority of children found homes in interracial or Indian households. For this reason, proponents of racial uplift and tribal assimilation could not possibly have found the guardianship system an eff ective tool of colonization. 42 Collectively, these cases demonstrate that Native and métis families managed to use guardianship as a means to navigate the shifting categories of race and power during the early stages of settler- colonialism before federal interventions accelerated and institutionalized indigenous child removal. Though children like Nora Jewell suffered the extreme abuses that the guardianship system could orchestrate, the flexible nature of guardianship allowed other wards to escape potential abuse and exploitation, to retain ties to indigenous communities and relatives, and to appropriate racial- ethnic fluidity during Washington’s territorial period. As Indian officials became more concerned with documenting family lineage and managing tribal membership rolls and allotment patents, extralegal and flexible guardianship arrangements would diminish, and federal officials, philanthropic organizations, and social welfare agents joined forces to institutionalize indigenous child removal and absolve Native maternal authority. As the twentieth-century studies in this issue reveal, indigenous mothers and their families would find ways to resist those systems of dispossession as well...|$|R

This dissertation examines variations in emotional and informational responsiveness by service representatives in telephone service interactions in retail banking. Emotional responsiveness is found to be detrimental to organizational and customer outcomes, while informational responsiveness is found to be beneficial for complex calls. Emotional responsiveness is influenced by individual differences, in-group membership and managerial influence. Informational responsiveness is affected by call complexity and service representative gender. ^ The research design is multi-method and field-based.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2015. Major: Art History. Advisor: Jane Blocker. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 367 pages. This dissertation examines {{the ways in}} which postwar art historical discourses routinely trivialize feminine creative, <b>emotional,</b> and physical <b>labor,</b> as well as the artists whose work is associated with this labor. It takes form of five case studies, each of which coheres around a different type of feminized laborer, including the domestic, the cook, the entertainer, the hostess, and the widow. It asserts that the labor that characterizes these roles gets written over by art historical practices that cannot conceive of time as doing anything but moving forward, of radicality as involving anything other than rejection of the past and of artistic and social conventions, and of the art object as anything other than autonomously authored and produced. These case studies do not correspond with an examination of four independent artists. Rather, they emulate the gendered work of American kin-work, a set of sustaining practices identified and studied by social scientists since the eighties. Each chapter traces a network of relations between artists whose affiliations are not legible within traditional art historical narratives. The artists who populate this study include a selection of those whose work has been trivialized {{on the basis of its}} affiliation with feminized labor, such as Janet Sobel, Lee Krasner, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Charlotte Moorman, and J Morgan Puett. These artist's careers span the transition from modernist to postmodernist art practices and several generations of feminist thought. These figures do not just serve to represent exclusion, however. Nor is it this project's goal to rescue them from obscurity. When we hold back, in order to survey what art historical narratives have left behind, we find that these remains offer alternative methods of meaning making, methods that abide by, rather than seek to dispel, obscurity. This project looks to other contemporary artists whose work addresses itself to the erasure of feminized creative, <b>emotional,</b> and physical <b>labor</b> [...] including Theaster Gates, Carrie Mae Weems, Lorna Simpson, and Dario Robleto [...] to develop these historical methods...|$|R

For men, taking an interest in greeting cards can seem like discrediting behavior for heterosexual masculinity, and so the belief that “men are bad at cards” circulates as one way of asserting gender difference. The greeting card industry reinforces this gendered view of greeting card communication, incorporating beliefs about gendered communication styles into its marketing, advertising, and card sentiments, and framing cards as a solution to the resulting communication gap.

A survey was constructed to assess the variables in the model. Responses were obtained from 265 service providers sampled from five different service industries and analyzed using structural equation modeling techniques. Results supported the links proposed in the theoretical model. Specifically, the EEE sequence was mediated by perceived hassles and moderated by provider tolerance for emotional dissonance and hassles.
