40|$|In {{the period}} of October 1, 1995 to December 31, 1995, {{additional}} progress was made in accomplishing the tasks of the project. In particular, the procedure for analyzing the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> elongated <b>particles</b> was developed. The <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ellipsoidal <b>particles</b> in an isotropic turbulent flow was analyzed. It was shown that the simulation data for the particle fluctuation velocity and diffusivity were in good agreement with the theoretical model predictions. The computational model for simulating particle motions in turbulent duct flows was further developed.

50|$|Ramnath Cowsik {{is known}} for his {{theories}} related to the big bang origin of the universe. He argued that, post the big bang, gravitationally dominant relicts were formed from the particles with finite rest mass, resulting in the formation of halos of dark matter with galaxies embedded within. He postulated that this would limit the sums of masses of neutrinos, a phenomenon known in the scientific world as the Cowsik-McClelland bound. These theories are said to have explained the velocity <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> of dark matter and reproduced the luminosity profiles and ratified the rotation curves of galaxies.|$|E
50|$|Rayleigh {{scattering}} {{is defined}} by a mathematical formula that requires the light-scattering particles to be far smaller than the wavelength of the light. For a <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> {{to qualify for the}} Rayleigh formula, the particle sizes need to be below roughly 40 nanometres (for visible light), and the particles may be individual molecules. Colloidal particles are bigger, and are in the rough vicinity of the size of a wavelength of light. Willis-Tyndall scattering, i.e. colloidal particle scattering, is much more intense than Rayleigh scattering due to the bigger particle sizes involved. The importance of the particle size factor for intensity {{can be seen in the}} large exponent it has in the mathematical statement of the intensity of Rayleigh scattering. If the colloid particles are spheroid, Willis-Tyndall scattering can be mathematically analyzed in terms of Mie theory, which admits particle sizes in the rough vicinity of the wavelength of light. Light scattering by particles of complex shape are described by the T-matrix method.|$|E

5000|$|These {{depend upon}} {{analysis}} of the [...] "halo" [...] of diffracted light produced when a laser beam passes through a <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> in air or in a liquid. The angle of diffraction increases as particle size decreases, so that this method is particularly good for measuring sizes between 0.1 and 3,000 μm. Advances in sophisticated data processing and automation have allowed this to become the dominant method used in industrial PSD determination. This technique is relatively fast and can be performed on very small samples. A particular advantage is that the technique can generate a continuous measurement for analyzing process streams.Laser diffraction measures particle size distributions by measuring the angular variation in intensity of light scattered as a laser beam passes through a dispersed particulate sample. Large particles scatter light at small angles relative to the laser beam and small particles scatter light at large angles, as illustrated below. The angular scattering intensity data is then analyzed to calculate {{the size of the}} particles responsible for creating the scattering pattern, using the Mie theory of light scattering. The particle size is reported as a volume equivalent sphere diameter.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{joining the}} team at the MGH Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MGH-NMR) Center, Kwong pursued an {{interest}} in perfusion (the distribution of blood an nutrients to tissue) and diffusion (the detection of random <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles,</b> principally water) in living tissues. Together with MIT graduate student Daisy Chien, and colleagues Richard Buxton, Tom Brady and Bruce Rosen {{he was one of}} the earliest entrants in the field of brain diffusion imaging, which itself was opened by the pioneering experiments of Denis Le Bihan. In a conference paper in 1988 at the Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine the MGH group was the first to demonstrate diffusion anisotropy in the human brain, stating, [...] "... we observed different diffusion patterns parallel and perpendicular to the midline of the brain, which was repeatable, and depended only on the direction of diffusion encoding gradient relative to the brain, regardless of which physical gradient was used.". This anisotropy itself is the fundamental principle underlying the modern method of MRI tractography and structural connectomics (the in vivo visualization the axonal fibers that connect neurons in the brain) [...] Chien and Kwong then used their early diffusion techniques to study human patients with stroke. In technically demanding circumstances (a low field MRI using conventional imaging, located in a parking lot trailer nearby the MGH) they were the first to demonstrate in human subjects the early drop in diffusivity seen in acute infarction in cats by Moseley.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> on the recrystallization {{behavior has}} been examined in industrially processed specimens of a Cu-Fe-P alloy(CDA 194). The specimens are produced through {{the steps of}} hot rolling, cold rolling, aging and final cold rolling. The γ→α martensitic transformation of small coherent γ-Fe precipitate particles which form on decreasing temperature during hot rolling is induced by subsequent cold rolling. Aging following the cold rolling produces fine γ-Fe particles, which are transformed to α-Fe by final cold rolling. The nucleation of recrystallization occurs predominantly at coarse Fe_ 3 P particles, observed after the hot rolling, larger than about 1 μm in diameter. A denser <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> smaller α-Fe <b>particles</b> shows a larger retarding effect on grain-boundary migration.

40|$|We {{consider}} pressure-driven {{flows in}} wide microchannels, and discuss how a transverse shear, generated by misaligned superhydrophobic walls, impacts cross-sectional spreading of Brownian particles. We show {{that such a}} transverse shear can induce an advective superdiffusion, which strongly enhances <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> compared to a normal diffusion, and that maximal cross-sectional spreading corresponds to a crossover between its subballistic and superballistic regimes. This allows us to argue that an advective superdiffusion {{can be used for}} boosting <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> at smaller Peclet numbers compared to known concepts of passive microfluidic mixing. This implies that our superdiffusion scenario allows one efficient mixing of much smaller particles or using much thinner microchannels than methods, which are currently being exploited.

Another study showed that nucleation theories could be applied, when the critical size is greater than 16 to 20 molecular formulas [32]. For different gas–liquid nucleation conditions, nucleation theories showed a consistent underestimation in the nucleation rates for different temperatures and supersaturations.
