40|$|The results {{presented}} in this note show the effect of twist and sweepback on the span load distribution over two <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing</b> models. The tests {{were made in the}} Atmospheric Wind Tunnel of the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. The data are taken from the results of an investigation dealing primarily with lateral stability.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had four}} engines {{mounted on a}} low inverted gull <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing,</b> high horizontal stabilizer, and a double vertical tail, based on the Blohm & Voss Ha 139 seaplane.|$|R
5000|$|When Air Ministry {{specification}} C.16/28 for a multi-engined bomber transport {{failed to}} produce a satisfactory replacement for the Vickers Victoria, the Ministry turned to monoplane designs. [...] Specification C.26/31 called for a twin-engined monoplane capable of carrying 24 soldiers and their gear over a range of 920 ml (1,480 km) at a speed of more than 95 mph (153 km/h). Handley Page, having had useful experience of constructing single-spar <b>monoplane</b> <b>wings</b> for their unsuccessful H.P.47 general-purpose bomber, realised that they could marry the fuselage of their failed contender for C.16/28, the H.P.43, to a <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing.</b> The result was designated the H.P.51.|$|R
50|$|The LVG E.I was a German two-seat {{monoplane}} of World War I. The E.I {{was unusual}} among monoplanes {{of its time}} in that it featured ailerons {{as opposed to the}} then-conventional (for <b>monoplanes)</b> <b>wing</b> warping.|$|R
50|$|The Torpille was {{considered}} an advanced design for its day. It had a wire-braced <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing</b> attached to a monocoque fuselage. The streamlined fuselage {{was the basis for}} the plane's appellation. Its powerplant was a 50 hp rotary engine.|$|R
50|$|The Nautilus had a high-set <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing</b> on a single-step hull, {{the wing}} being fabric covered and the hull all-metal. The {{aircraft}} was {{powered by a}} 720 hp (537 kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Xirs V-12 piston engine strut-mounted above the hull, driving a pusher propeller.|$|R

5000|$|In [...] "Stage II", {{the builder}} would add a 90-125 hp {{powerplant}} to the aircraft, mounted in a nacelle set on struts above the fuselage pod while retaining the flexible wing. In [...] "Stage III", the flexible wing {{would be replaced}} by a conventional, strut-braced <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing</b> mounted high on the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The Do R was {{a larger}} {{development}} of the Do J, with a larger high-mounted strut-braced <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing</b> and longer fuselage. All but the first three built also had four engines, {{in place of the}} Do J's two. The Do R could carry 19 passengers in two cabins; 11 in the forward cabin and eight in the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Grach-2 (Grach-Rook) - Students {{from the}} SKB MAI (Studencheskoye Konstruktorskoye Byuro Moskovskii Aviatsionii Institut Ordjonikidze - student {{construction}} bureau Moscow Aviation Institute Ordjonikidze) studied agricultural aircraft utilising the WIG effect. Their first effort, named Grach-2, was a standard An-2 fuselage mated to low-set [...]inverted gull. reverse-delta <b>monoplane</b> <b>wings</b> with couter, constant chord, dihedral sections and {{fitted with a}} t-tail.|$|R
25|$|Cantilever <b>monoplane</b> <b>wings</b> {{provided}} ample {{space to}} mount armament— and, being much more rigid {{than the old}} cable-braced wings, they afforded almost as steady a mounting as the fuselage. This new context also made the harmonisation of wing guns more satisfactory: producing a fairly narrow cone of fire in the close to medium ranges at which a fighter's gun armament was most effective.|$|R
50|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>monoplane</b> <b>wings</b> and flapsin deflecting propeller slipstreams downward is being conducted at theLangley Aeronautical Laboratory. A part of this investigation is reportedin references 1 and 2. The results of reference 1 indicate that a monoplanewing equipped with plain flaps and auxiliary vanes can deflect theslipstream through the large angles approaching the angles required forvertical take-off.|$|R
50|$|Similar in {{configuration}} to the company's earlier Comte AC-4, the Comte AC-8 {{was designed}} as a light transport for five passengers. It incorporated a braced high-wing <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing,</b> with a conventional tail unit and fixed tailwheel landing gear. The enclosed cabin had accommodation for a pilot and five passengers. The aircraft was powered by either a Wright J-6 or Lorraine radial engine.|$|R
50|$|The 920 was {{developed}} from the powered Oskbes Aviatika MAI 890 ultralight, which {{can also be used}} to aerotow the 920 glider. The 920 has a 90% parts commonality with the 890. The glider design uses a higher aspect ratio <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing</b> in place of the 890's biplane wing. It is intended to be a simple and robust student solo glider.|$|R
40|$|General {{methods of}} {{theoretical}} analysis of airplane spinning characteristics {{have been available}} for some time. Some of these methods of analysis might be used by designers to predict the spinning characteristics of proposed airplane designs if the necessary aerodynamic data were known. The present investigation, to determine the spinning characteristics of wings, is planned to include variations in airfoil sections, plan forms, and tip shapes of <b>monoplane</b> <b>wings</b> and variations in stagger, gap, and decalage for biplane cellules. The first series of tests, made on a rectangular Clark Y <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing,</b> are reported in reference 1. That report also gives {{an analysis of the}} data for predicting the probable effects of various important parameters on the spin for normal airplanes using such a wing. The present report is the second of the series. It gives the aerodynamic characteristics of a rectangular Clark Y biplane cellule in spinning attitudes and includes a discussion of the data, using the method of analysis given in reference 1...|$|R
25|$|The PIK-5 was a {{training}} glider produced in Finland in the 1940s and 1950s, equipping the country's gliding clubs with an aircraft greater in performance than primary gliders {{but less than}} competition sailplanes. The aircraft had a pod-and-boom configuration, with a high, strut-braced <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing</b> and a cruciform tail carried {{at the end of}} a tailboom that extended from a position high on the aft end of the pod.|$|R
50|$|The late 1950s saw a {{great leap}} in {{capability}} for the Chinese aviation industry with {{a wealth of}} indigeonously designed aircraft projects, {{one of which was}} the Capital-1. The Capital-1 bore a close resemblance to the contemporary Antonov An-14 Ptchelka, being twin-engined, twin-tailed with strut supported <b>monoplane</b> <b>wings</b> and fixed tricycle undercarriage, stub lower wing bracing the undercarriage and wing strutsand a podlike fuselage terminating in a boom carrying the tail-unit.|$|R
50|$|The MB.210 and MB.211 {{were the}} successors of the French Bloch MB.200 bomber built by Societé des Avions Marcel Bloch in the 1930s and {{differed}} primarily in being low <b>wing</b> <b>monoplanes</b> rather than high <b>wing</b> <b>monoplanes.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was a {{cantilever}} low <b>wing</b> <b>monoplane</b> with <b>wings</b> {{of straight}} tapered plan and with rounded tips. The undersides of the wings carried short span dive brakes {{outside of the}} full chord, narrow baths into which the main undercarriage retracted backwards, leaving the wheels partly exposed. In addition there were mid span, mid chord spoilers.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Pearse {{continued}} to work on constructing a tilt-rotor flying-machine for personal use – sometimes described as {{a cross between a}} windmill and a rubbish-cart. His design resembled an autogyro or helicopter, but involved a tilting propeller/rotor and <b>monoplane</b> <b>wings,</b> which, along with the tail, could fold to allow storage in a conventional garage. He intended the vehicle for driving on the road (like a car) as well for flying.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the end of}} the War, Hall and Tommy Thompson {{designed}} and developed the Convair Model 116 featured in Popular Mechanics magazine in 1946. The Model 116 consisted of a two-seat car body, powered by a rear-mounted 26 hp (19 kW) engine, with detachable <b>monoplane</b> <b>wings</b> and tail boom, fitted with their own tractor configuration 90 hp (67 kW) Franklin 4A4 (later 95 hp 4AL) engine driving a two bladed wooden propeller.|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} distribution tests {{described in}} this report, covering angles of attack up to 90 degrees, were made on a rectangular <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing</b> model in the atmospheric wind tunnel of the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. These tests indicate that a rectangular wing, by reason of its large tip loads, is uneconomical aerodynamically and structurally, has pronounced lateral instability above maximum lift, and is not adaptable to accurate calculation based on the classical wing theory.

50|$|In practice, {{since most}} wing warping designs {{involved}} flexing of structural members, they {{were difficult to}} control and liable to cause structural failure. Ailerons had begun to replace wing warping as the most common means of achieving lateral control as early as 1911, especially in biplane designs. <b>Monoplane</b> <b>wings</b> of the period were much more flexible, and proved more amenable to wing warping - but even for monoplane designs, ailerons became the norm after 1915.|$|R
50|$|Mixed {{construction}} low-wing <b>monoplane,</b> <b>wing</b> braced {{with short}} struts and wire. Fuselage of a steel frame, covered with canvas. Rectangular wings with rounded ends, of wooden construction, canvas covered, fitted with automatic slats and flaps. Wings were folding rearwards. Cab had two seats in tandem, with twin controls, under a common multi-part canopy. Fixed landing gear with a rear skid, main gear with aerodynamic covers. Inline engine in a fuselage nose, two-blade propeller.|$|R
50|$|Of {{very similar}} {{construction}} to the Grunau Baby, the Wolf had strut-braced high-set <b>monoplane</b> <b>wings</b> supported on a pylon aft of the cockpit. The hexagonal-section fuselage was constructed largely of wood with plywood skinning and {{the wings and}} tail surfaces were plywood-skinned {{back to the main}} spars with wooden-framed fabric-covered rear portions. The undercarriage consisted of rubber-sprung skids under the nose and tail with a fixed mainwheel aft of the loaded centre of gravity.|$|R
5000|$|Following on {{from the}} earlier Lorraine Hanriot LH.42 racing aircraft, Monsieur Louis Montlaur, {{at the behest of}} Lorraine Hanriot's parent organisation, the Société Générale Aéronautique (SGA), {{designed}} an aircraft with metal structure and skinning of similar layout to the LH.42. The mid-set <b>monoplane</b> <b>wings</b> had a single metal spar supporting wooden ribs which were fabric covered aft of the metal-skinned leading edge. The fuselage was a built up Duralumin structure with sheet metal skinning ...|$|R
5000|$|During the mid 1930s, the British Air Ministry {{formulated}} {{and released}} Specification P.13/36, which sought a twin-engine heavy-medium bomber suitable for [...] "world-wide use". Further {{requirements of the}} specification included the use of a mid-mounted cantilever <b>monoplane</b> <b>wing,</b> all-metal construction; the adoption of the in-development Rolls-Royce Vulture engine was also encouraged. In response, Handley Page produced the twin-engine HP56 design to meet Specification P.13/36. Handley Page aircraft designer George Volkert had responsibility for the design.|$|R
