Its music video was directed by Manson and W.I.Z. and sparked controversy for its violent depiction of an American football game between jocks and goths, with NME accusing it of being exploitative of the Columbine tragedy. Manson dismissed the claims as hype, and said: [...] "I'm trying to show that sports as well as music {{can be seen as}} violent, so <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>a</b> traditional black vs white, good vs evil theme for the video." [...] Manson appeared on an April 2001 episode of The O'Reilly Factor, where he once again denied that the band's music was responsible for Columbine. Bill O'Reilly argued that [...] "disturbed kids" [...] without direction from responsible parents could misinterpret the message of his music as endorsing the belief that [...] "when I'm dead [...] everybody's going to know me."
