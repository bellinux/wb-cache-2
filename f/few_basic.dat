5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games Retro said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce a <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then start building combat units, while the enemy starts with more buildings {{and the ability to}} immediately send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the basic units of the two sides are essentially identical and that the interface is clunky, but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E
5|$|Kiedis {{knew that}} the band's sound would inevitably change when Navarro joined. In June 1994, the band entered The Sound Factory, a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles, to record the album. The band completed a <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> tracks, when Kiedis began having difficulty singing. He had been through a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used; this caused him to relapse, and he once again became dependent on drugs. Kiedis had slipped from five years of sobriety and began reusing narcotics he'd sworn never to use again. The band took a short break from recording to perform at Woodstock '94, {{which was the first}} show Navarro played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E
5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E

The overscan and VBI are used for analog TV, for moderate and low bandwidths (including closed captioning in the VBI) respectively. DirectBand and RDS/RBDS are medium and narrow subcarriers used for analog FM radio. The EUREKA 147 and HD Radio standards both allow for datacasting on digital radio, defining a <b>few</b> <b>basics</b> but also allowing for later expansion.|$|R

5|$|Deir al-Balah was {{captured}} by the British Army following the surrender of Khan Yunis on 28 February 1917. By April an aerodrome and an army camp were established there and Deir al-Balah became a launching point for British forces against Ottoman-held Gaza and Beersheba {{to the north and}} northeast, respectively. Of the 25 British war cemeteries dating from World War I, one of the six largest was built in Deir al-Balah in March 1917. It continued to be used until March 1918 and contains a total of 724 graves. Deir al-Balah became a part of the British Mandate of Palestine starting in 1922. A municipal council to administer the town was established by the British authorities in 1946, but it had limited jurisdiction over civil affairs and provided a <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> services.|$|E
5|$|When {{recording}} was completed, Gridneff asked Boucher {{if he had}} {{any ideas}} for a further season of Star Cops. Boucher felt that were the series to continue he would like to extend the setting further out into the Solar System, visiting the Mars colonies and the Big Ring space colonies under construction. He intended to achieve this either by transferring one of the existing regular characters to the Mars colony or by introducing a new regular who would be based there. The second season was never developed beyond these <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> notions as it was clear to Boucher from an early stage that there was little prospect of the series being renewed. Following Star Cops, Boucher went on to work as script editor on the long-running ITV police drama The Bill before returning to freelance writing while Gridneff moved on to work on the BBC drama series The House of Eliott.|$|E

For these reasons, the Elders ban him from learning the ways of the Guild until a decision can be made on Bobbin's seventeenth birthday ("until his coming of age seventeen years hence," [...] as it is described in the game's audio drama). Hetchel, however, defies the Elders and secretly teaches him a <b>few</b> <b>basics</b> of weaving. This is where the game begins.|$|R

25|$|Compared to {{estimating}} performance {{which is}} very cost effective (thus useful in design), testing, while costly, {{is still the most}} precise method. Further, testing centrifugal compressor performance is very complex. Professional societies such as ASME (i.e. PTC–10, Fluid Meters Handbook, PTC-19.x), ASHRAE (ASHRAE Handbook) and API (ANSI/API 617-2002, 672-2007) have established standards for detailed experimental methods and analysis of test results.

40|$|Apollo 17 metric {{photographs}} {{provide the}} best available coverage for geologic interpretation of northern Mare Crisium and the northern Crisium basin. One region in particular, between Alhazen Crater and longitude 66 E, had previously been covered very poorly. The Apollo 17 photographs provide excellent monoscopic as well as stereoscopic viewing because of the favorably low sun illuminations (15 deg to 49 deg). These new photographic data allow the geology of the basin, the mare, and other nearby terrains to be reevaluated. This reexamination, together with data from continuing moon-wide photogeologic studies and analyses of returned rocks from Apollo landing sites, has produced a simple evolutionary picture of the region, expressed by fewer map units and explained by <b>fewer</b> <b>basic</b> processes than previously thought necessary...|$|R

Owing to the smaller lots employed in modern developments (especially in the Western US), Tudor Revival may be placed directly next to an unrelated style such as French or Italian Provincial, resulting in an eclectic mix.|$|E

He suggests instead that the Parthenon should be the model for philosophy, and advocates an explanatory model of philosophical activity rather than an argumentative or coercive one.|$|E

5000|$|Dari {{is a term}} long {{recommended}} by Afghan authorities to designate the Persian dialects spoken in Afghanistan, {{in contrast to the}} dialects spoken in neighboring Iran. Although still widely known as [...] "Farsi" [...] ("Persian") to its native speakers, the name was officially changed to Dari in 1964. Dari must not be confused with the dialect of Kabul, which is the dominant Persian dialect in Afghanistan. Apart from a <b>few</b> <b>basics</b> of vocabulary, however (and more Indo-Persian calligraphic styles in the Perso-Arabic script), there is little difference between formal written Persian of Afghanistan and of Iran. The term Dari is often loosely used for the characteristic spoken Persian of Afghanistan - in general the dialect of Kabul - but is best restricted to formal spoken registers (poetry, speeches, newscasts, and other broadcast announcements).|$|R
25|$|When {{the service}} {{initially}} launched with Diablo in November 30, 1996, Battle.net offered only a <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> services like chatting and game listings. Players could {{connect to the}} service, talk with other gamers and join multiplayer games of Diablo. Besides user account data, no game data was stored on the Battle.net servers. When a player connected to a game, they would be connecting directly to the other players in the game. No data was sent through the Battle.net servers. While this made the service quick and easy to use, it quickly led to widespread cheating since players using cheats could modify their game data locally. However, since there was an option to create private games, many players ended up playing with people they knew.|$|E

Lévi-Strauss had known Jakobson during their time together at the New School in New York during WWII and was influenced by both Jakobson's structuralism {{as well as the}} American anthropological tradition. In Elementary Structures he examined kinship systems from a structural point of view and demonstrated how apparently different social organizations were in fact different permutations of a <b>few</b> <b>basic</b> kinship structures.
