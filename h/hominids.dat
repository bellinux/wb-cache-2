5|$|Hominid {{is a short}} novel which {{contains}} one single and linear storyline. However, it is subdivided into seven chapters, each standing for a narrated day. The satirical character of the book stems from the underlying grotesque scenario, the speeches of Pitar and his fellow <b>hominids,</b> the mentioning of artifacts which {{have not yet been}} invented, and the numerous allusions to world history and literature.|$|E
5|$|In an African desert {{millions}} of years ago, a tribe of <b>hominids</b> is driven away from its water hole by a rival tribe. They awaken to find a featureless black monolith has appeared before them. Influenced by the monolith, they discover {{how to use a}} bone as a weapon and drive their rivals away from the water hole.|$|E
5|$|From an {{analysis}} of coastal deposits near Bundala in the Hambantota district in Sri Lanka, paleontologists have gathered secure evidence of prehistoric fauna in Sri Lanka by 125,000 BP. Excavations of the area have also yielded tools of quartz and chert probably belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic period. Consequently, some believe in {{the possibility that there}} were prehistoric humans in Sri Lanka from 500,000 BP or earlier, and consider it likely that they were on the island by 300,000 BP. Further analysis of ancient coastal sands in the north and south east of the island may yield evidence of such early <b>hominids.</b>|$|E
50|$|Paleogenetics {{opens up}} many new {{possibilities}} {{for the study of}} <b>hominid</b> evolution and dispersion. By analyzing the genomes of <b>hominid</b> remains, their lineage {{can be traced back to}} from where they came, or from where they share a common ancestor. The Denisova <b>hominid,</b> a species of <b>hominid</b> found in Siberia from which DNA was able to be extracted, may show signs of having genes that are not found in any Neanderthal nor Homo sapiens genome, possibly representing a new lineage or species of <b>hominid.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} archaeologists who are {{interested}} in early <b>hominid</b> often focus on African, European and East Asian or even Australian regions due to good <b>hominid</b> fossil preservation. It was not until the late 1800s that Dubois found the skull of Homo erectus in Java, Indonesia, and had plugged the Southeast Asian region into the spotlight. Despite the fact that these <b>hominid</b> are important to the human evolution on a global scale, yet a small number of archaeological works on early <b>hominid</b> had been conducted within the region. One possible explanation is that small number of <b>hominid</b> fossils had not been found in the region since then. However, in 2003 since the archaeologists found another <b>hominid</b> species on the island of Flores, Indonesia, this discovery has introduced many new theoretical approaches to the <b>hominid</b> evolution in the region and on the global scales.|$|R

5|$|From South Asia in general, {{there is}} secure {{evidence}} of such early settlement. Although not regarded as an anatomically modern Homo sapiens, a skull from the Central Narmada Valley in Madhya Pradesh, India, referred to as Narmada Man, is the first authenticated discovery of a late Middle Pleistocene (around 200,000 BP) hominid from South Asia. The discovery has sparked much debate regarding where it belongs in the taxonomic organisation of Pleicestone <b>hominids.</b> Its morphometric traits do not easily match those of Homo erectus, but they correlate with hominid specimens called archaic Homo sapiens, which include pre-Neanderthals from Europe and West Asia. Other classifications of the skull include Homo heidelbergensis and evolved Homo erectus, but the latter has been disputed by some as having no taxonomic meaning.|$|E
5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5â€“3 million years ago as <b>hominids</b> when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E
5|$|King and Jenner befriended American {{expatriate}} Joe Boyd, the {{promoter of}} the UFO Club, {{who was making}} {{a name for himself}} as one of the more important entrepreneurs on the British music scene. The newly hired booking agent, Bryan Morrison, and Boyd had proposed sending in better quality recordings. From Morrison's agency the band played a gig outside London for the first time. In November, the band performed the first (of many) strangely named concerts: Philadelic Music for Simian <b>Hominids,</b> a multimedia event arranged by the group's former landlord, Mike Leonard, at Hornsey College of Art. They performed at the Free School for the following two weeks, before performing at the Psychodelphia Versus Ian Smith event at the Roundhouse in December, arranged by the Majority Rule for Rhodesia Campaign, and an Oxfam benefit at the Albert Hall (the band's biggest venue up to this point).|$|E
5000|$|The (non-sentient) [...] "Vampire" [...] {{species of}} <b>hominid</b> on Ringworld uses rishathra to obtain prey. A {{powerful}} pheromone is released that brings any compatible <b>hominid</b> into an extreme state of arousal. The victim immediately attempts {{to mate with}} the nearest compatible <b>hominid,</b> usually the vampire. During this mating, the vampire gains sustenance by draining the victim's blood.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hominid</b> appears {{during one}} of the levels in The Behemoth's 2nd game, Castle Crashers, using a lance weapon based on his ray gun. He is playable to anyone who has also {{downloaded}} Alien <b>Hominid</b> HD on the XBLA version, while he is unlocked by completing said level on the PlayStation Network and Steam versions of the game. The green eyeball from an early boss fight also appears as an Animal Orb, firing lasers at enemies. <b>Hominid</b> appears as a playable character in Team Meat's Super Meat Boy, another game that originated as a flash game on Newgrounds. The Super Soviet Missile Mastar minigame from Alien <b>Hominid</b> was released as a free app for iOS on February 7, 2011. An improved version of the PDA Games minigame was released for iOS on December 9, 2011. Developer Tom Fulp has cited the PDA Games as being the inspiration for The Behemoth's third game, BattleBlock Theater, which features unlockable <b>Hominid</b> character heads for those who own Alien <b>Hominid</b> HD.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} horse remains {{found in}} the area now covered by Britain and Ireland date to the Middle Pleistocene. Two species of horse have been identified from remains at Pakefield, East Anglia, dating back to 700,000BC. Spear damage on a horse shoulder bone discovered at Eartham Pit, Boxgrove, dated 500,000BC, showed that early <b>hominids</b> were hunting horses in the area at that time. The land which now comprises the British Isles was periodically joined to continental Europe by a land bridge, extending from approximately the current coast of North Yorkshire to the English Channel, most recently until about 9,000years ago. Dependent on {{the rise and fall}} of sea levels associated with advancing and retreating Ice ages, this allowed humans and fauna to migrate between these areas; as the climate fluctuated, hunters could follow their prey, including equids.|$|E
25|$|At Buya in Eritrea, one of {{the oldest}} <b>hominids</b> {{representing}} a possible link between Homo erectus and an archaic Homo sapiens was found by Italian scientists. Dated to over 1 million years old, it is the oldest skeletal find of its kind and provides a link between <b>hominids</b> and the earliest anatomically modern humans. It is believed that the section of the Danakil Depression in Eritrea was also a major player in terms of human evolution, and may contain other traces of evolution from Homo erectus <b>hominids</b> to anatomically modern humans.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of tools}} to obtain food is {{probably}} a long-standing <b>hominid</b> adaptation. Therefore, the rapid increase in <b>hominid</b> brain size over the last million years cannot be explained by selection for basic tool use alone. 350 o alternative theories, here termed the ecological adaptation hypothesis and the intraspecific competition hypothesis, are reviewed and rejected.

25|$|The {{first known}} <b>hominids</b> evolved in Africa. According to paleontology, the early hominids' skull anatomy {{was similar to}} that of the gorilla and the chimpanzee, great apes that also evolved in Africa, but the <b>hominids</b> had adopted a bipedal {{locomotion}} which freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open savanna at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This occurred 10 to 5 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, a {{graduate}} student from the Arizona State University discovered a <b>hominid</b> jawbone in the Ledi-Geraru region of Afar.

50|$|Nest-building in {{primates}} {{refers to}} the behaviour of building nests by extant strepsirrhines (lemurs and lorisoids) and <b>hominid</b> apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and humans). Strepsirrhines build nests for both sleeping and also for raising families. <b>Hominid</b> apes build nests for sleeping at night, and in some species, for sleeping during the day. Nest-building by <b>hominid</b> apes is learned by infants watching the mother {{and others in the}} group, and is considered tool use rather than animal architecture. Old World monkeys and New World monkeys do not nest.|$|R
40|$|The ToumaÃ¯ cranium TM 266 is {{the first}} known from any Late Miocene African {{hominoid}} clade, {{and is one of}} the best preserved crania of any Miocene hominoid. Since its publication there has been debate in the scientific literature and discussion in the popular press over the assertion that this cranium is significant because it is the earliest known <b>hominid</b> 1. The basis of the <b>hominid</b> assessment rests on two interpretations of the anatomy: a homi-nid-like, small, flat-wearing canine; and, cranial features reflecting an upright stance and bipedal locomotion. In fact, it is widely reported that the specimen is an upright <b>hominid</b> biped (Haile-Selassie et al., 2004; Kimbel, 2004; Lieberman, 2002), although this is yet to be verified by independent observations and study. The history of paleo-anthropology may be relevant to this assessment, because there have been similar claims for other extinct primate species. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that Sahelanthropus (the genus TM 266 is aï¿½ributed to) is a <b>hominid</b> by examining features of the canine and of the cranial base that are said to reflect canine reduction and change of function, and upright posture and bipedal locomotion. These are <b>hominid</b> autapomorphies and their presence or absence in late Miocene hominoids has fundamental importance for identifying the <b>hominid</b> clade...|$|R
