40|$|Soil erosion {{has been}} a major concern in the United States for over a century. Water erosion {{accounts}} for about two thirds of this erosion. Past researchers have divided the erosion process into rill and interrill erosion components. Rill erosion process can be further divided into scouring, headcutting and side sloughing subprocesses. Headcuts are defined as local areas of intense erosion accompanied by an abrupt elevation change. To more accurately model the rill erosion process, headcutting mechanics were developed to mathematically model the phenomenon;Headcut erosion data were collected on seven soils in six states as part of the USDA Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP). Rill plots 9 m long and 0. 5 m wide, were set up on 3 % to 6 % slopes. These plots were formed with cultivator shovels. A rotating boom rainfall simulator was used to simulate rainfall over the erosion plots. After equilibrium runoff was achieved, additional flows of 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 L/min were added to the top of each rill. During each flow addition, wooden stakes were placed adjacent to headcuts that formed in the rill and overhead stereo photographs were taken to determine the location of headcuts. Flow additions were repeated without rainfall. Headcut erosion was measured by calculating the volume of soil voided and multiplying this by the soil bulk density;Five models were developed using the principles of fluid mechanics. Statistical analyses indicated that two models, the total energy model and the vertical force model, were superior over other models tested. The energy model was based on the sum of the energy lost at each headcut. The vertical force model was based on the force in the plunge pool due to the flowing water. Coefficients of determination (r[superscript] 2) using the energy model and the vertical force model were 0. 85 and 0. 84, respectively. Soil properties were correlated to the <b>erodibilities</b> calculated with the two models.

As predicting fan size is essentially a conservation of mass problem, our analysis is general, applying to all types of fan landform.

Here we stress that the distribution of subsidence rates in the depositional basin is a primary control on relative fan size. Both free coefficients in the oft-cited power-law correlation of fan area and catchment area can be shown to be set primarily by the tectonic setting, taken to include source area uplift rate and the subsidence distribution in the depositional basin. In the case of a steady-state landscape, relative fan size is shown to be independent of both climate and source lithology; only during times of significant departure from steady state can relative fan size be expected to vary with either climate or source lithology.

This fish population, which plays an important ecological role in the St. Lawrence River estuary, has dramatically declined over the last decades. Siltation and excessive algal growth in the spawning area were identified as the most probable causes of the fish population decline; suggesting that soil erosion, nutrient and sediment transport are major factors underlying the environmental problem. In this context, 137 Cs provides an effective tool for investigating the magnitude and spatial distribution of long-term soil redistribution taking place in the watershed. Sampling of cultivated fields, riverbanks, bottom sediments and forested sites were thus undertaken to help understand the erosive behaviour of the watershed.

40|$|The Jumilla Fault Zone (JFZ) is an ENE-WSW {{topographic}} lineament in {{the external}} part of the eastern Betic Cordillera. It represents an active fault. Three small basins are aligned along the JFZ, the La Celia-, Alqueria- and Jumilla basins. The tectonic geomorphology of the La Celia- and Alqueria basins consists of folds, a set of normal fault scarps, strike-slip lineaments, fault-springs, tectonically-modified drainage lines and elevated gypsum/anhydrite diapirs. Two of the scarps are normal faults generated by the extensional collapse {{of one of the}} folds. The other scarps are secondary normal faults generated by transtensional left-lateral motions along the JFZ. Normal fault scarps that developed on conglomerates are considerably steeper (~ 30 °) than those affecting softer marly materials (< 10 °) as a consequence of their different <b>erodibilities.</b> Two natural springs reveal the sealing nature of the normal faults, which has resulted in a segmented groundwater system. These springs are the sources of the two largest ramblas (gullies) in the area. The onset of fault activity is constrained by the late Tortonian-Messinian age of the sedimentary rocks in the basins. Interbedded lavaflows and lamproitic dykes in the lacustrine sediments have been dated at 7. 6 - 7. 2 Ma. However, the morphology of fault scarps and relief of the diapirs suggest a younger age of the deformation. Results from modelling of fault scarp evolution indicate Middle Pleistocene and younger ages of faulting and scarp formation. Furthermore, in {{at least one of the}} fault scarps, Quaternary alluvial-pediment deposits are involved in the deformation. The drainage pattern anomalies and moderate earthquake activity (Mb 4. 2) in the JFZ also indicate slow ongoing tectonic activity. In addition, the ENE prolongation of the JFZ (outside the study area) shows geodetic displacement rates of approximately 2 mm/year. We thus conclude that the JFZ is still active, despite the general lack of post-Messinian deposits in the studied basins. The discrepancy between the age of the tectonic landforms and the late Neogene age of the basin infill can be explained by an endo- to exhorheic change in the drainage system, due to the capture of the ancient basin lake system by tributaries of the nearby Segura river. The cessation of sedimentation in the basins resulted in the preservation of tectonic landforms. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the river {{migration}} model MIANDRAS {{has been applied}} to simulations of the planform changes of the river Allier, a tributary of the river Loire in France. The Allier is a very dynamic and natural river system with braided and meandering river sections. Two meandering reaches of the Allier, located between Varennes-sur-Allier and Moulins, have been examined in the present study. MIANDRAS is a numerical model that simulates meandering processes in shallow alluvial rivers with erodible banks. In MIANDRAS the river is schematised as a single meandering channel, as the floodplains are assumed non-conveying. For the prediction of river planform changes, the rate and direction of bank erosion are computed by coupling a steady-state flow and bed topography model with a time-dependent bank erosion model. Sediment gradation, timedependent variations of the bed topography (i. e. migrating bars) and flow exchanges between the main channel and the floodplains are not taken into account. MIANDRAS did not perform satisfactorily in predicting the planform changes of the Allier. The 2 (and 3 -) dimensional flow processes in flood periods, caused by floodplain constrictions and flow exchange between the main channel and the floodplains, appeared to be an important feature influencing the bank erosion. Therefore, the influence of overbank flow was studied in more detail. The 3 -dimensional flow model DELFT 3 D-FLOW (TRISULA) was used to simulate overbank flow processes in one of the examined reaches of the Allier. The results of the MIANDRAS computations can be explained reasonably well from the results of the overbank flow computations. Near the upstream floodplain constriction, where high bank erosion rates were observed in the prototype river, high velocities occurred in the overbank flow computations. At this location high bank erosion coefficients had to be adopted in the MIANDRAS computations. The relatively low erosion rates at the downstream boundary {{can be explained by the}} low velocities occurring in overbank flow. These are due to backwater effects near the downstream floodplain constriction. The small erosion rates at this location resulted in small <b>erodibilities</b> in the MIANDRAS computations. Floodplain bed roughness appears to have a significant influence on velocity directions and magnitudes. The velocity field is correlated to the flow exchange between the main channel and the floodplains. This flow exchange strongly decreases in the case of a higher floodplain bed roughness. These results agree with the results of scale model experiments performed in the Flood Channel Facility at HR Wallingford, England. The results of this study give new indications for the range of applicability of MIANDRAS. Besides the possibility to use MIANDRAS in case of rivers with mainly inbank flow, the model can also be applied to rivers with overbank flow periods, provided that the flow exchange between the main channel and the floodplains is small. A small flow exchange occurs in case of a high floodplain bed roughness, a straight floodplain and main channel, or relatively small flood discharges.

40|$|Open-cut {{coal mining}} in Central Queensland {{involves}} the breaking up of overburden, generally of Permian origin, that overlies the coal seams using explosives, followed by removal with draglines {{which results in}} the formation of extensive overburden spoil-piles with steep slopes at the angle of repose. These spoil-piles form long multiple rows, with heights of up to 60 or 70 m above the original landscapes. They are generally highly saline, dispersive and highly erosive. Legislation requires that these spoil-piles be rehabilitated into a stable self sustaining ecosystem with no off-site pollution. In contrast to agricultural ecosystems where slope gradient is a fixed characteristic of the landscape, the first stage in the rehabilitation of these landscapes is the modification and lowering of slopes to create a landscape that is stable against geotechnical failure (landslides) and erosion. This is followed by revegetation with rapidly establishing grasses as pioneer vegetation to further reduce erosion, and an appropriate mixture of native shrubs and trees which are slower to establish. Excessive erosion and on-site discharges of sediment into mine working areas may result in the temporary cessation of mining operation with significant financial consequences, while off site discharges may breach the mining lease conditions. The average cost of rehabilitation is high (average of $ 22, 000 /ha) and with approximately 100, 000 ha of spoil-piles in Queensland at present, the total cost of rehabilitation facing the industry is very high. Most of this comprised the cost of reshaping the landscape, associated with the large amount of material movement necessary to achieve the desired landscape. Since soil and spoil-piles vary greatly in their <b>erodibilities,</b> a reliable and accurate methodology is needed to determine cost effective combinations of slope length, slope gradient and vegetation that will result in acceptable rates of erosion. This paper reports on the development of a set of two user friendly computer packages, MINErosion 3. 1 and MINErosion 4. 1 that were designed to assist minesites to achieve stable postmining landscape reconstruction that will result in acceptable rates of erosion. MINErosion 3. 1 is a user friendly predictive hillslope computer package useful in the selection of suitable combinations of landscape design parameters (slope gradient, slope length and vegetation cover) that will result in acceptable rates of erosion. The slope length and gradient are parameters required by the mining companies as inputs into their landscape design software to cost effectively construct suitable landscapes that will meet the required erosion criteria. MINErosion 3. 1 predicts with reasonable accuracy, both the annual average soil loss under the prevailing climatic conditions as well as the potential erosion from individual rainstorms with known annual recurrence intervals. A database of 35 soils and spoils from Central Queensland are imbedded in the model. MINErosion 4. 1 is a user friendly catchment/landscape based predictive erosion package useful in the estimation of erosion rates (mean annual or individual rainstorm) from the proposed reconstructed postmining landscape.

40|$|Combining field {{reconstruction}} and landscape evolution modelling {{can be useful}} to investigate the relative role of different drivers (tectonics, climate, local base level) on long term catchment evolution. In this thesis, field {{reconstruction and}} landscape evolution modelling are combined to unravel the long-term (300 ka) response to lava damming events of evolution of the Geren Catchment, {{a tributary of the}} upper Gediz river near Kula, Western Turkey. This catchment was considered suitable for such a study because its high preservationof remnant landscape surfaces and fluvial terraces which could be dated, while its base level evolution could be reconstructed by identifying and dating lava flows. In Chapter 2, landscape evolution modelling of an idealized catchment revealed long-term (15 ka) catchment response to natural damming. Evolution of a high erodible and low erodible landscape was simulated using landscape evolution model (LEM) LAPSUS (LandscApe procesS modelling at mUlti dimensions and Scales). The natural dam was given four different <b>erodibilities,</b> to mimic both the potentially more erodible landslide dams and resistant lava dams. In a low erodible landscape damming led to persistent preservation of the sediment wedge formed behind the dam, while in a high erodible landscape, damming additionally led to knickpoint persistence, hampered incision of the main river and stream rerouting. The highest erodible dam was almost removed after 15 ka, while its sediment wedge was still partly present. Comparison of results with natural dam events from literature showed that modelled response characteristics are observed in actual situations and that simulations on Quaternary timescales are useful. In Chapter 3, field reconstruction resulted in a young lava flow being age constrained to the late Holocene (3. 0 – 2. 6 ka), by luminescence dating of fluvial sands below and on top of the flow. This lava flow dammed the Gediz river at two locations. the upstream lake was silted, while the downstream lake was not. Dams were breached catastrophically and possibly in a cascading event. The Gediz created an epigenetic gorge and its current river bed is still not at its pre-lava flow level. Results are summarized in a conceptual diagram. Furthermore, field reconstruction and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating revealed multiple lava dam events which have infrequently raised and lowered the base level of the Geren Catchment in the middle to late Pleistocene (311 – 175 ka). Sediment-capped palaeosurfaces in the Geren suggest change from an active fluvial system to a more lacustrine environment in the middle Pleistocene, followed by fluvial reactivation and stepped incision in the late Pleistocene. A second landscape evolution modelling study was conducted in Chapter 4, on a 300 ka timescale, with a larger catchment. Four scenarios have been applied on a reconstructed paleodem of the Geren Catchment. In the first scenario, the palaeodem was given constant rainfall for 300 ka. In the second scenario, three short (1 ka) damming events were added at its catchment outlet. In the third scenario, the palaeodem endured gradual base level lowering at its outlet, based on the known incision rate of its base level, the Gediz river. In the fourth scenario, base level lowering and damming events were combined. Results were interpreted by evaluating 1 ka-averaged net erosion, catchment sediment storage, longitudinal profile development and spatial differences in net erosion and sediment storage. Results showed that the net erosion signal of the catchment is complex in all cases. However, average net erosion and its variability increased due to constant base level lowering. Additionally, alternating phases of high and low variability occurred in net erosion, where high variability coincided with a strong decrease in total catchment sediment storage. Adding damming events to the gradual base level lowering scenario generated similar average net erosion as the base level lowering scenario, however its temporal pattern showed significantly different alternation of high and low variability periods. Furthermore, dampened upstream erosion was observed. Over time, this dampening migrates upstream indicating a long-term legacy of short term dam events. Field reconstruction and landscape evolution modelling were combined in Chapter 5, to be able to reconstruct and understand actual Geren catchment response to identified base level evolution over a 300 ka period. In all simulations, rainfall and vegetation are varied over time based on arboral pollen. Because exact significance and duration of dam events were not known, three scenarios of landscape evolution in the Geren Catchment were investigated: i) uplift driven gradual base level lowering, ii) gradual base level lowering and short damming events and iii) gradual base level lowering and long damming events. Output was evaluated for erosion-aggradation evolution in trunk gullies at two different distances from the catchment outlet. Climate influences erosion – aggradation activity in the upstream reach, although internal feedbacks influence timing and magnitude. Scenario i shows the most correlation with the climate signal, although its correlation is weak. Lava damming events leave an aggradation signal in the downstream reach, while complex and lagged response to these dams obscure correlations with climate and leave a legacy of the past in current landscape evolution. Catchment response of the long dam scenario correspond best with field reconstruction and dating. The combination of climate and base level explains {{a significant part of the}} landscape evolution history of the Geren Catchment. In Chapter 6, a reflection and synthesis of Chapters 2 - 5 is presented. Indications for response to tectonics, climate and damming events are discussed separately for both field and modelling results. It is concluded that (lava) damming events of Pleistocene age can hamper, but also enhance incision on a 300 ka timescale. Furthermore, they can still have effect on current and future catchment evolution. However, catchment response to this evolution is complex and catchment specific and model results do not exactly reproduce its catchment history. An aggregated landscape evolution model output such as stream bed elevation change can be useful for comparison with fluvial terrace sequences. Combining field reconstruction and modelling suggests that the 300 ka incision history of the Geren is best explained if the catchment endured prolonged dam events. The combination of field reconstruction, dating and landscape evolution modelling therefore can enhance our understanding of long-term evolution of a specific landscape and increases knowledge on long term impact of past events on current catchment complexities and it is suggested to embed this research approach more structurally in long-term  landscape reconstructions...|$|R

Since wind can carry away sand but not cobbles, for example, a channel bed rich in cobbles could form an inverted ridge {{if it was}} originally surrounded by much finer sediments, even if the sediments were not cemented. This effect has been invoked for channels in Saheki Crater.|$|E
50|$|The 1996 Farm Bill did {{not make}} many changes to the CRP. The major change made was in {{relation}} to early termination of CRP contracts. This bill allowed the termination of contracts after five years, {{with the exception of}} filterstrips, waterways, strips adjacent to riparian areas; lands with an <b>erodibility</b> index of over 15; and other lands that the Secretary deems to be highly sensitive 7. Also, cropping history became a part of the eligibility system used to determine if a piece of land should be enrolled into the CRP. Land was deemed eligible for CRP if it was cropped two of the last five years and meets {{at least one of the}} following requirements: had an <b>erodibility</b> index of eight or higher; was considered a cropped wetland; was associated with or surrounds non-cropped wetlands; was devoted to a highly beneficial environmental practice (for example, filter strips); was subject to scour erosion; was located in national or state CRP conservation priority areas; or was marginal pastureland in riparian areas 7. Other changes came in the form of appropriation bills. The Appropriations Bill of 2001 provided an exception to the requirement that the owner plant vegetative cover when excessive rainfall or flooding made planting impossible and the Appropriations Bill of 2002 created a new pilot program for enrollment of wetland and buffer acreage in CRP 7.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, the {{considerable}} effect rills have on landscapes often negatively impact human activity. Rills {{have been observed}} washing away archaeological sites. They are also very common in agricultural areas because sustained agriculture depletes the soil of much of its organic content, increasing the <b>erodibility</b> of the soil. Agricultural machines, such as tractors, compact the soil {{to the point where}} water flows over the surface rather than seeping into the soil. Tractor wheel impressions often channel water, providing a perfect environment for the generation of rills. If left alone, these rills may erode considerable amounts of arable soil.|$|E
50|$|Soil texture was {{the main}} {{differentiating}} soil characteristic used in the early survey process. Soil series were soon to follow as groupings of soil types. By 1906 Miami soil series included 16 soil types from the glaciated regions and Norfolk series included 12 soil types from the coastal plains. Several other characteristics were added by that time. They were soil color, organic content, soil structure, drainage, <b>erodibility,</b> and nature of subsoil. Soil provinces were established and soil series were confined to their area. Series at first were identified where the soils formed from the same accumulated parent material: glaciated, wind blown, alluvial etc.|$|E
5000|$|The Ranger Uranium Mine in Northern Australia {{showed a}} {{significant}} increase in <b>erodibility</b> of lands when in contact with materials treated from chemical mining (Riley 1995). [...] This could manifest itself in landslides and loss of habitat, as well as an increase in gravel composition that could cause other potential problems. If these lands can be planted with vegetation that can survive more acidic conditions, however likely that may be, {{they may be able to}} avoid eroding materials into other, less mine-contaminated ecosystem (Riley 1995). Given the likelihood of this, though, more rehabilitation measures are being sought after.|$|E
50|$|In {{many places}} around the world, {{riparian}} zones have been completely eliminated as humans have cleared land for raising crops, growing timber, and developing land for commercial or residential purposes. Removing riparian vegetation increases the <b>erodibility</b> of stream banks, and can also speed the rate of channel migration. In addition, removal of riparian vegetation fragments the remaining riparian ecosystem, which can prevent or hinder dispersal of species between habitat patches. This can diminish riparian plant diversity, as well as decrease abundances and diversity of migratory birds or other species that depend on large, undisturbed areas of habitat. Fragmentation can also prevent gene flow between isolated riparian patches, reducing genetic diversity.|$|E
