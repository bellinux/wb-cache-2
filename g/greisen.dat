500|$|At Cornell, Rossi met {{his first}} American {{graduate}} student, Kenneth <b>Greisen,</b> {{with whom he}} wrote an article, [...] "Cosmic-Ray Theory", {{which was published in}} the Reviews of Modern Physics and became known among cosmic-ray researchers as [...] "The Bible". During the summer of 1941, <b>Greisen</b> and physicists from Denver and Boulder accompanied Rossi to Mount Evans, where they refined the knowledge of proportionality between mesotron momentum and lifetime before decay. [...] <b>Greisen</b> and Rossi also carried out experiments, which showed, in terms of processes documented in the [...] "Bible", that not all particles of the soft component, could be produced by mesotrons of the hard component. [...] They interpreted this as evidence for primary electrons or photons, but it became evident later that the soft excess arises from the decay of neutral pions.|$|E
500|$|With the {{completion}} of his work on mesotrons, Rossi turned his attention toward the war effort. In 1942, while commuting from Ithaca to Cambridge, Massachusetts, he became a consultant on radar development at the Radiation Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. [...] Here, along with <b>Greisen,</b> he invented a [...] "range tracking circuit", which was patented after the war.|$|E
500|$|With this progress, Rossi's group began a major {{experiment}} that could measure both primary energies and arrival directions of extensive air showers. [...] Participating {{in this effort}} were: George Clark, William Kraushaar, John Linsley, James Earl, and Frank Scherb. [...] Kraushaar came to MIT from Cornell in 1949, after earning his PhD under Kenneth <b>Greisen.</b> [...] With the support of Professor Donald Menzel who {{was director of the}} Harvard College Observatory, Rossi's group deployed fifteen liquid scintillators, of area [...] on the wooded grounds of the observatory's Agassiz station. [...] The signals were brought on cables to a Quonset hut, where they were displayed on fifteen oscillographs and recorded photographically.|$|E

2500|$|Cosmic {{rays are}} high energy {{particles}} that bombard the Earth's atmosphere. About 89% {{of these are}} protons. [...] The flux of cosmic rays is approximately proportional to 1/(Ea) where E is the energy and a is somewhere between 2 and 3 up to the UHECR limit. [...] Cosmic rays created in our galaxy with energy of less than about 1018eV get trapped by the galaxy's magnetic field. [...] Particles above that should escape, so high energy cosmic rays would likely come from outside our galaxy. [...] According to the <b>Greisen,</b> Zatsepin, Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff, inter-galactic cosmic rays above 1020eV should be absorbed by the Cosmic microwave background radiation due to pion production and pair production. [...] In pion production, the protons (UHECRs) above 1020eV have enough energy {{to interact with the}} CMBR to create pions, and above 1017eV have enough energy to interact with the electron-positron pairs from pair production. [...] These interactions would cause extra-galactic UHECRs to lose too much energy to reach the earth. [...] Physicists have observed cosmic rays with energies at this level since 1963 [...] Some cosmic ray experiments claim that they have seen UHECR levels in excess of the GZK prediction, while others claim to detect levels about equivalent to the prediction [...] Such conflicting experiments are the motivation for further study of UHECRs and therefore experiments like WALTA.|$|E

30|$|Clinical {{applications}} of muscle regeneration strategies are very limited although the topic receives {{a substantial amount}} of interest in basic science and preclinical studies (Corona and <b>Greising</b> 2016; Kwee and Mooney 2017). Restore Orthobiologic Implant (DePuy Orthopaedics; Warsaw, Indiana) was also used to treat a patient with large volumetric muscle loss and the presence of new tissue at the implant assessed by computer tomography, showing an improvement in strength after the surgery (Mase et al. 2010). Sicari et al. (Sicari et al. 2014) used extracellular matrix scaffolds from porcine urinary bladder to treat patients with volumetric muscle loss. The scaffolds promoted the remodelling of muscle tissue with perivascular stem cell homing and the de novo formation of muscle cells, and functional improvements in some patients (Sicari et al. 2014).|$|R
5000|$|Later {{construction}} included 1556-8 {{work on the}} tower. The interior west gallery likely {{dates from}} 1616. In the early 18th century the roofs were renovated and the tower was topped by a Madonna, following destruction of the original tower roof by lightning in 1711. A Baroque tower top was added by Josef <b>Greising</b> in 1719. Jakob van der Auwera designed the Madonna sculpture for the roof-top (1713) that was then made by goldsmith Martin Nötzel from copper and covered in gold (made from 400 gold ducats). In 1843-53 a major restoration was conducted by [...] This work included changes to the western façade and added the lower gallery and the rose window. In 1856-7, the Gothic Revival spire was added. At that time the gold cover on the Madonna was also restored.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the 2010 AFL season, <b>Greisen</b> re-signed with the Florida Tuskers for the 2010 UFL season. <b>Greisen</b> saw significant playing time after injuries sidelined starting quarterback Brooks Bollinger. <b>Greisen</b> helped lead the Tuskers to the 2010 UFL Championship Game where they played the Las Vegas Locomotives in a rematch of the previous year's UFL Championship.|$|E

30|$|Extremity {{orthopaedic}} {{trauma that}} results in volumetric muscle loss (VML) presents chronic and persistent functional muscle deficits, restricted joint range of motion, and fibrosis, which ultimately manifest as chronic disability (Mase et al. 2010; Corona et al. 2015; Garg et al. 2015; Rivera and Corona 2016). Moreover, VML injury may impair healing of concomitantly fractured bone (Willett et al. 2013; Hurtgen et al. 2016; Pollot et al. 2016; Hurtgen et al. 2017 a, 2017 b). In such cases where composite bone and skeletal muscle tissue injuries exist, clinical care emphasizes fracture healing with little attention to regeneration of the traumatized skeletal musculature. Recent basic and translational research efforts are aimed at promoting de novo regeneration of the muscle tissue to ameliorate musculoskeletal regeneration and to promote long-term improvements in muscle and limb function (Corona and <b>Greising</b> 2016).|$|R
5000|$|Juliusspital is a Baroque {{hospital}} with a courtyard and a church originally established in 1576. However, the 160 m long northern wing was added by [...] in 1700-4. Beneath it lies the similarly-sized wine cellar. The Rococo pharmacy survived the bombing of 1945 largely undamaged. North of the Spital is a park used by the patients, fronted to the right by the Alte Anatomie (by Joseph <b>Greising,</b> built in 1705-14. This was renovated in 1788 and used by the medical faculty such as Albert von Kölliker, von Siebold or Rudolf Virchow to instruct up to 48 students in surgery and anatomy. The park also features a water basin by Jacob van der Auvera with stone dolphins and allegorical figures for the Franconian rivers Main, Tauber, Saale and Sinn. It sports the coat-of-arms of Johann Philipp von Greifenclau zu Vollraths.|$|R
5000|$|The Baroque abbey {{buildings}} {{were built in}} two phases (1687-98 and 1715-35), grouped around two enclosed and three open courtyards. The two main façades, the northern of the Abteibau and the western of the Festssaalbau face a Cour d'honneur. The earlier tract was planned and built by Leonhard Dientzenhofer (eastern wings and two-storied north façade) in early Baroque style, out of gray/white sandstone. After Dientzenhofer's death construction paused until J. <b>Greising</b> built the Empfangsbau in 1716. He later, based on plans revised by Balthasar Neumann, constructed the western front of the large cour d'honneur and built the Festsaalbau at its eastern end. Neumann also {{was responsible for the}} stairway of the Empfangsbau, based on a design at Schloss Weißenstein. The statues of the stairway were made by Balthasar Esterbauer, other scupltues by Daniel Humbach. Stucco work was done by G. Hennicke and the ceiling fresco by J.A. Remele (1712-22). The Kaisersaal also features stucco by Hennicke, surrounding a central ceiling painting of [...] "The triumph of the lamb" [...] by Clemens Lünenschloss.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, <b>Greisen</b> {{pursued a}} career in the Arena Football League, and joined the AF2's Green Bay Blizzard. The AF2 was the AFL's {{development}} league. In his first and only year in the AF2, <b>Greisen</b> threw for 2,718 yards and 61 touchdowns.|$|E
50|$|After {{spending}} {{two seasons}} as the backup {{quarterback for the}} Desperados, <b>Greisen</b> signed with the Georgia Force.

Georgia hosted the National Conference Championship, but lost 66-56 to the Columbus Destroyers. On the season, <b>Greisen</b> completed 74 percent of his passes (393-for-531) with 117 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and 4,871 yards. His 117 touchdowns were the AFL single season record until broken by Tommy Grady in 2012 (142 touchdowns).|$|E

5000|$|Between the 1823 and 1824 editions Müller varied {{the texts}} slightly, but also (with the {{addition}} of the further 12 poems) altered the order in which they were presented. Owing to the two stages of composition, Schubert's order in the song-cycle preserves the integrity of the cycle of the first twelve poems published and appends the twelve new poems as a Fortsetzung (Continuation), following Müller's order (if one excludes the poems already set) with the one exception of switching [...] "Die Nebensonnen" [...] and [...] "Mut!". In the complete book edition Müller's final running-order was as follows: [...] "Gute Nacht"; [...] "Die Wetterfahne"; [...] "Gefror'ne Thränen"; [...] "Erstarrung"; [...] "Der Lindenbaum"; [...] "Die Post"; [...] "Wasserflut"; [...] "Auf dem Flusse"; [...] "Rückblick"; [...] "Der <b>greise</b> Kopf"; [...] "Die Krähe"; [...] "Letzte Hoffnung"; [...] "Im Dorfe"; [...] "Der stürmische Morgen"; [...] "Täuschung"; [...] "Der Wegweiser"; [...] "Das Wirtshaus"; [...] "Das Irrlicht"; [...] "Rast"; [...] "Die Nebensonnen"; [...] "Frühlingstraum"; [...] "Einsamkeit"; [...] "Mut!"; [...] "Der Leiermann". [...] Thus Schubert's numbers would run 1-5, 13, 6-8, 14-21, 9-10, 23, 11-12, 22, 24, a sequence occasionally attempted by Hans Joachim Moser and Günther Baum.|$|R
30|$|As {{previously}} described (Pollot and Corona, 2016; <b>Greising</b> et al. 2017), swine were anesthetized with Telazol (4 – 6  mg/kg, i.m.), intubated and maintained under isoflurane anesthesia. Under appropriate aseptic conditions, a 10  cm incision was made centered over the anterior compartment {{to expose the}} peroneus tertius (PT) muscle. The anterior aspect of the muscle was measured and a 3  ×  3 cm 2 area was marked in the middle third of the PT muscle. Then this area of muscle (5.59 [*]±[*] 0.04  g) was sharply dissected from the PT muscle. Sham operated limbs were surgically exposed and the PT muscle was isolated, but no tissue was removed. A subset of VML defects were treated with autologous minced muscle grafts as {{previously described}} (Pollot et al. 2016; Ward et al. 2016). Briefly using the muscle from the contralateral VML injury an autologous minced muscle graft was created. Under sterile conditions the muscle was minced to ~ 1  mm 3 pieces and ~ 50 % volume was transplanted into the defect of the designated repair limb. To accommodate the autograft into the defect, the epimysium layer superficial to the muscle was closed over autograft with ~ 8 interrupted proline sutures. In all cases the fascial and skin incisions were closed in layers with absorbable suture and compressive bandages were wrapped around each limb. Post-surgical analgesic administration of Buprenorphine SR (0.01  mg/kg, s.c.), Rimadyl (4.4  mg/kg, s.c.), and Excede (5.0  mg/kg, s.c.) was conducted through 1 week post-surgically.|$|R
