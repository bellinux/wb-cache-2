500|$|After Khánh {{was again}} secure in Saigon, he said [...] "I am very {{moved by the}} spirit of unity shown by {{the armed forces and}} {{population}} when faced with the threat of internal strife. <b>I</b> <b>commend</b> the patriotism of all the soldiers who knew how to put the higher interests of the nation above all else." [...] Khánh said he would relinquish power and return to a purely military rule in two months time, but reneged on an earlier explicit promise to guarantee a purely civilian government, simply stating that the new regime would be one [...] "that has the confidence of the entire people". The Soviet Union said the coup [...] "demonstrated once again on what a rotten foundation Washington's policy in South Vietnam is based".|$|E
500|$|Jane was {{a devout}} Protestant during the English Reformation, when the Church of England violently {{rejected}} {{the authority of}} the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. Known for her piety and education, she corresponded with Protestant leaders in Continental Europe, such as Heinrich Bullinger. A modest person who dressed plainly, her last words before her execution are reported as [...] "Lord, into thy hands <b>I</b> <b>commend</b> my spirit!" [...] Jane's execution by a Catholic queen made her into what the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography terms a [...] "Protestant martyr", {{and by the end of}} the century Jane had become, in the words of the historian Eric Ives, [...] "a Protestant icon". Depictions of Jane in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as in John Foxe's Actes and Monuments (1563), published after Protestant Elizabeth took the throne, [...] "presented [...] as primarily a figure in a national narrative about an elect nation possessed of a pure Protestant faith which had risen supreme over Catholic Europe".|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} scene Agnes {{has been moved}} by the Prefect's grief, and prayed for the son to be restored to life, which an angel has done. The repentant Procopius kneels before her, while she leans down to tell him Vade amplius noli peccare ("Go forth and sin no more"; from [...] ). However {{the result of the}} miracle was that (in William Caxton's translation) [...] "the bishops of the idols made a great discord among the people, so that all they cried: Take away this sorceress and witch that turned men's minds and alieneth their wits". The Prefect is now sympathetic to Agnes but fears he will lose his position if he does nothing, so leaves the matter in the hands of another official; the two are seen talking together, with words from [...] Nihil invenio cause in eam ("I find no cause against her") above. The last scene shows her martyrdom; she was sentenced to be burned but the flames part away from her so that finally the magistrate orders her killed by a spear. Her last words, from , are In manus tuas domine commendo animam meam ("Into your hands, O Lord, <b>I</b> <b>commend</b> my spirit").|$|E

5000|$|Asked {{directly}} whether, in {{leaping from}} the tower, {{she expected to}} kill herself, Joan replied, [...] "No, for as <b>I</b> leaped <b>I</b> <b>commended</b> myself to God." [...] By leaping she hoped to escape and avoid deliverance to the English.|$|R
2500|$|... {{a part of}} {{the realm}} was {{assigned}} me by my lord and father ... and in it the metropolitan see of Sens then lacked a pastor. For its good government, <b>I</b> <b>commended</b> it to Wenilo, who was at that time serving me as a clerk in my chapel.|$|R
500|$|At Fotheringhay on {{the evening}} of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be {{executed}} the next morning. She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France. The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution. The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, [...] "I forgive you with all my heart, for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles." [...] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments, revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson-brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church, with a black satin bodice and black trimmings. As she disrobed she smiled and said that she [...] "never had such grooms before... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company". She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, and stretched out her arms. Her last words were, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum" [...] ("Into thy hands, O Lord, <b>I</b> <b>commend</b> my spirit").|$|E

2500|$|... "Lack {{of access}} to loanable funds at cheap and {{profitable}} interest rates had been the bane of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises in the country. <b>I</b> <b>commend</b> First bank of Nigeria for their trail-blazing action. Before we got to First Bank, we had approached a number of banks, but their concern was primarily and solely the profit motif. It is, therefore, a major achievement that First Bank, as the leading bank, truly, agreed to our proposal. This gesture from First Bank is one laced with patriotic zeal, as it {{had the potential to}} revolutionise the operations of small scale industrialists, and by extension the economy of Nigeria as a whole. The current Group managing Director of the bank: Mr. Bisi Onasanya, gave unqualified support to the project. Onasanya saw it as a key corporate social responsibility activity with multipier effects on the economy.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>commended</b> Maria {{for feeling}} scruples which proved {{her to be}} the best of good girls, and promised to relieve her from all fear of future temptation. This was easily done.

60|$|Ere {{revolving}} any complicated project, however, {{adapted to}} this end, I first simply suggested to Bartleby {{the propriety of}} his permanent departure.

2500|$|Some Western writers {{claim that}} the immaculate {{conception}} of Mary is a teaching of Islam. Thus, commenting in 1734 on the passage in the Qur'an, [...] "I have called her Mary; and <b>I</b> <b>commend</b> her to thy protection, and also her issue, against Satan driven away with stones", George Sale stated: [...] "It is not improbable that the pretended immaculate conception of the virgin Mary is intimated in this passage. For according to a tradition of Mohammed, every person that comes into the world, is touched at his birth by the devil, and therefore cries out, Mary and her son only excepted; between whom, and the evil spirit God placed a veil, so that his touch did not reach them. And for this reason they say, neither of them were guilty of any sin, {{like the rest of}} the children of Adam." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark's gospel is {{nevertheless}} still {{seen as the}} most reliable of the four {{in terms of its}} overall description of Jesus's life and ministry. This recognition allows scholars to chart the evolution of Jesus in the scriptures: Mark's Christ, for example, dies with the cry, [...] "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"; Matthew, the next gospel to be written, repeats this word for word but manages to make clear that Jesus's death {{is the beginning of the}} resurrection of Israel; Luke has a still more positive picture, replacing Mark's (and Matthew's) cry of despair with one of submission to God's will ("Father, into your hands <b>I</b> <b>commend</b> my spirit"); while John, the last gospel, has Jesus dying without apparent suffering in fulfillment of the divine plan. Historical reconstruction suggests that the original despairing death of Jesus has become more and more victorious over time.|$|E
2500|$|The Mexican Genome Project was {{initiated}} by Calderón's administration {{in part as}} a response to the swine flu outbreak and to safeguard the discovering of genetic markers that will better target and assist Mexico's 100+ million people in regards to prevention and treatment of diseases and other health concerns such as diabetes. A study on the efficacy of the project confirmed, according to Dr. Jiménez-Sánchez, that [...] "It is not possible today to say genetic variation is responsible for the unique H1N1 Influenza A mortality rate in Mexico. However, knowledge of genomic variability in the Mexican population can allow the identification of genetic variations that confer susceptibility to common diseases, including infections such as the flu." [...] "It will also help develop pharmacogenomics to help produce medicines tailored to people of a specific genetic group, to the creation of drugs that are both safer and more effective." [...] Calderón commended the achievement: [...] "The genomic map of the Mexican population is an essential contribution of Mexico to science and public health. This study represents an important landmark to develop genomic medicine in Mexico to improve healthcare of its population. <b>I</b> <b>commend</b> our National Institute of Genomic Medicine, INMEGEN, for such a significant milestone." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "To pious readers, greeting: 'Inasmuch as a {{faithful}} testimonial {{of learning and}} piety {{ought not to be}} refused to any learned and pious man, so neither to James Arminius, a native of Amsterdam , for his deportment while he attended the University of Basle was marked by piety, moderation, and assiduity in study and very often, in the course of our theological discussions, he made his gift of a discerning spirit so manifest to all of us, as to elicit from us well-merited congratulations. More recently, too, in certain extraordinary prelections delivered with the consent, and by the order, of the Theological Faculty, in which he publicly expounded a few chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, he gave us the best ground to hope that he was destined erelong — if, indeed, he goes on to stir up the gift of God that is in him — to undertake and sustain the function of teaching, to which he may be lawfully set apart, with much fruit to the Church. <b>I</b> <b>commend</b> him, accordingly, to all good men, and, in particular, to the Church of God in the famous city of Amsterdam and I respectfully entreat that regard may be had to that learned and pious youth, so that he may never be under the necessity of intermitting theological studies which have been thus far so happily prosecuted. Farewell ! 'John James Grynaeus, ' Professor of Sacred Literature, and Dean of the Theological Faculty. — Written with mine own hand. Basle, 3rd September, 1583.' ...|$|E
