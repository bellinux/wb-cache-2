40|$|In {{a recent}} study [S. Das, J. H. Snoeijer and D. Lohse Phys. Rev. E 82 056310 (2010) ], we {{provided}} quantitative demonstration of the conjecture [W. A. Ducker Langmuir 25 8907 (2009) ] {{that the presence of}} impurities at the surface layer (or the air-water interface) of surface nanobubbles can substantially lower the gas-side contact angle and the Laplace pressure of the nanobubbles. Through an analytical model for any general air-water interface without nonideality effects, we showed that a large concentration of soluble impurities at the air-water interface of the nanobubbles ensures significantly small contact angles (matching well with the experimental results) and Laplace pressure (though large enough to forbid stability). In this paper this general model is extended to incorporate the effect of nonidealities at the air-water interface in impurity-induced alteration of surface nanobubble properties. Such nonideality effects arise from finite enthalpy or entropy of mixing or finite ionic interactions of the <b>impurity</b> <b>molecules</b> at the nanobubble air-water interface and ensure significant lowering of the nanobubble contact angle and Laplace pressure even at relatively small impurity coverage. In fact for <b>impurity</b> <b>molecules</b> that show enhanced tendency to get adsorbed at the nanobubble air-water interface from the bulk phase, impurity-induced lowering of the nanobubble contact angle is witnessed for extremely small bulk concentration.

40|$|A reduced {{equation}} of motion that describes the excited-state dynamics of interacting two-level <b>impurity</b> <b>molecules</b> in a dielectric host crystal is derived starting from a microscopic model for the total system. Our theory generalizes the derivation of the conventional superradiance master equation for molecules in vacuum; the role of photons in the conventional theory is played by polaritons (mixed crystal-radiation excitations) in our approach. Our final equation thus contains dispersive and superradiant polariton-mediated intermolecular interactions. The effect of the dielectric host is completely contained within a rescaling of these interactions with the transverse dielectric function ε(ω) of the crystal taken at the impurity’s transition frequency. Our theory yields all local field and screening factors for both the dispersive and the dissipative couplings from a single, unified starting point.
