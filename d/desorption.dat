5|$|Where ν and Ediff are as {{described}} above, Γ is the jump or hopping rate, T is temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Ediff must be {{smaller than the}} energy of <b>desorption</b> for diffusion to occur, otherwise <b>desorption</b> processes would dominate. Importantly, equation 1 tells us how very strongly the jump rate varies with temperature. The manner in which diffusion takes place {{is dependent on the}} relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor: when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion. This case, known as mobile diffusion, is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems. For the phenomena described throughout this article, it is assumed that Ediff >> kBT and therefore Γ << ν. In the case of Fickian diffusion it is possible to extract both the ν and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient, D, versus 1/T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present (see below), there may be more than one Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature.|$|E
25|$|Thermal <b>desorption</b> {{is highly}} {{effective}} at removing PCBs from soil.|$|E
25|$|DESI is a {{combination}} of electrospray (ESI) and <b>desorption</b> (DI) ionization methods.|$|E
25|$|Liquids {{with the}} analyte {{dissolved}} in them, or solutions, can be ionized through {{methods such as}} matrix-assisted laser <b>desorption</b> , electrospray ionization, and atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization.|$|E
25|$|Others include photoionization, glow discharge, field <b>desorption</b> (FD), fast atom {{bombardment}} (FAB), thermospray, desorption/ionization on silicon (DIOS), Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART), {{atmospheric pressure}} chemical ionization (APCI), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), spark ionization and thermal ionization (TIMS).|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} {{solubilization}} and recovery, the surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation process involves the injection of hydrocarbon mitigation agents or specialty surfactants into the subsurface to enhance <b>desorption</b> and recovery of bound up otherwise recalcitrant non aqueous phase liquid (NAPL).|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry {{was awarded}} to John Bennett Fenn for the {{development}} of electrospray ionization (ESI) and Koichi Tanaka {{for the development of}} soft laser <b>desorption</b> (SLD) and their application to the ionization of biological macromolecules, especially proteins.|$|E
25|$|Thermal <b>desorption</b> is a {{technology}} for soil remediation. During the process a desorber volatilizes the contaminants (e.g. oil, mercury or hydrocarbon) {{to separate them}} from especially soil or sludge. After that the contaminants can either be collected or destroyed in an offgas treatment system.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to increasing adsorption in MOFs is {{to alter the}} system {{in such a way}} that chemisorption becomes possible. This functionality has been introduced by making a composite material, which contains a MOF and a complex of platinum with activated carbon. In an effect known as hydrogen spillover, H2 can bind to the platinum surface through a dissociative mechanism which cleaves the hydrogen molecule into two hydrogen atoms and enables them to travel down the activated carbon onto the surface of the MOF. This innovation produced a threefold increase in the room-temperature storage capacity of a MOF; however, <b>desorption</b> can take upwards of 12 hours, and reversible <b>desorption</b> is sometimes observed for only two cycles. The relationship between hydrogen spillover and hydrogen storage properties in MOFs is not well understood but may prove relevant to hydrogen storage.|$|E
25|$|The EMC of wood {{varies with}} the ambient {{relative}} humidity (a function of temperature) significantly, {{to a lesser degree}} with the temperature. Siau (1984) reported that the EMC also varies very slightly with species, mechanical stress, drying history of wood, density, extractives content and the direction of sorption in which the moisture change takes place (i.e. adsorption or <b>desorption).</b>|$|E
25|$|Infrared laser {{wavelengths}} {{used for}} infrared MALDI include the 2.94nbsp&µm , mid-IR optical parametric oscillator, and 10.6nbsp&µm carbon dioxide laser. Although not as common, infrared lasers are used {{due to their}} softer mode of ionization. IR-MALDI also {{has the advantage of}} greater material removal (useful for biological samples), less low-mass interferences, and compatibility with other matrix-free laser <b>desorption</b> mass spectrometry methods.|$|E
25|$|Wood is a {{hygroscopic}} substance. It has {{the ability}} to take in or give off moisture in the form of vapour. Water contained in wood exerts vapour pressure of its own, which is determined by the maximum size of the capillaries filled with water at any time. If water vapour pressure in the ambient space is lower than vapour pressure within wood, <b>desorption</b> takes place. The largest-sized capillaries, which are full of water at the time, empty first. Vapour pressure within the wood falls as water is successively contained in smaller capillaries. A stage is eventually reached when vapour pressure within the wood equals vapour pressure in the ambient space above the wood, and further <b>desorption</b> ceases. The amount of moisture that remains in the wood at this stage is in equilibrium with water vapour pressure in the ambient space, and is termed the equilibrium moisture content or EMC (Siau, 1984). Because of its hygroscopicity, wood tends to reach a moisture content that is in equilibrium with the relative humidity and temperature of the surrounding air.|$|E
25|$|MALDI {{methodology}} is a three-step process. First, {{the sample}} is mixed with a suitable matrix material and applied to a metal plate. Second, a pulsed laser irradiates the sample, triggering ablation and <b>desorption</b> of the sample and matrix material. Finally, the analyte molecules are ionized by being protonated or deprotonated in the hot plume of ablated gases, and can then be accelerated into whichever mass spectrometer is used to analyse them.|$|E
25|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope {{can remove}} SAM molecules in many different ways. The first is to remove them mechanically by dragging the tip across the substrate surface. This {{is not the most}} desired technique as these tips are expensive and dragging them causes a lot of wear and reduction of the tip quality. The second way is to degrade or desorb the SAM molecules by shooting them with an electron beam. The {{scanning tunneling microscope}} can also remove SAMs by field <b>desorption</b> and field enhanced surface diffusion.|$|E
25|$|Adsorption is the {{adhesion}} of atoms, ions or molecules from a gas, liquid or {{dissolved solid}} to a surface. This process creates {{a film of}} the adsorbate {{on the surface of}} the adsorbent. This process differs from absorption, in which a fluid (the absorbate) is dissolved by or permeates a liquid or solid (the absorbent), respectively. Adsorption is a surface-based process while absorption involves the whole volume of the material. The term sorption encompasses both processes, while <b>desorption</b> is the reverse of it. Adsorption is a surface phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} of the MALDI technology and comparable instruments are today produced for very different purposes. From more academic and analytical, to more industrial and high throughput. The MS field has expanded into requiring ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry such as the FT-ICR instruments {{as well as more}} high-throughput instruments. As many MALDI MS instruments can be bought with an interchangeable ionization source (Electrospray ionization, MALDI, Atmospheric pressure ionization, etc.) the technologies often overlap and many times any soft ionization method could potentially be used. For more variations of soft ionization methods go to Soft laser <b>desorption</b> or Ion source.|$|E
25|$|Another method {{good for}} biomolecules is Matrix {{assisted}} laser <b>desorption</b> electrospray ionization (MALDESI). In this technique, it utilizes Infrared laser ionization to excite the sample molecules {{to allow for}} the desorbed ions to be ready for MS analysis. The geometry of the source and the distance between the ESI and matrix will have and effect on the efficiency of the sample compound. This technique can also be used with aqueous samples as well. The water droplet can be placed at {{the focal point of the}} laser, or the droplet can be dried to form the solid. Planar samples do not need sample preparation to perform this experiment.|$|E
25|$|Laser <b>desorption</b> {{electrospray}} ionization (LDESI) {{mass spectrometry}} is an ambient ionization technique applicable to {{plant and animal}} tissue imaging, live-cell imaging, and most recently to cell-by-cell imaging. This technique uses a mid-IR laser to ablate the sample which creates a cloud of neutral molecules. This cloud is then hit with the electrospray from above to cause ionization. The desorbed ions are then able to pass into the mass spectrometer for analysis. This method is also good for imaging in applications. The analyses can be desorbed through a pulsed laser irradiation without the need of a matrix. This method is best used with small organic molecules up to larger biomolecules as well.|$|E
25|$|Ellipsometric {{porosimetry}} {{measures the}} change of the optical properties and thickness of the materials during adsorption and <b>desorption</b> of a volatile species at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure depending on the application. The EP technique is unique {{in its ability to}} measure porosity of very thin films down to 10nm, its reproducibility and speed of measurement. Compared to traditional porosimeters, Ellipsometer porosimeters are well suited to very thin film pore size and pore size distribution measurement. Film porosity is a key factor in silicon based technology using low-κ materials, organic industry (encapsulated organic light-emitting diodes) {{as well as in the}} coating industry using sol gel techniques.|$|E
25|$|The term matrix-assisted laser <b>desorption</b> {{ionization}} (MALDI) {{was coined}} in 1985 by Franz Hillenkamp, Michael Karas and their colleagues. These {{researchers found that}} the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed 266nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide melittin could be ionized when mixed {{with this kind of}} “matrix”. The breakthrough for large molecule laser <b>desorption</b> ionization came in 1987 when Koichi Tanaka of Shimadzu Corporation and his co-workers used what they called the “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30nm cobalt particles in glycerol with a 337nm nitrogen laser for ionization. Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized. Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266nm laser. Further improvements were realized {{through the use of a}} 355nm laser and the cinnamic acid derivatives ferulic acid, caffeic acid and sinapinic acid as the matrix. The availability of small and relatively inexpensive nitrogen lasers operating at 337nm wavelength and the first commercial instruments introduced in the early 1990s brought MALDI to an increasing number of researchers. Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{treatment}} stage utilises the exothermic nature of adsorption {{and results in}} <b>desorption,</b> partial cracking and polymerization of the adsorbed organics. The final step aims to remove charred organic residue formed in the porous structure in the previous stage and re-expose the porous carbon structure regenerating its original surface characteristics. After treatment the adsorption column can be reused. Per adsorption-thermal regeneration cycle between 5–15 wt% of the carbon bed is burnt off resulting {{in a loss of}} adsorptive capacity. Thermal regeneration is a high energy process due to the high required temperatures making it both an energetically and commercially expensive process. Plants that rely on thermal regeneration of activated carbon have to be of a certain size before it is economically viable to have regeneration facilities onsite. As a result, it is common for smaller waste treatment sites to ship their activated carbon cores to specialised facilities for regeneration.|$|E
25|$|Expanded-bed {{adsorption}} (EBA) chromatography is {{a convenient}} and effective technique for {{the capture of}} proteins directly from unclarified crude sample. In EBA chromatography, the settled bed is first expanded by upward flow of equilibration buffer. The crude feed, a mixture of soluble proteins, contaminants, cells, and cell debris, is then passed upward through the expanded bed. Target proteins are captured on the adsorbent, while particulates and contaminants pass through. A change to elution buffer while maintaining upward flow results in <b>desorption</b> of the target protein in expanded-bed mode. Alternatively, if the flow is reversed, the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an elution buffer. The mode used for elution (expanded-bed versus settled-bed) depends {{on the characteristics of}} the feed. After elution, the adsorbent is cleaned with a predefined cleaning-in-place (CIP) solution, with cleaning followed by either column regeneration (for further use) or storage.|$|E
500|$|Surface {{diffusion}} is {{a critically}} important concept in heterogeneous catalysis, as reaction rates are often {{dictated by the}} ability of reactants to [...] "find" [...] each other at a catalyst surface. With increased temperature adsorbed molecules, molecular fragments, atoms, and clusters tend to have much greater mobility (see equation 1). However, with increased temperature the lifetime of adsorption decreases as the factor kBT becomes large enough for the adsorbed species to overcome the barrier to <b>desorption,</b> Q (see figure 2). Reaction thermodynamics aside because of the interplay between increased rates of diffusion and decreased lifetime of adsorption, increased temperature may in some cases decrease the overall rate of the reaction.|$|E

2500|$|Redox {{reactions}} involving Fe {{also appear}} to be essential factors in the fate of arsenic in aquatic systems. The reduction of iron oxyhydroxides {{plays a key role}} in the release of arsenic to water. So arsenic can be enriched in water with elevated Fe concentrations. [...] Under oxidizing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized from pyrite or iron oxides especially at elevated pH. Under reducing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized by reductive <b>desorption</b> or dissolution when associated with iron oxides. The reductive <b>desorption</b> occurs under two circumstances. One is when arsenate is reduced to arsenite which adsorbs to iron oxides less strongly. [...] The other results from a change in the charge on the mineral surface which leads to the <b>desorption</b> of bound arsenic.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first and}} most {{important}} step in sample preparation for mass spectrometry is determining what phase the sample needs to be in. Different ionization methods require different sample phases. Solid phase samples can be ionized through methods such as field <b>desorption,</b> plasma-desorption, fast atom bombardment, and secondary-ion ionization.|$|E
2500|$|DESI {{has been}} widely studied since its {{inception}} in 2004 by Professor Zoltan Takáts, [...] et al., in Professor Graham Cooks' group from Purdue University with the goal of looking into methods that didn't require the sample to be inside of a vacuum. Both DESI and direct analysis in real time (DART) have been largely responsible for the rapid growth in ambient ionization techniques, with a proliferation of more than thirty new techniques being found today. These methods allow for complex systems to be analyzed without preparation and throughputs as high as 45 samples a minute. DESI is a combination popular techniques, such as, electrospray ionization and surface <b>desorption</b> techniques. Electrospray ionization with mass spectrometry was reported by Malcolm Dole in 1968, but John Bennett Fenn was awarded a nobel prize in chemistry for the development of ESI-MS in the late 1980s. Then in 1999, <b>desorption</b> of open surface and free matrix experiments were reported in the literature utilizing an experiment that was called desorption/ionization on silicon. The combination of these two advancements led to the introduction of DESI and DART as the main ambient ionization techniques that would later become multiple different techniques. One in particular, due to increasing studies into optimization of DESI is, Nanospray <b>desorption</b> electrospray ionization. In this technique the analyte is desorbed into a bridge formed via two capillaries and the analysis surface.|$|E
2500|$|To date, {{hydrogen}} {{storage in}} MOFs {{at room temperature}} is a battle between maximizing storage capacity and maintaining reasonable <b>desorption</b> rates, while conserving {{the integrity of the}} adsorbent framework (e.g. completely evacuating pores, preserving the MOF structure, etc.) over many cycles. There are two major strategies governing the design of MOFs for hydrogen storage: ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{remediation}} approaches {{consist of}} soil excavation and {{disposal to landfill}} and groundwater [...] "pump and treat". In-situ technologies include {{but are not limited}} to: solidification and stabilization, soil vapor extraction, permeable reactive barriers, monitored natural attenuation, bioremediation-phytoremediation, chemical oxidation, steam-enhanced extraction and in situ thermal <b>desorption</b> and have been used extensively in the USA.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biogeochemistry}} {{of arsenic}} {{is complex and}} includes various adsorption and <b>desorption</b> processes. The toxicity of arsenic is connected to its solubility and is affected by pH. Arsenite (...) is more soluble than arsenate (...) and is more toxic; however, at a lower pH, arsenate becomes more mobile and toxic. It was found that addition of sulfur, phosphorus, and iron oxides to high-arsenite soils greatly reduces arsenic phytotoxicity.|$|E
2500|$|Electron {{ionization}} {{and chemical}} ionization {{are used for}} gases and vapors. In chemical ionization sources, the analyte is ionized by chemical ion-molecule reactions during collisions in the source. Two techniques often used with liquid and solid biological samples include electrospray ionization (invented by John Fenn) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI, initially developed as a similar technique [...] "Soft Laser <b>Desorption</b> (SLD)" [...] by K. Tanaka for which a Nobel Prize was awarded and as MALDI by M. Karas and F. Hillenkamp).|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} methods {{can be used}} to {{determine}} this C:T ratio. At the beginning, MS-SnuPE relied on radioactive ddNTPs as the reporter of the primer extension. [...] Fluorescence-based methods or Pyrosequencing can also be used. However, matrix-assisted laser <b>desorption</b> ionization/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis to differentiate between the two polymorphic primer extension products can be used, in essence, based on the GOOD assay designed for SNP genotyping. [...] Ion pair reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (IP-RP-HPLC) has also been used to distinguish primer extension products.|$|E
2500|$|Shotgun {{proteomics}} {{arose from}} the difficulties of using previous technologies to separate complex mixtures. In 1975, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) was described by O’Farrell and Klose {{with the ability to}} resolve complex protein mixtures. [...] The development of matrix-assisted laser <b>desorption</b> ionization (MALDI), [...] electrospray ionization (ESI), [...] and database searching continued to grow the field of proteomics. However these methods still had difficulty identifying and separating low-abundance proteins, aberrant proteins, and membrane proteins. Shotgun proteomics emerged as a method that could resolve even these proteins.|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{studies have}} shown that the {{mobility}} of TNT degradation products is likely to be lower “than TNT in subsurface environments where specific adsorption to clay minerals dominates the sorption process.” [...] Thus, the mobility of TNT and its transformation products are dependent on the characteristics of the sorbent. The mobility of TNT in groundwater and soil has been extrapolated from “sorption and <b>desorption</b> isotherm models determined with humic acids, in aquifer sediments, and soils”. [...] From these models, it is predicted that TNT has a low retention and transports readily in the environment.|$|E

[...] TiS2 nanotubes with open ended tips are reported to store up to 2.5 weight percent hydrogen at 25 ⁰C and 4 MPa hydrogen gas pressure. Absorption and <b>desorption</b> rates are fast, which is an attractive for hydrogen storage. The hydrogen atoms are postulated to bind to sulfur.|$|E
