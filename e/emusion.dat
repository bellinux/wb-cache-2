40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the possibility of}} spin-coating a silver halide <b>emusion</b> similar to that used on Kodak HRP plates onto a positive resist coating reticle blank was made. By changing the cating weight and temperature of the emulsion {{it was found that the}} emulsion could be coated onto the reticle without harm to the positive resist material. A five micron width line was imaged successfully and measured in the final chrome sub-layer of the reticle...|$|E
40|$|Charles University in Prague Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Králové Department of Pharmaceutical Technology Student: Nikola Mrázková Supervisor of Diploma thesis: Doc. RNDr. Milan Dittrich CSc. Title of Diploma thesis: Formulation of {{nanoparticles}} with terbinafine In {{the theoretical}} {{part of this}} diploma thesis is presented review concerning basic applications of nanotechnology in health service, characteristic of nanoparticles, their dividing and use in pharmacotherapy, especially in targeted drug transport. The focus of the thesis presented here is in experimental part. Particles of submicrom size were fabricated by the using of <b>emusion</b> solvent distribution method in the emulsion of o/w type. Star-like terpolymer of DL- lactic acid and glycolic acid branched on tripentaerytritole as core was used as potential drug carrier. The aim was to prepare the smallest particles as possible. The size and the size distribution were measured by the PCS method by the using of the device Zeta Sizer ZS. The impact of two from the chemical point of view different emulsifiers and two emulsion concentrations on the granulometric parameters of the prepared particles was evaluated. The stability of parameters during storage at lowered temperature and in the frozen state during the one day period after preparation was [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{stability}} determination of model O/W (30 / 70) emulsions at 25 °C. In fact, the time and emulsifier concentration (Tego Care PS) dependences of physical properties (aging) were monitored. In {{the second part of}} the work, the influence of conservant on emulsion stabilities were studied. In order to study physical properties of <b>emusions</b> rheometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and optical microscopy were employed. The rheological measurement provided information on viscosity and viscoelastic modulus. DSC experiments used the repeated freezing/thawing cycles which allowed monitoring of changes in crystallization temperature of water present in emulsions and melting enthalpy of ice formed during the cooling. The optical microscopy was used to examine the change in oil droplet size in the course of emulsion destabilization and phase separation. In this case the image analysis was carried out using program HarFA. The results showed that due to the emulsion creaming, the oil droplets diffuse and aggregate which causes phase separation. Those processes were quickest for the emulsion with lowest emulsifier concentration 0. 1 % (destabilization during 51 days) The emulsions with emulsifier concentration about 1. 5 and 1. 3 % were stable at least for 4 months. The presence of the coemulsifiers increased the elastic modulus and descreased the phase difference due to the network formation. It was shown that for the stability determination is necessary to use conservant due to risk of microbial contamination. DSC experiments allowed to distingush samples prepared under different conditions. Lower rotational speed during emulsion preparation caused the appearance of two melting and crystalization peaks while for higher speed only one peak was observed...|$|R
