5|$|Following the war, Ljotić's {{body was}} removed from the tomb <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> buried. Two {{theories}} exist about what happened to it. One claims it was removed by Ljotić's followers and taken to an unknown location following the creation of the Free Territory of Trieste in 1947. The other theory holds that Ljotić was buried in Šempeter pri Gorici until the signing of the Treaty of Osimo in 1977, when his followers removed his body from the tomb <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> buried and took it to an unknown location outside Yugoslavia, possibly to Italy.|$|E

5|$|Before {{applying}} the top coats of paint, the LMS would apply a matt undercoat of shop grey <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> customary {{to photograph the}} locomotive for the first time. The ensuing LMS top coats for the Coronation Class came in two basic colours during this period: Caledonian blue and crimson lake. Linings for streamliners involved the renowned 'speed whiskers' comprising stripes emerging from a fixed point in the lower centre of {{the front of the}} locomotive to run in parallel along the sides. Non-streamliners carried the standard LMS-style lining.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi was {{transported to}} {{hospital}} with severe head injuries, and {{was moved to}} his native France in November. He remained there until his death more than nine months later on 17 July 2015, when he was mourned by the motor sport community. Bianchi's accident prompted Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), to investigate the incident with a ten-person panel <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> determined there was no single cause that prompted the crash. The victory allowed Hamilton to increase his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points over Rosberg, who was 63 points in front of Daniel Ricciardo. Mercedes extended their advantage over Red Bull in the Constructors' Championship, and Williams remained ahead of Ferrari {{in the battle for}} third place with four races left in the season.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 {{was first}} {{designated}} by 1936 {{to run from}} US 113 (now DE 1) southeast of Dover north to US 13 in Smyrna, following its current alignment to Leipsic and Smyrna-Leipsic Road to Smyrna.

DE 9 was extended further north to DE 2 by the 1970s. The route was rerouted to bypass downtown New Castle in the 1980s. The intersection with DE 1 was reconstructed into an interchange in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has {{been lost in the}} past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{continued}} efforts of U.S. Chess Federation officials, a special FIDE Congress was held in March 1975 in Bergen, Netherlands, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> accepted that the match should be of unlimited duration, but the 9–9 clause was once again rejected, by a narrow margin of 35 votes to 32. FIDE set a deadline of April 1, 1975, for Fischer and Karpov to confirm {{their participation in the}} match. No reply was received from Fischer by April 3. Thus, by default, Karpov officially became World Champion. In his 1991 autobiography, Karpov professed regret that the match had not taken place, and claimed that the lost opportunity to challenge Fischer held back his own chess development. Karpov met with Fischer several times after 1975, in friendly but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match since Karpov would never agree to play to 10.|$|E
5|$|Griesbach {{agreed with}} Woide and {{expanded}} on Michaelis' point of view. If this manuscript has been corrupted from a version, {{it is more}} reasonable to suspect the Coptic, the version of the country <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written. Between this manuscript and both the Coptic and Syriac versions there is a remarkable coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex by letter A.|$|E

5|$|HMV's Poll of Polls was {{an annual}} list of albums {{compiled}} by British music retailer HMV from 1998 to 2012. The listing was created each December by collating year-end polls from approximately 30music magazines, newspapers and guides {{to determine the}} most critically acclaimed albums of the year. An album's placing in the list {{was determined by the}} number of different polls <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> included. In the event of two records featuring in the same number of polls, the album with the highest combined placings was given the higher position on the Poll of Polls. In 2011, Let England Shake by PJ Harvey was named the best album of the year after receiving 21nominations– the following year, Channel Orange by Frank Ocean topped the poll with 22nominations.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Debbie was {{an intense}} and {{long-lived}} hurricane that formed during August 1969. The fifth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, third hurricane and second major hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Debbie formed on August 14 {{in the southern}} Atlantic Ocean and took a general northwesterly path until turning northward into the central Atlantic. The storm was characterized by numerous fluctuations in intensity, and it reached winds corresponding to Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale on four separate occasions. The hurricane bypassed the island of Bermuda to the southeast on August 22, before ultimately brushing southeastern Newfoundland with strong winds. It dissipated over the cold waters east of Greenland. Although Debbie {{had little effect on}} land, it was extensively researched and was subject to a weather modification experiment by Project Stormfury, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> seeded with silver iodide.|$|E
5|$|In 1515, Pope Leo X {{granted a}} plenary indulgence {{intended}} {{to finance the}} construction of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It would apply to almost any sin, including adultery and theft. All other indulgence preaching was to cease for the eight years <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> offered. Indulgence preachers were given strict instructions on how the indulgence was to be preached, and they were much more laudatory of the indulgence than those of earlier indulgences. Johann Tetzel was commissioned to preach and offer the indulgence in 1517, and his campaign in cities near Wittenberg drew many Wittenbergers to travel to these cities and purchase them, since sales had been prohibited in Wittenberg and other Saxon cities.|$|E
