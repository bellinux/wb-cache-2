5|$|MI6 sends James Bond, agent 007, {{into the}} field to spy on a {{terrorist}} arms bazaar on the Russian border. Despite M's insistence on letting 007 finish his reconnaissance, British Admiral Roebuck orders the frigate HMS Chester to launch a missile attack on the arms bazaar. Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L-39 Albatros, and as the missile is too <b>far</b> <b>along</b> to be aborted, 007 hijacks the L-39 and flies away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} fitting out, the ship's {{flagship}} facilities, {{including those}} on the bridge and in the admiral's cabins, were modified to satisfy Combined Fleet's desire to have the ship equipped as the primary flagship of the commander-in-chief, as her sister Yamato was too <b>far</b> <b>along</b> for such changes. These alterations, along with improvements in the secondary battery armour, pushed back completion and pre-handover testing of Musashi by two months, to August 1942.|$|E
5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly {{before he went to}} bed. Kelly and Kate had gone to bed earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not know how <b>far</b> <b>along</b> they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E

5|$|In The Ant and the Grasshopper, a {{grasshopper}} squanders {{the spring}} and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food. After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars – that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. Although the film was already <b>far</b> <b>along,</b> Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Sección de Investigación de Accidentes of Guatemala's Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil.

25|$|Daniel was suffocated {{and killed}} in his bedroom, {{and a copy of}} the Bible was left by his body. Daniel had {{internal}} injuries to the throat area, showing no bruises. Daniel's exact time of death is unknown. The reports determined Daniel was sedated with Xanax and likely unconscious when he was killed. Daniel's body had also just started to show signs of decomposition but was not as <b>far</b> <b>along</b> as his mother's body.|$|E
25|$|The alcohol {{dependence}} syndrome {{was seen as}} a cluster of seven elements that concur. It was argued that not all elements may be present in every case, but the picture is sufficiently regular and coherent to permit clinical recognition. The syndrome was also considered to exist in degrees of severity rather than as a categorical absolute. Thus, the proper question is not ‘whether a person is dependent on alcohol’, but ‘how <b>far</b> <b>along</b> the path of dependence has a person progressed’.|$|E

25|$|Cuba {{received}} 150 T-34-85 tanks {{as military}} {{aid from the}} Soviet Union in 1960. The T-34-85 was the first Soviet tank to enter service with the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (<b>FAR),</b> <b>along</b> with the IS-2. Many T-34-85 tanks first saw action in April 1961 during the Bay of Pigs Invasion with an unknown number destroyed or knocked out during the battle. In 1975, large quantities of T-34-85s were also donated from the USSR to the FAR to support its lengthy intervention in the Angolan Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} {{was found to be}} pilot error. The aircraft had not been in a stable approach, landed at too high a speed, and touched down too <b>far</b> <b>along</b> the runway to have sufficient distance available in which to stop. The location where the aircraft ended up meant that the post-crash fire was exacerbated. Only one of the three fire engines had a key to the gate, which delayed their arrival at the crash site. Subsequent to this accident, the airport operator has ensured that all fire engines are provided with keys to all gates they need access to. All four on board the aircraft survived the accident, but were killed by the post-crash fire.|$|E
25|$|According to the UK {{newspaper}} The Daily Telegraph, a {{quota of}} 20,000 abortions and sterilizations {{was set for}} Huaiji County in Guangdong Province in one year due to reported disregard of the one-child policy. According to the article local officials were being pressured into purchasing portable ultrasound devices to identify abortion candidates in remote villages. The article also reported that women as <b>far</b> <b>along</b> as 8.5 months pregnant were forced to abort, usually by an injection of saline solution. A 1993 book by social scientist Steven W. Mosher reported that women in their ninth month of pregnancy, or already in labour, were having their children killed whilst in the birth canal or immediately after birth.|$|E

25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} <b>far</b> <b>along</b> it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the German 4th Army in {{preventing}} the Fifth Army from advancing <b>far</b> <b>along</b> the Gheluvelt Plateau, led Haig to reinforce the offensive in the south-east, along the southern side of Passchendaele Ridge. Haig gave principal authority for the offensive to the Second Army (General Herbert Plumer) on 25 August. Like Gough after 31 July, Plumer planned to launch a series of attacks with even more limited geographical objectives, using the extra heavy artillery brought in from the armies further south to deepen and increase {{the weight of the}} creeping barrage. Plumer intended to ensure that the infantry were organised on tactically advantageous ground and in contact with their artillery, when they received German counter-attacks. Minor operations by both sides continued in September along the Second and Fifth army fronts, the boundary of which had been moved northwards, close to the Ypres–Roulers railway at the end of August.|$|E
500|$|The NKAP {{approved}} the preliminary specifications of the I-250 on 19 September 1944 {{which included a}} maximum speed of [...] a take-off weight of [...] and a time to [...] of 3.9 minutes. A mock-up was inspected on 26 October and rejected because of the poor cockpit layout, although this decision was reversed because the fuselage of the first prototype was too <b>far</b> <b>along</b> for major changes that would have significantly delayed the program. That same month the combustion chamber was sent to TsIAM for testing which revealed it to be too weak. The complete powerplant was tested in December, but the drive shaft connecting them failed several times.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of his radar work and the few months spent with Fermi, Alvarez arrived at Los Alamos in the spring of 1944, later than many of his contemporaries. The work on the [...] "Little Boy" [...] (a uranium bomb) was <b>far</b> <b>along</b> so Alvarez became {{involved}} {{in the design of the}} [...] "Fat Man" [...] (a plutonium bomb). The technique used for uranium, that of forcing the two sub-critical masses together using a type of gun, would not work with plutonium because the high level of background spontaneous neutrons would cause fissions as soon as the two parts approached each other, so heat and expansion would force the system apart before much energy has been released. It was decided to use a nearly critical sphere of plutonium and compress it quickly by explosives into a much smaller and denser core, a technical challenge at the time.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} turned over to the Sevastopol port {{authorities}} before being stricken on 14 August 1907. Before she was fully dismantled the Naval Ministry decided to use her hull for full-scale armour trials. She was re-designated as Stricken Vessel Nr. 4 on 22 April 1912. Chesma was fitted with a replica of the armour system used in the s to test its effectiveness. She was towed into position and given a 7° list to simulate the descent angle of shells fired at long range. Ironically her own guns were used against her as Ioann Zlatoust anchored [...] away and fired 12-inch, [...] and 6-inch shells with reduced charges to simulate shells fired from approximately [...] away. These revealed significant weaknesses in the support structure for the armour plates and in the deck protection, but the Gangut-class ships were too <b>far</b> <b>along</b> in construction to incorporate fixes. Afterwards she served as a torpedo target for the destroyers of the Black Sea Fleet. During these attacks she settled {{to the bottom of the}} Bay of Tendra and was eventually scrapped during the mid-1920s.|$|E
500|$|Besides {{being the}} Usher, Brother Justin {{is also an}} Avataric Creature of Dark. His spiritual {{presentation}} in the series, the Tattooed Man, was portrayed by Don Swayze. Show creator Daniel Knauf saw in Brother Justin [...] "one {{of the most complex}} devils", and envisioned Christopher Walken to play him when he wrote the first draft of the show. Knauf originally designed Brother Justin as a preacher <b>far</b> <b>along</b> in his career as well as a recurring instead of a regular character, [...] "much more evolved towards the dark side." [...] An early draft of Carnivàle gave Brother Justin's real name as Lucius Crowe, a radio preacher who advocated ethnic hatred, especially for Gypsies and carnival folk. It also mentioned Brother Justin joining [...] "The Order of the Knights of Jericho" [...] between 1921 and 1923 and becoming its head in 1926. The completion of the construction of his [...] "Temple of Jericho" [...] was set in Nebraska in 1928. At the series' start initially projected to occur in 1930, the character had already gathered a great army of followers through his [...] "Church of the Air" [...] radio sermons.|$|E
