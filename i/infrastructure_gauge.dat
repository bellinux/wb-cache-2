We therefore focus here on the quantum <b>infrastructure</b> of classical <b>gauge</b> theories. We dedicate these projections to him in friendship and respect. The fundamental problem of physics today is to harmonize our spacetime and quantum concepts and precepts. Their discoverers, Einstein and Heisenberg, violated each other’s main principles and their theories suffered for it. Einstein believed that the Bohr-Heisenberg complementarity of descriptions was less fundamental than the alleged completeness of classical description. His tangent vectors offend against the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Heisenberg believed that spacetime points were not fundamental and referred all quantities to one reference time. His operator-algebra concept infringes Einstein’s localit...|$|R

50|$|Just {{south of}} the main {{entrance}} and main security fence stands a single railway platform, for workers access to the site. Within the security fence, the marshalling yard of 8 parallel loops exists, formerly shunted by a dedicated MoD diesel hydraulic shunting locomotive.

50|$|When {{building}} new railways or extensive reinvestments {{are made to}} the existing railway <b>infrastructure,</b> the <b>gauge</b> is expanded to SE-C that also accepts UIC GC. The structure gauge on {{the bulk of the}} system already (2012) allows large cars built to SE-C, albeit with restrictions and a special permit. The remaining limitation is the track circuits, the blocks are not dimensioned for the extra width and a large car placed to close to a turnout at a passing loop may intrude on the structure envelope of the through line. As a stop-gap this is generally solved by adding an extra normal-sized car at the tail-end to ensure that no part of the consist obstruct the space needed by passing trains (the engine serves the same function at the front-end). The larger cars are also barred from using certain industrial spurs leading to warehouses or loading docks built for the narrower cars.|$|R
50|$|In 1870 the LNWR (who {{had taken}} over both the narrow and {{standard}} gauge routes) extended the standard gauge line northwards past {{the edge of the}} harbour estate to , thereby linking to Bangor {{and the rest of the}} UK. Shortly afterwards a branch was opened extending initially to St Helens Road, just into the harbour estate. This moved the northern transshipment process nearer the water's edge, but it continued all the same. Within a couple of years the standard gauge tracks were extended to the quayside, obliterating the narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> north of the Afon Seiont and permanently removing the need for transshipment in the town.|$|R

The line was to open in four stages and be completed by 2015 as the third of the seven Transit City lines after the Sheppard East LRT and Etobicoke-Finch West LRT (today's Finch West LRT). Unlike the other Transit City lines, this service would share <b>infrastructure</b> and track <b>gauge</b> with the streetcar system; the other LRTs would not be compatible and use larger vehicles on standard gauge tracking.|$|R

Approximately 478 strategic tide gauges were found to be operational at this time, of which about three-quarters have near-real time data telemetry of various kinds. Around half of the gauges take part in real-time international data exchange. The NEAMTWS network can be considered to be in good shape in that most of its sites for which a gauge exists will be capable of meeting required standards in the near future. On the other hand, NEAMTWS (and the European and North African network in general) contains major gaps along the North African coastline and on European Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts which require new installations. The paper also summaries standards for the various sea level programmes, and reviews existing European infrastructure in the form of data centres and web sites...|$|R
5000|$|In 1872 the LNWR built a {{standard}} gauge {{line at the}} southern end of the route from [...] to a new station at Talysarn, which, confusingly, they named [...] This was built partly on new ground and partly over narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Extensive transshipment yards were laid out at 'Nantlle'. Thereafter narrow gauge wagons arrived from the quarries, their contents (not the wagons and contents) were transshipped onto standard gauge wagons to be taken to the quays at Caernarfon or to anywhere else the LNWR served. This left a couple of miles of 3 ft 6in gauge, horse-drawn tramway linking 'Nantlle' (Talysarn) with several quarries. This remnant was operated as such by the LNWR, then from 1923 the London Midland and Scottish Railway and from 1948 until 1963 by British Railways as far as the Pen-yr-Orsedd Quarry. It is the last recorded use of horses by BR, and closed only with the closure of the branch line to which it connected.|$|R
40|$|The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basin in South Asia, which mainly covers Bangladesh and India territories, has {{periodic}} {{and flash}} floods every year due to Indian monsoon from Bay of Bengal and melting glacier/snow {{water from the}} Himalayas. These three main rivers with countless tributaries not only have seasonal water variation but also occasionally high-elevated waters. However, due to the remoteness and insufficient local <b>infrastructure,</b> river <b>gauges</b> is limited {{in this area and}} the timeliness of data availability is hardly achievable. Therefore, using satellite observation to monitor rivers and streams becomes a promising and necessary technique as the data processing algorithm has been developed and the data is more accessible. In the past two decades, altimetry satellites that were used to observe open ocean had been studied for investigating inland water bodies. The altimetry waveform needs to be carefully retracked in order to identify the water signal in a series of radar echoes. From a chain of well-known altimetry satellites, e. g., ERS- 1 /- 2, TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason- 1 /- 2, and Envisat, the sampling rate is mainly at 18 – 20 Hz after a smoothing from its nominal pulse repetition frequency. However, the sampling rate corresponding to about 350 m on the ground is sometimes insufficient for narrow rivers. Hence, in this study we utilized SARAL/AltiKa, an Indian altimetry satellite operated in Ka band radar, with a sampling rate at 40 Hz, to investigate its applicability in the GBM basin and compare with other independent satellites. Our preliminary result in Yaluzangbu River, the upstream of Brahmaputra, shows the uncertainty of measurements in each cycle has reduced from meters level to below 50 cm...|$|R
40|$|Hydrological data {{collection}} requires deployment of physical <b>infrastructure</b> like rain <b>gauges,</b> water level gauges, {{as well as}} use of expensive equipment like echo sounders. Many {{countries around the world}} have recorded a decrease in deployment of physical infrastructure for hydrological measurements; developing countries especially have less of this infrastructure and, where it exists, it is poorly maintained. Satellite remote sensing can bridge this gap, and has been applied by hydrologists over the years, with the earliest applications in water body and flood mapping. With the availability of more optical satellites with relatively low temporal resolutions globally, satellite data are commonly used for mapping of water bodies, testing of inundation models, precipitation monitoring, and mapping of flood extent. Use of satellite data to estimate hydrological parameters continues to increase due to use of better sensors, improvement in knowledge of and utilization of satellite data, and expansion of research topics. A review of applications of satellite remote sensing in surface water modelling, mapping and parameter estimation is presented, and its limitations for surface water applications are also discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sub-surface {{pressure}} (SSP) {{data from}} tide gauges at three bases on the Pacific {{coast of the}} Antarctic Peninsula, together with SSP information from a bottom pressure recorder deployed {{on the south side}} of the Drake Passage, have been used to study the relationships between SSP, Drake Passage transport, and the strength of Southern Ocean zonal winds as represented by the Southern Annular Mode. High correlations were obtained between all parameters, confirming results obtained previously with independent data sets, and demonstrating the value of information from the permanent Rothera base, the southern-most site considered. These are important findings with regard to the design, installation and maintenance of observation networks in Antarctica. In particular, they provide the necessary justification for Antarctic Peninsula tide <b>gauge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> investment in the lead up to International Polar Year.

30|$|In {{this part}} we {{concentrate}} on research {{that focuses on}} organisational and technological procedures in international railway transport. Evtimov [9] suggested {{that there should be}} interoperability between CIM and SMGS procedures, and identified three phases: (1) a common CIM/SMGS consignment note, (2) a unique claim handling mechanism, and (3) a single Eurasian rail transport law. Zitrický [23] investigated the rationalisation of technological processes in international railway freight transport using network optimising methods such as the program evaluation and review technique (PERT) and the critical path method (CPM). His main focus was on how to reduce the time spent by technological processes. Abramović [1] examined the use of demand forecasting models in international freight transport. Through these models he established not only the influence of the traffic sector but also the key drivers of the economy. Zitrický and Blaho [24] suggested technical and technological parameters for use with the common consignment note CIM/SMGS. In research Drożdziel et al. [7] make a proposal of solving the problems within the East – West transport by building a new broad <b>gauge</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> but they did not make any analyses for organisational optimisation in transport between the East and West. In our research we have used following resources about network techniques modelling: Pašagić [16] and Tulsian and Pandey [21]. Both resources take a strict mathematical approach for explaining network techniques. But Pašagić [16] has also introduced some possible uses of network techniques in transport.|$|R
40|$|Declining <b>gauging</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and fractious water {{politics}} have decreased available information about river flows globally. Remote sensing and water balance modelling are frequently cited as potential solutions, but these techniques largely rely on these same in-decline gauge data to make accurate discharge estimates. A different approach is therefore needed, and we here combine remotely sensed discharge estimates made via at-many-stations hydraulic geometry (AMHG) and the PCR-GLOBWB hydrological model to estimate discharge over the Lower Nile. Specifically, we first estimate initial discharges from 87 Landsat images and AMHG (1984 - 2015), {{and then use}} these flow estimates to tune the model, all without using gauge data. The resulting tuned modelled hydrograph shows a large improvement in flow magnitude: validation of the tuned monthly hydrograph against a historical gauge (1978 - 1984) yields an RMSE of 439 m 3 /s (40. 8 %). By contrast, the original simulation had an order-of-magnitude flow error. This improvement is substantial but not perfect: tuned flows have a one-to two-month wet season lag and a negative baseflow bias. Accounting for this two-month lag yields a hydrograph RMSE of 270 m 3 /s (25. 7 %). Thus, our results coupling physical models and remote sensing is a promising first step and proof of concept toward future modelling of ungauged flows, especially as developments in cloud computing for remote sensing make our method easily applicable to any basin. Finally, we purposefully do not offer prescriptive solutions for Nile management, and rather hope that the methods demonstrated herein can prove useful to river stakeholders in managing their own water...|$|R
50|$|In the 1900s, the Tuscarora Valley {{began to}} suffer from {{increased}} labor expenses and operating costs. The causes are not understood in detail, although they may be attributable in part to capital improvements to the original lightly built narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> including the construction of concrete abutments for the railroad's bridges and a creamery and warehouse in Port Royal in 1912. This era also saw a turnover in the railroad's management; {{after the death of}} T.S. Moorhead in 1906, all of the other Moorheads disappeared from the board and offices of the railroad. Initially replaced by other local men, the railroad then seems to have fallen into the hands of New York investors, such as Jacob S. Farlee, president from 1910 to 1915. However, locals were still represented on the board of directors, albeit as a minority; for instance, J.M. Blair was vice-president of the railroad during this era. A revival of the Tuscarora Railroad's charter was granted in January 1910 {{under the influence of the}} New York group, to extend south to Hancock and the B&O, but the Tuscarora was declared abandoned again in 1912. The financial condition of the Tuscarora Valley continued to deteriorate, and after 1913, it was unable to pay its bonded interest. The railroad was nearly abandoned, but the lumber brokers Blair and Hower bought up the railroad's bonds in early 1915 and gained control of a majority of the stock by 1917. By protecting the unprofitable railroad, they could ensure that their lumber businesses could retain access to what was, as yet, the only means of transportation in the Tuscarora Valley capable of sustaining them.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{demands on}} water supplies, non-point source pollution, and water quality-based {{ecological}} concerns all {{point to the}} need for observing stream flow perturbations and pollutant discharges at higher resolution than was practical in the past. This work presents the results from a test of a rapidly deployable river observational approach consisting of four components: (1) existing geospatial data and federal, state, and private river <b>gauging</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for identifying key river reaches and critical sampling times, (2) human- actuated sensor deployments for broad spatial characterization of the targeted river reach, (3) stationary sensors embedded in the river and its sediments for longer term spatiotemporal observations within the targeted reach, and (4) the robotic Networked Infomechanical System (NIMS RD) for high resolution scanning of spatiotemporal hydraulic and chemical properties at specific points along the reach. The approach is demonstrated for a test bed deployment at the confluence of the Merced and San Joaquin Rivers in Central California. After identifying a suitable reach for the test deployment, a network of on-line gauging stations, accessed through the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC), is used to coordinate the timing of the subsequent three deployment aspects based on flow and river stage forecasts. Kayak-mounted sonar and water quality sensors are used to rapidly survey the test zone bathymetry and basic water quality parameters (temperature, salinity). Results from the rapid survey are then used to guide locations of the sediment- anchored sensor arrays (javelins) which include temperature, water pressure (depth) and water quality sensors distributed vertically at screened intervals. The NIMS RD is comprised of two supporting towers and a suspension cable delivering power and Internet connectivity for controlling and actuating the tram-like NIMS unit. The NIMS unit is capable of raising and lowering a payload of sensors, allowing a preprogrammed or data-actuated adaptive scan to be completed across a stream channel. In this work, NIMS RD is deployed to provide high resolution synoptic sampling of velocity, electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate, ammonium, pH, and temperature distributions across the San Joaquin River channel in the confluence zone. Results from the different aspects of the test deployment are presented and discussed in the context of potential science and engineering applications of this multiscale networked sensing strategy...|$|R
40|$|This {{final report}} {{summarizes}} activities and results at the University of North Carolina {{as part of}} the the SciDAC- 2 Project The Secret Life of Quarks: National Computational Infrastructure for Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics. The overall objective of the project is to construct the software needed to study quantum chromo- dynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interactions of subatomic physics, and similar strongly coupled gauge theories anticipated to be of importance in the LHC era. It built upon the successful efforts of the SciDAC- 1 project National Computational <b>Infrastructure</b> for Lattice <b>Gauge</b> Theory, in which a QCD Applications Programming Interface (QCD API) was developed that enables lat- tice gauge theorists to make effective use {{of a wide variety of}} massively parallel computers. In the SciDAC- 2 project, optimized versions of the QCD API were being created for the IBM Blue- Gene/L (BG/L) and BlueGene/P (BG/P), the Cray XT 3 /XT 4 and its successors, and clusters based on multi-core processors and Infiniband communications networks. The QCD API is being used to enhance the performance of the major QCD community codes and to create new applications. Software libraries of physics tools have been expanded to contain sharable building blocks for inclusion in application codes, performance analysis and visualization tools, and software for au- tomation of physics work flow. New software tools were designed for managing the large data sets generated in lattice QCD simulations, and for sharing them through the International Lattice Data Grid consortium. As part of the overall project, researchers at UNC were funded through ASCR to work in three general areas. The main thrust has been performance instrumentation and analysis in support of the SciDAC QCD code base as it evolved and as it moved to new computation platforms. In support of the performance activities, performance data was to be collected in a database for the purpose of broader analysis. Third, the UNC work was done at RENCI (Renaissance Computing Institute), which has extensive expertise and facilities for scientific data visualization, so we acted in an ongoing consulting and support role in that area...|$|R
