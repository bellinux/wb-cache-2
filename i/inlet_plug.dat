The <b>plug's</b> <b>inlet</b> face defines a central circuit region and a ring-shaped region with the ring-shaped region {{including at least}} some of the plug's remaining portion so-closed to fluid flow. This remaining portion or closed region at each radius R of the ring shaped region satisfies a radius independent, flow-based relationship. Entry openings are defined in the <b>plug's</b> <b>inlet</b> face in correspondence with the holes. The entry openings define an open flow area at each radius of the ring-shaped region.

40|$|Aortic coarctation (CoA) {{accounting}} for 3 - 11 % of {{congenital heart disease}} can be successfully treated. Long-term results, however, have revealed decreased life expectancy associated with abnormal hemodynamics. Accordingly, an assessment of hemodynamics is the key factor in treatment decisions and successful long-term results. In this study, 3 D angiography whole heart (3 DWH) and 4 D phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were acquired. Geometries of the thoracic aorta with CoAs were reconstructed using ZIB-Amira software. X-ray angiograms were {{used to evaluate the}} post-treatment geometry. Computational fluid dynamics models in three patients were created to simulate pre- and post-treatment situations using the FLUENT program. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the impact of the <b>inlet</b> velocity profile (<b>plug</b> vs. MRI-based) with a focus on the peak systole pressure gradient and wall shear stress (WSS). Results show that helical flow at the aorta inlet can significantly affect the assessment of pressure drop and WSS. Simplified <b>plug</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity profiles significantly (p < 0. 05) overestimate the pressure drop in pre- and post-treatment geometries and significantly (p < 0. 05) underestimate surface-averaged WSS. We conclude that the use of the physiologically correct but time-expensive 4 D MRI-based in vivo velocity profile in CFD studies may be an important step towards a patient-specific analysis of CoA hemodynamics...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} conducted to demonstrate catalytic combustion of a residual fuel oil. Three catalytic reactors, including a baseline configuration and two backup configurations based on baseline test results, were operated on No. 6 fuel oil. All reactors were multielement configurations consisting of ceramic honeycomb catalyzed with palladium on stabilized alumina. Stable operation on residual oil was demonstrated with the baseline configuration at a reactor inlet temperature of about 825 K (1025 F). At low inlet temperature, operation was precluded by apparent plugging of the catalytic reactor with residual oil. Reduced plugging tendency was demonstrated in the backup reactors by increasing {{the size of the}} catalyst channels at the reactor <b>inlet,</b> but <b>plugging</b> still occurred at inlet temperature below 725 K (845 F). Operation at the original design inlet temperature of 589 K (600 F) could not be demonstrated. Combustion efficiency above 99. 5 % was obtained with less than 5 % reactor pressure drop.

40|$|SPE Paper 89885 The {{injector}} impairment due to {{suspended particles}} during waterflood project happens in two stages: firstly particles penetrate into a reservoir and are {{captured by the}} rock (deep bed filtration); at the second stage, after the reservoir <b>inlet</b> is <b>plugged</b> by particles, the particles build up a filter cake. Prediction of injectivity decline is based on mathematical modelling of deep bed filtration and filter cake formation. The model parameters are determined from either laboratory tests or field data. The model parameters for deep bed filtration - the filtration and formation damage coefficients - can be determined from laboratory pressure measurements using so-called 3 -point pressure method. The method for determination of the critical porosity fraction, which is necessary for calculation {{of the time of}} transition from deep bed filtration to filter cake buildup, is not available in the literature. In the current paper, the 3 -point pressure method was used for determination of the critical porosity fraction. The data from 18 laboratory tests were treated, and the correlation between the formation damage coefficient and the critical porosity fraction was obtained. This correlation allows determining of the deep bed filtration and filter cake buildup parameters from either routine coreflood test or well injectivity history...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to enhance mixing in T-type micromixers by introducing a constriction in the microchannel under periodic electro-osmotic flow. Two sinusoidal ac electric fields with 180 ° phase difference and similar dc bias are applied at the two inlets. The out of phase ac electric field induces oscillation of fluid interface at the junction of the two inlet channels and the constriction. Due to the constriction introduced at the junction, fluids from these two <b>inlets</b> form alternative <b>plugs</b> at the constricted channel. These plugs of fluids radiate downstream from the constriction into the large channel and form alternate thin crescent-shaped layers of fluids. These crescent-shaped layers of fluids increase tremendously the contact surface area between the two streams of fluid and thus enhance significantly the mixing efficiency. Experimental results and mixing mechanism analysis show that amplitude and frequency of the ac electric field and the length of the constriction govern the mixing efficiency...|$|R

Changing demographics in the UK and reducing leakage have led to significant increases in water age and hence increased risk of poor water quality.

Detailed analysis of flow distribution and water age suggests that tanks with horizontal inlets are better mixed when compared with vertical top water level inlets. With increasing length to width ratio, the flow characteristics of tanks with vertical <b>inlets</b> increasingly resemble <b>plug</b> flow.

40|$|Estimation of the {{intrinsic}} permeability, kl, and Klinkenberg coefficient, b, of tight rock plugs is routinely performed using unsteady state gas-flow experiments. These experiments popularized by Jones (1972) {{and referred to}} as pulse-decay or draw-down methods consist in recording the differential pressure, ∆P(t), {{at the edge of}} a core <b>plug</b> when the <b>inlet</b> of this <b>plug</b> is connected to a gas tank initially put at a given pressure. Using adequate flow models and an inverse technique, kl and b are estimated from the pressure decay. Our purpose in this work is to determine optimum conditions under which precise estimations of both kl and b can be performed. A complete 1 D isothermal gas flow model including Klinkenberg effect was developed and direct numerical simulations were used to determine reduced sensitivity of the pressure decay to kl and b. Conditions under which these two parameters can be estimated independently from a single pressure decay signal were analyzed. Optimal parameters of the experiment including volumes of the upstream and downstream tanks, length and diameter of the plug, initial pressure in the upstream tank and pressure decay recording period are deduced from precision criteria on the estimation of kl and b...|$|R
40|$|Viscous heating {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the dynamics of fluids with strongly temperature-dependent viscosity because of the coupling between the energy and momentum equations. The heat generated by viscous friction produces a local temperature increase near the tube walls with a consequent decrease of the viscosity which may dramatically change the temperature and velocity profiles. These processes are mainly controlled by the Peclét number, the Nahme number, the flow rate and the thermal boundary conditions. The problem of viscous heating in fluids was investigated in the past for its practical interest in the polymer industry, and was invoked to explain some rheological behaviours of silicate melts, but was not completely applied to study magma flows. In this paper we focus on the thermal and mechanical effects caused by viscous heating in tubes of finite lengths. We find that in magma flows at high Nahme number and typical flow rates, viscous heating is responsible for the evolution from Poiseuille flow, with a uniform temperature distribution at the <b>inlet,</b> to a <b>plug</b> flow with a hotter layer near the walls. When the temperature gradients induced by viscous heating are very pronounced, local instabilities may occur and the triggering of secondary flows is possible.

40|$|A {{method has}} been devised for high-volume, {{high-velocity}} surface deposition of protective metallic coatings on otherwise vulnerable surfaces. Thermal spraying is used whereby {{the material to}} be deposited is heated to the melting point by passing through a flame. Rather than the usual method of deposition from the jet formed from the combustion products, this innovation uses non-steady combustion (i. e. high-frequency, periodic, confined bursts), which generates not only higher temperatures and heat transfer rates, but exceedingly high impingement velocities {{an order of magnitude}} higher than conventional thermal systems. Higher impingement rates make for better adhesion. The high heat transfer rates developed here allow the deposition material to be introduced, not as an expensive powder with high surface-area-to-volume, but in convenient rod form, which is also easier and simpler to feed into the system. The nonsteady, resonant combustion process is self-aspirating and requires no external actuation or control and no high-pressure supply of fuel or air. The innovation has been demonstrated using a commercially available resonant combustor shown in the figure. Fuel is naturally aspirated from the tank through the lower Tygon tube and into the pulsejet. Air for starting is ported through the upper Tygon tube line. Once operation commences, this air is no longer needed as additional air is naturally aspirated through the <b>inlet.</b> A spark <b>plug</b> on the device is needed for starting, but the process carries on automatically as the operational device is resonant and reignites itself with each 220 -Hz pulse...|$|R

50|$|No sooner was {{the inlet}} open in 1918 {{than it was}} again filled with sand and debris. There {{were a number of}} {{influential}} citizens in the area who were steadfastly opposed to opening the Sebastian Inlet. Among them were grove owners such as A. B. Michael of Orchid. Michael was opposed to it for several reasons. One, he saw opening an inlet to the ocean as something that would forever change the fragile ecology of the Indian River Lagoon. At that time it was almost a body of fresh water. He was also concerned that the influx of salt water would ruin the fresh water wells essential for his groves. Cattlemen on the mainland nearby also shared a fear that their fresh water wells would be ruined, but the most powerful opponent to the opening was by far Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Rail Road that feared salt water in the lagoon would mean teredoes in the pilings of their rail road trestles that crossed the areas fresh water rivers. At any rate, it wasn't but {{a couple of days after}} the Sebastian Inlet was opened that someone organized several boatloads of men from the Narrows to Ft. Pierce into an Inlet destruction crew. One evening they loaded lanterns, shovels, saws, pick-axes, dynamite and chains, maybe even a mule or two, into boats and headed to the newly opened Sebastian Inlet. There they cut cabbage palms and any other tree they could find, dragged them into the cut and placed a lot of dynamite along the banks. Once the dynamite was set off it blew sand into the <b>inlet</b> sufficiently to <b>plug</b> it up.|$|R
40|$|Background: Aortic coarctation (CoA) {{accounts}} for approximately 10 % of congenital heart diseases. CoA causing high pressure gradient can be successfully treated. Long-term results, however, revealed decreased life expectancy associated with abnormal hemodynamics. To understand better CoA treatment, patient-specific {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) models were created to simulate pre- and post-treatment hemodynamics {{with a focus on}} pressure gradient. Methods: Flow simulations using CFD program FLUENT using non-newtonian blood model and k-w turbulence model were performed in three CoA cases (case 1 : 40 years old (yo), female, 88 % stenosis; case 2 : 23 yo, female, 47 % stenosis; case 3 : 29 yo, female, 62 % stenosis) that were reconstructed from MRI data using software ZIB-Amira. 4 D MRI flow data were used to simulate peak systole flow (case 1 : 260 ml/s, Re= 1580; case 2 : 350 ml/s, Re= 3800; case 3 : 350 ml/s, Re= 6700). The peak systole pressure drop is the major parameter used in the clinical practice for the treatment decision. All three cases were treated by stents. Angiography data were used to reconstruct post-treatment geometries. Two inlet flow conditions were investigated: <b>plug</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity profile and in vivo velocity profile obtained by MRI. 4 D MRI flow data were analyzed using software MEVISFlow. Results: The swirl flow generated by left ventricle and the aortic valve reduces recirculation zone behind the stenosis and shift the flow towards the inner wall of the aortic arch thus reducing the pressure drop. All three cases revealed lower pressure drop with the MRI based inlet flow profiles (Pre-treatment: plug profile - dPcase 1 = 49. 2 mmHg, dPcase 2 = 17. 4 mmHg, dPcase 3 = 14. 8 mmHg vs. MRI based profile - dPcase 1 = 45. 3 mmHg, dPcase 2 = 13. 2 mmHg, dPcase 3 = 13. 0 mmHg). Stent treatment of CoA reduced pressure drop in all three cases. The pressure drop reduction due to treatment was also better with the MRI based inlet flow profile (Post-treatment: plug profile - dPcase 1 = 9. 0 mmHg, dPcase 2 = 10. 1 mmHg, dPcase 3 = 5. 9 mmHg vs. MRI based profile - dPcase 1 = 3. 3 mmHg, dPcase 2 = 6. 1 mmHg, dPcase 3 = 3. 1 mmHg). Conclusion: In vivo velocity profile at the inlet of the aorta including secondary flow features (swirl) generated by the left ventricle and the aortic valve affects both: the estimation of the pressure drop caused by the aortic coarctation and the effect of the treatment. We conclude that the use of the in vivo velocity profile as can be assessed by a 4 D MRI flow data is important for both: the correct in silico estimation of the pressure drop due to the aortic coarctation that is important for the treatment decision and for the estimation of the hemodynamic impact of a treatment...|$|R
