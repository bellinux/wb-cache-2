500|$|Imperial Bedrooms {{opens with}} an {{acknowledgement}} from Clay, the main character, {{that both the}} Less Than Zero novel and its film adaption are actual representational works within the narrative of his life: [...] "The movie {{was based on a}} book by someone we knew... It was labeled fiction but only a few details had been altered and our names weren't changed and there was nothing in it that hadn't happened." [...] The Los Angeles Times described this as a [...] "nifty little trick", as it allows Ellis to establish the newer book [...] "as the primary narrative, one that trumps Ellis as author and the real world." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle calls it a [...] "neat trick of authorial self-abnegation". Another reviewer describes it as Ellis at [...] "his most ambitious", a [...] "Philip Rothian, doppelgänger gambit", making his new narrator [...] "the real Clay" [...] and the other an imposter. This allows Ellis to skilfully, [...] "with writerly jujitsu", acknowledge Robert Downey Jr.'s popular performance as Julian in the moralistic 1987 film, in which he died; Ellis appreciates the adaptation as a [...] "milestone in a lot of ways". The device also allows the novelist to insert self-critique; The Sunday Times reviewer notes that Imperial Bedrooms finds its characters [...] "still a little sore at their depiction as inarticulate zombies". John Crace, in his [...] "digested read" [...] of Imperial Bedrooms, insinuates through parody that [...] "the author" [...] of the metafictional Less Than Zero is also meant to be Ellis, describing him in Clay's voice as [...] "too immersed in the passivity of writing and too pleased with his own style to bother with many commas to admit it so he wrote me into the story as the man who was too frightened to love." [...] With regard to the opening narrative conceit, Ellis queries [...] "Is it complication ... or is it clarification?", opining that it certainly is the latter for Clay. Even though Ellis never names himself explicitly in the book, he conceded to Lawson that one can [...] "guess [...] is who the Clay of Imperial Bedrooms is referring to." [...] Ellis did, however, reveal that he had not decided when writing the novel whether Clay was referring to him or not. Eileen Battersby likened Bedrooms to Lunar Park (2005), cited his use of [...] "self-consciousness as a device." [...] This device was picked up on by several other critics—in particular, Vice noted that [...] "the scatological violence of American Psycho" [...] and [...] "the otherworldly terror of Lunar Park" [...] had here been combined. Ellis himself raised the [...] "sequel" [...] question, commenting [...] "...I don't think it is [...] Well, I mean, it is and it isn't. It's narrated by him, sure. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> maybe have switched the names around and it could stand alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, 2009, Charles Pratt, Jr., head {{writer of}} the series, was interviewed by TV Guide about the Reese and Bianca relationship. After saying {{he felt he had}} longer to tell the love story and {{that it could have been}} better told if not for Riegel {{temporarily}} departing as Bianca, Pratt was viewed by fans and critics as blaming Riegel for the failure of the storyline. [...] "I was led to believe we had her for longer than we really did — suddenly I got word that Eden is leaving now," [...] stated Pratt. [...] "We got to play everything we wanted to with Bianca and Reese but not in the time we’d hoped for — in my mind, it was a two-year story. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have rushed to the wedding earlier so that they’d have had more time together as a married couple and then had them break up, but I think the fans would have been even more unsatisfied with that." ...|$|E

60|$|You see, {{it was an}} {{endurance}} test, and no man {{likes to}} give another best. Faugh! it was steam beer. I had learned more expensive brews. Not for years had I drunk steam beer; but when I had, I had drunk with men, and <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> show these youngsters some ability in beer-guzzling. And the drinking began, and I had to drink {{with the best of}} them. Some of them might lag, but the guest of honour was not permitted to lag.|$|R

I said it would kill Blakey if he saw it; and she said: No matter, let it kill him; it would show him that we valued his gift, and were moving heaven and earth to find it; and, at any rate, it would kill me if I kept myself in suspense. I said I should not care for that; but with her sympathy <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> live through the night, and I was sure I should find the thing at the Milk Street office in the morning.|$|R
2500|$|After comedian {{and actress}} Ellen DeGeneres {{came out as}} a lesbian, Falwell {{referred}} {{to her in a}} sermon as [...] "Ellen DeGenerate". DeGeneres mocked him, saying, [...] "Really, he called me that? Ellen DeGenerate? I've been getting that since the fourth grade. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I'm happy <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give him work." ...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the third}} show I {{was given the}} sign, {{which of course is}} the fingers across the throat, which in show {{business}} means you better finish. We were very swiftly evacuated by Iroquois helicopters. We could see the jungle where the battle was well and truly taking place and I remember that instinctive... that feeling of - this is very bad; this is dangerous. This {{is going to be a}} sad night, and indeed it was. You know, 17-year-old thoughts and through 17-year-old eyes, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see thousands and thousands of orange lights, which of course was the gunfire, and I'll never forget it. Never. Patricia Amphlett, 17 August 2009, Radio Australia Today ...|$|R
60|$|Happy {{for all her}} {{maternal}} feelings was the day {{on which}} Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be <b>guessed.</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say, {{for the sake of}} her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman {{for the rest of her}} life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the podium}} ceremony, {{in which two}} Brazilian drivers participated {{for the first time}} since the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, the top three {{finishers}} appeared in the obligatory press conference. Hamilton said that the decision to not make a pit stop during the safety car period was the team's decision: [...] "We had two very comfortable, two very decent stints and the team opted for me to stay out. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> they thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pull out a gap but it was a 23 second gap I needed and I only had seven laps or something, so I don't know how that worked out." [...] Hamilton added that he felt that things looked good for the rest of the season, stating that [...] "if we [...] can continue with this momentum we have got we are looking very good".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} shied rocks at them," [...] said Tommy, {{who had come}} down from the tree. [...] "They may be bigger than I am, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> outrun 'em," [...] and at this remark the others had to smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{brings me}} to something, Cynthia," [...] said Jeff, [...] "and I don't want you to say {{anything}} till I've got through. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help mother run the place as well as Jackson, and I could stay here next winter." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Puppy Episode" [...] and DeGeneres's {{attendant}} {{coming out}} generated enormous publicity {{before the show}} aired. Right-wing groups like the American Family Association pressured ABC to drop the storyline and Ellen sponsors not to advertise; two occasional advertisers, J. C. Penney and Chrysler, decided not to buy time during the episode. Another sponsor, Wendy's, decided not to advertise on Ellen again at all. Despite these losses of potential advertisers, ABC turned away ads from two LGBT-oriented sponsors, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) and lesbian vacation company Olivia Cruises. Jerry Falwell called DeGeneres [...] "Ellen Degenerate", to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I've been getting that since the fourth grade. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I'm happy <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give him work." [...] GLAAD organized [...] "Come Out With Ellen" [...] house parties across the United States and HRC created [...] "Ellen Coming Out House Party" [...] kits that included invitations, posters and an Ellen trivia game. HRC had initially planned to send out about 300 kits. Deluged with requests, they ended up sending out about 3,000. ABC affiliate WBMA-LP in Birmingham, Alabama, citing [...] "family values", first sought ABC's permission to move the episode out of prime-time to a late-night slot. When ABC declined the request, the affiliate refused to air the episode at all. Local LGBT organization Pride Birmingham arranged for a satellite feed of the episode and rented a 5,000-seat theatre for a viewing party, with about 1,000 people attending. Local activists circulated a petition requesting that Abilene, Texas-area affiliate KTXS-TV not air the episode but were unsuccessful.|$|R
