40|$|Taking a {{partially}} penetrating vertical {{well as a}} uniform line sink in three-dimensional space, by developing necessary mathematical analysis, this paper presents unsteady-state pressure drop equations for an off-center partially penetrating vertical well in a circular cylinder drainage volume with constant pressure at outer boundary. First, the point sink solution to the diffusivity equation is derived, then using superposition principle, pressure drop equations for a uniform line sink model are obtained. This paper also gives an equation to calculate pseudoskin factor due to partial penetration. The proposed equations provide fast analytical tools to evaluate {{the performance of a}} vertical well which is located arbitrarily in a circular cylinder drainage volume. It is concluded that the well off-center distance has significant effect on well pressure drop behavior, but it does not have any effect on pseudoskin factor due to partial penetration. Because the outer boundary is at constant pressure, when producing time is sufficiently long, steady-state is definitely reached. When well producing length is equal to payzone thickness, the pressure drop equations for a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well</b> are obtained...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the validity of}} the perfect layering model in the definition of the well capture zone around pumping wells drilled in heterogeneous formations. The relevance of groundwater as source of water supply for both human consumption and agricultural use, makes necessary to set the limits of well head protection areas, whose definition cannot be done apart capture zone delineation. The schematization of the 3 -D structure of the spatially random hydraulic conductivity in a simple set of layers each of them of constant properties simplifies noteworthy the computations, but its validity range has to be demonstrated. To reach this goal the travel time statistics in a 3 -D heterogeneous domain are numerically achieved by considering different anisotropy conditions of the media. The comparison is posed {{in the case of a}} <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well</b> pumping from an artesian aquifer characterized by a constant piezometric gradient. The results quantify the applicability of the perfect layering model by definition of the mean travel time upper limit for which the differences in the capture zone are negligible among formations with different anisotropy ratios...|$|E
40|$|Two new {{integral}} transforms, {{ideally suited}} for solving boundary value problems in well hydraulics, {{are derived from}} one of the Goldstein identities which generalizes a corresponding Weber identity. The two transforms are, therefore, named the Weber-Goldstein transforms. Their properties are presented. For the first, second, and third type boundary conditions, the new transforms remove the radial portion of a Laplacian in the cylindrical coordinates. They are used to straightforwardly rederive known solutions to the problems of a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> flowing <b>well</b> and a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> pumped <b>well.</b> A novel solution for a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> flowing <b>well</b> with infinitesimal skin situated in a leaky aquifer is also found by means of one of the new transforms.

Based on the new solution, a flowing well test is proposed for estimating the hydraulic conductivity and specific storativity of the aquifer and the skin factor of the well. The test can also be used in a constant-head injection mode. A type-curve estimation procedure is developed and illustrated with an example. The effectiveness of the test in estimating the well skin factor and aquifer parameters depends on the availability of data on the sufficiently early well response...|$|R

40|$|Riparian {{zones in}} {{semiarid}} regions often exhibit {{high rates of}} evapotranspiration (ET) in spite of low-soil moisture content due {{to the presence of}} phreatophytic vegetation that is able to withdraw water from shallow aquifers. This work seeks to better define the relationship between ET, the saturated zone and the river boundary by comparing observed water table drawdown records to analytically modeled drawdown in <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>wells</b> of an unconfined aquifer in response to daily ET flux. ET at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS), a riparian zone in a temperate, semiarid environment, is calculated using a radiation-based method to provide ET values at four different wells with different vegetation densities. Analytically modeled drawdown response to ET forcing shows that drawdown magnitude increases with increasing distance from the river edge even as the surficial ET forcing remains constant. This behavior is also observed in well hydrographs and shows the buffering effect that flow from the river has on drawdown in <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> riparian <b>wells</b> in highly permeable, unconfined aquifers. Relative contributions of river water to aquifer storage are calculated for ET-induced diurnal fluctuations of the water table at increasing distances from the river boundary. Failure to account for these spatial differences in drawdown related to the river source may explain some errors associated with estimating ET from well hydrographs alone...|$|R

An existing numerical finite element model has been used to perform the simulations. The results of the numerical model are compared to those from analytical Jacob and Lohman solution for estimating hydraulic heads and drawdown curves.

40|$|Designing an {{appropriate}} dewatering {{system at the}} early stages of mine planning is important in managing and controlling groundwater inflow into big open pit mines. To better design a dewatering system, it is necessary to investigate the hydrodynamic parameters of the aquifer involved with the mining operation. Such investigations are also important for the prediction of post-mining pit lake formation and mine drainage quality control. A series of pumping tests was carried out at Sangan iron mine, Mashhad, Iran, {{in order to determine the}} transmissivity and storativity of the confined aquifer. The pumping data were first evaluated with analytical Theis and Cooper-Jacob equations. An axi-symmetric finite element software, SEEP/W, was used to simulate transient, radial flow to a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well</b> in the confined aquifer. The groundwater recovery pattern was also considered in the numerical model. Analytical solutions and field data were used for the evaluation of the numerical model predictions.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{of carbon dioxide}} injection, via a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well,</b> into a homogeneous confined saline aquifer were conducted using TOUGH 2 to study temporal variations in near-wellbore pressures. The effect of contrasts in fluid properties on near-wellbore pressure was studied by comparing the predicted pressure histories of carbon dioxide injection to that of water injection into a confined saline aquifer. Simulation results predict an initial jump followed by subsequent decline in near-wellbore pressure over time under isotropic and weakly anisotropic conditions due to phase separation between the less dense and highly compressible carbon dioxide-rich (gas) phase and weakly compressible brine. Conversely, near-wellbore pressure increased monotonically during water injection because {{the differences between the}} viscosities, densities, and compressibilities of resident brine and water are relatively small. Sensitivity studies on the effects of the compressibility and viscosity of carbon dioxide and permeability anisotropy suggest that temporal variations in near-wellbore pressures depend strongly on the contrast in density between carbon dioxide and brine, and on the ratio between vertical and horizontal permeabilities of the aquifer (permeability anisotropy). These results suggest that the monitoring near-wellbore pressures during carbon dioxide injection is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the caprock and thereby warrants geomechanical studies...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a numerical study {{to investigate the}} combined role of partial well penetration (PWP) and non-Darcy effects concerning the performance of groundwater production wells. A finite difference model is developed in MATLAB to solve the two-dimensional mixed-type boundary value problem associated with flow to a partially <b>penetrating</b> <b>well</b> within a cylindrical confined aquifer. Non-Darcy effects are incorporated using the Forchheimer equation. The model is verified by comparison to results from existing semi-analytical solutions concerning the same problem but assuming Darcy’s law. A sensitivity analysis is presented to explore the problem of concern. For constant pressure production, Non-Darcy effects lead {{to a reduction in}} production rate, as compared to an equivalent problem solved using Darcy’s law. For <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>wells,</b> this reduction in production rate becomes less significant with time. However, for partially <b>penetrating</b> <b>wells,</b> the reduction in production rate persists for much larger times.

40|$|We {{consider}} two-dimensional {{steady state}} flow toward a <b>well</b> that <b>fully</b> <b>penetrates</b> a randomly heterogeneous aquifer. A constant pumping rate is prescribed deterministically at the well while a constant head is maintained at a circular outer boundary of radius L. Flow occurs over an infinite hierarchy of mutually uncorrelated, statistically homogeneous, and isotropic random fields (modes) of natural log transmissivity, Y(r), {{each of which}} is associated with a Gaussian variogram. Here we consider only a lower cut-off of the hierarchy. We develop an analytical solution for the mean and variance of hydraulic head based on the nonlocal theory first proposed for steady state flows in bounded, randomly heterogeneous media by Neuman and Orr [1993] and Guadagnini and Neuman [1999 a]. In particular, we develop and solve analytically recursive closure approximations of the governing nonlocal moment equations to second order in Y. Analytical solutions are evaluated by Gaussian quadratures. The two-dimensional nature of our solution renders it useful for relatively thin aquifers in which vertical heterogeneity tends to be of minor concern relative to that in the horizontal plane. Potential uses include the analysis of pumping tests and tracer test, the statistical delineation of their respective capture zones, and the analysis of contaminant transport toward <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>wells...</b>|$|R

40|$|We study {{three-dimensional}} {{steady state}} flow field {{generated by a}} <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well</b> extracting a constant water discharge from a confined aquifer of constant thickness. The hydraulic conductivity K is modeled as an axisymmetric, stationary random space function, and the flow equation is solved by using the seven-node finite volume numerical scheme. In view of application in aquifer characterization we analyze how the equivalent conductivity K-eq varies {{as a function of}} the distance from the extraction well. The numerical simulations showed that the boundary condition at the well exerts a large impact on K-eq and that the first-order solution in sigma(Y) 2 obtained by Indelman et al. (1996) is valid up to sigma(2) (Y) = 0. 5. For higher values of sigma(2) (Y) the first-order solution overestimates K-eq with differences that for a given sigma(2) (Y), reduce progressively as the formation becomes more anisotropic. A simple inverse procedure based on K-eq, obtained through cross-well interference, is finally proposed and tested with the objective of estimating the parameters of the geostatistical model of variability of the hydraulic conductivity. A few parametric examples showed that a suitable interpretation of pumping tests can be used to safely estimate parameters such as the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity, its variance, and, although with larger uncertainty, the horizontal integral scale, while the inference of the anisotropy ratio is highly uncertain and error prone...|$|E
40|$|Slug {{tests have}} been used for over 30 years as a means of {{evaluating}} hydraulic parameters of aquifers. The interpretation of transient water level data from these tests has almost exclusively been based on fitting the data to analytical solutions or on using semi-analytical methods. Because these methods are constrained by simplifying assumptions, it is useful to investigate the conditions under which these assumptions are reasonable so that the interpretation of field data can be carried out with increased confidence. To this end, the authors investigate the transient flow of water in an unconfined aquifer during a slug test, using a numerical model that solves the generalized Richards` equation. The model accounts for saturated-unsaturated flow, time-dependent seepage face in the well, various combinations of blank casings and well screens, and injection or withdrawal tests. Parametric studies were conducted using a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well</b> in a 10 meter thick, homogeneous, isotropic aquifer with an initial hydrostatic condition in order to provide insights into such issues as (1) the difference in response between injection and bail-out tests, (2) the significance of flow through the transient seepage face, and (3) the role of the unsaturated zone. An examination of the flow anatomy suggests that flow in the unsaturated zone is significant and important, although the response of the water level in the well may not be very sensitive to the unsaturated zone processes.

40|$|Previously {{a hybrid}} analytical-numerical {{solution}} for the general problem of computing transient well flow in vertically heterogeneous aquifers was proposed by the author. The radial component of flow was treated analytically, while the finite-difference technique {{was used for the}} vertical flow component only. In the present work the hybrid solution has been modified by replacing the previously assumed uniform well-face gradient (UWG) boundary condition {{in such a way that}} the drawdown remains uniform along the well screen. The resulting uniform well-face drawdown (UWD) solution also includes the effects of a finite diameter well, wellbore storage and a thin skin, while partial penetration and vertical heterogeneity are accommodated by the one-dimensional discretization. Solutions are proposed for well flow caused by constant, variable and slug discharges. The model was verified by comparing wellbore drawdowns and well-face flux distributions with published numerical solutions. Differences between UWG and UWD well flow will occur in all situations with vertical flow components near the well, which is demonstrated by considering: (1) partially <b>penetrating</b> <b>wells</b> in confined aquifers, (2) <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>wells</b> in unconfined aquifers with delayed response and (3) layered aquifers and leaky multiaquifer systems.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} study keyed {{to the analysis}} of the impact on hydraulic head statistics of two selected methodologies for the stochastic simulation of hydro-facies spatial arrangement. We analyze the distribution of hydraulic heads in a confined aquifer under steady-state convergent three-dimensional flow to a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well,</b> superimposed to a mean uniform regional gradient. The heterogeneous structure of the system is modeled on the basis of available field information comprising detailed lithological data collected within an aquifer system located in northern Italy. These data are grouped into five litho-type categories and the aquifer system is modeled as a random composite medium. Monte Carlo realizations of the three-dimensional geo-material distributions are generated through the Sequential Indicator and the Truncated Plurigaussian Simulation methods. The latter enables one to integrate geological conceptual information in the simulation procedure, while the former relies mainly on a variogram-based analysis. Point and vertically averaged hydraulic heads, corresponding to typical observations collected within screened boreholes, are analyzed by evaluating the dependence of their sample probability distributions on (i) the hydro-facies generation scheme (ii) the extent of the vertical averaging interval and (iii) the relative distance between the location of observation boreholes, hydrological boundaries and the source term. Theoretical probability density function models are fitted against numerically simulated distributions within a Maximum Likelihood context. Our results indicate that hydraulic heads associated with the Truncated Plurigaussian Simulation method exhibit increased variability when compared to their counterparts evaluated upon relying on a Sequential Indicator based modeling strategy of the system heterogeneity. Covariance matrices and probability distributions of point and vertically averaged hydraulic heads display similar key representative features and patterns. This suggests that typical measurements collected in screened boreholes can be used to infer qualitative information about the correlation structure and the statistical properties of heads...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of heterogeneous media vary spatially {{in a manner}} that can seldom be described with certainty. It may, however, be possible to describe the spatial variability of these properties in terms of geostatistical parameters such as mean, integral (spatial correlation) scale, and variance. Neuman et al. (2004) proposed a graphical method to estimate the geostatistical parameters of (natural) log transmissivity on the basis of quasi–steady state head data when a randomly heterogeneous confined aquifer is pumped at a constant rate from a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well.</b> They conjectured that a quasi–steady state, during which heads vary in space-time while gradients vary only in space, develops in a statistically homogeneous and horizontally isotropic aquifer as it does in a uniform aquifer. We confirm their conjecture numerically for Gaussian log transmissivities, show that time-drawdown data from randomly heterogeneous aquifers are difficult to interpret graphically, and demonstrate that quasi–steady state distance-drawdown data are amenable to such interpretation by the type curve method of Neuman et al. The method yields acceptable estimates of statistical log transmissivity parameters for fields having either an exponential or a Gaussian spatial correlation function. These estimates are more robust than those obtained using the graphical time-drawdown method of Copty and Findikakis (2003, 2004 a). We apply the method of Neuman et al. (2004) simultaneously to data from a sequence of pumping tests conducted in four wells in an aquifer near Tuebingen, Germany, and compare our transmissivity estimate with estimates obtained from 312 flowmeter measurements of hydraulic conductivity in these and eight additional wells at the site. We find that (1) four wells are enough to provide reasonable estimates of lead log transmissivity statistics for the Tu¨bingen site using this method, and (2) the time-drawdown method of Cooper and Jacob (1946) underestimates the geometric mean transmissivity at the site by 30 – 40 %...|$|E
40|$|The study, a {{continuation}} of that of Indelman et at. [1996], aims at deriving the second-order moments of flow variables such as hydraulic head, its gradient,and the specific discharge for steady flow toward a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well</b> in a confined heterogeneous aquifer. The lag conductivity Y = In K is modeled as a three-dimensional stationary function of Gaussian correlation of anisotropy ratio e. By using first-order approximations in sigma(Y) (2) and e, we derive the variance and the vertical integral scale of the piezometric head H, of its radial gradient E-r and of the radial component of the specific discharge q(r). Owing to the nonuniformity of the average flow, these quantities are functions of {{the distance from the}} well. It is shown that the variances of the head sigma(H) (2), and of its gradient sigma(E) (2), as well as the crossvariance sigma(E),(Y) between E-r and Y, vanish at the well, whereas the discharge variance sigma(qr) (2) tends to the product between the log conductivity variance sigma(Y) (2) and the squared mean discharge (2). This behavior pertains to a stratified formation surrounding the well. Far from the well (approximate to 75 horizontal Y integral scales I) the head variance approaches a constant value. For r {{greater than or equal to}} 10 I the moments sigma(E) (2), sigma(qr) (2) and sigma(E,Y) tend to the corresponding values for uniform flow but with the local mean head gradient replacing the constant one. The head vertical integral scale grows indefinitely with r, whereas the vertical integral scale of the flux is larger by one log conductivity vertical scale than the one prevailing in uniform flow. This latter property is explained by the presence of the source line, which increases the correlations in the vertical direction. The present results may be used in identifying the log conductivity statistical parameters from flowmeter velocity measurements in piezometers surrounding pumping or injecting wells...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three parts of contributions. Systems of a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> pumping <b>well</b> in a confined aquifer near a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> stream with and without streambeds are discussed in Chapter II. In Chapter III, stream-aquifer systems with a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> pumping <b>well</b> in a confined aquifer between two parallel <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> streams with and without streambeds are discussed. Stream depletion rates in Chapter II are solved using Laplace and Fourier transform methods, and stream depletion rates in Chapter III are solved using the potential method. Chapter II presents analytical solutions in the Laplace domain for general stream depletion rates caused by a pumping well and caused by stream stage fluctuations. For seasonal case, the stream stage {{is a function of}} time. For an individual flood wave, the stream stage is a function of time and distance along the stream. Semi-analytical solutions of seasonal stream depletion rates in time domain, using a cosine function to simulate stream stage fluctuations, are presented. The stream depletion rate caused by pumping is solved analytically, while the stream depletion rate caused by stream stage fluctuations is solved numerically. Various parameters affecting stream depletion rates, such as flood period and streambed, are analyzed. For a short-term case, the pumping rate is assumed to be constant, and a Gaussian function is used as an example of floodwaves. This part is solved using the same method as used in the seasonal case. Early time and late time approximations of the stream depletion rates are also presented. This approximation leads to an interesting finding that the stream depletion rate caused by seasonal stream stage fluctuations can be neglected if the stream aquifer system has a long time to equilibrate. In Chapter III, analytical stream depletion rates caused by a pumping well between two parallel streams with and without streambeds are presented. In this chapter, stream stage is assumed to be constant. Capture zone delineations were analyzed in the case without streambed. For the case with streambed, streambed conductance, which is an important factor controlling stream depletion, is analyzed. All solutions discussed in this dissertation can be used to predict stream depletion rates and to estimate parameters controlling stream depletion rates, which is crucial for water management. In addition to the stream depletion, the derived semi-analytical solutions in the Laplace-Fourier domain {{can also be used to}} predict drawdown in the aquifer near the stream. The derived solutions may also be used inversely to find the streambed and aquifer parameters if the stream stage fluctuation can be well described...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{steady flow}} of water in a confined aquifer toward a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well</b> of radius r(w) (Figure 1). The hydraulic conductivity K is modeled as a three-dimensional stationary random space function. The two-point covariance of Y = In (K/K-G) is of axisymmetric anisotropy, with I and I-v, the horizontal and vertical integral scales, respectively, and K-G, the geometric mean of K. Unlike previous studies which assumed constant flux, the well boundary condition is of given constant head (Figure 1). The aim {{of the study is}} to derive the mean head [H] and the mean specific discharge [q] as functions of the radial coordinate v and of the parameters sigma(Y) (2), e = I-v/I and r(w) /l. An approximate solution is obtained at first-order in sigma(Y) (2), by replacing the well by a line source of strength proportional to K and by assuming ergodicity, i. e., equivalence between (H) over bar, (q) over bar, space averages over the vertical, and [H], [q], ensemble means. An equivalent conductivity K-eq is defined as the fictitious one of a homogeneous aquifer which conveys the same discharge Q as the actual one, for the given head H-w in the well and a given head H in a piezometer at distance r from the well. This definition corresponds to the transmissivity determined in a pumping test by an observer that measures H-w, (H) over bar, and Q. The main result of the study is the relationship (19) K-eq = K-A(1 - lambda) + K(efu) lambda, where K-A is the conductivity arithmetic mean and K-efu is the effective conductivity for mean uniform flow in the horizontal direction in the same aquifer. The weight coefficient lambda 10, lambda has the simple approximate expression lambda* = in (r/I) ln (r/r(w)). Near the well, lambda congruent to 0 and K-eq congruent to K-A, which is easily understood, since for r(w) /I K-efu, our result indicates that the transmissivity is overestimated in a pumping test in a steady state and it decreases with the distance from the well. However, the difference between K-A and K-efu is small for highly anisotropic formations for which e << 1. A nonlocal effective conductivity, which depends only on the heterogeneous structure, is derived in Appendix A along the lines of Indelman and Abramovich [1994]...|$|E
40|$|In Ontario’s James Bay Lowland, sub-arctic bog and fen peatlands make up 90 % of the landscape. Increasing {{resource}} {{extraction operations}} {{in this area}} pose a risk of contaminant release into these systems, both intentional (i. e. high nitrogen/ sulphate/ phosphate wastewater outputs) and unintentional (i. e. crude oil pipeline leakages, fuel carrying train derailments, etc.). Once released, there is potential for solute migration and accumulation through both saturated and unsaturated transport processes. Further, capillary action {{has the potential to}} mobilize contaminants upwards towards the non- vascular mosses which dominate the surface. The limited existing field and laboratory studies have only provided preliminary information on fate and transport of dissolved solute, and no field studies have considered the potential accumulation of solute above the water table in a bog peatland. In the event of a release, a thorough understanding of solute fate and transport within the saturated and unsaturated (vadose) zones is necessary to predict the fate of the plume and the potential impacts on peatland ecosystems. To better understand contaminant transport in these systems, approximately 14 000 L/day of sodium chloride (300 mg/L) was released into a bog in the James Bay Lowland. The tracer was pumped into a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well</b> (1. 5 m below ground surface (bgs)) over a 45 day period in 2015 between July 5 and August 18. Plume development was measured in the saturated zone via in situ specific conductance (SC), temperature, and water table depth from a well and piezometer monitoring network. Specific conductance measurements were collected in the unsaturated zone using Time Domain Reflectrometry (TDR) sensors installed at 5, 10, and 15 depths (cm bgs). Meteorological data were collected from nearby weather stations {{for the duration of the}} spill. Following the spill, four 30 cm long cores were extracted from the site. An unsaturated breakthrough experiment was conducted for 60 days in a laboratory setting using a 300 mg/L sodium chloride solution, to verify processes observed in the field. Depth dependent soil parameterization was completed on each core following this experiment to determine the influence of inter core heterogeneity on unsaturated solute distribution. In the saturated zone, over the spill period the bulk of the plume travelled a lateral distance of 100 m in the direction of a slight water table gradient (0. 004 m/m). The plume shape was irregular and indicative of preferential flow paths formed by interconnected hollows in the landscape. Saturated transport of the tracer occurred primarily within the 25 cm piezometers (corresponding to the acrotelm). A discontinuous second high hydraulic conductivity layer at ~ 125 cm bgs also experienced rapid solute advection. Transport was confounded by a large amount of precipitation (233 mm total over the study period), which enhanced lateral dispersion, and diluted the tracer in the highly conductive upper peat layer. Solute also showed the potential to accumulate and remain in lower hydraulic conductivity hummocks adjacent to flow paths, and potentially within closed pores in the peat matrix. These results highlight the complexity of fate and transport in bog peatlands, and the susceptibility of the systems in a real-world spill scenario as detailed knowledge about depositional environment, meteorological conditions, topography, water table gradient and contaminant specific behaviour are required for accurate plume assessment. Field scale characterization of the vadose zone showed a strong dependence of unsaturated solute accumulation on hydrological conditions. In particular, elevated water table conditions increased connectivity between unsaturated hummocks and the saturated zone, greatly accelerating the rate of solute accumulation. Heterogeneity in soil structure increased the complexity of this relation, as less dense soil transmitted solute well under high water contents but did not retain the solute in low water content conditions. Denser soil experienced solute accumulation at a slower place but had a greater water and solute retention capacity, better facilitating capillary rise and long term accumulation. In laboratory conditions inter core heterogeneity played a great role in solute accumulation. Rates of evaporation differed between cores; highest evaporative rates and upward solute mobility were noted in a core with a highly porous upper 5 cm underlain by dense peat, which supplied solute and retained water well above the water table. The results of this study highlight the importance of extracting samples representative of site conditions due to a large amount of inter-core heterogeneity. Further development of these concepts is recommended through the use of 2 D unsaturated zone modelling...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThis thesis {{deals with}} some {{fundamental}} aspects of groundwater models. Deterministic mathematical models of groundwater are usually used to simulate flow and transport processes in aquifer systems {{by means of}} partial differential equations. Analytical solutions for the deterministic mathematical models of the Theis problem and the transient confined-unconfined flow in a confined aquifer are investigated in the thesis. The Theis equation is a most commonly applied solution for the deterministic mathematical model of the Theis problem. In the thesis, a most simplified similarity transformation method for derivation of the Theis equation is proposed by using the Boltzmann transform. To investigate the transient confined-unconfined flow towards a <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>well</b> in a confined aquifer, a new analytical solution for the deterministic mathematical models of interest is proposed in the thesis. The proposed analytical solution considers a change of hydraulic properties (transmissivity and storativity) during the confined-unconfined conversion. Based on the proposed analytical solution, a practical method to determine distance of the conversion interface from pumping well and diffusivity of the unconfined region is developed by using a constant rate test. Applicability of the proposed analytical solution is demonstrated by a comparison with previous solutions, namely the MP and the Chen models. The {{results show that the}} proposed analytical solution can be used to assess the effect of the change of diffusivity on the transient confined-unconfined flow. The MP model is only accepted if the transmissivity during the confined-unconfined conversion is constant. The Chen model, given as a special case of the proposed analytical solution, is limited to the analysis of the transient confined-unconfined flow with a fixed diffusivity. An important application of groundwater models is to estimate parameters, such as hydraulic properties and flow dynamics, of groundwater systems by assessing and analysing field data. For instance, the pumping and the hydrochemistry and environmental tracer tests are two effective ways to obtain such data. To evaluate hydraulic properties of aquifer systems by derivative interpretation of drawdown data from pumping tests, a new diagnostic analysis method is proposed based on a lg-lg drawdown derivative, dlgs/dlgt, and the differentiation algorithm namely Lagrange Interpolation Regression (LIR) in the thesis. Use of a combined plot of dlgs/dlgt and a semi-lg drawdown derivative (ds/dlgt) is made to identify various flow segments during variable discharge tests with infinite conditions, constant rate tests in bounded aquifers and tests involving double-porosity behaviours. These can be applied to further characterize pumped aquifers. Compared to traditional diagnostic analysis method using plot of ds/dlgt alone, the combined drawdown derivative plot possesses certain advantages identified as: (1) the plot of dlgs/dlgt is strikingly sensitive for use in unveiling differences between pumping and its following recovery periods in intermittent variable discharge tests; (2) storativity (S) of pumped aquifers can be evaluated by using the combined plot; and (3) quantitative assessments of double-porosity behaviours can also be achieved. Based on two case studies, advantages and disadvantages of uses of the LIR and other existing differentiation methods in calculations of numerical drawdown derivative are demonstrated in practice. The results suggest that the LIR is a preferred method for numerical differentiation of drawdown data as {{it can be used to}} effectively minimise noisy effects. The proposed derivative approach provides hydrologists with an additional tool for characterizing pumped aquifers. Use of hydrochemistry and environmental tracer tests to assess flow dynamics of groundwater systems is demonstrated via a case study in the dolomite aquifer of South Africa. An emphasis is on determining mean residence times (MRTs) of the dolomite aquifer by means of an appropriate box model with time series of 14 C values of dissolved inorganic carbon (14 C-DIC) and initial 14 C activities of spring samples during 1970 s and 2010 s. To obtain the calibrated 14 C MRTs, 13 C values of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ 13 C-DIC) of the spring samples are applied to estimate mineral dissolution in the dolomite aquifer and calculate the initial 14 C activities. The results indicate that the spring samples have about 50 %- 80 % initial 14 C activities. By using the appropriate box model, the calibrated 14 C MRTs of the spring system are given within a range from ≤ 10 to 50 years. Additionally, the flow dynamics, including the recharge source and area, the effect of climate change on the temporal trend of the groundwater MRTs and the groundwater flow circulation, of the dolomitic spring system are also discussed for further possible management interventions in the dolomite aquifer...|$|E

40|$|Riparian {{zones in}} {{semi-arid}} regions often exhibit {{high rates of}} evapotranspiration (ET) in spite of low soil moisture content due to vegetation that is able to withdraw water from shallow aquifers. This work better defines the relationship between ET and the saturated zone by comparing the observed water table drawdown to analytically modeled drawdown in <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> <b>wells</b> of an unconfined aquifer in response to daily ET flux. ET at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site or BHRS (a riparian zone in a temperate, semi arid environment) is calculated following the approach of Batra et al. (2006) but uses site (or near site) measurements for air temperature and net radiation while relying on Landsat 5 data for quantification of vegetation. The resulting ET calculations represent a data set consisting of high resolution (30 m x 30 m) ET flux values obtained from minimal site measurements. Water table levels in the shallow, unconfined aquifer were monitored over {{the summer and fall}} of 2009 to record the timing and magnitude of daily fluctuations in four wells with different vegetation densities and distances from the nearby Boise River at the site. ET derived from the radiation-driven model of Batra et al. (2006) compares favorably with groundwater ET contribution rates calculated from well hydrographs (White, 1932), which further supports the finding of negligible water contribution coming from the unsaturated zone in shallow riparian aquifers in semi-arid regions (Shah et al., 2007). Using an analytical solution to ET induced drawdown (Malama 2 ̆ 6 Johnson, 2010) for a semi-infinite (or river bounded) domain, daily drawdown is modeled in response to daily ET flux applied at the water table. Close agreement between observed and modeled drawdown supports the idea that ET can be estimated from well hydrographs in a wellcharacterized aquifer and conversely, if ET behavior is characterized, aquifer parameters like hydraulic conductivity and specific storage can be estimated from well hydrographs...|$|R
40|$|Several oil {{reservoirs}} in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia {{are operating}} under active water drive maintaining their reservoir pressure {{close to its}} initial and above bubble-point pressure. For such reservoirs, productivity equations based on the steady-state condition are highly required. This work presents new analytical equations to obtain steady-state productivity for a multiple-wells system in homogeneous, anisotropic rectangular reservoirs with different lateral boundaries. Five cases of different lateral boundaries are defined and studied in this paper. The equations are derived by taking <b>fully</b> <b>penetrating</b> vertical <b>wells</b> as uniform line sinks, and solving a square matrix of dimension n, where n {{is the number of}} wells. The derived equations relate the production rate vector to the pressure drawdown vector. They provide fast analytical tools to evaluate the performance of multiple-wells system, which are located arbitrarily in an anisotropic rectangular reservoir. It is concluded that for a given multiple-wells system, as the number of constant pressure boundaries increases, the total productivity index increases. Also, in a given rectangular reservoir, if the wells are located symmetrically with respect to the same type of lateral boundary, then their productivity indices are equal...|$|R
