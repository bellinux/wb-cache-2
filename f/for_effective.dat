5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain that is responsible <b>for</b> <b>effective</b> tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so {{it is possible that}} it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} and treatment of childhood cancer results in significant disruptions, and distress {{is not limited to the}} ill child and the primary caregivers. Healthy siblings of pediatric cancer patients have been shown to experience significant levels of distress and difficulty with psychological adjustment. The purpose of this current paper aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions provided to healthy siblings of pediatric cancer patients in improving symptoms of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms, behavior, quality of life, and cancer-specific constructs from pre-intervention to post-intervention. This meta-analysis sought to assess published and unpublished studies to better identify the components of the interventions that were the most effective. A total of 15 studies were identified, resulting in 11 effect sizes for anxiety, 7 effect sizes for depression, 2 effect sizes for posttraumatic stress symptoms, 2 effect sizes for behavior, and 3 effect sizes for a cancer-specific construct. Preliminary analysis of these effect sizes indicated that interventions provided to siblings of pediatric cancer patients were mildly <b>effective</b> <b>for</b> anxiety, mildly <b>effective</b> <b>for</b> depression, moderately <b>effective</b> <b>for</b> posttraumatic stress symptoms, mildly <b>effective</b> <b>for</b> quality of life, not significantly <b>effective</b> <b>for</b> behavior, mildly <b>effective</b> <b>for</b> cancer-specific fear, not significantly <b>effective</b> <b>for</b> cancer-specific communication, mildly <b>effective</b> <b>for</b> cancer-specific interpersonal difficulties, and largely <b>effective</b> <b>for</b> cancer-specific intrapersonal difficulties. Primary analysis of anxiety and depression indicated no significant moderators or intervention components that significantly impacted effectiveness. Future research should focus on utilizing control groups during intervention and detailing treatment components as well as sibling demographics, to allow for further analysis of the interventions’ effectiveness...|$|R
5|$|Marion Little {{examines}} theoretical frameworks {{related to}} NVC. The influential interest-based model for conflict resolution, negotiation, and mediation developed by Fisher, Ury, and Patton at the Harvard Negotiation Project in the 1980s {{appears to have}} some conceptual overlap with NVC, although neither model references the other. Little suggests The Gordon Model <b>for</b> <b>Effective</b> Relationships (1970) as a likely precursor to both NVC and interest-based negotiation, based on conceptual similarities, if not any direct evidence of a connection. Like Rosenberg, Gordon had worked with Carl Rogers, so the models' similarities may reflect common influences.|$|E

5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows <b>for</b> <b>effective</b> base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E

5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household.

Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback.

5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel {{capacity}} {{is more than}} double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can {{spend as much time}} as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity.

However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E

A fire in January 1951 damaged the ship severely, and she was sold for scrapping the following month.|$|E

5|$|The second {{element of}} the {{auxiliary}} forces was the Yeomanry, 38 regiments of volunteer cavalry which had historically {{been used as a}} form of internal security police, deployed to suppress local riots and provide a show of force to support the authorities. Recruits to the force were usually personally wealthy, providing their own horses and uniforms, and units were often heavily bankrolled by their senior officers. Training requirements were low, with an annual eight-day camp. The regiments were liable to be called out for defence against an invasion or an insurrection, and were not prepared <b>for</b> <b>effective</b> mobilisation; the units possessed no transport resources, or even a designated quartermaster.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites <b>for</b> <b>effective</b> management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E
