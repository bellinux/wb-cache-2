5|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} Lochner's paintings were well known and widely copied during his lifetime, and remained so until the 16th century. Early examples in ink after his Virgin in Adoration are in the British Museum and École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. The influence of Lochner's Last Judgement {{can be seen in}} Hans Memling's Gdansk altarpiece, where the gates of Heaven are similar, as is the rendering of the blessed. Albrecht Dürer knew of him before his stay in Cologne, and Van der Weyden saw his paintings during his travel to Italy. The latter's Altar of Saint John is similar to Lochner's <b>Flaying</b> of Bartholomew, especially in the executioner's pose, while his Saint Columba altarpiece includes two motifs from Lochner's Adoration of the Magi triptych; specifically, the king in the central panel {{with his back to the}} viewer, and the girl in the right hand wing holding a basket containing doves.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Flay</b> is an Iron Chef on {{the show}} Iron Chef America. In 2000, when the {{original}} Iron Chef show traveled to New York for a special battle, he challenged Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto to battle rock crab. After the hour battle ended, <b>Flay</b> stood {{on top of his}} cutting board and raised his arms in what one journalist wrote was [...] "in premature victory". As Morimoto felt that real chefs consider cutting boards and knives as sacred, and being offended by <b>Flay's</b> flamboyant gesture, he criticized his professionalism, saying that <b>Flay</b> was [...] "not a chef". <b>Flay</b> went on to lose the battle. <b>Flay</b> challenged Morimoto to a rematch in Morimoto's native Japan.

25|$|Immediately {{following}} Willow's {{reconciliation with}} Tara, Warren (Adam Busch), {{one of the}} Trio, shoots Buffy; a stray shot kills Tara {{right in front of}} Willow. In an explosion of rage and grief, Willow soaks up all the dark magic she can, which turns her hair and eyes black. In the final episodes of the season Willow becomes exceedingly strong, surviving unharmed when Warren hits her in the back with an axe. She hunts Warren, tortures him by slowly pushing a bullet into his body, then kills him by magically <b>flaying</b> him. Unsatisfied, she attempts to kill the other two members of the Trio but is unsuccessful due to her weakening power. She solves this problem by killing her 'dealer' from earlier in the season and draining him of his magic. When she is confronted by Buffy they begin to fight, only to be stopped by Giles who has borrowed magic from a coven of wiccans. Willow successfully drains him of this borrowed magic, fulfilling his plan and causing her to feel all the pain of everyone in the world. She tries to ease the pain by destroying the world, finally to be stopped by Xander.|$|E

500|$|Hazlitt appreciatively quotes long {{extracts}} {{from what he}} considered {{some of the best}} scenes, and remarks that, as sad as the concluding events are, [...] "The oppression of the feelings is relieved by the very interest we take in the misfortunes of others, and by the reflections to which they give birth." [...] This leads to his mentioning the then-current practice of substituting, on stage, a happy ending for Shakespeare's tragic one, which had been approved by no less an authority than Dr. Johnson. Arguing against this practice, Hazlitt brings in a lengthy quote from an article Lamb wrote for Leigh Hunt's Reflector, which concludes: [...] "A happy ending!—as if the living martyrdom that Lear had gone through,—the <b>flaying</b> of his feelings alive, did not make a fair dismissal from life the only decorous thing for him." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1677, a {{particularly}} brutal German General Kops leading {{the forces of}} Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I designed to keep Hungary dominated by the Germans, rather than to become dominated by the Turks, began impaling and quartering his Hungarian subjects/opponents. An opposing general for the Hungarians, , responded in kind, by <b>flaying</b> alive Imperial troops, and fixing sharp iron hooks in fortress walls, upon which he threw captured Germans to be impaled. Finally, Emperor Leopold I {{had had enough of}} the mutual bloodshed, and banished Kops in order to establish a needed cessation of hostilities. After the Treaty of The Hague (1720), Sicily fell under Habsburg rule, but the locals deeply resented the German overlords. One parish priest (who exhorted his parishioners to kill the Germans) is said to have broken into joy when a German soldier arrived at his village, exclaiming it was gone a whole eight days since last he killed a German, and shot the soldier off his horse. The priest was later impaled. [...] In the short-lived 1784 Horea Revolt against the Austrians and Hungarians, the rebels gained hold of two officers they promptly impaled. On their side, the imperial troops got hold of Horea's 13-year-old son, and impaled him. That seems to have merely inflamed the rebel leader's determination, although the revolt was quashed shortly afterwards.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his first}} battle with Bobby <b>Flay</b> in New York, battle rock crab, Morimoto famously {{declared}} that <b>Flay</b> was [...] "not a chef" [...] because <b>Flay</b> {{stood up on}} his chopping board after completing his dishes. Morimoto went on to defeat <b>Flay</b> in the New York Battle, the results of which <b>Flay</b> contested believing he was [...] "given inferior cooking space and equipment" [...] and because he had cut himself in addition to suffering several electric shocks during the battle. This led to the two chefs competing once again in Japan during the 21st Century Battles. Morimoto lost to <b>Flay</b> in the re-match with Japanese lobster as the theme ingredient. [...] Nevertheless, <b>Flay</b> would become an Iron Chef along with Morimoto in the American spin-off, Iron Chef America.

Four nights after Titus’ first birthday, <b>Flay</b> finds Swelter wandering the castle with a meat cleaver. Swelter does not know of <b>Flay’s</b> banishment, and expects him to be sleeping where he has always slept up until now. <b>Flay</b> follows him to just outside Sepulchrave’s door, where Swelter discovers that <b>Flay</b> is not there, and soon realizes that he has been followed. <b>Flay</b> lures Swelter to the Hall of Spiders (making use of the fact that Sepulchrave — who is by now quite insane — is sleepwalking), and there they fight a long duel. Eventually, <b>Flay</b> kills Swelter. Lord Sepulchrave arrives on the scene, and decides that Swelter’s body should be taken to the Tower of Flints. After helping Sepulchrave carry the body to the tower, <b>Flay</b> is ordered to stay where he is.

However, Jean-Paul Duminy played what is possibly his highest innings of his career, <b>flaying</b> the Pakistani bowlers for an incredible 265 not out - well supported by Ryan Canning, who notched up 112 runs before captain Francois du Plessis declared. With the total 470 for 5 - the partnership having added 349 runs together - South Africa managed to dig into the Pakistani batsmen at regular intervals on day three, and despite 85 from Shahid Yousuf they could only post 303. Ugasen Govender and Vernon Philander both got figures of three wickets for 43. In reply, South Africa made hay quickly, scoring 162 for 5 in 34 overs and giving themselves plenty of time to bowl Pakistan out - setting them what was thought to be a challenging target of 330. However, despite four wickets from Morné Morkel, Shahid Yousuf and Hasan Raza made centuries, and when the final over of the day was bowled, the hosts needed 13 runs to complete the whitewash and win the series 2-0. They could only make six - however, they still took the series, with 1-0 in two Tests.|$|E
