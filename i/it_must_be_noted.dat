5|$|As for tournaments {{where only}} one of the Big Four has competed, this is the only {{category}} where {{the rest of the field}} has a positive ratio, winning 186 of the 262 tournaments (71%) played overall. However, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits. Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008, the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments (52%) where just one of them has competed.|$|E
5|$|When Rocky was {{diagnosed}} with brain damage, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that many athletes have a form of brain damage including football players, soccer players, and other individuals in contact sports such as rugby, etc. Rocky never went for a second opinion and yielded to his wife's wishes to stop. So {{with the advent of}} new research techniques into brain damage, Rocky was found to be normal among fighters, and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion. By today's standards Rocky Balboa would be given {{a clean bill of health}} for fighters.|$|E
5|$|In December 1283 in Gniezno, {{at the age}} of 22 or 23 years, Ludgarda, wife of Przemysł II, died unexpectedly. Relations {{between the}} spouses for some time before her death weren't very good; perhaps there had even been a {{separation}} between them. The reason for this was the supposed infertility of Ludgarda, more apparent after ten years of marriage. The actual period of marital intercourse between the spouses given their age (both are quite young {{at the time of their}} wedding) could actually be shorter. Indeed, there is no direct proof about Ludgarda's barrenness beyond the lack of offspring; in those, the childlessness in marriage was usually considered to be the woman's fault, although in this case (due to the birth of a daughter from Przemysł II's second marriage), it seems more likely. It wasn't a surprise when accusations began to emerge against the Duke of Greater Poland of the suspected murder of his wife. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted,</b> however, that no contemporary source mentions this, a fact more surprising because Przemysł II had bitter enemies who certainly would use this crime against him. Also any reactions from church or public penance would noticed.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the}} {{narrative}} follows the epic format, with the clashing of antagonistic entities, conquests and retreats, {{a concern for}} genealogy, and the central moral question, often rough and binary but also thrilling, of good vs. evil.|$|R
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that good}} {{recovery}} is commonly feasible if the calibration point is set {{close to the}} amount to be measured. That said, the 0.8  mg/mL calibration point should not be fixed but adjusted on a case-by-case basis.|$|R
30|$|<b>It</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the}} results from {{trespasser}} counts, concerning e.g. the age and hour distribution, might be biased from the site selection criteria.

25|$|Sberbank is the {{successor}} of Soviet saving banks, whose assets {{belonged to the}} state. During Russia's transition {{to a market economy}} in the 1990s, in which these assets were sold, Sberbank provided no guarantee for citizens' deposits. This resulted in a landslide depreciation, which in turn led to severe discontent among the Russian population. Since 1996, partial compensation for investors' losses has been offered - however, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that this only applied to state-owned banks such as Sberbank until 2003, offering them an unfair advantage.|$|E
25|$|A future goal is {{to develop}} {{projectiles}} that are self-guided - a necessary requirement to hit distant targets or intercepting missiles. When the guided rounds are developed, the Navy is projecting each round to cost about $25,000, though <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that developing guided projectiles for guns {{has a history of}} doubling or tripling initial cost estimates. Some high velocity projectiles developed by the Navy have command guidance, but the accuracy of the command guidance is not known, nor even if it can survive a full power shot.|$|E

25|$|A VAT, {{like most}} taxes, distorts {{what would have}} {{happened}} without it. Because the price for someone rises, the quantity of goods traded decreases. Correspondingly, some people are worse off by more than the government is made better off by tax income. That is, more is lost due to supply and demand shifts than is gained in tax. This is known as a deadweight loss. If the income lost by the economy is greater than the government's income; the tax is inefficient. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that a VAT and a Non-VAT have the same implications on the microeconomic model.|$|E
25|$|Australian radio hams can {{be traced}} to the early 1900s. The 1905 Wireless Telegraphy Act while {{acknowledging}} the existence of wireless telegraphy, brought all broadcasting matters in Australia under the control of the Federal Government. In 1906, the first official Morse code transmission in Australia was conducted by the Marconi Company between Queenscliff, Victoria and Devonport, Tasmania. However, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that some sources claim that there were transmissions in Australia as early as 1897 – these were either conducted solely by Professor William Henry Bragg of Adelaide University or by Prof. Bragg in conjunction with G.W. Selby of Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Information can {{be drawn}} as to the tunnel's vertex which lies at 1154,5meters above sea level {{and the fact that}} the tunnel does not run in a {{straight}} line but rather in a slope down from either side of its vertex. The tunnel was designed in such a way that inflowing water would be able to drain. From the railway station of Göschenen to the tunnel's vertex the train lines ascend at an angle of 6‰ and descend at 2‰ from vertex to the village of Airolo. The tunnel's length is indicated to be 14'998meters, its vertex being at kilometre80. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that the old Gotthard railways' distances were measured from the town of Immensee, as clearly indicated on the graphic timetable.|$|E
50|$|Dialog in sitcoms on Quebec {{television}} often uses such idioms extensively, {{which can}} make certain dialogs rather incomprehensible to French speakers of Europe. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> also <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that most speakers will use various contractions, omitting certain articles or even changing the pronunciation of certain words, which can be daunting for inexperienced speakers.|$|R
50|$|A protein-lined pore {{perfectly}} meets all {{the observed}} {{requirements of the}} early fusion pore, and while some data does support this theory, sufficient data does not exist to pronounce it the primary method of fusion. <b>It</b> also <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that a protein-lined pore requires at least five copies of the SNARE complex while fusion has been observed with as few as two.|$|R

25|$|She {{reportedly}} {{became his}} mistress in Paris in 2005. However, <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that Raja Petra Kamaruddin, the Malaysia Today editor, {{was the one}} who connected Najib Abdul Razak with the Altantuya murders. Najib Abdul Razak denied all allegations as there were no concrete proof about him knowing Altantuya. Raja Petra retracted his allegation of the involvement of Najib Abdul Razak and Rosmah Mansor after the case were brought to court. Afraid of being prosecuted by the Malaysian courts for giving a false statement, Raja Petra fled to England, and left his wife and children behind. In addition, a former aide to Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, Muhamad Rahimi Osman, claims that Sirul's family was enticed to make a false statement that Najib was involved in Altantuya's murder.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{alimentary}} {{system of}} Bothriolepis –which includes the organs involved in ingestion, digestion and removal of waste– {{can be described}} as simple and straight, unlike that of humans. It begins at the anterior end of the organism with a small mouth cavity located over the posterior area of the upper jaw plates. Posteriorly from the mouth, the alimentary system extends into a wider and dorso-ventrally flattened region called the pharynx, from which both the gills and lungs arise. The esophagus, which is also characterized as a dorso-ventrally flattened tube, extends from the mouth into the stomach and leads to a flattened ellipsoidal structure. This structure may be homologous to the anterior end of the intestine found in other fish. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that the flatness of these structures may have been exaggerated when the fossil specimens experienced tectonic deformation through geologic time. The intestine begins narrowly on the anterior end, expands transversely and then again narrows posteriorly towards the cylindrical rectum, which terminates just within the posterior end of the trunk carapace. While the alimentary system is primitive in nature and lacks an expanded stomach region, it is specialized by an independently acquired complex spiral valve, comparable to that in elasmobranchs and many bony fish and similar to that found in some sharks. A single fold of tissue rolled upon its own axis forms this specialized spiral valve.|$|E
25|$|Like other settled, agrarian {{societies}} in history, {{those in the}} Indian subcontinent have been attacked by nomadic tribes throughout its long history. In evaluating the impact of Islam on the sub-continent, one must note that the northwestern subcontinent was a frequent target of tribes raiding from Central Asia. In that sense, the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions were not dissimilar {{to those of the}} earlier invasions during the 1st millennium. What does however, make the Muslim intrusions and later Muslim invasions different is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system, the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics, even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent, though the non-Muslim population was left to their own laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural codes that in some ways were very different from the existing cultural codes. This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature, though different from both the ancient Indian culture and later westernised modern Indian culture. At the same time <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that overwhelming majority of Muslims in India are Indian natives converted to Islam. This factor also {{played an important role in}} the synthesis of cultures.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>must</b> to <b>be</b> <b>noted</b> that Antonio Mairena {{tended to}} deprecate all non-Gypsy palos as {{inferior}} in quality.
