25|$|Theoretically, landless peasants {{were to be}} {{the biggest}} {{beneficiaries}} from collectivization, because it promised them an opportunity to take an equal share in labor and its rewards. In fact, however, rural areas did not have many landless peasants, given the wholesale redistribution of land following the Revolution. Alternatively, for those with property, collectivization meant forfeiting land up to the collective farms and selling most of the harvest to the state at minimal prices set by the state itself. This, in turn, engendered opposition to the idea. Furthermore, collectivization involved significant changes in the traditional village life of Russian peasants within a very short time frame, despite the long Russian rural tradition of collectivism in the village obshchina or mir. The changes were <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> in other places, such as in Ukraine, with its tradition of individual farming, in the Soviet republics of Central Asia, and in the trans-Volga steppes, where for a family to have a herd of livestock was not only a matter of sustenance, but of pride as well.|$|E

30|$|Hence, the German {{economic}} miracle can {{be described}} as one of a stable labor market in 2009 and beyond, where employment stayed high and unemployment moved up only marginally with lower working hours per person – in spite of a substantial output decline.

However, Japan and Germany are very similar in the fact that both are strongly export-oriented countries and hours worked per worker were reduced substantially in both countries.

A critic from Entertainment Weekly stated that although the storyline between Agents Kim and Kellerman was necessary, it was [...] "Boring? Beyond words." [...] A similar comment was made by a reviewer from TV Guide about C-Note's plot. The reviewer stated that she is [...] "just not that invested in his story" [...] because his character is completely {{cut off from the}} rest of the escapees and that he is less of a compelling character than T-Bag, who also has a separate plot. On the other aspects of the episode, the critic from the Arizona Daily Star commended the episode's pre-credits sequence, saying that [...] "'Prison Break' is now at the top of the list for sheer shock value and tight storytelling". The pre-credits sequence involved the first five minutes of the episode which was about Michael's past and Sara's escape from Kellerman. There were also comments about the main turning point of Michael and Lincoln's plot as they decide to stop running. The critic from IGN commented that this [...] "changes the direction of the show completely, and should provide fans with <b>even</b> <b>more</b> exciting <b>dramatic</b> possibilities in future episodes".

40|$|Agents, idols, and icons Since {{the early}} 1960 s, Artificial Intelligence has {{cherished}} the ambition to design an artificial cognitive machine able to reproduce intimate {{aspects of human}} behaviour.

But populations of cognitive agents aren’t the real thing, {{despite the efforts of}} their designers. Furthermore, one must cautiously examine the rationale behind these often incredibly complex arrangements of algorithms, in order to assess the usefulness of such exercises. As a matter of fact, Artificial Intelligence relies on a very positivist, and sometimes reductionist, view of human behaviour.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) by David Hestenes and colleagues in 1992 produced a remarkable impact within the community of physics teachers. An instrument to measure student comprehension of the Newtonian concept of force, the FCI demonstrates that active learning leads to far superior student conceptual learning than didactic lectures. Compared to a working knowledge of physics, biological literacy and illiteracy have an <b>even</b> <b>more</b> direct, <b>dramatic,</b> and personal impact. They shape public research and reproductive health policies, the acceptance or rejection of technological advances, such as vaccinations, genetically modified foods and gene therapies, and, on the personal front, the reasoned evaluation of product claims and lifestyle choices.

The BCI should serve as a lever for moving our current educational system in a direction that delivers a deeper conceptual understanding of the fundamental ideas upon which biology and biomedical sciences are based...|$|R
40|$|Ukraine is {{a country}} of the Mid-Latitude ecotone – a {{transition}} zone between forest zone and forestless dry lands. Availability of water defines distribution of the country’s forests and decreasing their productivity towards the south. Climate change generates a particular threat for Ukrainian forests and stability of agroforestry landscapes. The paper considers the impacts of expected climate change on vulnerability of Ukrainian forests using ensembles of global and regional climatic models (RCM) based on IPCC Scenarios B 1, A 2, A 1 B, and a “dry and warm” scenario A 1 B+T-P (increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation). The spatially explicit assessment was provided by RCM for the WMO standard period (1961 - 1990), “recent” (1991 - 2010) and three future periods – 2011 - 2030, 2031 - 2050 and 2081 - 2100. Forest-climate model by Vorobjov and model of amplitude of flora’s tolerance to climate change by Didukh, {{as well as a}} number of specialized climatic indicators, were used in the assessment. Different approaches leads to rather consistent conclusions. Water stress is the major limitation factor of distribution and resilience of flatland Ukrainian forests. Within Scenario A 1 B, the area with unsuitable growth conditions for major forest forming species will substantially increase by end of the century occupying major part of Ukraine. Scenario A 1 B+T-P projects <b>even</b> a <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> decline of the country’s forests. It is expected that the boundary of conditions that are favorable for forests will shift to north and north-west, and forests of the xeric belt will be the most vulnerable. Consistent policies of adaptation and mitigation might reduce climate-induced risks for Ukrainian forests...|$|R
2500|$|The {{political}} {{decision of the}} Texans was to restore control and order by any necessary means. As Governor Oscar Branch Colquitt instructed Ranger Captain John R. Hughes, [...] "...you and your men are to keep Mexican raiders off of Texas territory if possible, and if they invade the State let them understand they do so {{at the risk of}} their lives." [...] Hundreds of new special Rangers were appointed by order of the state, which neglected to carefully screen aspiring members. Rather than conduct themselves as law enforcement officers, many of these groups acted more like vigilante squads. Reports of Rangers abusing their authority and breaking the law themselves increased. The situation grew <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> when on March 9, 1916, Pancho Villa led 500 Mexican raiders in a cross-border attack against Columbus, New Mexico, increasing the high tension that had already existed between the communities. Villa and General Ramon Banda Quesada, in an attack against the town that was garrisoned by a detachment of the 13th Cavalry Regiment (United States), seized 100 horses and mules, burned the town, killed 14 soldiers and 10 residents, and took ammunition and weaponry before retreating back into Mexico. Quesada had five men captured and suffered the loss of 80 dead or mortally wounded, mostly from the U.S. machine gun emplacements.|$|E

He justified these actions by saying in private meetings that [...] "he felt they could do their best in picking the better of the bad apples". These events, along {{with the fact that he}} was linked to personally overseeing who ran the heads of each Mexican cartel, together with the increasing current account deficit fostered by government spending, caused alarm among Mexican and foreign T-bill (tesobono) investors, who sold them rapidly, thereby depleting the already-low central bank reserves (which eventually hit a record low of $9billion). The economically orthodox thing to do, in order to maintain the fixed exchange rate (at 3.3 pesos per dollar, within a variation band), would have been to sharply increase interest rates by allowing the monetary base to shrink, as dollars were being withdrawn from the reserves. Given the fact that it was an election year, whose outcome might have changed as a result of a pre-election-day economic downturn, the Bank of Mexico decided to buy Mexican Treasury Securities in order to maintain the monetary base, and thus prevent the interest rates from rising. This, in turn, caused an <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>dramatic</b> decline in the dollar reserves. These decisions aggravated the already delicate situation, to a point at which a crisis became inevitable and devaluation was only one of many necessary adjustments.
