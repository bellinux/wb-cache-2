Recent work on OpenFlow has largely assumed static replica configurations or has relied on controller developers to embed high avail-ability support in their design. Instead, we present Rule-Bricks, a system for flexibly embedding high availability support in existing OpenFlow policies. RuleBricks intro-duces three key primitives: <b>drop,</b> <b>insert,</b> and reduce. We de-scribe how these primitives can express various flow assign-ment and backup policies, demonstrating the one offered by the Chord protocol. We have implemented RuleBricks and the Chord assignment policy. Using simulation, we compare RuleBricks against a typical tree-based approach.

40|$|This study adresses the Robust Gate Assignment Problem (RGAP) for {{the case}} of both {{homogeneous}} and heterogeneous gates. Due to the increased traffic and congestion at airports, scientific approaches to operational problems have gained importance in the airline industry. Operations planning has a vital importance in this environment. One {{of the most important}} problem types for the airport management is the well known gate assignment problem (GAP). In this study, a column generation (CG) algorithm is proposed to solve GAP and the algorithm is formulated as a linear programming relaxation of the set covering problem. The pricing subproblem (PSP) for the CG approach is represented with a network structure and solved using the shortest path algorithm. Results show that for both homogeneous and heterogeneous instances, the proposed CG algorithm provides optimal LP solutions according to the idle time of variance robustness measure. <b>Insert</b> <b>capability</b> suggested by Dorndorf [1] is also investigated as a robustness measure and compared to variance of idle time.

40|$|Caching {{techniques}} {{can be used}} to reduce bandwidth consumption and data access delay in wireless ad hoc networks. When cache is used, cache consistency issues must be addressed. To maintain strong cache consistency in some strategic scenarios (e. g., battle fields), the invalidationbased approach is preferred due to its low overhead. However, this approach may suffer from some security attacks. For example, a malicious node (intruder) may <b>drop,</b> <b>insert</b> or modify invalidation messages to mislead the receivers to use stale data or unnecessarily invalidate the data that is still valid. In this paper, we propose a solution based on the IR-based cache invalidation strategy to prevent intruders from dropping or modifying the invalidation messages. Although digital signatures {{can be used to}} protect IRs, it has significantly high overhead in terms of computation and bandwidth consumption. To address this problem, we propose a family of randomized grouping based schemes for intrusion detection and damage recovery. Extensive analysis and simulations are used to evaluate the proposed schemes. The results show that our solution can achieve a good level of security with low overhead...|$|R

The data races present in these algorithms may {{cause them to}} <b>drop</b> <b>inserted</b> or appended elements. Nevertheless, the algorithms 1) do not crash and 2) may produce a data structure that is accurate enough for its clients to use successfully.

This approach enables developers to reuse the construction algorithms, which have been engineered to execute successfully in parallel contexts {{despite the presence of}} data races, without having to understand the details of why they execute successfully. We evaluate the end-to-end accuracy and performance consequences of our approach by building a space-subdivision tree for the Barnes-Hut N-body simulation out of our presented tree and array building blocks. The resulting approximate data structure construction algorithm eliminates synchronization overhead and anomalies such as excessive serialization and deadlock. The algorithm exhibits good performance (running 14 times faster on 16 cores than the sequential version) and good accuracy (the accuracy loss is four orders of magnitude less than the accuracy gain associated with increasing the accuracy of the Barnes-Hut center of mass approximation by 20 %). 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{the year}} 2005 Italian Ministry of University and Research financed a {{national}} coordinated {{project on the}} subject: Standard design of hydraulic structures in urban drainage systems, that gives the title to this book. Four operating units based in Napoli, Roma, Catania and Cosenza were involved, leaded by Prof. Giacomo Rasulo as coordinator. The main idea of this volume was to spread among interested audience the activities carried out during the project in a coordinated way: {{as a matter of}} fact, papers concerning researches developed during the project activities have been submitted to refereed journals or presented at national or international conferences, and the overall project achievements could possibly be appreciated in a limited way. In this sense the outcomes of activities have been here presented to give an overall view of this coordinated project. Objective criteria to verify urban drainage systems became necessary after ATO (Optimum Territorial Range Agency) institution in order to define upkeep programmes and actions to restore the existing structures. Moreover new hydraulic structures might be designed to ensure the proper hydraulic working of city sewerage. In Italy standard designing criteria for structures used in urban networks are rarely available. On the contrary in other European countries designers and city sewerage managers can consult extremely useful designing criteria defined by specific Standard Agency (German ATV, for example). Hydraulic structures design, when designing criteria are not available, generally develops in two steps: 1) designers dimension structures following their own experience and considering indications available in technical literature; 2) expensive laboratory tests are performed on physical models to verify the previously dimensioned structures and to complete their designs; only the second step has to be considered when structures have to be verified. The aim of this book is therefore to define a "proper design" manual to analyse in detail some of these structures and to give useful indications to designers and managers. The hydraulic structures analyzed have been split into four sub-themes as the number of operating units: - vortex shafts; - energy dissipative structures in steep sewers; - devices structures for sediment removal in sewers; - pollution indicators for best management practice structures. Study results concerning the vortex shaft structure allowed to define the inlet structure for supercritical flow approach channel. Laboratory measurements combined with numerical simulations have been performed to analyze the hydraulic behaviour of channel <b>drop</b> <b>inserted</b> in a sewer, equipped with a depressed stilling basin.

40|$|In {{this work}} we devised {{a method to}} create smaller eye drops of the {{glaucoma}} medication timolol maleate by altering the dropper tip design and changing the physical properties of the formulation. Most ocular diseases are treated with topical application of eye drops. After instillation of an eye drop, typically, less than 5 % of the applied drug penetrates the cornea and reaches the intraocular tissues; the major fraction of the instilled drug is absorbed and enters the systemic circulation. Ophthalmic solutions are available in multidose or single-dose glass/plastic dropper bottles that deliver drops with a volume that ranges from 25 μL to 70 μL (average 40 μL). Because of the low capacity of the precorneal area, the optimal drop volume is about 20 μL; with larger volumes there is the risk of adverse systemic effects due to absorption of the drug via the nasal mucosa. Thus, both from the biopharmaceutical and economic point of view, drops of only 5 - 15 mL volume should be instilled into the eye. In this present work we devised a method {{to reduce the size}} of the <b>drop</b> by <b>inserting</b> a glass capillary tube into the dropper tip and by changing the physical properties of the formulation (by altering the concentration of Tween 80 ™, i. e., 0. 05 % and 0. 1 % of Tween 80 ™).

Our timolol maleate formulation with 0. 1 % concentration of Tween 80 ™ delivered through the dropper tip with the inserted glass capillary was shown to be better than the other formulations available in the market in terms of ability to deliver smaller drops, meaning that each bottle would last longer and that the yearly cost of treatment would be lower...|$|R

Moving AE2 would also pose high risk to both the submarine and any vessels involved in the relocation; as well as potentially damaging the wreck, there is still an unexploded torpedo aboard.

Methods: This prospective study included consecutive patients with glaucoma and healthy participants. After a complete eye examination and determination of baseline intraocular pressure (IOP), topical hypotensive medication was introduced in both eyes, and the Eyedrop® delivery device (a plastic device in which the bottle with eye <b>drops</b> is <b>inserted)</b> was made available to all participants (with video and written instructions) for use in one eye, randomly chosen. In the second phase, all patients were evaluated by an experienced examiner for IOP determination, investigation of possible associated side effects, and ease of instilling eye drops (by a visual analog scale [VAS]; 0 – 10). Results: Thirty two participants (mean age 42. 3 ± 16. 2  years) were evaluated. Of these, 44 % had glaucoma. There {{was no significant difference}} in mean IOP variation when comparing the eye using (- 3. 9 ± 2. 9  mmHg) or not using the device (- 3. 3 ± 2. 6  mmHg; P= 0. 36). The subjective rating of the facility of drops instillation was significantly higher with the Eyedrop® applicator (VAS = 7. 6 ± 1. 6) than without it (VAS = 6. 2 ± 1. 8; P 5) among participants without prior experience with eye drop instillation (78. 6 % [11 / 14]) versus those already experienced (66. 7 % [12 / 18]).

It is absolutely necessary as we know, that insects should carry pollen from the flowers of the one form reciprocally to those of the other. Insects are attracted by five drops of nectar, secreted exteriorly {{at the base of the}} stamens, so that to reach these <b>drops</b> they must <b>insert</b> their proboscides outside the ring of broad filaments, between them and the petals. In the short-styled form of the above three species, the stigmas face the axis of the flower; and had the styles retained their original upright and central position, not only would the stigmas have presented their backs to the insects which sucked the flowers, but their front and fertile surfaces would have been separated from the entering insects by the ring of broad filaments, and would never have received any pollen. As it is, the styles diverge and pass out between the filaments. After this movement the short stigmas lie within the tube of the corolla; and their papillous surfaces being now turned upwards are necessarily brushed by every entering insect, and thus receive the required pollen.|$|R

Space communications architectures and technologies for this century must satisfy a growing set of requirements, including those for Earth sensing, collaborative observation missions, robotic scientific missions, human missions for exploration of the Moon and Mars where surface activities require supporting communications, and in-space observatories for observing the earth, as well as other star systems and the universe. An advanced, integrated, communications infrastructure will enable the reliable, multipoint, high-data-rate capabilities needed on demand to provide continuous, maximum coverage for areas of concentrated activity. Importantly, the cost/value proposition of the future architecture must {{be an integral part of}} its design; an affordable and sustainable architecture is indispensable within anticipated future budget environments. Effective architecture design informs decision makers with insight into the capabilities needed to efficiently satisfy the demanding space-communication requirements of future missions and formulate appropriate requirements. A driving requirement for the architecture is the extensibility to address new requirements and provide low-cost on-ramps for new capabilities insertion, ensuring graceful growth as new functionality and new technologies are infused into the network infrastructure. In addition to extensibility, another key architectural attribute of the space communication equipment's interoperability with other NASA communications systems, as well as those communications and navigation systems operated by international space agencies and civilian and government agencies. In this paper, we review the philosophies, technologies, architectural attributes, mission services, and communications capabilities that form the structure of candidate next-generation integrated communication architectures for space communications and navigation. A key area that this paper explores is from the development and operation of the software defined radio for the NASA Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Testbed currently on the International Space Station (ISS). Evaluating the lessons learned from development and operation feed back into the communications architecture. Leveraging the reconfigurability provides a change in the way that operations are done and must be considered. Quantifying the impact on the NASA Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) software defined radio architecture provides feedback to keep the standard useful and up to date. NASA is not the only customer of these radios. Software defined radios are developed for other applications, and taking advantage of these developments promotes an architecture that is cost effective and sustainable. Developments in the following areas such as an updated operating environment, higher data rates, networking and security can be leveraged. The ability to sustain an architecture that uses radios for multiple markets can lower costs and keep new technology infused...|$|R
