50|$|Armor etching, using strong mineral acids, was not {{developed}} until the fifteenth century. Etchants mixed from salt, charcoal, and vinegar {{were applied to}} plate armor that had been painted with a maskant of linseed-oil paint. The etchant would bite into the unprotected areas, causing the painted areas to be raised into relief. Etching in this manner allowed armor to be decorated as if with precise engraving, but without the existence of raised burrs; it also prevented the necessity of the armor being softer than an engraving tool. Late in the seventeenth century, etching became used to produce the graduations on measuring instruments; the thinness of lines that etching could produce allowed {{for the production of}} more precise and accurate instruments than were possible before. Not long after, it became used to etch trajectory information plates for cannon and artillery operators; paper would rarely survive the rigors of combat, but an <b>etched</b> <b>plate</b> could be quite durable. Often such information (normally ranging marks) was etched onto equipment such as stiletto daggers or shovels.|$|E
5000|$|Liquid {{capacitive}} inclinometers are inclinometers (or clinometers) whose {{sensing elements}} {{are made with}} a liquid-filled differential capacitor; they sense the local direction of acceleration due to gravity (or movement). [...] A capacitive inclinometer has a disc-like cavity that is partly filled with a dielectric liquid. One of {{the sides of the}} cavity has an etched conductor plate that is used to form one of the conductors of a variable parallel plate capacitor. The liquid along with {{the other side of the}} cavity forms the other plate of the capacitor. In operation, the sensor is mounted so that the disc is in a vertical plane with its axis horizontal. Gravity then acts on the liquid pulling it down in the cavity forming a semicircle. As the sensor is rotated the liquid remains in this semicircular pattern covering a different area of the <b>etched</b> <b>plate.</b> This change in area results in a change in the capacitance. The change in capacitance is then electronically converted into an output signal that is linear with respect to the input angle.|$|E

5000|$|Callot's {{technical}} {{innovations in}} improving the recipes for etching ground were crucial in allowing etching to rival the detail of engraving, {{and in the long}} term spelt the end of artistic engraving. Previously the unreliable nature of the grounds used meant that artists could not risk investing too much effort in an <b>etched</b> <b>plate,</b> as the work might be ruined by leaks in the ground. Equally, multiple stoppings-out, enabling lines etched to different depths by varying lengths of exposure to the acid, had been too risky. Callot led the way in exploiting the new possibilities; most of his etchings are small but full of tiny detail, and he developed a sense of recession in landscape backgrounds in etching with multiple bitings to etch the background more lightly than the foreground. He also used a special etching needle called an échoppe to produce swelling lines like those created by the burin in an engraving, and also reinforced the etched lines with a burin after biting; which soon became common practice among etchers. Callot etched a great variety of subjects in over 1400 prints, from grotesques to his tiny but extremely powerful series Les Grandes Misères de la guerre. Abraham Bosse, a Parisian illustrative etcher popularized Callot's methods in a hugely successful manual for students. His own work is successful in his declared aim of making etchings look like engravings, and is highly evocative of French life at the middle of the century.|$|E

30|$|Mattax and Kyte (1961) {{worked on}} glass micromodels. They used {{chemical}} etching of glass plates. Plates were {{coated with a}} thin layer of wax and lines were scribed with a stylus. Then the glass was etched in hydrofluoric acid, the model can be made intermediately wet by saturating it with crude oil for several hours. Etching leads to a lenticular pore shape with a typical depth in the range of 50 – 100  µm. The distance between channels is of the order of 1  mm. The <b>etched</b> <b>plate</b> is covered by a second plate as a cover. Emami Meybodi et al.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. For my Honor's Capstone Project, I am {{explored}} {{the idea of}} oppositional dualism through process in intaglio. Printmaking as an art media that allows an artist to render realistic images on the plate but allow for processes where the image remains a mystery to the artist until the plate {{is removed from the}} etching solution. Over and over again the image is a mystery, often one that is pleasant to look at after its revelation. Sometimes the explorations can cause images that are hard to read or those that simply refuse to appear, print after print. Intaglio is a printmaking technique where the image is built up by grooves and areas which lie below the surface of a metal plate, usually copper. To make a print from the <b>etched</b> <b>plate,</b> ink is pushed into the grooves, and the surface of the plate wiped clean. The plate is then put onto a press bed with dampened paper on top and run through the press, drawing the ink out of the grooves and onto the paper. For the capstone, I created six 18 " x 24 " plates and six 12 " x I 8 iplates that I printed, often in groups of 2 - 3 creating a deep image that was open to the viewer's interpretation. Although I created multiple prints from each plate, no two prints looked alike. To showcase my work, I installed seven pieces at the Latino Resource Center, and had an exhibition with an opening reception. B. S. Ed (Bachelor of Science in Education...|$|E
40|$|The conference {{presentation}} {{will discuss}} a recent collaboration between artist printmaker Tracy Hill and ceramic researcher Dr Alasdair Bremner. The {{aim was to}} create large format 3 D relief prints that retained a print quality, yet were rendered in a durable material. The presentation will discuss the compromises and opportunities that developed from the cross-disciplinary activity. Tracy has been developing a way of translating the marks from etched metal plates and silkscreen images {{onto the surface of}} cast plaster. The direct interaction with this surface and the relationship which resulted between the oil based ink of the <b>etched</b> <b>plate</b> and the surface layer of the water based ink laid down by the silk screen, offered many potential combinations, creating a versatile and unique medium that was printed, yet retained a relief surface. The disadvantage of this process was the fragility of the resulting works. A potential solution was to translate the process into ceramic. Alasdair’s research using castable refractory concrete to create large format architectural ceramics presented a way to achieve pieces that would have the scale and durability that was required. This industrial technology offers the opportunity to achieve the creation of objects that do not conform to some of the traditional limitations of conventional clay yet can make use of a range of ceramic surface treatments. The challenge of the project was to translate the techniques that Tracy had developed for use in plaster to refractory concrete material, combining the print quality with ceramic glaze qualities. They will discuss the processes developed and highlight the advantages print making in refractory concrete can offer in terms of the interaction of glaze and oxide; the scales possible and finally the durability and permanency. This collaboration opens up new possibilities for printmaking beyond the conventional print within a gallery space...|$|E
