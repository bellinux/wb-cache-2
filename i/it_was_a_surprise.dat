25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{result on}} Saturday as Adrian Sutil topped the time sheets, as Vettel's engine blew {{halfway through the}} session causing it to be red-flagged as oil was on the track. The other Force India, Fisichella, was 0.621 seconds behind his team-mate in P6.|$|E
25|$|Since he was batting {{as well as}} ever, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> that {{he retired}} {{at the end of}} the 1974 season. However, the Surrey {{dressing}} room was not a happy place at the time, and that may have been a factor in his decision. He reappeared in one John Player League fixture in 1976, against Kent on 11 July.|$|E
25|$|On {{the results}} night, Ryan Seacrest {{revealed}} that Holcomb and Glover {{were in the}} bottom 2. However, the two contestants were then declared safe together with Miller and Harrison {{and no one was}} eliminated. Seacrest stated that due to the save not being used, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> non-elimination round and votes for that week would be carried over to the following week.|$|E

25|$|In February 1982, after Glenn Shorrock had {{departed}} Little River Band, Farnham became their lead vocalist with recommendations by Goble and Wheatley. Farnham had initially resisted {{the idea of}} joining LRB but Wheatley convinced him that Shorrock approved of the replacement. This continued Farnham's move away from cabaret and into rock music. As Little River Band was a successful band prior to Farnham joining, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> that they found little initial success.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{that such}} people as Bujak and Borusewicz instead of calling a National Commission {{nominated}} themselves. The opposition surprised even the Government. At this moment they broke the statutes. In {{the fall of}} 1987 Solidarity members, including myself, during the pilgrimage to Częstochowa sent a petition to Wałęsa to call a National Commission meeting. But Wałęsa wouldn’t accept it. So {{there have been no}} meetings, except amongst themselves.|$|E
25|$|After {{years of}} success, in 2003, she {{was seen in}} several low budget films, yet not less {{challenging}} roles. She ventured into strong woman-oriented films in 2003, such as Escape From Taliban, which won her the BFJA Award for Best Actress. She then played the protagonist in Market (2003), a film portraying the whole life {{story of a young}} prostitute. The film did decently at the box office as it was considered 'Average.' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> successor of the year.|$|E

It was initially released {{on only one}} screen in Hong Kong at the Broadway Cinematheque in Yau Ma Tei {{at the end of}} 2015. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> hit, and subsequently received a release at select UA Cinemas. It was further picked up by two independent cinemas, the Metroplex in Kowloon Bay and the Ma On Shan Classics Cinema. The Metroplex decided to show the film in its largest cinema (430 seats) boosting ticket sales.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the grass}} court season beginning, Murray {{appointed}} Amélie Mauresmo as his new coach. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> move which saw Mauresmo become {{the first woman to}} coach a high-profile male player. In their first tournament together, Murray recorded a straight sets win over Paul-Henri Mathieu as he attempted to defend his Queen's Club Championship title. However, he suffered a shock defeat to Radek Štěpánek in the following round, ending his 19 match win streak which stretched back to his 2012 Wimbledon final defeat to Roger Federer.|$|E
25|$|Although he just {{failed to}} reach three-figures in the wet summer of 1930, Staples was still a force with the ball as shown when he took 7 for 24 on a sticky wicket against Leicestershire at Trent Bridge. However, in 1931 a car {{accident}} {{kept him out of}} most of Nottinghamshire's later programme and the team's bowling was very weak without him and Larwood. 1932 opened with a sensational 10 for 21 against Hampshire and saw Staples on the whole bowling better than ever, so that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> when after 1933 Staples decided to retire to coach the team. He did play one match as captain in 1934 when Arthur Carr was not able to play.|$|E

50|$|Jansante {{played for}} {{conservative}} coaches Dr. Jock Sutherland and John Michelosen. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> both coaches’ style not {{to throw the}} football. He {{was the first of}} the Steelers to catch double-digit (10) passes in a single game, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> that even 10 passes were thrown in Jansante’s big days.|$|R

25|$|Tattersall, however, bowled in {{excellent}} form for Lancashire {{right up to}} 1957; taking 100 County Championship wickets every year except 1956, when after an irresistible start, he unaccountably lost form. In the wet summer of 1958. he failed to reach 100 wickets {{for the first time}} since 1949. The eminent Lancashire cricket writer, John Kay, felt Tattersall the victim of inconsistent policy at Old Trafford. In 1956, he was left out in mid-season, a move that probably cost the County the championship. Nonetheless, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to see Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton dropped at the beginning of 1959, for the leg-spinner Tommy Greenhough. Although Tattersall was recalled at the beginning of the 1960 season, he did not do well enough to keep his place after May.|$|E
25|$|Parma {{opened the}} last Serie A weekend of February away to Genoa, who {{were led by}} Pasquale Marino, the coach who took charge of much of Parma's 2010–11 season. With neither side having scored since 5 February, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> when the scoring was opened so easrly in the game; Massimo Gobbi swept home {{from the edge of}} the area after just five minutes. Giovinco then had what looked like a fair goal ruled out for offside just before half-time. Parma did get their second goal after the break after a {{brilliant}} run from Jonathan Biabiany ended in a Giovinco chance with the follow-up falling to Sergio Floccari, who converted against his former employees. With just over ten minutes to go, Genoa were very fortunate to be given a penalty for Francesco Modesto's accidental handball inside the area; Rodrigo Palacio tapped in after Mirante's save. Genoa then should have had a penalty after a reckless Modesto challenged went unpunished. The referee inexplicably allowed 7 minutes of injury time; Palacio used the sixth to break the offside trap and slot home to level the score and earn a point for his team.|$|E
25|$|Their white jerseys have {{provided}} three basic color combinations, {{two of which}} have been previously alluded to in this article. The last combination consists of both white jerseys and pants. That particular combination surfaced in {{the first game of the}} 2003 season, when the team was coached by Steve Spurrier, during a nationally televised game against the New York Jets, which led many sports fans and Redskins faithful alike to point out that they had never seen that particular combination before. That year the Redskins wore it two more times. That look didn't appear again until midway through the 2005 season when the Redskins wore it in a road game against the St. Louis Rams. The Redskins won six straight games, including one in the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, wearing that combination and the local media jokingly pointed out that the reason the Redskins were winning was their use of the white over white combination. In the NFC Divisional Playoff game against the eventual 2005 NFC Champion Seattle Seahawks, the Redskins wore the all-white uniforms, in hopes that they could keep their streak going; however, they lost 20–10. The Redskins continued to wear the white jerseys and white pants into the 2006 preseason. In the 2006 season, the Redskins started wearing black cleats, something that hadn't been done for quite a while. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> because they wore white cleats during the preseason. They would have to wear that color for the rest of the season, because the NFL usually asks teams to choose either black or white cleats to be worn throughout the season.|$|E

500|$|In January 1910, Maeda {{took part}} in a wrestling tournament in Mexico City. During the semifinals, Maeda drew with Hjalmar Lundin. This is a {{different}} result than Lundin recalled in his 1937 memoirs. Said Lundin, [...] "Having been accustomed to handling the big Greco-Roman wrestlers with ease, the Jap thought he could do likewise with me, but in the first encounter I got the better of him, after which my confidence returned. I had no trouble then in winning the match. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to the crowd and a set-back for Koma. He had been the hero all week, but {{as soon as he was}} beaten the fans, true to form, called him a bum." ...|$|E
500|$|Feng {{represented}} Singapore for {{the first}} time at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the women's team tournament. She contributed significantly to Singapore's 3–2 win against South Korea in the semifinals by defeating Dang Ye-Seo and Park Mi-Young in two singles matches. Feng's match against Park was closely fought, with Feng eventually overcoming Park 3–1. Singapore was assisted by the implementation of the expedite system when the game failed to be completed in ten minutes. Under the system, players serve on alternative points rather than on every two points. A receiving player scores a point if she manages 13 returns, which disadvantages defensive play by the server. The system unsettled Park, and Feng won two minutes after its introduction in the match when Park committed a service fault. Interviewed afterwards, Feng said: [...] "I definitely did not expect that [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> and the best birthday present I've ever gotten." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Shake It Off" [...] became another remix {{in which}} Carey would feature a hip-hop artist, having done so {{several times in}} the past.

500|$|On February 3, 2005, Bethesda {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with Take-Two Interactive regarding the publication and release of Oblivion. Under the agreement, Bethesda would retain full control over Oblivions development and the rights to any possible sequels, and Take-Two would agree to publish the game under its recently formed 2K Games sub brand. According to Producer Gavin Carter, the team's experience was a rarity in the industry; few independent developer-publisher relationships still exist, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> that Bethesda's experience worked out {{as well as it}} did. Carter described Take-Two's role as one of minimal interference, and the company mostly left Bethesda's development teams alone, trusting them to produce a [...] "fantastic product" [...] with minimal interference or [...] "red tape". The relationship was a rarity in the industry, according to Carter, where most developers are beholden to their publishers. [...] Ashley Cheng, Oblivions senior producer, concurred. There was [...] "complete freedom" [...] at Bethesda to decide their own path, whatever market trends might say. Of the legal proceedings affecting Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax during the initial stages of game development, when Bethesda founder Christopher Weaver sued the company for severance pay, Todd Howard said that he, as a producer, wasn't involved with corporate affairs. [...] "I just focus on the games." ...|$|E
500|$|Fauré's operas {{have not}} found {{a place in the}} regular repertoire. Prométhée is the more {{neglected}} of the two, with only a handful of performances in more than a century. Copland considered Pénélope (1913) a fascinating work, {{and one of the best}} operas written since Wagner; he noted, however, that the music is, as a whole, [...] "distinctly non-theatrical." [...] The work uses leitmotifs, and the two main roles call for voices of heroic quality, but these are the only ways in which the work is Wagnerian. In Fauré's late style, [...] "tonality is stretched hard, without breaking." [...] On the rare occasions when the piece has been staged, critical opinion has generally praised the musical quality of the score, but has varied as to the dramatic effectiveness of the work. When the opera was first presented in London in 1970, in a student production by the Royal Academy of Music, Peter Heyworth wrote, [...] "A score that offers rich rewards to an attentive ear can none the less fail to cut much ice in the theatre.... Most of the music is too recessive to be theatrically effective." [...] However, after a 2006 production at the Wexford Festival, Ian Fox wrote, [...] "Fauré's Pénélope is a true rarity, and, although some lovely music was anticipated, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> how sure the composer's theatrical touch was." ...|$|E
