40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{electric}} energy quality of switching power supply, through the theoretical analysis on the high frequency large-power rectification and the reverse switch supply theory, we conclude that the switch supply is the main polluting source of affecting the power energy quality. At the same time, we obtain that the contents of 3, 5, 7 th-fold harmonic components in the switching supply is highest through the measurement of special <b>harmonics</b> <b>test</b> instrument. Other high-frequency harmonics also exist, but their proportions are rather low, as can be neglected. Therefore, the 3, 5, 7 th-fold harmonic components of the switching supply are the major reasons leading to the system polluted. In order to eliminating the pollution of the harmonics produced by the switching supply to power grid and the side-effect to its own control system, this paper designs a general 3 -phase passive filter instrument which can not only restrict harmonics, but also improve the power factor of the supply system. The test shows that the method can make the supply system to ideal effect, the contents {{of all kinds of}} harmonics become rather lower than the standard constituted by our country, and it also degrades the power harmonics and decreases the alternating current ripples greatly...|$|E

40|$|<b>Harmonic</b> pulse <b>testing</b> is a {{well testing}} {{technique}} in which the injection or production rate is varied in a periodic way. The pressure response to the imposed rates, both in the pulser well and in the observer wells, can be analyzed in the frequency domain to evaluate the reservoir properties. The advantages {{of this type of}} test are that dedicated well testing surface equipment is not required and that the test can be performed during ongoing field operations. In an earlier study we demonstrated that the <b>harmonic</b> pulse <b>testing</b> methodology can be used to evaluate the effective permeability to hydrocarbons and the reservoir total compressibility even for such a heterogeneous case as in a water injection scenario. The analysis can be performed using a numerical simulator in the Fourier domain, by which heterogeneities can be explicitly taken into account. As time-stepping is not required in such a simulation, calculations are much faster than calculations in the time domain. In the present paper we report on the application of the methodology to two field cases. The first case is a gas storage reservoir, operated with a day-night injection-shut in scenario. Data analysis proved that the reservoir was homogeneous and that a minor fault identified by the seismic was not hindering hydraulic communication between the pulser and the observer wells. The second case is a set of <b>harmonic</b> <b>test</b> experiments on three groundwater wells, the details of which have been published earlier together with a first attempt to interpret the data.

40|$|<b>Harmonic</b> Pulse <b>Testing</b> was {{introduced}} in the early 1970 's as a special case of pulse testing. It is characterized by a periodic variation of production/injection rate. Subsequent developments proved that it could provide the same information as a conventional well test (permeability and skin, heterogeneity) in addition to those given by a pulse test (areal connectivity within the reservoir) if proper interpretation models were adopted. Consequently, it can be considered as a promising methodology to test a well during ongoing field operations without stopping production and thus it is very attractive for monitoring well performance, especially of gas storage wells. Initially applied to oil wells, <b>Harmonic</b> Pulse <b>Testing</b> has recently been extended to gas wells for which the assumption of Darcy flow regime is no longer valid because of inertial phenomena and/or turbulence. <b>Harmonic</b> Pulse <b>Testing</b> for gas wells comprises three or more consecutive sequences of pulses characterized by increasing average rate, similar to a Flow After Flow test. The interpretation of a single-well <b>Harmonic</b> Pulse <b>test</b> is based on the derivative approach in the frequency domain to obtain kh and the skin components (mechanical skin and D factor). The possibility of assessing well deliverability from a multi-sequence pulse test was analysed in the research work presented in this paper. Different Pulse test configurations were considered and compared with the well-established Flow After Flow test in terms of deliverability estimate. To this end synthetic well test data were generated and sensitivity to test design, well parameters and reservoir interference were carried out.

40|$|Abstract – ADC testing {{frequently}} {{confronts the}} problem of spectral purity of <b>harmonic</b> <b>test</b> signal. The majority of dynamic ADC test methods require test signal distortion at least 10 dB {{less than that of}} the tested ADC – the condition that cannot be practically fulfilled for testing up-to-date ADCs. More sophisticated approach to ADC testing applies the correction for test signal imperfections. In both cases test signal distortion has to be known – roughly in the first case and quite accurately in the second case. In this paper an easy method for the testing of signal spectral purity is proposed. Test signal passed by one of two simple analog filters is measured by a common ADC, whose nonlinearity is mathematically post-corrected. The results are compared with common approach applying notch filter and uncertainty analysis is performed. I...|$|R

The stiffness decreased and damping increased {{as a function}} of the moisture content (MC), which is presumed to be the effect of plasticization and an unstable state. The increasing damping was associated with the breaking of hydrogen bonds and the formation of free volume within polymer networks. The changes of loss modulus ratio at 1 and 20 Hz, E″ 1 Hz/E″ 20 Hz, proved the changing trend of the unstable state. Higher ramping rates aggravated the unstable state at the RHramp period, and higher constant RH levels provided more recovery of the unstable state at the RHisohume period. Changes of viscoelastic properties were associated with RH (varied or remained constant), and the application of Boltzmann’s superposition principle is a good approach to simulate viscoelasticity development...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – A {{broadband}} {{single element}} transducer was constructed from single crystal PMN-PT and tested to de-termine {{the feasibility of}} using this material for simultane-ous sub-harmonic and second harmonic imaging. The transducer consisted of a 1 - 3 PMN-PT/epoxy composite with two quarter wave matching layers and a backing. The transducer face was spherically curved to yield a 53 mm focal point. The transducer’s impulse response had a center frequency of 5. 2 MHz and- 6 dB bandwidth over 130 %. The transmit response for tone burst excitation indicated a shift in center frequency to 6. 5 MHz and a- 6 dB bandwidth of 100 %. Receive sensitivity was high {{at the lower end}} of the band and decreased with increasing frequency; this behavior was probably due to electrical impedance mismatch. Contrast agent testing using Sona-zoid ® showed that the second harmonic could be easily detected. The sub-harmonic was not detected due to the center frequency shift under tone burst excitation.

30|$|The last {{block of}} the note {{decision}} stage includes some <b>harmonic</b> <b>tests</b> {{to perform the}} final decision. One {{of the problems in}} polyphonic detection is the detection of the octave and perfect fifth since many errors occur due to either missing notes or, especially, to the appearance of false positives [26, 27]. This is due to the overlapping between harmonic partials of different sounds. Assuming ideal harmonicity, it is known that harmonic partials of two sounds coincide if and only if the fundamental frequencies of the two sounds are in rational number relations [28, 29]. When the harmonicity is not ideal, the overlapping continues since the partials of the notes may exhibit appreciable bandwidth. On the other hand, an important principle in Western music is that simple harmonic relationships are favored over dissonant ones {{in order to make the}} sounds blend better [21]. This is the case of octaves and fifths. These intervals are the ones whose harmonious relationships are the simplest (2 [*]:[*] 1 and 3 [*]:[*] 2) and these are also the two most frequent intervals in Western music [30].|$|R
