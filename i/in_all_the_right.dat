Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an emotionally disturbed drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from {{the other members of the}} band. Lydon later wrote, [...] "We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She was killing him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission.... Only she didn't want to go alone.

[...] He further {{explained that}} Carradine's Americana was [...] "an ideal selection for the fortnight." [...] In fact, the film won the People's Choice Award there in 1981. Film columnist Christopher Hicks stated that Americana was also warmly received at the 1981 United States Film and Video Festival in Park City, Utah. [...] This was the third of such events which would later become known as the Sundance Film Festival. Carradine said of the audience's reaction to the film, [...] "Well, they laughed <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> places, and they applauded at the end, so I guess it went alright."

Rolling Stones review was decidedly ambivalent, praising the album's sound, but noting that [...] "Wu-Tang... are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvas—the self." [...] Entertainment Weekly was more enthusiastic, giving the album an A, and writing that [...] "With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, Enter has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-kept secret."
