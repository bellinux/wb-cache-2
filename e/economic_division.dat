500|$|Putnam, {{along with}} Saul Kripke, Keith Donnellan, and others, contributed {{to what is}} known as the causal theory of reference. In particular, Putnam {{maintained}} in The Meaning of [...] "Meaning" [...] that the objects referred to by natural kind terms—such as tiger, water, and tree—are the principal elements of the meaning of such terms. There is a linguistic division of labor, analogous to Adam Smith's <b>economic</b> <b>division</b> of labor, according to which such terms have their references fixed by the [...] "experts" [...] in the particular field of science to which the terms belong. So, for example, the reference of the term [...] "lion" [...] is fixed by the community of zoologists, the reference of the term [...] "elm tree" [...] is fixed by the community of botanists, and the reference of the term [...] "table salt" [...] is fixed as [...] "NaCl" [...] by chemists. These referents are considered rigid designators in the Kripkean sense and are disseminated outward to the linguistic community.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} {{disparities between}} some classes of European Americans and African Americans have diminished. Black Americans today have a median income level {{much higher than}} they did in the 1990 census and as compared to the 2000 census, after inflation is considered. African Americans occupy a higher percentage of high-paying jobs within the USA than they used to. [...] This has led to a rapidly increasing black upper-middle class. Many of America's suburbs are becoming diversified with black and white residents coexisting in affluent neighborhoods. With the <b>economic</b> <b>division</b> within similar classes declining between races, African-American movement to the suburbs has resulted in some suburbs becoming more diverse. [...] Other times middle and upper class blacks have chosen to settle in chiefly African-American communities, so their children can grow up in a strong community of their own.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987 Dr. Joyce Williams, the {{chairperson}} of the Southeast Area Council, an organization within the Mayor's Citizens Assistance Council, said that her group stopped referring to the area as the [...] "Third Ward." [...] The practice became official on Wednesday June 3, 1987 The group itself was formerly named the Third Ward Area Council. Williams said [...] "The city has become a cosmopolitan city. The term ‘ward’ is stagnant, unsophisticated, and places areas in isolation." [...] Williams hoped that fellow Houstonians would also stop referring to sections {{of the city as}} [...] "wards." [...] Kim Cobb of the Houston Chronicle explained that [...] "She's particularly concerned about the Riverside-MacGregor area near the Medical Center that her group represents. She thinks the term [...] "Third Ward" [...] implies an <b>economic</b> <b>division</b> that will {{get in the way of}} the benefits that will come to the rest of the city from the opening of the George Brown Convention Center." [...] Betty Chapman, a historian, said in 2007 [...] "The wards haven’t had any real meaning since 1905. But people are very interested in them. They’re an important part of our history." ...|$|E
2500|$|How wealth was {{assessed}} [...] varied from one community to another. Farmers counted {{the number of}} ploughshares owned and among the pastoral folk it {{was the number of}} cows. Wealth was distributed unequally among the people, leading to distinct economic classes - the rich, the poor and the middle class. The nobility, state officers, export traders and court poets formed the wealthy class. Most agriculturists and inland merchants made up the middle class. The lowest class consisted of labourers and wandering minstrels. It was believed that this <b>economic</b> <b>division</b> of people {{was the result of a}} divine arrangement; the poor people were made to feel that their miserable condition was due to their past sins, tivinai, and was inevitable. The extreme opulence of some people as well as the abject poverty of some others are clearly portrayed in the contemporary literature. Most of the rich spent a part of their wealth on charity, the king's philanthropy setting an example. It was believed that one needed to accumulate wealth in order to give donations and perform righteous obligations. Sometimes, the men of the household undertook a long journey to the north of the Venkata Hill or the northern boundary of Tamilakam, to earn wealth. One possible region that they might have gone to is the Mysore region, where the gold mines were getting famous. F. R. Allchin, who has discussed the antiquity of gold mining in the Deccan, says that the high period of mining in South India was the last centuries of the pre-Christian era and the first two centuries of the Christian era, which coincides with the Sangam period.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Economic</b> <b>Division</b> was a {{critical}} one for the NLRB. Cause-and-effect {{was one of the}} fundamental assumptions of the National Labor Relations Act, and for the causes of labor unrest to be understood economic analysis was needed. From the start, the <b>Economic</b> <b>Division</b> undertook three important tasks: 1) Gather economic data in support of cases before the courts; 2) Conduct general studies of labor relations to guide the board in formulating decisions and policies; and 3) Research the history of labor relations (the history of written agreements, whether certain issues were historically part of collective bargaining, how unions functioned internally, trends in employer activities, trends in collective bargaining, whether certain employer actions led to labor disputes, etc.) so that the board could educate itself, the courts, Congress, and the public about labor relations. The first function proved critical to the survival of the NLRB. It was the Economic Division's data and analysis, more than then NLRB's legal reasoning, which proved critical in persuading the Supreme Court to sustain the Wagner Act in NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel. The Court even cited several <b>Economic</b> <b>Division</b> studies in its decision. In the wake of Jones & Laughlin Steel, many labor relations experts outside the agency concluded that economic analysis was [...] "an accepted fact" [...] essential to the proper functioning of the agency. The <b>Economic</b> <b>Division</b> did, too. It asked Madden to pair an economist with an attorney in every important case, and prepared outline of the economic data needed to support each case in case it went before the courts.|$|E
