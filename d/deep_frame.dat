2500|$|The backglass is a {{vertical}} graphic panel {{mounted on the}} front of the backbox, which is the upright box at the top back of the machine. The backglass contains the name of the machine, eye-catching graphics, (usually) the score displays (lights, mechanical wheels, an LED display, or a dot-matrix display depending on the era), and sometimes a mechanical device tied to game play, for example, elevator doors that opened on an image or a woman swatting a cat with a broom such as on Williams' 1989 [...] "Bad Cats". For older games, the backglass image is screen printed in layers on the reverse side of a piece of glass; in more recent games, the image is imprinted into a translucent piece of plastic-like material called a translite which is mounted behind a piece of glass and which is easily removable. The earliest games did not have backglasses or backboxes and were little more than playfields in boxes. Games are generally built around a particular theme, such as a sport or character and the backglass art reflects this theme to attract the attention of players. Recent machines are typically tied into other enterprises such as a popular film series, toy, or brand name. The entire machine is designed to be as eye-catching as possible to attract players and their money; every possible space is filled with colorful graphics, blinking lights, and themed objects, and the backglass is usually the first artwork the players see from a distance. Since the artistic value of the backglass may be quite impressive, it is not uncommon for enthusiasts to use a <b>deep</b> <b>frame</b> around a backglass (lighted from behind) and hang it as art after the remainder of the game is discarded.|$|E

40|$|In this {{qualitative}} study, I {{examine the}} persistent trend {{of black women}} as an excluded relationship partner for white men. Integral to understanding the exclusion of black women as relationship partners is the construction of black female bodies, by influential white men historically and contemporarily, as the abject opposite of hegemonic femininity, which holds "middle-class, heterosexual, [w]hite femininity" as the norm (Collins 2005 : 193). This construction essentially places black women outside the bounds of hegemonic femininity, beauty, sexuality, and womanhood. Using the theoretical concept <b>deep</b> <b>frame,</b> which is the "conceptual infrastructure of the mind" (Lakoff 2006 a: 12) and representative of one's commonsense world view, I argue that {{the ways in which}} influential white men have constructed black female bodies is a critical component of the raced, gendered, and classed <b>deep</b> <b>frame</b> of white men. This <b>deep</b> <b>frame</b> undergirds how many white men perceive, interpret, understand, emote, and engage in actions where black women are concerned. Hence in this study, I qualitatively examine, through analyzing and interpreting the in-depth online questionnaires of 134 white male respondents, how the <b>deep</b> <b>frame</b> of white men affects how they perceive black women and ultimately the relationships they seek with black women. The results of the study show that many white male respondents, despite most having very limited or no personal interactions with black women, viewed black women through the one-dimensional lens of the raced, gendered, and classed <b>deep</b> <b>frame.</b> Many respondents perceived black women as unattractive unless capable of a white normative standard, as possessing a negative "black" culture, and as possessing negative and "unfeminine" attributes that make them complicit in their own rejection. These findings show how the <b>deep</b> <b>frame</b> disciplines white men to view black women as "out of bounds" as legitimate relationship partners, and disciplines the types of relationships they seek with black women. The results of this study also reveal that the conceptual approach of <b>deep</b> <b>frame</b> rooted in an understanding of the power of influential white men to control and construct society provides a theoretical alternative to the outmoded interracial marriage theories of caste and exchange...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Separation logic [7] is {{well known}} to provide a local {{reasoning}} principle for local store, the frame rule. Local reasoning is extended to programs with modules and higher-order functions respectively by the hypothetical frame rule [4] and higher-order frame rule [2]. This means, for instance, that the private state of a library module can be hidden, so that clients {{do not need to}} know or worry about the private state; this leads to modular proofs. Higher-order functions can be expressed in low level languages using code pointers and recursion through the store, as in [1, 8]. However, local reasoning for such languages is surprisingly tricky: in [8], a version of the (higher-order) <b>deep</b> <b>frame</b> rule is observed to hold only as a rule and not as an axiom. This means one can only apply the rule to the top level triple under consideration, but not to nested triples appearing inside assertions. Assuming the axiom version allows one to “launder ” specifications [6, 8] and thus derive memory-safety of programs that actually crash. On the other hand, it appears that without a reasoning principle resembling the axiom version, there are safe programs whose correctness cannot be shown. In this paper we investigate and analyse the technique of “laundering” in more detail and propose a remedy, an idiom for writing specifications (Hoare triples) that “promise ” that applications of the <b>deep</b> <b>frame</b> axiom are sound. This is done with the help of second order logic (quantification over assertions). We demonstrate the utility of this technique for proving real programs by means of an example: a generic memoiser for recursive functions. 1 Introduction an...|$|E

40|$|Higher order store {{programs}} are programs which store, manipulate and invoke code at runtime. Important examples of higher order store programs include operating system kernels which dynamically load and unload kernel modules. Yet conventional Hoare logics, which provide {{no means of}} representing changes to code at runtime, are not applicable to such programs. Recently, however, new logics using nested Hoare triples have addressed this shortcoming. In this paper we describe, from top to bottom, a sound semi-automated verification system for higher order store programs. We give a programming language with higher order store features, define an assertion language with nested triples for specifying such programs, and provide reasoning rules for proving programs correct. We then present in full our algorithms for automatically constructing correctness proofs. In contrast to earlier work, the language also includes ordinary (fixed) procedures and mutable local variables, {{making it easy to}} model programs which perform dynamic loading and other higher order store operations. We give an operational semantics for programs and a step-indexed interpretation of assertions, and use these to show soundness of our reasoning rules, which include a <b>deep</b> <b>frame</b> rule which allows more modular proofs. Our automated reasoning algorithms include a scheme for separation logic based symbolic execution of programs, and automated provers for solving various kinds of entailment problems.
