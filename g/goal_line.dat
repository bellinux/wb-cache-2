5|$|In {{front of}} the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the <b>goal</b> <b>line,</b> two lines {{starting}} on the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> 16.5m (18yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5m (18yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the <b>goal</b> <b>line,</b> and a line joining them. This area {{has a number of}} functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul {{by a member of the}} defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.|$|E
5|$|Corner kick: {{when the}} ball has wholly crossed the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the {{defending}} team; awarded to attacking team.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbilt beat Mississippi 24–0, the {{visitors}} showing a strong defense. Morgan, Collins, and Sikes {{were on the}} sidelines for the whole game. Multiple times, the Commodores fumbled near the <b>goal</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the first}} half, by much rushing, forcing, snapbacks and {{vigorous}} bullyragging Riggs, the huge Hopkins quarterback, crashed over the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> for 4 points. Paul Dashiell converted. Riggs repeated his performance but Dashiell missed conversion. Navy then adopted the Hopkins rushing tactics and Stone went over for the first score.|$|E
5|$|Following the match, {{the referee}} {{admitted}} {{that at one}} point during the game the ball had passed the Blackburn <b>goal</b> <b>line,</b> but as Queen's Park did not attempt to claim the goal, it was not awarded. Queen's Park would ultimately become the only Scottish club to reach the final of the FA Cup, although they returned the following year where they again faced Blackburn Rovers.|$|E
5|$|In Game 6, Pittsburgh got goals from Malkin, {{his first}} in the Finals, and Hossa. Entering the final minute and {{trailing}} by one, Pittsburgh pulled Fleury {{for the second time}} that game, hoping to score with circumstances similar to Hossa's earlier goal. A tipped shot which passed in between Chris Osgood and the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> as time expired did not enter the net, giving Detroit the victory. Pittsburgh's final defeat of the season was by a score of 3–2.|$|E

5|$|In the 3rd quarter, New York's defense made a <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> stand, {{which became}} {{a turning point in}} the game. New York, who had trouble {{mounting}} drives to that point, then had a 95-yard drive which culminated in a touchdown, making the score 14–10. They drove again in the 4th quarter, with quarterback Charlie Conerly throwing a 15-yard touchdown pass to Frank Gifford to take the lead, 17–14.|$|E
5|$|The try at goal failed, but the ball, {{instead of}} going to the Cliftons behind the line, fell into the field and into the hands of one of the Academy team. By a quick decisive run, he again got the ball over the Cliftons <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> and scored a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded to}} the goal immediately, as Giggs made a surging run through the Barcelona defence before playing the ball to Berbatov in the inside-right channel. The Bulgarian forward's low cross found Giggs in the centre, and the United captain's shot was {{deflected}} to Ronaldo {{on the far side}} of the goal, only for the Portuguese's shot to be blocked by Valdés. The resulting corner reached Berbatov {{on the far side of}} the goal, but it was deemed to have crossed the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> first and Barcelona were awarded a goal kick, from which they launched another attack. Messi played a through-ball to Puyol on the right flank, but as the Barcelona captain reached the <b>goal</b> <b>line,</b> he was fouled by Ronaldo, who – despite going in two-footed – escaped the referee's book. Puyol himself rose to head Xavi's free kick towards goal, but it was directly at Van der Sar, who claimed the ball easily.|$|E

50|$|The {{pitch is}} {{rectangular}} in shape. The longer sides are called touchlines. The other opposing sides {{are called the}} <b>goal</b> <b>lines.</b> The two <b>goal</b> <b>lines</b> must be between 45 and 90 m and be the same length. The two touch lines must also be of the same length, and be between 90 and 120 m in length. All lines must be equally wide, not to exceed 12 cm. The corners of the pitch are marked by corner flags.|$|R

5|$|With Hopkins {{backed up}} against her own <b>goal</b> <b>line,</b> Dashiell broke through the entire Navy team for a touchdown. Goal was missed and the score was 14 to 6 against Navy. With the game fast coming to a close The Tars formed a closely knit ball with the halfback in center.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E
5|$|After taking {{possession}} {{on his own}} 16-yard line, Georgia quarterback and true freshman Matthew Stafford caused the first turning point of the game as he threw an interception to Brenden Hill of Virginia Tech. Starting deep in Georgia territory, Virginia Tech was further aided by a personal foul on Georgia, which set up a first-and-goal situation for Virginia Tech on the Georgia 6-yard line. A two-yard run by Virginia Tech tailback Branden Ore brought the ball closer to the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> and ended {{the first quarter of}} play.|$|E

50|$|To {{increase}} the number of field goals and decrease the number of tie games, the goal posts are moved from the end lines {{at the back of the}} end zones to the <b>goal</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5|$|All line {{markings}} on the pitch {{form part of}} the area which they define. For example, a ball on the side line {{is still in the}} field of play; a ball on the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line has occurred in the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> before a goal is scored.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, Tennessee had the ball at its 19-yard line, facing a second down and ten. On the first play of the quarter, Tennessee ran an end-around to Kendrick Jones, who ran the ball for 76 yards, giving the Volunteers a first down at the Virginia Tech five-yard line. Three plays later, running back Jay Graham crossed the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> for the first Tennessee touchdown of the second quarter. The extra point was good, and with 13:23 remaining in the first half, Tennessee took a 210 lead.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall {{got off to a}} good start, completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the limited}} {{dimensions}} of the indoor arena, special rules were adopted for the game: the tanbark-covered field itself was only 80 yards long (60 yards between the <b>goal</b> <b>lines)</b> and 45 yards wide, 10 yards narrower than the regulation width at the time. The sidelines were butted up against the stands. The goal posts were moved from the endlines to the <b>goal</b> <b>lines.</b> The ball was automatically moved back 20 yards every time one team crossed the 10-yard line. For the first time, all plays started with the ball on or between the hash marks, which were ten yards from the sidelines. Additionally, drop kicks and field goals were banned.|$|R
50|$|Harrow Football {{is usually}} {{played on a}} pitch {{resembling}} a rugby pitch, only muddier and uneven. It is usually 100-130 yards (90-120m) in length by 50-100 yards (45-90m) in width. The pitch must be rectangular, with the length (touch lines) longer than the width (<b>goal</b> <b>lines).</b>|$|R
5|$|Cody {{personally}} {{took over}} the Auburn game after Vanderbilt was up 17–0. In {{one of the greatest}} exhibitions of punt covering, Cody smothered the receiver every time, recovering two fumbles, including one across the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> for a touchdown. Then, in the last ten seconds of play, Cody dropped kicked a three-pointer from the 33-yard line. In the season's final game against rival Sewanee, tackles Cody and Tom Lipscomb blocked a punt leading to the game's second touchdown. Irby Curry later had an 80-yard touchdown with Cody clearing the path. The final score was 28–3. Cody also received an offer to play for Navy.|$|E
5|$|Despite being pinned {{against their}} own <b>goal</b> <b>line,</b> the Hokies {{initially}} had some success moving the ball. Taylor completed a two-yard pass, Evans ran for six yards, and Taylor ran for two yards on third down to earn a first down at the Tech 13-yard line. After a Tech timeout, Darren Evans ran for five yards. On the next play, he broke free for a 32-yard run, advancing {{the ball to the}} 50-yard line. The Hokies were unable to capitalize on Evans' run, however, as on the next play, a pass from Taylor was intercepted by Cincinnati defender Brandon Underwood at the Cincinnati 28-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's offense {{returned}} to the field with 4:35 remaining and needing to score rapidly {{in order to make}} up the 18-point deficit, the game's largest. The Seminoles began their drive with their passing offense, trying three passes in four plays. Quarterback Manuel completed two of those three pass attempts, gaining 37 yards and advancing deep into Virginia Tech territory. A pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech advanced the Seminoles to the Tech 11-yard line, and three rushing plays later, running back Ty Jones crossed the <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> for a touchdown. The score came with 1:40 remaining in the quarter and brought the score to 35–24.|$|E
