25|$|Cahokia, Pre-Columbian North Americas largest {{civic center}} north of Mexico, {{produced}} {{some of the}} finest and most widely spread ceramics. Pottery from the Cahokia site was especially fine, exhibiting smooth surfaces, very thin walls, and distinctive tempering, slips and coloring. Archaeologists have recorded how these qualities changed and evolved through time, and most examples can be pinpointed very accurately within the phases of the sites chronology. Ramey Incised and Powell Plain are two varieties that emerged during the Stirling Phase, and are considered two of the most important local varieties. A distinctive trait of this period is the shell temper. The cores of the sherds are typically a range of greys to buffs and creams. Some have slips of liquid clay and pigment with common colors being red, grey, and black and the surfaces polished to a <b>high</b> <b>sheen.</b> Although their attributes are nearly identical, there are major differences. While the Powell Plain has an unadorned surface, Ramey Incised are burnished and decorated with a series of incised motifs decorating the upper shoulders of the jar most often interpreted as having underworld or water connections. The incised decoration is added when the clay is still wet by tracing a design with a blunt-ended tool. The specific shapes and incised motifs are used to place the artifacts securely into the local chronology. Most have been found in association with high status items fashioned from exotic materials and associated with specialized structures such as mortuaries and temples, and were almost certainly vessels used exclusively by the elites and for ritual purposes. As the influence of the Cahokian religion, lifestyle and trade network expanded outward from its American Bottom origins, examples of its high status pottery went with it. Numerous examples have been found of local imitations of the exotic wares, albeit usually with less technical skill. Examples of Cahokian made or inspired wares have been found as far away as Aztalan in Wisconsin, the Winterville Site in Mississippi. and Fort Ancient sites in Ohio.|$|E

50|$|Texas indigo snakes are {{predominantly}} black in color, with a <b>high</b> <b>sheen</b> which gives their smooth scales a remarkable iridescent hue. Their underside {{is often a}} salmon pink color. They are large snakes, regularly attaining total lengths beyond 6 ft; 8 ft long specimens are not unheard of.|$|E
5000|$|Ultra sheer {{refers to}} very light deniers of {{stockings}} or pantyhose, usually 10 or less. The denier of a stocking {{refers to the}} thickness of the nylon yarn used in the fabric. The greater the denier, the more durable the material and less prone to tearing (or [...] "getting a run"). Ultra sheer stockings have a very light transparency and a <b>high</b> <b>sheen.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{hallmark}} of Chorrera culture is its ceramic traditions, which features whistling {{animal and plant}} effigy Stirrup spout vessels and human figurines made from molds. Everyday utilitarian pottery was still very fine with thin decorated walls and red or black slips polished to a <b>high</b> <b>sheen.</b> Surfaces of bowls, bottles, ollas, and other ceramic pieces were incised, painted, pattern burnished, or decorated with rocker stamps. Ceramics were used in personal adornments as well, examples being ceramic ear spools and rocker stamps used for body painting.|$|E
50|$|Mohair is a silk-like fabric or yarn {{made from}} the hair of the Angora goat. It is both durable and resilient. It is notable for its <b>high</b> luster and <b>sheen,</b> and is often used in fiber blends to add these qualities to a textile. Mohair also takes dye {{exceptionally}} well.|$|R

50|$|Around 1968, Chadwick created {{works that}} used a matt patina {{over some of}} the bronze, but with faces or chests {{burnished}} to a <b>high</b> golden <b>sheen,</b> a technique already seen in works of sculptors including Armitage.This method appeared in Chadwick's Elektras and according to Chadwick stemmed from his desire 'to get a bit of contrast and colour'. In 1973 Chadwick had begun to clothe his figures in pleated drapery - figures often were winged, with billowing cloaks, such as in Pair of Walking Figures - Jubilee 1977. This continued in the 1980s, where works such as High Wind exaggerated the effects of wind. Clothed sitting couples also began to appear on benches, as Chadwick began to explore how far he could push his method towards naturalism.|$|R
5000|$|Creating black ware pottery is a {{long process}} {{consisting}} of many steps requiring patience and skill. Six distinct processes occur before the pot {{is ready to be}} sold. According to Susan Peterson in The Living Tradition of Maria Martinez, these steps include, “finding and collecting the clay, forming a pot, scraping and sanding the pot to remove surface irregularities, applying the iron-bearing slip and burnishing it to a <b>high</b> <b>sheen</b> with a smooth stone, decorating the pot with another slip, and firing the pot." ...|$|E
5000|$|The wood is {{relatively}} hard and dense, {{and is often}} used for firewood. It has very high resistance to rotting {{and can be used}} for fence posts, piers, sleepers. Heartwood dark red, sapwood pale yellow. Very dense, hard, fine grained timber, difficult to work, but polishes to a <b>high</b> <b>sheen.</b> Has been used for furniture, turnery, boat-building, benchtops. Popular as a craft furniture timber during the 1990s and early 2000s, Nicholas Dattner [...] famously used ironbark that had been submerged as a wharf pier for 80 years in a range of tables. At about 1130 kg/m3 {{it is one of the}} few timbers that will not float.|$|E

Mohair takes dye exceptionally well. Mohair is warm in winter as it has excellent insulating properties, while remaining cool in summer due to its moisture wicking properties. It is durable, naturally elastic, flame resistant and crease resistant. It {{is considered to be}} a luxury fiber, like cashmere, angora and silk, and is usually more expensive than most wool that comes from sheep.|$|R
40|$|BP Australia Limited (BP) leased Lots 33 and 34 {{located at}} the corner of Durlacher and Waldeck Street in Geraldton, Western Australia from August 1957 to February 2003. The Site, known at “Junction Auto’s” was sold to Clarisse Holdings (Sovereign Petroleum) in February 2003, with BP later {{acquiring}} Sovereign Petroleum and retaining liability to remediate the Site to comply with commercial/industrial use screening criteria. In April 2007, the Site was closed for decommissioning and remedial works, inclusive of the removal of petroleum infrastructure, excavation to a maximum depth of 6. 5 m BGL, removal of impacted soil, backfilling of clean soil and validation soil samples were completed. The validation samples collected, with the exception of two, were all ‘non detect’. Since decommissioning, the Site has been monitored both on-site and off-site under the bi-annual groundwater monitoring program. Four wells along the North-Western side of the Site continue to yield <b>high</b> TPH/BTEX levels, <b>sheens</b> and strong odours. After reviewing all available historical soil and groundwater data, the source of contamination was found to be along the North-Western border. BP intends to sell the Site for residential development and as such the Site must be remediated. Modelling using BIOSCREEN indicates that contamination above guidelines will remain after 10 years if there is no source removal. A number of techniques were examined for remediating the residual contamination; in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) was scored the highest through a screening matrix. It is recommended that 1680 kg Klozur® CR is required to remove the contamination source and according to the BIOSCREEN modelling, after 5 years the residual plume will be degraded. This project investigation of the torque speed curve was completed and provided an insight into the torque speed characteristics of the Lab-Volt machines. It provides a basis for further experimentation and comparison with other methods available for determining the machine characteristics...|$|R
500|$|The Altar and the Door {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews upon its release. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave it four-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, saying it has a [...] "slightly greater dose of rock" [...] and [...] "Casting Crowns gave fans {{no reason to be}} disappointed on Alter [...] ". Deborah Evans-Price of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars, commenting that [...] "With this new set, [...] Hall and his companions again deliver songs that are musically engaging and lyrically insightful... Few acts more eloquently capture the complexities of being a Christian in today’s tumultuous world, but these fine folks continue to help light the path for the rest of us". Jennifer E. Jones of cbnmusic.com gave it four out of five spins, opining that [...] "There’s a reason why Casting Crowns {{is one of the best}} Christian bands out today, and that reason is evident when you listen to The Altar and The Door. After three albums, lead singer/songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot... The Altar and The Door leaves plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus". Mark Lawrence of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, saying [...] "Traditionally album number three is a defining point in a band's legacy: some bands self implode and produce an album <b>high</b> on production <b>sheen</b> but low on song quality... other bands though go on to produce their masterpiece... The Altar and the Door leans closer to the masterpiece than the flop but leaves you with a sense that they have even greater things to come... The Altar And The Door' is clearly a Casting Crowns album in sound, content and style but this is far from being a negative thing and will appeal to both existing fans as well as draw in new ones". Brian Mansfield gave it two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that [...] " [...] concern themselves with the space between the title’s two fixtures– that is, between intention and action, between doing good and getting in the way, or, as one song puts it, between “the God we want and the God who is.” That’s a space worth exploring, and the band’s motives may be the best, but their anthems are as predictable as a televangelist’s tears: start soft, build big, then cue the strings".|$|R
50|$|These {{lacquers}} {{are also}} used on wooden products, furniture primarily, and on musical instruments and other objects. Nitrocellulose lacquers {{are also used}} to make firework fuses waterproof. The nitrocellulose and other resins and plasticizers are dissolved in the solvent, and each coat of lacquer dissolves some of the previous coat. These lacquers were a huge improvement over earlier automobile and furniture finishes, both in ease of application and in colour retention. The preferred method of applying quick-drying lacquers is by spraying, {{and the development of}} nitrocellulose lacquers led to the first extensive use of spray guns. Nitrocellulose lacquers produce a hard yet flexible, durable finish that can be polished to a <b>high</b> <b>sheen.</b> Drawbacks of these lacquers include the hazardous nature of the solvent, which is flammable and toxic, and the hazards of nitrocellulose in the manufacturing process. Lacquer grade of soluble nitrocellulose is closely related to the more highly nitrated form which is used to make explosives. They become relatively non-toxic after approximately a month since at this point, the lacquer has evaporated most of the solvents used in its production.|$|E
5000|$|The Satin Angora {{is derived}} from cross {{breeding}} between a Satin and a French Angora. This breed is named for the <b>high</b> <b>sheen</b> of the wool, {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "satinized", the hair shaft has a semi-transparent outer shell and reflects light, resulting in deep color, high luster, and extreme soft texture of its wool. It resembles the French Angora, having no furnishings on the face, ears, or feet, and it is also easy to groom compared to the English variety, although the soft texture makes matting an issue, and daily combing is recommended. Satin Angora's wool is said to be stronger for spinning than other varieties of Angora, although it is considered more difficult to spin as it is more slippery.They are shown at ARBA shows using the types [...] "white" [...] and [...] "colored" [...] (broken not yet approved). As with other ARBA shown rabbits, toenails should also be only one color. The color of a Satin Angora is determined by the color of its head, feet, and tail (all the same color).|$|E
5000|$|GameSpot said, [...] "Compact and unspectacular as it is, Zork: Grand Inquisitor is a {{model of}} {{adventure}} gaming as good entertainment. Many of the genre's conventions (FMV, item hunting, absurdist humor) get polished to a <b>high</b> <b>sheen</b> here. It is funny and reflexive without being geeky or pointlessly ironic. The third-string actors exploit their comic trademarks to good effect. Real attention is paid to the pacing of the whole affair, so there are no overly quiet dead zones of tedious activity. And the puzzles are fun to solve rather than gratuitous brain-teasing exercises." [...] Adventure Classic Gaming said, [...] "One of the more distinguished, entertaining games of the last several years, Zork Grand Inquisitor is light and amusing (and in some places, very funny). It strikes a good balance between its tone and subject matter. ... Overall, Zork Grand Inquisitor is the best looking game among the next generation titles of the Zork series. While it is a very good adventure, it is not a very good Zork." [...] Destructoid wrote an article about it in the site's Games Time Forgot series, commenting [...] "Not only is Zork: Grand Inquisitor a clever, well-written adventure game, but it's {{also one of the most}} singularly rewarding games a fan of Zork could ever play." ...|$|E
