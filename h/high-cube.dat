The percentage of <b>high-cube</b> containers is expected to increase from 30% in 2007 to 50% in 2012. Without loading gauge enhancement these larger containers would have to be transported by road or via a longer rail route via London that is already operating at capacity.

2500|$|Container {{capacity}} is often expressed in {{twenty-foot equivalent unit}}s (TEU, or sometimes teu).

According to Wright Investors’ Service, {{at the end of}} 2007, the company {{operated}} a fleet of 114 tractors, 241 <b>high-cube</b> trailers, 3,882 53-foot-high cube containers and 3,177 53-foot chassis to transport truckload freight. They also owned two 736-foot triple-deck, roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ocean-going barges and three 403-foot Triplestack box carriers. Their stock reached an all-time high of $14.75 in 2007.|$|E
50|$|This {{work will}} {{accommodate}} additional freight traffic {{as a result}} of 'Felixstowe South' expansion at the Port of Felixstowe. It will also allow the newer <b>high-cube</b> containers to be carried by train - and the percentage of these containers is expected to increase from 30% in 2007 to 50% in 2012. Network Rail completed the gauge enhancement from Ipswich to Peterborough in 2008. Work should be completed by 2014. at an estimated cost of £291 million.|$|E
50|$|The {{approaches}} to the Lötschberg tunnel were originally single track and have subsequently been doubled. The bridges and tunnels of the line were partly designed to be doubled, but were initially not fully bored or built. Double tracking of the line was completed between 1976 and 1992. At {{the same time the}} tracks were lowered to create a continuous SIM corridor (Simplon Inter-Modal) for a rolling highway (trucks carried on flatcars) and <b>high-cube</b> containers. Also, the passenger train capacity was increased massively.|$|E
50|$|Container {{capacity}} is often expressed in {{twenty-foot equivalent unit}}s (TEU, or sometimes teu). A twenty-foot equivalent unit {{is a measure of}} containerized cargo capacity equal to one standard 20 ft long container. This is an approximate measure, wherein the height of the box is not considered. For example, the 9 ft tall <b>high-cube,</b> as well as 4 ft half-height 20 ft containers are equally counted as one TEU. Similarly, extra long 45 ft containers are commonly designated as two TEU, no different than standard 40 ft long units. Two TEU are equivalent to one forty-foot equivalent unit (FEU).|$|E
5000|$|The National Docks Secondary is an {{integral}} component in the anticipated expansion of the Liberty Corridor [...] and Cross Harbor Freight Movement projects, including the intermodal container transhipment operations {{on the west side}} of the Upper New York Bay in the Port of New York and New Jersey. To that end, as of 2010, the track is being restored, tunnel clearances increased, and redundant overhead bridges removed to allow double stacking of the <b>high-cube</b> containers increasingly favored for intermodal transportation. The line will connect with ExpressRail Port Jersey, a ship-to-rail container transfer operation, planned to open in 2014, and to the planned new post-Panamax container terminal at MOTBY.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, ChevyVan {{received}} a major redesign, moving the engine {{forward of the}} driver with a short nose and hood. The van was constructed of a unibody style frame and employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-Arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 Ford Econoline. Suspension and steering parts came from the Chevrolet C/K. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name. These models between 78 and 95 were popular with Van conversions such as Curtis and Starcraft. In addition to the cab-chassis models, there were also factory cube vans from Chevy and GMC, called the Chevy <b>High-Cube</b> or Hi-Cube, and GMC MagnaVan.|$|E
50|$|To {{accommodate}} EUR-pallets, {{there are}} derivative intermodal containers {{that are about}} 2 in wider — these {{are commonly known as}} “pallet-wide” containers. These containers feature an internal width of 2440 mm for easy loading of two 1200 mm long pallets side by side - many sea shipping providers in Europe allow these, as overhangs on standard containers are sufficient to fit them in the usual interlock spaces. Especially the 45 ft pallet-wide <b>high-cube</b> shortsea container has gained wide acceptance, as these containers can replace the A-Behälter swap bodies with a length of 13670 mm that are common for truck transport in Europe. The EU has started a standardization for pallet-wide containerization in the EILU (European Intermodal Loading Unit) initiative.|$|E

50|$|A.J. Thrall {{established}} the Union Wagon Company in 1916, selling used and reconditioned rail car components. This became the Thrall Car Manufacturing Company in 1917. By mid-century, {{under the leadership}} of Richard L. Duchossois, the company focused on building specialized freight cars, such as <b>high-cube</b> boxcars for auto parts, all-door boxcars for building products, gondolas, rotary-dump gondolas for coal, bulkhead flatcars and centerbeam flatcars for lumber, double-stack container cars, covered hoppers, autorack cars and single-level trailer cars. In the 1980s, Thrall acquired five competing railcar manufacturers, including autorack builders Whitehead & Kales and Portec, and became the largest such manufacturer of these cars in the United States. In 1984, Duchossois purchased the remaining shares of the company owned by the Thrall family, and the company then operated as part of Duchossois Industries. In the 1990s, Thrall had a production capacity of over 16,000 freight cars per year, with more than 3,000 employees.|$|E
40|$|How can {{technology}} {{be better}} utilized to meet socioeconomic needs? Technological change {{is closely related}} to societal change. At the level of the firm, technology is a tool to achieve and sustain competitive advantage but radical innovation is system oriented and involves infrastructure. The paramount role of information technology has to be emphasised. Two new concepts are emerging; Just in Time/Total Quality Control (JIT/TQC) and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). So-called value-added-networks or VANs are catching on in Western countries. The bottlenecks are the costs, the externalities, the lack of standardization, and the system incoherence. Brief case-studies are developed: the new generation of m�tros, high speed trains, the motor industry, and intermodalism with utilization of <b>High-Cube</b> containers. The findings of these studies show that organizational innovation has to go along with technological innovation. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUnder the {{contemporary}} conditions of permanent construction complication, {{the volume of}} reinforce-concrete structures {{that are in the}} process of exploitation of building function in the conditions of difficult loading is growing: they are exposed to the slanting bend, twisting and dynamic influences. These structures include foundations and ceilings of productive buildings installed with the use of vibrating equipment (flatting mills, press, metal-working machine-tools), beams for a faucet, highway coverage, bridge elements, air strips of the air fields, body elements of hydro energetic objects. The complex loaded structures shall meet the stringent requirements not only in terms of bending and compression resistance but also in terms of structural integrity maintenance (crack resistance). In case of the technological process change or formation of defects and damages, repair of these elements is not possible – they can be only replaced, and this will demand to stop the production, sort out a <b>high-cube</b> of reinforced-concrete structures and, consequently, lead to material expenses comparable with a new building construction. An increase of the exploitation term of the complex loaded reinforce-concrete structures is a topical and economically demanded research...|$|E
