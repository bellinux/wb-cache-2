Geochemistry allows geologists to determine levels of association between igneous units: in the Karoo Province of southern Africa, large volumes of rhyolite along the continental margin were produced <b>from</b> <b>melts</b> with initially basaltic compositions. Xenoliths of mantle material can carry information about the ultimate source of a magma, as well as reveal heterogeneities within the magma mixing and assimilation of host magmas at depth. Gabbro fractionation allows geologists to determine the smallest possible mass of concealed material. Studies of geomorphology in the Karoo Province have identified regional uplift, associated with the underplating and consequent thickening of the crust.|$|E

40|$|Conditions for {{crystallization}} of calcite <b>from</b> <b>melts</b> in {{the presence}} of a vapor or gaseous phase are reviewed to provide possible guidelines for growth of calcite. Phase equilibrium data for the system CaO-CO_ 2 show that to precipitate calcite from molten CaCO_ 3 the temperature must be above 1230 ° C and excess CO 2 must be present at pressures greater than 39. 5 bars. Phase equilibrium data for the system CaO-CO_ 2 -H_ 2 O show that calcite can be precipitated <b>from</b> <b>melts</b> at 650 °C {{in the presence}} of an aqueous vapor phase at 10 bars or more. Crystallization can be induced either by introducing temperature variations, or by changing the composition of the coexisting aqueous vapor phase under isobaric, isothermal conditions.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} {{the conditions under which}} crystals can retain morphological stability, i. e., shape stability of the advancing interface, during growth from vapors was studied. Morphological stability (MS) is a necessary condition for the growth of homogeneous single crystals required for numerous device applications. For crystallization <b>from</b> <b>melts,</b> the MS concepts are well developed and are essentially based on heat and mass transfer conditions about the advancing interface. For crystallization from vapors, the MS requirements are more complex and not well understood. The added complexity arises from the fact that anisotropies in interfacial kinetics are typically stronger in crystallization from vapors than <b>from</b> <b>melts.</b> These pronounced anisotropies root in the distinctly lower atomic roughness of most vapor-solid interfaces...|$|E

40|$|On {{the island}} of Mustique, fresh and propylitized olivine () clinopyroxene basalt, {{plagioclase}} () clinopyroxene () orthopyroxene and plagioclase () clinopyroxeneamphibole andesite lavas and minor intrusions are interbedded with Oligocene pyroclastic and epiclastic rocks. Chemical data show that two isotopically identical, but chemically different, suites of lava are present: (i) the OPXS (87 Sr/ 86 Sr 0. 70403 - 70454; 143 Nd/ 144 Nd 0. 512952 () 0. 512986; d 18 Ocpx 5. 49 and 5. 61), comprising basalts and orthopyroxene-bearing andesites; and (ii) the AMPHS (87 Sr/ 86 Sr 0. 70401 - 513037; d 18 Ocpx 5. 54), made up of basalts and amphibole-bearing andesites. The OPXS has higher contents of TiO 2, P 2 O 5, light rare earth elements, Sm, Pb, Th, U, Zr, Y and Nb, and higher La/Yb ratios than the AMPHS. The isotopic data suggest that both suites formed <b>from</b> <b>melts</b> derived from the same subduction-modified depleted mantle source as the volcanic rocks of nearby St Vincent and Bequia, and the northern islands of the Lesser Antilles Arc. The immobile trace element contents, and La/Yb ratios, of the OPXS are indicative of ~ 10 % partial melting of the source, whereas those of the AMPHS are indicative of ~ 25 % partial melting. The within-suite chemical variation of the OPXS is consistent with ~ 45 % fractional crystallization of its intratelluric mineral assemblages, {{and that of the}} AMPHS is consistent with the removal of ~ 65 % of its intratelluric assemblages. Experimental evidence suggests that both suites of basalt crystallized at pressures < 8 kbar <b>from</b> <b>melts</b> containing 1 - 2 wt% water. After extensive fractional crystallization, the andesites crystallized at pressures between approximately 5 and 2 kbar. The OPXS magmas appear to have lost more of their water content than the AMPHS magmas. Thus, the OPXS andesites formed <b>from</b> <b>melts</b> with an estimated water content of 2 - 3 wt%, whereas the AMPHS andesites formed <b>from</b> <b>melts</b> containing at least 4. 5 wt% water...|$|E
