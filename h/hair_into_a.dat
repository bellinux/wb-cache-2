5|$|On 21 July 1645, after Jiangnan {{had been}} superficially pacified, Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict {{ordering}} all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid {{the rest of}} their <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> queue identical to those of the Manchus. The punishment for non-compliance was death. This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe. For Han officials and literati, however, the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one's body intact), whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their virility. Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest. The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming general Li Chengdong (李成東; d. 1649), respectively on August 24 and September 22. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐; d. 1667) massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing in the Lower Yangtze. A few committed loyalists became hermits, hoping that for lack of military success, their withdrawal from the world would at least symbolize their continued defiance against foreign rule.|$|E
25|$|Like all Qing officials, Chen had {{to shave}} his {{forehead}} and arrange his <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> queue like the Manchus, and to adopt the Qing court dress, which featured smaller sleeves and a shorter sash than the Ming court style, as befitted {{the status of the}} Manchus as horseback-riding warriors.|$|E

At The Great American Bash on July 24, 2005, Animal and Heidenreich {{defeated}} MNM {{to win the}} WWE Tag Team Championship in a match personally dedicated by Animal to Hawk. After winning the titles Heidenreich changed his appearance, to a look that better suited the Legion of Doom image by shaving his <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mohawk and wearing face paint.|$|E

25|$|Mother and {{daughter}} both wear long white sundresses. The elegant presentation, {{which also includes}} a straw hat for each and a parasol for the mother, {{is typical of the}} fashion of the time, around 1910. The 19-year-old Maria has a simple floor-length dress that emphasizes her slender silhouette. At the neck the dress is finished with a stand-up collar. The tight-fitting sleeves contrast {{with the rest of the}} dress, and are of a more transparent white cloth, through which shines the skin. Of similar fabric is an panel of cloth mounted below the chest on a large ring. The sea wind blows the cloth into arabesques behind the daughter. Under the dress appears a brown leather shoe; on its side reflections emphasize the smooth surface. In her right hand Maria holds a yellow straw hat with a wide, sweeping brim, decorated with purple colored flowers and a turquoise bow. She has pinned her brown <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> knot, so that her face comes into its own.|$|E
500|$|When Kirk and Spock are {{traveling}} {{on a public}} bus, they encounter a punk rocker blaring his music on a boom box, to the discomfort of everyone around him. Spock takes matters {{into his own hands}} and performs a Vulcan nerve pinch. Part of the inspiration for the scene came from Nimoy's personal experiences with a similar character on the streets of New York; [...] " [...] by the arrogance of it, the aggressiveness of it, and I thought if I was Spock I'd pinch his brains out!" [...] On learning about the scene, Kirk Thatcher, an associate producer on the film, convinced Nimoy to let him play the role; Thatcher shaved his <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mohawk and bought clothes to complete the part. Credited as [...] "punk on bus", Thatcher (along with sound designer Mark Mangini) also wrote and recorded [...] "I Hate You", the song in the scene, and it was his idea to have the punk—rendered unconscious by the pinch—hit the stereo and turn it off with his face.|$|E
500|$|From 1643 to 1650, {{political}} power lay {{mostly in the}} hands of Dorgon. Under his leadership, the Qing Empire conquered most of the territory of the fallen Ming dynasty (1368–1644), chased Ming loyalist regimes deep into the southwestern provinces, and established the basis of Qing rule over China despite highly unpopular policies such as the [...] "hair cutting command" [...] of 1645, which forced Qing subjects to shave their forehead and braid their remaining <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> queue resembling that of the Manchus. After Dorgon's death {{on the last day of}} 1650, the young Shunzhi Emperor started to rule personally. He tried, with mixed success, to fight corruption and to reduce the political influence of the Manchu nobility. In the 1650s, he faced a resurgence of Ming loyalist resistance, but by 1661 his armies had defeated the Qing Empire's last enemies, seafarer Koxinga (1624–1662) and the Prince of Gui (1623–1662) of the Southern Ming dynasty, both of whom would succumb the following year. The Shunzhi Emperor died at the age of 22 of smallpox, a highly contagious disease that was endemic in China, but against which the Manchus had no immunity. He was succeeded by his third son Xuanye, who had already survived smallpox, and who reigned for sixty years under the era name [...] "Kangxi" [...] (hence he was known as the Kangxi Emperor). Because fewer documents have survived from the Shunzhi era than from later eras of the Qing dynasty, the Shunzhi era is a relatively little-known period of Qing history.|$|E

5000|$|During her 2006 and 2007 tours, Stevie Nicks {{performed}} [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] as her encore. For this number, {{she changed}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> black dress and styled her <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> up-do to resemble Belle from the 1946 film. Footage {{from the film}} played in the background as well while she performed. Due to issues obtain copyrights for the 1946 film, a performance of the song was cut from the final edit of her 2009 Live in Chicago DVD. Instead, a new studio version recorded in Nashville in January 2008 appears on the accompanying album, The Soundstage Sessions.|$|R
500|$|It was {{recorded}} {{that during the}} Yuan dynasty, envoys were sent to Long Ya Men in 1320 to obtain tame elephants. The people of Long Ya Men then returned in 1325 with a tribute and trade mission to China. In around 1330, the traveller Wang Dayuan {{was said to have}} sailed through this passageway. In his travelogue Daoyi Zhilüe, he recorded that Long Ya Men was the two hills of Temasek between which a strait runs, and it was so called because the two hills looked like [...] "Dragon's teeth". Wang described the people of Long Ya Men as being prone to acts of piracy, and that while the natives traded with Chinese from Quanzhou, Chinese junks on their way back from the Western Oceans (西洋) may be met by pirates there who attacked with two to three hundred perahus (boats). He mentioned that in olden times a chief there found a jewelled head-dress while digging in the ground, and that [...] "the beginning of the year is calculated from the [...] rising of the moon, when the chief put on this head-gear and wore his [...] dress". [...] He also said the natives would [...] "gather their <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> chignon, and wear short cotton bajus girded about with black cotton sarongs". The description of the people may be the first known record of the Orang Laut who inhabited the region. A different settlement called Ban Zu (班卒), described as being located on a hill behind Long Ya Men, is thought to be a transcription of the Malay Pancur and may be today's Fort Canning Hill.|$|E
2500|$|The Qing dynasty's {{order that}} all {{subjects}} shave their forehead and braid {{the rest of}} their <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> queue was viewed as a symbolic gesture of servitude by many Han Chinese, who thought that changing their dress to the same as Yi would be contrary to the spirit of [...] "Hua-Yi zhi bian." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Bickle {{decides to}} assassinate Senator Palantine, he cuts his <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Mohawk. This detail was {{suggested}} by actor Victor Magnotta, {{a friend of}} Scorsese's who had a small role as a Secret Service agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: [...] "Magnotta had talked about certain types of soldiers going into the jungle. They cut their hair in a certain way; looked like a Mohawk ... and you knew that was a special situation, a commando kind of situation, and people gave them wide berths ... {{we thought it was}} a good idea." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Uncanny X-Men #173, October 1983, Claremont {{and artist}} Paul Smith {{created a new}} look for Storm, abandoning her old costume for black leather top and pants, and {{changing}} her former veil of white <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> punk mohawk. The change in appearance {{was inspired by the}} decision of colleague Walt Simonson to shave off his beard and mustache while on vacation with his wife, X-Men editor Louise Simonson. Upon their return, Simonson's daughter, Julie, upset at her father's new appearance, ran from the room. When the editors decided to change Storm's appearance, Smith submitted a number of designs to them, explaining in a 2008 interview: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Red Horn Mythic Cycle is {{from the}} Ho Chunk, or Winnebago people. The mythic cycle of Red Horn and his sons has certain analogies with the Hero Twins mythic cycle of Mesoamerica. Redhorn was known by many names, {{including}} [...] "Morning Star", a reference to his celestial origin, and [...] "He who is Struck with Deer Lungs," [...] a possible reference to the Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif. In the episode associated with this name, Red Horn turns into an arrow to win a race. After winning the race, Redhorn creates heads on his earlobes and makes his <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> long red braid.

2500|$|After Skunk Anansie split, Skin {{released}} her debut solo album Fleshwounds.

She even ditched her trademark bald look and grew her <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> boyish crop. [...] While the album was not a massive success in the UK, two singles were released from it: [...] "Trashed" [...] and [...] "Faithfulness". [...] "Lost", a double A-Side with [...] "Getting Away With It", was a planned third single but was pulled shortly before release; promo CDs were sent out to radio stations but it received no airplay. Elsewhere in Europe the album's success was greater. For example, in Italy it peaked at Number 6 in the album chart and in Germany at Number 18.|$|E
2500|$|Carl Streator is {{the protagonist}} of Lullaby. Over {{the course of the}} novel, a few {{important}} aspects of his character are revealed that play a part in his narration style and his character. Firstly, he imparts to us at the beginning of Chapter 2 that he is a journalist. Because the novel is set up as a frame story, the majority of Lullaby is written as a retelling by Streator himself. [...] This is apparent throughout the novel as he describes the people and events around him. He will often recount a person’s appearance in terms of 'the details': [...] "The details of Nash are, he’s a big guy in a white uniform. He wears high-top white track shoes and gathers his <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> little palm tree at the crown of his head" [...] (p.25).|$|E
2500|$|After {{having been}} {{popular with the}} fans from early on, in the final months of his title reign, Backlund changed his image, cutting his moppish <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> crewcut, wearing amateur wrestling singlets and losing muscle mass and definition. Fans {{seemingly}} grew weary of this [...] "Howdy Doody" [...] character (as The Grand Wizard had dubbed him). In 1983, he was voted the Wrestling Observer Newsletters Most Overrated Wrestler. Vincent K. McMahon, who had bought the WWF from his father, wanted to put the title on the more charismatic and muscular Hulk Hogan. McMahon initially suggested Backlund to turn heel and lose to Hogan, but when Backlund refused, a transitional champion became necessary between Backlund and Hogan. Backlund sustained a (kayfabe) injury when The Iron Sheik assaulted him with his Persian clubs and on December 26, 1983, Backlund lost the title to Sheik when Backlund's manager, Arnold Skaaland, threw in the towel while Backlund was locked in the camel clutch.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately after Desert Fury, Wallis {{began work}} on Deadlock, the {{original}} project name for Beggars Are Coming to Town. Again Miller would be cast with Desert Furys Burt Lancaster and Wendell Corey. After weeks of rehearsals on the Modjeska Canyon location, {{under the direction of}} Byron Haskin, Miller suddenly became the second leading lady. Lizabeth Scott, ever competitive with all actresses, grabbed the Kay role for herself. Miller later recalled, [...] "(Wallis) planned to star me in 'I Walk Alone.' He tested me with Burt; it was a wonderful test. But then Lizabeth Scott decided she wanted the role, and Lizabeth got whatever she wanted—from Hal Wallis! [...] So, I got the second part instead." [...] The 21-year-old Miller was recast as the slumming socialite divorcée, Alexis Richardson. Miller was afraid that playing a [...] "meanie" [...] role might typecast her. She was also forced to cut her 22-inch <b>hair</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> shorter chignon. In designing Miller's wardrobe, Edith Head was impressed by Miller's physique, describing it as [...] "the most exciting figure since Betty Grable." [...] The resulting film was renamed I Walk Alone (1948). Shooting took place early December 1946–mid-February 1947. The film was released January 16, 1948. She was 5th-billed after Kirk Douglas. Despite Miller's fears of being typecast as a femme fatale, film historians tend to typecast her [...] "as always playing the 'good girl.'" [...] Typecasting reflected real life as Miller's name seldom appeared in gossip columns and when it did, never involved scandal. Though Miller participated in the Hollywood dating circuit, the one name that invariably appeared in the press was William Haskel Schuyler, a television pioneer and consultant based in San Francisco. In late November 1947, it was announced that Miller and Schuyler would wed. But the marriage was postponed.|$|E
