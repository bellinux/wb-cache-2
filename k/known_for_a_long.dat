5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust {{has been}} <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk {{of workers in}} a chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E

Edward Jenner had also studied vaccination using cowpox (Vaccinia) to give cross-immunity to smallpox in the late 1790s, and by the early 1800s vaccination had spread to most of Europe.|$|E

25|$|Natural {{processes}} {{can have}} a distinct recurrent behaviour, e.g. periodicities (as seasonal or Milankovich cycles), but also irregular cyclicities (as El Niño Southern Oscillation). Moreover, the recurrence of states, in the meaning that states are again arbitrarily close after some time of divergence, is a fundamental property of deterministic dynamical systems and is typical for nonlinear or chaotic systems (cf. Poincaré recurrence theorem). The recurrence of states in nature has been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time and has also been discussed in early work (e.g. Henri Poincaré 1890).|$|E
25|$|Vytenis died ca. 1315 {{without an}} heir. The {{circumstances}} surrounding his death are not <b>known.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time Russian historians {{claimed that he}} was struck by lightning. However, that was a mistake of a Russian scribe: it was an inadequate translation of Teutonic propaganda that Gediminas killed his master Vytenis and usurped his throne. Vytenis is mentioned for the last time in September 1315 during the unsuccessful Siege of Christmemel, the first castle built by the Teutonic Knights on the right bank of the Neman River. Historians know of only one son of Vytenis, Žvelgutis (Swalegote), who possibly died before his father. Such a situation allowed Gediminas, brother of Vytenis, to become the Grand Duke of Lithuania. During his reign the Grand Duchy became a major military and political power in the Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|In extratropical Eurasia and the Americas {{almost all}} song is {{produced}} by male birds; however in the tropics and {{to a greater extent}} the desert belts of Australia and Africa it is more typical for females to sing as much as males. These differences have been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time and are generally attributed to the much less regular and seasonal climate of Australian and African arid zones requiring that birds breed at any time when conditions are favourable, although they cannot breed in many years because food supply never increases above a minimal level. With aseasonal irregular breeding, both sexes must be brought into breeding condition and vocalisation, especially duetting, serves this purpose. The high frequency of female vocalisations in the tropics, Australia and Southern Africa may also relate to very low mortality rates producing much stronger pair-bonding and territoriality.|$|E

25|$|Clustering {{of genes}} in prokaryotes was <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. Their genes are grouped in operons, genes within operons {{share a common}} {{promoter}} unit. These genes are mostly functionally related. The genome of prokaryotes is relatively very simple and compact. In eukaryotes the genome is huge and {{only a small amount}} of it are functionally genes, furthermore the genes are not arranged in operons. Except for nematodes and trypanosomes; although their operons are different from the prokaryotic operons. In eukaryotes each gene has a transcription regulation site of its own. Therefore, genes don’t have to be in close proximity to be co-expressed. Therefore, it was long assumed that eukaryotic genes were randomly distributed across the genome due to the high rate of chromosome rearrangements. But because the complete sequence of genomes became available it became possible to absolutely locate a gene and measure its distance to other genes.|$|E
25|$|The {{classic example}} of {{targeted}} development is imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), a small molecule which inhibits a signaling molecule kinase. The genetic abnormality causing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{time to be a}} chromosomal translocation creating an abnormal fusion protein, kinase BCR-ABL, which signals aberrantly, leading to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemia cells. Imatinib precisely inhibits this kinase. Unlike so many other anti-cancer agents, this pharmaceutical was no accident. Brian Druker, working in Oregon Health & Science University, had extensively researched the abnormal enzyme kinase in CML. He reasoned that precisely inhibiting this kinase with a drug would control the disease and have little effect on normal cells. Druker collaborated with Novartis chemist Nicholas Lydon, who developed several candidate inhibitors. From these, imatinib was found to have the most promise in laboratory experiments. First Druker and then other groups worldwide demonstrated that when this small molecule is used to treat patients with chronic-phase CML, 90% achieve complete haematological remission. It is hoped that molecular targeting of similar defects in other cancers will have the same effect.|$|E
500|$|Weak results {{hinting that}} the clique problem {{might be hard}} to {{approximate}} have been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. [...] observed that, {{because of the fact}} that the clique number takes on small integer values and is NP-hard to compute, it cannot have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. If too accurate an approximation were available, rounding its value to an integer would give the exact clique number. However, little more was known until the early 1990s, when several authors began to make connections between the approximation of maximum cliques and probabilistically checkable proofs. They used these connections to prove hardness of approximation results for the maximum clique problem.|$|E

500|$|Water-insoluble chromium(III) {{compounds}} and chromium metal {{are not considered}} a health hazard, while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of chromium(VI) have been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. [...] Because of the specific transport mechanisms, only limited amounts of chromium(III) enter the cells. Several in vitro studies indicated that high concentrations of chromium(III) in the cell can lead to DNA damage. Acute oral toxicity ranges between 1.5 and 3.3mg/kg. A 2008 review suggested that moderate uptake of chromium(III) through dietary supplements poses no genetic-toxic risk. In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.5mg/m3, time-weighted average. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 250mg/m3.|$|E
