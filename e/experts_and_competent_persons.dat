40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{information}} acquisition strategies of <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>competent</b> non-expert intensive care physicians during two simulated diagnostic scenarios involving respiratory distress in an infant. Specifically, the information acquisition performance of six <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> 12 <b>competent</b> non-experts was examined using an eye tracker during the initial 90 seconds of the assessment of the patient. The results indicated that, in comparison to competent non-experts, experts recorded longer mean fixations, irrespective of the scenario. When the dwell times were examined against specific areas of interest, the results revealed that competent non-experts recorded greater overall dwell times on the nurse, where experts recorded relatively greater dwell times on the head and face of the manikin. In the context of the scenarios, experts recorded differential dwell times, spending relatively more time on the head and face during the seizure scenario than during the coughing scenario. The differences evident between <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>competent</b> non-experts were interpreted as evidence of the relative availability of task-specific cues or heuristics in memory that might direct the process of information acquisition amongst expert physicians.

40|$|Empirical {{investigations}} of cognitive skill acquisition have generally focused on differences between novice <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> operators. The {{result is a}} neglect of the intermediate stage of skill acquisition in which operators progress through competence towards expert performance. This study investigated the qualitative and quantitative differences in the cognitive cues generated by <b>competent</b> <b>and</b> <b>expert</b> firefighters. Participants first read a written, firefighting-related decision scenario before listing the cues that they considered relevant in formulating a decision. The results revealed that experts generated significantly more cues than competent operators.

These outcomes suggest that differences exist between the cues that are employed by <b>expert</b> <b>and</b> <b>competent</b> operators during decision-making, and that these differences reflect a qualitative change in information processing that occurs during the transition from competence to expertise. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Fire {{safety in}} {{buildings}} {{can not be}} underestimated given the grave losses associated with fire incidences. Legislation has been a useful means of ensuring fire safety in buildings, and in England and Wales, the recent introduction of the Regulatory Reform Fire Safety Order (FSO) 2005 has been mentioned {{to be a positive}} progression in fire safety standards. However, since its enactment, compliance with the legislation especially among micro and small organisations continues to trail behind expectation. Given that micro and small organisations constitute an enormous proportion of UK organisations and the success of legislation depends on compliance, it is essential to investigate the reasons behind this low compliance. This research thus sought to explore the potential reasons for this situation by the use of qualitative interviews conducted with key duty-holders of the legislation: the enforcing authority; responsible persons; <b>and</b> <b>competent</b> <b>persons.</b> The study reveals that low awareness of the FSO in micro and small organisations {{is at the heart of}} the low compliance. Also the lack of a recognised formal qualification system for <b>competent</b> <b>persons</b> makes it difficult for responsible <b>persons</b> to appoint <b>competent</b> <b>persons.</b> Beyond this, micro and small organisations prefer to conduct in-house fire risk assessments despite the danger of the lack of understanding of construction materials and technical issues of Fire Safety by responsible persons. This preference is due to the financial burden of engaging a <b>competent</b> <b>person.</b> Furthermore, reduced contact between businesses/building owners and the fire service under the FSO could also be undermining its compliance. Although it can be argued that the FSO is fairly new and as such it requires time to be fully grasped by organisations, the insight provided by this study is useful in the early identification of potentially problematic areas for early redressing...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{extensive}} use of mini-excavators in construction presents a significant health and safety risk from their tendency to become unstable, or in the extreme to roll-over, under certain working conditions. No standard exists to specifically assess excavator stability, so {{the purpose of this}} paper is to document the development and trial of a series of practical field tests designed to achieve this. Design/methodology/approach – Tests were designed in collaboration with a group of plant <b>experts</b> <b>and</b> <b>competent</b> operators. The tests were subsequently trialled by applying them to four mini-excavators, the aim being to see if these plant items could be reliably assessed in terms of their stability characteristics. Results of the study were presented to H&S experts for comment. Findings – The tests were able to assess mini-excavator stability. For each machine, five “stability criteria” were scored thereby producing an overall score, by which mini-excavator stability could be conveniently represented. Research implications – No previous field test research has been identified in this area. The results produced here may go some way towards developing an international standard for on-site stability tests. Practical implications – The tests are easy to apply at the work site so long as performed by <b>competent</b> <b>persons</b> under appropriately risk-assessed and risk controlled conditions; and if disseminated to industry, could act as a means of standardising mini-excavator stability tests until such time an International Standard becomes available.
