5|$|Maneater {{is one of}} the few {{films in}} the series to break the {{standard}} formula of Syfy natural horror films with its use of a normal, living tiger rather than a CG animal or excusing its behavior by having <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mutant or genetically altered. Critics heavily panned the film citing substandard acting, heavy use of stereotypical characters, a hole-filled plot, unused subplots, and the use of a live tiger resulting in almost all attacks being implied rather than seen.|$|E
5|$|Whether <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{depression}} in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoon trough, a broad surface front, or an outflow boundary, a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis. About 85 to 90percent of Pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough. Even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability, {{the lack of a}} surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low. Vertical wind shear of less than 10m/s (20kn, 33ft/s) between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development. Typically with Pacific typhoons, there are two outflow jets: one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the Westerlies, and a second towards the equator.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{research}} done, it is {{concluded that}} children exposed to extensive vocabulary and complex grammatical structures more quickly develop language and also have a more accurate syntax than children raised in environments without complex grammar exposed to them.

Indeed, raising of the forelegs appears to have this 'stop-sign' effect even in encounters between congenerics of the three Phidippus species.

25|$|For marching band, schools {{compete against}} other {{schools in the}} same UIL conference. The 33 regions are grouped into seven areas for Class 5A and 6A schools, and five areas for Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A schools. All schools of all classes compete in region {{competition}} annually, as a fall semester activity. However, in even-numbered years schools in Class 4A and Class 6A can advance from region to area and state, and in odd-numbered years schools from Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 5A can advance from region to area and state. In order for bands to advance from Region to Area, {{they need to get}} an overall Division 1 from at least two Region judges, whether <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> 1-2-1, 2-1-1, 1-1-2, etc... the bands then will advance to the Area Competition. In order to make State, the band needs {{to make it to the}} Area Final competition AND make it to the top 3-5 bands to get to State. The Area and State winner is the school with the lowest ordinal score when the rankings from each judge are tabulated. For example, School 1 receives a first place score from three judges, a second place score from the fourth judge, and a fourth place score from the fifth judge. The ordinal score for School 1 is 9 (1+1+1+2+4). School 2 receives two first place scores and three second place scores. The ordinal score for School 2 is 8 (2+2+2+1+1). School 2 would be the champion despite receiving fewer first place scores because School 2's ordinal score is lower than School 1's. Thus, overall placement in the caption area for each judge is more important than the raw score awarded by the judge.|$|E
