5|$|South African {{track and}} field athletes won a {{combined}} 17 medals at the Games, four gold, seven silver and six bronze. Sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who carried the nation's flag at the opening ceremony, was the most successful South African athlete winning individual gold in the T44 400 metres, gold in the 4×100 metres relay T42-46, setting world records in both, and individual silver in the T44 200 metres. In the 200 metres event Pistorius set a new world record in his heat, but he was defeated in the final by Brazilian Alan Oliveira. After the race Pistorius raised an <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> the length of Oliveira's blades, he later apologised for the timing of his remarks, but not the content of his complaint. The IPC confirmed the length of Oliveira’s blades were proportional to his body and legal, but expressed willingness to engage with Pistorius about the issue.|$|E

25|$|The {{blessing of}} {{same-sex}} marriages and same-sex unions is an <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> which Christian churches are in ongoing disagreement. These disagreements are primarily {{centered on the}} interpretation of various scripture passages related to homosexuality, and in some churches on varying understandings of homosexuality in terms of psychology, genetics and other scientific data. While various Church bodies have widely varying practices and teachings, individual Christians of every major tradition are involved in practical (orthopraxy) discussions about {{how to respond to}} the issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> measuring spin along different axes is {{that these}} measurements cannot have definite values at the same time―they are incompatible {{in the sense that}} these measurements' maximum simultaneous precision is constrained by the uncertainty principle. This is contrary to what is found in classical physics, where any number of properties can be measured simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy. It has been proven mathematically that compatible measurements cannot show Bell-inequality-violating correlations, and thus entanglement is a fundamentally non-classical phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Olivier Blanchard {{suggests}} that a fiscal union in the EZ can mitigate devastating effects of the single currency on the EZ peripheral countries. But he adds that the currency bloc will not work perfectly even if a fiscal transfer system is built, because, he argues, the fundamental <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> competitiveness adjustment is not tackled. The problem is, since the EZ peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, {{they are forced to}} adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.|$|E

25|$|The {{historian}} Carl Leban attributes Cao Cao's {{victory to}} one single strategic decision — the defender's choice of location. Leban asserts that Cao Cao chose Guandu {{as the place}} to make his stand because of his superior understanding {{of the relation between}} topography, logistics, and tactics over Yuan Shao. It was the <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> logistics that prompted Cao Cao to abandon the defence at the Yellow River. By luring Yuan Shao far south into Guandu, Cao Cao had forcibly extended Yuan Shao's supply lines and was thus able to pounce on his logistical disadvantage to gain a decisive victory.|$|E
25|$|Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) {{overturned}} {{a monopoly}} {{granted by the}} New York state legislature to certain steamships operating between New York and New Jersey. Daniel Webster argued that the Constitution, by empowering Congress to regulate interstate commerce, implied that states {{do not have any}} concurrent power to regulate interstate commerce. Chief Justice Marshall avoided that <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> the exclusivity of the federal commerce power because that issue was not necessary to decide the case. Instead, Marshall relied on an actual, existing federal statute for licensing ships, and he held that that federal law was a legitimate exercise of the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce, so the federal law superseded the state law granting the monopoly.|$|E

25|$|To many Brazilians at that time, the {{greatest}} <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> their elections was {{their belief that}} the illiterate didn't have capacity to vote, {{on the grounds that}} the illiterate were unaware of the notion of the meaning of a representative government, of the choice of somebody as its representative and were easily corruptible, usually selling their votes. To Pedro II, the best way to resolve the problem about the electoral fraud was not restricting the right to vote but, instead, improving education in the country. Even so, Brazil was capable of keeping uninterrupted elections from 1822 to 1889, strengthening the electoral process, as well the representative system, a record matched in the Americas only by the United States and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Small was {{involved}} {{in one of the}} most controversial incidents in early cricket history when Hambledon played Chertsey at Laleham Burway on 23 & 24 September 1771. Hambledon won the match by 1 wicket. It was in this game that Chertsey's Thomas White used a bat that was as wide as the wicket, possibly in an attempt to force an <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> the width of the new straight bats that had recently replaced the old curved sticks. Whether that was White's intention is unclear but his action ensured that a new rule was passed which limited the width to 4.25inches. This rule supported a written motion presented by Hambledon bowler Thomas Brett that was counter-signed by club captain Richard Nyren and senior batsman Small. The original of Brett's memorandum, bearing Small's signature, is maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club in its museum at Lord's.|$|E
25|$|There had {{for many}} years been a {{controversial}} <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> the apparent inability of players from Yorkshire's large ethnic minority population {{to make their way}} at the club. Tendulkar was the first Asian player to represent Yorkshire, but he was an overseas player. It was not until 2003 that Dewsbury's Ismail Dawood became the first British-born Asian to play for Yorkshire. He was followed by Ajmal Shahzad and Adil Rashid who have both represented England. In 2007, Azeem Rafiq as a member of Yorkshire's academy team became the first player of an Asian background to captain England at any level when he was appointed U15s captain. In the summer of 2012, Rafiq stepped in for the injured Andrew Gale to captain the team in 6 T20 matches, becoming the first player of Asia origin to lead the county, as well as the youngest captain in the clubs history.|$|E

25|$|There is an unsolved <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> {{his final}} rank. Sources like the {{promotion}} recommendations from Generals Hardee and Johnston speak for a promotion from Major to Lieutenant Colonel in early 1864. There are several authors who {{speak of a}} promotion either from Major to Colonel or from Lieutenant Colonel to Colonel - what gives those voices credibility {{is the most common}} date when the promotion was dated, February 20, 1864. His microfilmed muster roll also lists his highest rank as Colonel. In the Official Records on most occasions everyone (Lt. Col. or Col.) is simply addressed as Col., including Smith in the later war years. However, there is a single document in which Smith and other artillery officers are strictly differed into Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels. This document refers to Smith as (full) Colonel. It is authorized by Major General Arnold Elzey, commanding the artillery of the Army of Tennessee; and written by Captain Charles Swett, Elzey's Inspector General, on December 21, 1864.|$|E
25|$|Bergen Municipality, which {{merged with}} the {{surrounding}} municipalities of Arna, Åsane, Fana, and Laksevåg on 1 January 1972, was skeptical to the {{plans for a new}} bridge. They were concerned that additional cars and buses would clog up the city center additionally. The <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> joining the toll company was placed on hold within Bergen Municipality, and without Bergen signing for the required shares, the company could not be established. Not until 5 November 1973 did Bergen Municipal Council vote to purchase the shares in the company. This was in part motivated by a report that showed that 46% of the traffic on the ferry was going to places south and west of the city center—traffic which would not contribute to congestion with a bridge. The company was officially founded on 14 March 1974 with Bjørkaas being appointed chair and Sørensen deputy chair. They would both remain in these positions until 1993.|$|E
25|$|The fixed JG wage {{provides}} an in-built inflation control mechanism. Mitchell (1998) called {{the ratio of}} JG employment to total employment the buffer employment ratio (BER). The BER conditions the overall rate of wage demands. When the BER is high, real wage demands will be correspondingly lower. If inflation exceeds the government’s announced target, tighter fiscal and monetary policy would be triggered to increase the BER, which entails workers transferring from the inflating sector to the fixed price JG sector. Ultimately this attenuates the inflation spiral. So instead of a buffer stock of unemployed being used to discipline the distributional struggle, the JG policy achieves this via compositional shifts in employment. Replacing the current non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), the BER that results in stable inflation is called the non-accelerating inflation buffer employment ratio (NAIBER) (Mitchell 1998). It is a full employment steady state JG level, which is dependent {{on a range of}} factors including the path of the economy. There is an <b>issue</b> <b>about</b> the validity of an unchanging nominal anchor in an inflationary environment. The JG wage would be adjusted in line with productivity growth to avoid changing real relativities. Its viability as a nominal anchor relies on the fiscal authorities reining in any private wage-price pressures.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular 22 pages of story, each issue included extra material. Because the opening credit page was a two-page splash across the inside front cover and page one, an additional page needed to be inserted to make the story start on the recto side of the page. Brubaker's solution was to use page two as a cast list with short descriptions that updated as the story progressed, which he felt was [...] "old-fashioned and neat".
