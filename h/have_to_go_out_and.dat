500|$|In {{the modern}} era, the main {{industry}} of the Lake District {{has shifted from}} agriculture to tourism. The subsequent influx of tourists to the District has at times conflicted with traditional life, including the raising of Herdwicks. One Lake District farmer summed the problem up as, [...] "We get 100,000 visitors across our land every year...If just one in a thousand forgets to shut a gate or can't be bothered, that's a hundred times we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> round up our sheep." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Earth Angel" [...] was {{recorded}} as a literal garage demo—it {{was recorded}} in a home garage at the Los Angeles home of Ted Brinson (a relative of Williams who had previously played bass for the Jimmie Lunceford and Andy Kirk bands). The home was located at 2190 West 30th Street in South Los Angeles. The garage {{was used as the}} primary recording space of Dootsie Williams for all of his Dootone artists, and had also been used to record demos for Jessie Mae Robinson. It was recorded on a single-track Ampex tape recorder, owned by big band veteran Ted Brinson, who performs bass guitar on the track. The drums were muffled with pillows so as to not overwhelm the vocals. A neighbor's pet dog stopped many takes by barking. [...] "Everytime the dog barked next door, I'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> shut him up, and then we'd do another take," [...] remembered Williams. Williams performs piano on the track, with Preston Epps on bongos (though this unconfirmed), as well as an unknown drummer. The song is composed in the key of E-flat major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 76 beats per minute. Duncan's vocal range spans from C4 to D5. The first five seconds of the intro are cut off of the recording by accident.|$|E
500|$|In the 1999–2000 NBA season, Don Nelson {{wanted to}} use Nowitzki as a point forward {{to make use of}} his passing skills. However, one of the most {{important}} moves was made off the hardwood: until then, the owner of the Mavericks was Ross Perot, Jr., who had bought the franchise for $125 million, but had no plans of investing in players and admitted he knew little of basketball. On January 4, 2000, he sold the Mavericks to Internet billionaire Mark Cuban for $280 million. Cuban quickly invested into the Mavericks and restructured the franchise, attending every game at the sidelines, buying the team a $46 million six-star Boeing 757 for traveling, and increasing franchise revenues to over $100 million. Nowitzki lauded Cuban: [...] "He created the perfect environment... we only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> win." [...] As a result of Nelson's tutelage, Cuban's improvements and his own progress, Nowitzki significantly improved his averages. The second-year pro now averaged 17.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game in 35.8 minutes, had nine double-double games, and scored a career-high 32 points twice. He was voted runner-up in the NBA Most Improved Player Award behind Jalen Rose, and made it into the NBA All-Star Sophomore squad along with peers Paul Pierce and Vince Carter. In the traditional Rookie-Sophomore match, he scored 17 points, grabbed six rebounds, and dished out four assists in an overtime loss against the rookie team led by Steve Francis and Lamar Odom. The [...] Nowitzki also was chosen for the NBA All-Star Three Point Shootout, becoming the tallest player ever to participate. After draining 15 shots in the first shootout, he entered the final round, where he finished as runner-up to Jeff Hornacek. While he improved on an individual level, the Mavericks missed the playoffs after a mediocre 40–42 season.|$|E

2500|$|... 20 April - During some {{traditional}} Easter celebrations of the Burning of Judas, some anti-government protesters burned effigies of President Maduro {{and other government}} officials saying they betrayed the Venezuelan people just as Judas Iscariot had betrayed Jesus. Protesters marched to {{the headquarters of the}} United Nations Program for Development called the [...] "Resurrection of Democracy" [...] where Maria Corina Machado explained that [...] "The whole world understands that we are now fighting for democracy and giving freedom. The whole world condemns the blow given to parliament in these times when it prevents me from entering" [...] and Antonio Ledezma said that, [...] "It's not enough to pray, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> fight to achieve the resurrection of democracy. The historic alliance of workers and students is at the forefront of this struggle for a better country". Residents of Carabobo protested with banners and flags for social improvements and denounced shortages effecting them. Clashes occurred between protesters and the National Guard.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Styx {{was accused}} of putting the {{backward}} message [...] "Satan move through our voices" [...] on the song [...] "Snowblind", from Paradise Theatre. Guitarist James Young called these charges [...] "rubbish," [...] and responded, [...] "If {{we want to make}} a statement, we'll {{do it in a way}} that people can understand us and not in a way where you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> buy a $400 tape player to understand us." [...] The vinyl reproduction of Paradise Theater had laser etching on side one, spelling out Styx at the top, and two ladies facing each other on the sides. But on side two, the side with the song (Snow Blind) it had a black label with a small hole cut out where you could place the eraser side of a pencil, and play the album backwards to hear the backward message. In 1983, the band released a concept album, Kilroy Was Here, satirizing the Moral Majority.|$|E

60|$|Hour {{after hour}} dragged heavily {{by in the}} forest hut, and at last the brother and sister felt quite sure {{that in some way}} or other {{all the rest of the}} family had perished.

Most of his teeth are gone, and he is as blind as bat. His nose has been broken at some time or other, and is arched like a culvert now. His under lip hangs down like a camel's, and his ears are chopped off close to his head. I had some trouble at first to find a name for him, but I finally concluded to call him Baalbec, because he is such a magnificent ruin. I can not keep from talking about my horses, because I have a very long and tedious journey before me, and they naturally occupy my thoughts about as much as matters of apparently much greater importance.|$|E
