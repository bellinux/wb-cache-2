5|$|Boucherett {{was born}} on 16 April 1755, the son of Ayscoghe Boucherett of Willingham and Stallingborough, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Mary White. The elder Boucherett had been the High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1754, and was a landed <b>gentleman</b> <b>in</b> Lincolnshire, whose family was descended from Huguenot merchants; they married into the Ayscoghe family and {{inherited}} the Willingham estate through this marriage. The elder Boucherett's daughter, Mary, had married Michael Barne of Sotterley, Suffolk, an army officer {{and a member of}} parliament for Dunwich.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1860s to {{the early}} 1870s, W. S. Gilbert was {{extremely}} productive, writing a large quantity of comic verse, theatre reviews and other journalistic pieces, short stories, and dozens of plays and comic operas. His output in 1870 included dozens of his popular comic Bab Ballads; two blank verse comedies, The Princess and The Palace of Truth; two comic operas, Our Island Home and The <b>Gentleman</b> <b>in</b> Black; and various other short stories, comic pieces, and reviews appearing in various periodicals and newspapers. In 1871 he was even busier, producing seven plays and operas.|$|E

5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a <b>gentleman.</b> <b>In</b> many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E

25|$|But Richardson {{still felt}} the need to respond by writing a {{pamphlet}} called Answer to the Letter of a Very Reverend and Worthy <b>Gentleman.</b> <b>In</b> the pamphlet, he defends his characterizations and explains that he took great pains to avoid any glorification of scandalous behaviour, unlike the authors of many other novels that rely on characters of such low quality.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a number}} of famous life stories showing the same causal connection. For example, P.

Gage healed quickly. After that accident, however, he became erratic, disrespectful, and vulgar. Gage had been transformed from a well-controlled, well-respected person to an individual with psychopathic traits.|$|E

25|$|His next {{first-class}} appearance {{came the}} following {{season for the}} Minor Counties against the touring West Indians, with Hazelton taking career best figures of 6/45 in the West Indians first-innings, this after he took 4 wickets in their first-innings, which gave him his only ten wicket haul in a match. Further first-class appearances came for the <b>Gentleman</b> <b>in</b> 1928, the North, the Minor Counties against the touring South Africans in 1929, and the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1930 against Yorkshire. Overall, Hazelton took 23 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 27.00. He played Minor counties cricket for Buckinghamshire until 1931, having made a total of 68 Minor Counties Championship appearances.|$|E
25|$|Rhodri {{was content}} to end {{his life as a}} country <b>gentleman</b> <b>in</b> England, and though his son Thomas ap Rhodri used the four lions of Gwynedd on his seal he made no attempt to win his inheritance. Owain, his only son, was born in Surrey, where his {{grandfather}} had acquired the manor of Tatsfield. Tatsfield, a small village only 17 miles from the centre of London, still has Welsh place names e.g. Maesmawr Road (trans: Large Field Road). Thomas died in 1363 and Owain returned from abroad to claim his patrimony in 1365. Owain Lawgoch was in French service by 1369 and his lands in Wales and England were confiscated.|$|E
25|$|The Prince of Carignano {{took over}} the army and headed to Saint Quentin {{with the aim of}} {{continue}} the invasion and attract Louis de Bourbon, Count of Soissons, who was in Picardy in command of a force of 14,000 soldiers, and his army to the town. Having arrived at the fields in front of Saint Quentin, the Prince changed the route of the army and advanced towards the Somme river. The Cardinal Infante sent to him don Esteban de Gamarra, a <b>gentleman</b> <b>in</b> his confidence, to transmit the order to cross the Somme at the village Bray-sur-Somme or at an easier place even if the French armies were guarding the riverside. Pontoons and boats were dispatched from Cambrai for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|Beside its {{historical}} value, Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư is also considered an important {{work of the}} literature of Vietnam because Ngô Sĩ Liên often provided {{more information about the}} mentioned historical figures by the additional stories which were well written like a literary work. From various comments of Ngô Sĩ Liên, it seems that the historian also tried to define and teach moral principles based on the concept of Confucianism. For example, Ngô Sĩ Liên mentioned for several times the definition of a Gentleman (Quân tử) who, according to the historian, had to possess both good qualities and righteous manners, Ngô Sĩ Liên also emphasized the importance of the <b>Gentleman</b> <b>in</b> the dynastic era by pointing out the difference between a Gentleman and a Mean man (Tiểu nhân) or determining what would be the effectiveness of the example of such Gentlemen.|$|E
25|$|In 1806 Satchwell {{founded the}} Leamington Spa Charity, with the {{assistance}} of Reverend James Walhouse. The charity was to help the sick poor, who were to provide a certificate of need from a respectable person or parish officer, entitling them to a weekly lodgings allowance of 5s, subject to medical supervision. Money was raised from hotels and subscriptions, with Satchwell both the secretary and treasurer until his death in 1810. He was also well known for his poetry, which he wrote and performed. He died of a chest condition and was buried in Leamington's parish church, All Saints on 4 December 1810, just yards from where his friend Abbotts had been laid to rest four years earlier. Two years after his death, Satchwell was to be honoured as a 'patron and friend' of the town, given a raised tomb fit for a nobleman or <b>gentleman</b> <b>in</b> the churchyard of All Saints.|$|E
25|$|Fox {{was also}} {{regarded}} as a notorious womaniser in a period when a mistress was considered a practical necessity for a London <b>gentleman.</b> <b>In</b> 1784 or 1785, Fox met {{and fell in love}} with Elizabeth Armistead, a former courtesan and mistress of the Prince of Wales who had little interest in politics or Parliament. He married her in a private ceremony at Wyton in Huntingdonshire on 28 September 1795, but did not make the fact public until October 1802, and Elizabeth was never really accepted at court. Fox would increasingly spend time away from Parliament at Armistead's rural villa, St. Ann's Hill, near Chertsey in Surrey, where Armistead's influence gradually moderated Fox's wilder behaviour and together they would read, garden, explore the countryside and entertain friends. In his last days, the sceptical Fox allowed scriptural readings at his bedside in order to please his religious wife. She would survive him by some thirty-six years, dying on 8 July 1842, at the age of ninety-one.|$|E

25|$|Nathaniel Martin is an Anglican priest whom Maturin meets as a parson, a {{thin and}} shabby {{literary}} <b>gentleman</b> <b>in</b> The Ionian Mission. He shares Maturin's love {{of nature and}} lack of maritime knowledge. Martin has an unfortunate tendency to buy his knowledge of living creatures {{at the expense of}} personal injury, including the loss of an eye to an owl, but his knowledge of anatomy and former experience in stuffing birds make him an obvious choice for surgeon's mate under Stephen. Martin first serves as assistant to Maturin in Treason's Harbour (Chapter 4), when Martin stays too long on the Dromedary inspecting Maturin's new diving bell, purchased to inspect the sea bottom. One notable show of his skills is when Martin sutures Maturin's long cut on the forehead; he is with the Surprises for the entire Red Sea mission, but not taken aboard the Surprise once she is repaired. He serves in this capacity through several novels. He is assistant surgeon on the Surprise sailing as a privateer in The Letter of Marque. Later, Martin serves as Surprise's surgeon during Stephen's absence (Thirteen-Gun Salute and The Nutmeg of Consolation). Sailors, who normally consider churchmen unlucky on board a ship, are often prepared to accept him in this medical capacity, further comforting themselves with the mistaken belief that he is only aboard because he was defrocked for having an affair with his Bishop's wife (from The Letter of Marque), though by that time he is a solid married man. At first meeting, Martin is a young man (younger than Stephen) who is eager to please and to be pleased; these qualities, along with his interest in nature, slowly fade with time. Martin's career at sea ends in The Wine Dark Sea when he becomes too ill to sail after treating himself with strong medicines he did not need, mistaking salt sores for the pox, in guilt for his thoughts, not actions towards Clarissa Oakes on the previous voyage. His love of botanizing returns as Maturin begins treatment to restore him. Surprise arrives at Callao, a port in Peru, before Martin is recovered, and Maturin has work to do ashore in Peru. Martin heads home with Dr Geary on a merchantman, Three Graces. Aubrey has given two livings on his holdings to Martin.|$|E
