40|$|Humans' {{ability to}} {{represent}} their body state from within through interoception has been proposed to predict different aspects of human cognition and behaviour. We focused on the possible contribution of interoceptive sensitivity to social behaviour as mediated by adaptive modulation of autonomic response. We, thus, investigated whether interoceptive sensitivity to one's heartbeat predicts participants' autonomic response at different social distances. We measured respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during either a Social or a Non-social task. In the Social task <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>viewed</b> an experimenter performing a caress-like movement at different distances from their hand. In the Non-social task a metal stick was moved at the same distances from the participant's hand. We found a positive association between interoceptive sensitivity and autonomic response only for the social setting. Moreover, only good heartbeat perceivers showed higher autonomic response 1) in the social compared to the non-social setting, 2) specifically, when the experimenter's hand was moving at boundary of their peripersonal space (20 cm from the participant's hand).

40|$|Objectives: Fuzzy trace {{theory was}} used to examine the effect of {{information}} concerning medication benefits and side-effects on willingness to use a hypothetical medication. Methods: Participants (N = 999) were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Using 3 × 5 experimental research design, <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>viewed</b> information about medication side effects in 1 of 3 formats and information about medication benefits in 1 of 5 formats. For both side-effects and benefits, one format presented only non-numeric information and the remaining formats presented numeric information. Results: Individuals in the non-numeric side-effect condition were less likely to take the medication than those in the numeric conditions (p < 0. 0001). In contrast, individuals in the non-numeric benefit condition were more likely to take the medication than those in the numeric conditions (p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that non-numeric side-effect information conveys the gist that the medication can cause harm, decreasing willingness to use the medication; whereas non-numeric benefit information has the opposite effect. Practice implications: Presenting side-effect and benefit information in non-numeric format appears to bias decision-making in opposite directions. Providing numeric information for both benefits and side-effects may enhance decision-making. However, providing numeric benefit information may decrease adherence, creating ethical dilemmas for providers...|$|R

We argue that existing research fails {{to take account of}} the "social" aspects of social support, and that new methods, sensitive to the complexities of human interaction, are needed. One promising method, tape-assisted recall (in which an audiotape of an interaction is played back to participants), allows researchers to examine the help-intended communication within a dyad as well as <b>each</b> <b>participant's</b> <b>view</b> of that communication. The conversations of the three couples and the participants' moment-by-moment perceptions of these conversations illustrate the complexities of help-intended communication. The commentaries in the tape-assisted recall sessions yielded insights into the interactions that were not always apparent on the surface: the personal meanings of the interactions, {{in the context of the}} couple's relationship, were necessary for understanding how support attempts are delivered effectively and why they sometimes fail.

40|$|Empirical {{work has}} demonstrated, {{at least to}} some degree, that {{alternatives}} to didacticism are useful in the classroom. However, other investigations have shown that didactic methods continue to dominate classroom instruction time. A genuine need exists for research aimed at identifying the source of the discrepancy between the methodologies lauded in current process-product educational literature and the observed teaching practice noted in classroom research. This investigation was conducted to determine how or if an instructor's belief system influences the manner in which that same instructor teaches. In order to adequately address that objective, three specific research questions were developed. First, this work examined the espoused beliefs of a small sample of practicing athletic training educators regarding the role of the teacher, the student, and the nature of instruction. This was accomplished through the use of qualitative research methods including semi-structured telephone interviews, written questionnaires, demographic data sheets, and stimulated recall sessions in which <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>viewed</b> videotape of their own classroom instruction and discussed it with the principal investigator. Next, this investigation also analyzed classroom practice by observing those practicing athletic training educators as they taught in class. This was accomplished by videotaping <b>each</b> <b>participant's</b> classroom instruction during three hours of classroom instruction. Utilizing case studies assembled for <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> and a cross case analysis, this work also assessed the degree to which those espoused beliefs aligned with classroom practice. By utilizing these methods, this investigation indicates that beliefs do influence the manner in which individuals teach; however, other factors such as formal pedagogical training, experience, and job requirements may also influence the manifestation of demonstrated classroom practice, as well...|$|R

Thirty groups of 4 current college baseball players were: (i) teammates (players from same team/view from own position), (ii) non-teammates (players from different teams/view from own position), or (iii) scrambled teammates (players from same team/view not from own position). Teammates performed significantly better (i. e., faster and more coordinated decisions) than the other two groups, whereas scrambled teammates performed significantly better than non-teammates. These findings suggest that team coordination is achieved through both experience with one’s teammates’ responses to particular events (e. g., a ball hit up the middle) and one’s own general action capabilities (e. g., running speed).

Two experiments investigated whether user performance on this chart could be improved by incremental design changes. The experiments focussed on the task of determining the correct dose to administer to the patient. To do this accurately, the chart-user must take into account the patient’s current blood glucose level and any relevant orders (i. e., prescriptions) for “routine” or “supplemental” insulin recorded on the chart.

A total of 160 five- to thirteen-year-old children and adults participated. <b>Each</b> <b>participant</b> was randomly assigned to either the incidental (INC) or the intentional (INT) memory condition. In this repeated-measures design, <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>viewed</b> a total of 36 sex-stereotyped static and dynamic toy pictures and was asked to recall the previously seen toys after a filler task. In general, the results did not support the evolutionary hypothesis, but they did, in part, confirm gender schema theory. Congruent with the gender-schema theory, there was no overall memory advantage for males or females across the two conditions. On average, males and females remembered an equal number of objects. Overall, the participants recalled more static toy pictures than dynamic pictures. Also, with age, the participants recalled more stimuli. This pattern was significant also across memory conditions. As predicted, males and females recalled more objects in the INT than in the INC memory condition. Consistent with gender-schema theory, the results revealed a weak interaction between sex of the participant and the sex-stereotyped toys. In the INC condition, males remembered more male stereotyped toys than female and neutral stereotyped toys, and females recalled more female and male stereotyped objects than neutral stereotyped objects. The pattern of recall was different in the INT condition, suggesting that the mechanisms of these two types of memory are somewhat distinct. According to the present findings, there is no emergence of cognitive sex differences in a task using either incidental or intentional memory that assesses static or dynamic sex-stereotyped stimuli. ...|$|R

Practical implications – The results suggest that an NPO-sponsored advertisement promoting awareness about a disease or health condition is more effective without the co-sponsorship of a pharmaceutical company. Originality/value – This is the only identified research into attitudes towards sponsors of disease awareness advertising that considers pharmaceutical companies and health NPOs and is important, given the increasing trend of disease advertising and cause-related marketing in Australia and internationally...|$|R
30|$|Following recall, {{participants}} completed {{a test of}} recognition memory consisting of 20 trials with 10 boundary and 10 midpoint target still pictures taken from the movies randomly matched to lure pictures from a foil movie. For <b>each</b> trial, <b>participants</b> <b>viewed</b> both a target and a lure and were instructed to select the picture {{that came from the}} movie. Recognition memory was scored as the proportion of trials answered correctly for each movie. For order memory, the experimenter laid in front of the participant 12 laminated pictures from the movie, printed on 10  cm[*]×[*] 15  cm index cards, in a randomized order. Participants were instructed to arrange the cards in the correct chronological order. Order memory performance was scored as an error measure, which was the mean absolute deviation from the correct position for each picture; in this case, lower scores on the task meant better performance. Time to complete the task was also recorded.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{impact of}} context on the complex process of {{clinical}} reasoning {{is not well}} understood. Using situated cognition as the theoretical framework and videos to provide the same contextual “stimulus” to all participants, we {{examined the relationship between}} specific contextual factors on diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning accuracy in board certified internists versus resident physicians. Methods <b>Each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>viewed</b> three videotaped clinical encounters portraying common diagnoses in internal medicine. We explicitly modified the context to assess its impact on performance (patient and physician contextual factors). Patient contextual factors, including English as a second language and emotional volatility, were portrayed in the videos. Physician participant contextual factors were self-rated sleepiness and burnout [...] The accuracy of diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning was compared with covariates using Fisher Exact, Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearman Rho’s correlations as appropriate. Results Fifteen board certified internists and 10 resident physicians participated from 2013 to 2014. Accuracy of diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning did not differ between groups despite residents reporting significantly higher rates of sleepiness (mean rank 20. 45 vs 8. 03, U =  0. 5, p < . 001) and burnout (mean rank 20. 50 vs 8. 00, U =  0. 0, p < . 001). Accuracy of diagnosis and treatment were uncorrelated (r =  0. 17, p = . 65). In both groups, the proportion scoring correct responses for treatment was higher than the proportion scoring correct responses for diagnosis. Conclusions This study underscores that specific contextual factors appear to impact clinical reasoning performance. Further, the processes of diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning, although related, may not be interchangeable. This raises important questions about the impact that contextual factors have on clinical reasoning and provides insight into how clinical reasoning processes in more authentic settings may be explained by situated cognition theory...|$|R
40|$|Perceptions of {{menstruation}} {{by media}} discourses portray this bodily function to be messy, inconvenient, {{and as an}} unnecessary phenomenon to be controlled or possibly eliminated. Commercials shown on YouTube targeted toward young women suggest that having a monthly period is not healthy and a lifestyle that is menses free is both pharmacologically available and recommended {{in order to live}} a fuller life. We explored the meanings attached to online menstrual suppression commercials with 10 women aged between 18 and 25. In-depth open-ended interviews were conducted over a 10 -month period in 2014 after <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>viewed</b> three menstrual suppression online advertisements. Feminist critical discourse was used for analysis with both authors coding for inter-rater reliability recognizing how our age difference and relationship as mother and daughter informed our interpretation. An overarching theme of tension emerged from the interviews with participants feeling detached due to the gendered stereotypes the commercials used to frame menstruation as compared to their own lived experience. Meanings associated with the menstrual suppression commercials were contrary to the participants’ lived experience of menstruation as a healthy process not a detrimental one to their well-being as suggested by the commercials. Subliminal messages within the advertisements were identified as reinforcing gender bias and prejudices, including those associated with femininity. Despite attempting to emulate popular culture, the menstrual suppression advertisements were largely dismissed by this group of participants as undermining their intelligence and of intentionally creating divisive binaries between groups of women. This study suggests that historical bias and stereotypical prejudices were identified by this group of young women within the marketing of menstrual suppression products and, as such, were dismissed as inauthentic to the menstruation experience reflecting a form of menstrual activism...|$|R

Paper {{presented at}} the EARLI Special Interest Group 14, Antwerp, Belgium. Visual expertise {{is becoming more and}} more a crucial part of medical expertise. The amount of medical images produced has grown tremendously and the last decades have welcomed several new and increasingly dynamic imaging techniques (Krupinski, 2010). Nevertheless, visual expertise has so far mainly been studied in domains using static images, such as X-ray images (Reingold & Sheridan, 2011). This is also true for the domain of clinical pathology, where pathologists interactively navigate and zoom within digital slides. Research in this domain either restricted these navigation possibilities (Krupinski et al., 2006; Tiersma, Peters, Mooij, & Fleuren, 2003) or neglected the visual processes (Crowley, Naus, Stewart, & Friedman, 2003). Hence, not much is known on visual expertise in domains that deal with interactive, medical images. In this study, six clinical pathologists of different expertise levels, performed diagnostic tasks on a virtual microscope (i. e., computer software displaying scanned tissue samples in a similar way as a light microscope). By measuring eye movements, microscope navigation and thinking aloud, insight in both visual and cognitive expertise was gained. <b>Each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>viewed</b> four histological slides, representing different diseases of the colon and annotated diagnostically relevant areas in the slide, while thinking-aloud. At the time of writing this submission, the data collection was just finished, hence the analysis is not fully completed, yet. However, some expected results – based on theory and prior studies – are given in the extended summary. This study will contribute to the understanding of visual expertise by developing a methodology which is fit for the study of interactive images...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to further explore the Kuleshov effect, {{originally}} examined by Soviet filmmaker Lev Kuleshov through a variety of editing experiments in the early 1920 's. Concluding that audience members were likely to view a neutral-faced actor's emotions based on the stimuli he was associated with (e. g., a bowl of soup for hunger), this observation became universally accepted. Although the influence of the Kuleshov effect has been well documented in a variety of academic texts (and integrated into empirical research), the study itself has never been fully replicated in its original form. Expanding on the qualitative research of Prince & Hensley (1992), this study aimed to test the strength of Lev Kuleshov’s initial experiment through adapted replication, as well as examine the influence gender differences within the target face (actor) may have on the participant’s interpretation of facial emotional expression. Adapted replication consisted of utilizing updated video clips, including both male and female actors, and providing regulated questionnaires to all participants (rather than a freeform, post-experiment discussion). It was expected that the Kuleshov effect would be observed, and the gender of the actor would have no effect on the participants’ responses. 150 undergraduate students from the University of Pittsburgh were included in this study, with <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> <b>viewing</b> (10) short clips and ranking the degree to which they believe the actor was expressing (8) different emotions (via a Likert-type scale). The results of this study showed the Kuleshov effect being observed in a more nuanced manner, with significant differences existing in specific emotion conditions for the target face. Future research on this subject could feature the inclusion of different participant populations, incorporate neuroimaging techniques, or examine gender as a primary research question...|$|R
