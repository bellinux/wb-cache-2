40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} {{aimed to}} detect coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (CPS) directly in samples of artificially contaminated milk, using multiplex PCR (mPCR). Standard and isolated bacterial strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hyicus, S. intermedius, Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli species were used, evaluating the specificity and detection limit of mPCR, for artificially contaminated UHT milk. Primers specific for the nuc gene (NUC 1 -NUC 2 {{were used for}} S. aureus, NUC 3 -NUC 4 for S. hyicus and NUC 5 -NUC 6 for S. intermedius). It was possible to detect the three target species by mPCR, directly from bovine whole milk, with adequate specificity and acceptable detention limit for identification of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus (CPS) in <b>foods.</b> The <b>specificity</b> {{was determined by the}} amplification of species-specific fragments, and the detection limit was assessed by the detection thresholds obtained for the three species (103 CFU mL- 1).

Purpose: To standardize a rapid, sensitive and fieldable optical immunoassay (OIA) {{for the detection of}} BoNTs A, B, E and F in food matrices. Materials and methods: The toxicity of BoNTs A, B, E and F was assessed by using a modified LD 50 assay. OIA was used to detect BoNTs in a variety of food matrices representing liquids, solids, and semisolid <b>food.</b> For <b>specificity</b> studies, the assay was used to test varying concentrations of epsilon toxin (ETX) from Clostridium perfringens, toxin A (TcdA) from C. difficile and staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) from S. aureus in spiked assay buffer. To evaluate the OIA performance, five concentrations (serially five-fold diluted, viz. 20, 4, 0. 8, 0. 16 and 0. 032 in ng/mL) of BoNT/A were made in orange juice and tested by both OIA and mouse bioassay.

Accurate predictions of temporal species composition within fish assemblages have been very difficult to make because the occurrence of a species is governed by variables including recruitment, biological associations, <b>food</b> and habitat <b>specificity,</b> and predator–prey relationships. The present study reduces temporal variability by placing fish into species occurrence categories, and shows that data based on 20 – 25 surveys is needed when using either an AM or a GM method (assuming K =  4) to identify the common species at dive spots. Common fish species are the most temporally stable, and thus are more appropriate for attracting divers.|$|R

A number of morphologically and ethologically well-defined ecotypes {{are known for}} this species that differ in their primary <b>food</b> plant <b>specificity.</b> Most of these ecotypes do not interbreed in nature, but are able to produce offspring under captive conditions. Microsatellite markers were developed for A. mylitta, and out of these, ten well-behaved microsatellite loci were {{used to analyze the}} population structure of different ecoraces. A total of 154 individual moths belonging to eight different ecoraces, were screened at each locus. Hierarchical analysis of population structure using Analysis of MOlecular VAriance (AMOVA) revealed significant structuring (F-ST = 0. 154) and considerable inbreeding (F-IS = 0. 505). A significant isolation by distance was also observed. The number of possible population clusters was investigated using distance method, Bayesian algorithm and self organization maps (SOM). The first two methods revealed two distinct clusters, whereas the SOM showed the different ecoraces not to be clearly differentiated. These results suggest that although there is a large degree of phenotypic variation among the different ecoraces of A. mylitta, genetically they are not very different, and the phenotypic differences may largely be a result of their respective ecology...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) tests {{only give}} a limited {{picture of the}} immunological response to food antigens. Furthermore, existing tests require large volumes of sample, over {{a limited number of}} foods, are not amenable to a high sample through-put system and the results are limited to normally just one immunoglobulin class. In order to investigate the global immune response towards food products we have developed the "all diet" microarray concept. The "all-diet food protein microarray contains extracts of over 400 food ingredients that cover most of the food products found in the UK. Using this system we have retrospectively determined food specific IgE, IgA, IgG and IgM from 17 well characterized sera. The results were analyzed by multivariate techniques and parametric methods. The proof-of-concept of the ''all diet microarray to investigate the relationships between <b>food</b> antigen <b>specificity</b> and multiple Ig type was demonstrated here. The novelity of this protein microarray is the use of arrayed food samples sequentially extracted with detergent and chaotropic agents. The array system possesses many advantages over traditional systems such as requirement of low sample volume, high sensitivity and a global view of the immune response. Notwithstanding these potential advantages to clinical practices, these benefits remain yet to be demonstrated. The development of the technique will allow further expansion into areas of research such as conjugation of the microarray with sensitized human basophils and also immunoglobulin binding to extracts of parasites.

Metarhizium acridum, a fungal pathogen that specifically infects acridids, has been developed as a control agent but its utility is limited by slow kill time and greater expense than chemical insecticides. We found that expression of four insect specific neurotoxins improved the efficacy of M. acridum against acridids by reducing lethal dose, time to kill and food consumption. Coinoculating recombinant strains expressing AaIT 1 (a sodium channel blocker) and hybrid-toxin (a blocker of both potassium and calcium channels), produced synergistic effects, including an 11. 5 -fold reduction in LC 50, 43 % reduction in LT 50 and a 78 % reduction in <b>food</b> consumption.

40|$|Background: The neuropeptide galanin {{increases}} food intake. Chronic ethanol (EtOH) {{increases the}} expression of galanin in the hypothalamus. The research presented here examines the effects of microinjection of galanin in the third ventricle on voluntary alcohol intake. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats with a cannula in the third ventricle were given access to increasing concentrations of EtOH for 12 hr/day until all acquired a preference for 7 % EtOH over water in a two-bottle choice. Rats then received a microinjection of galanin (0, 1, and 3 nmol) alone or {{in combination with the}} galanin antagonist M 40 (1 nmol) and with M 40 alone to determine the effects on EtOH and water intake. Tests were conducted during both the light and dark periods of a 12 : 12 -hr light-dark cycle with food available ad libitum. As a control for galanin-induced calorie intake, both EtOH and food were measured in a subset of rats during the dark. Results: Microinjections of galanin (1. 0 and 3. 0 nmol) increased EtOH consumption during both periods of the light-dark cycle. Galanin’s effect on ethanol intake during the light was large relative to the very low intake of food and water during this period. Rats increased their intake of EtOH but not <b>food.</b> Receptor <b>specificity</b> for galanin (3 nmol) was shown by the galanin antagonist M 40, which blocked the increase in EtOH intake. M 40 alone decreased EtOH intake slightly. Conclusions: These data show that galanin injected in the third ventricle increases EtOH consumption and that the effect can occur during both the light and the dark periods of the diurnal cycle in the presence of food and water. This suggests that galanin {{may play a role in}} augmenting voluntary alcohol intake and perhaps the development of alcohol dependence...|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{perceptions}} of food (for example, how filling or healthy) influence eating behaviour and appetite control. Therefore approaches {{to understand the}} global nutritional attributes of foods that predict the strength of consumer perceptions are of academic and commercial interest. The current research describes {{the development of a}} flexible platform for systematically mapping the global nutritional attributes of foods (both objective and perceived) to consumer {{perceptions of}} those foods. The platform consists of a database of standardised UK food images (currently n= 300), linked to a catalogue of detailed perceptual, nutritional, sensory, cost, and psychological information ('nutritional attributes'). The platform also incorporates demographic and psychometric questionnaires to examine the importance of nutritional attributes on consumer perceptions within or between relevant target groups. In the current study, the platform was applied to a sample of dieting and non-dieting British men and women (n= 887) to examine the global attributes of a subset of foods (n= 75) and their association with successful weight management (i. e. supportive of weight loss, weight loss maintenance or prevention of weight gain). Generalised linear models identified energy density, cost (£/kcal), perceived energy content and satiating capacity as the main nutritional attributes underlying dieters' and non-dieters' perception of successful weight management food. Additionally, pleasantness, and desire not to (over) eat were uniquely associated with dieters' perception of food as good for weight management; pleasantness was positively associated with weight management and desire to eat was negatively associated with weight management. Therefore, global nutritional attributes of foods can predict and distinguish the extent consumers' perceive a food to be related to successful weight management. This platform will be extended to increase the variety of <b>foods</b> and <b>specificity</b> of nutritional attributes in the database suitable for a range of commercial, academic or clinical research applications...|$|R

Methods: A descriptive and exploratory study with a qualitative approach, held at the Nucleus of Integrated Medical Attention - NAMI - Fortaleza-Ceará-Brazil, {{in the period of}} 2005 – 2006. The informers were seven undernourished pregnant women aged 15 to 35 years old. Data collection was carried out by means of prenatal consultation, a semi-structured interview and domiciliary visits. By applying the continent analysis of Bardin, the following thematic categories aroused: “Irregular feeding habits”; “Portraying the pregnancy” and “Child malnutrition as a stigma”. Results: The testimonies disclosed the misinformation about the gestation physiologic alterations, besides the involvement with many partners and family conflicts, the lack of acceptance of the father in the child care, the lack of knowledge about the severity of the pathology and on conditions to prevent it.

We, therefore, aimed to develop a precise method of measuring large particles (> 2 mm in diameter) in a bolus and an analytical method to provide a scientific rationale for food selection under masticatory dysfunction conditions. We developed a new illumination system to evaluate the ability of twenty female participants (mean age, 23. 4 +/- 4. 3 years) to masticate carrots, peanuts and beef with full, half and one quarter of the number of masticatory strokes. We also evaluated mastication under suppressed force, regulated by 20 % electromyographic of the masseter muscle. The intercept and inclination of the regression line for the distribution of large particles were adopted as coefficients for the discrimination of masticatory efficiency. Single set of coefficient thresholds of 0. 10 for the intercept and 1. 62 for the inclination showed excellent discrimination of masticatory conditions for all three test <b>foods</b> with high <b>specificity</b> and sensitivity. These results suggested that our method of analysing the distribution of particles > 2 mm in diameter might provide the basis for the appropriate selection of food texture for masticatory dysfunction patients from the standpoint of comminution...|$|R
40|$|An amplified {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for {{the detection}} of Clostridium botulinum complex neurotoxins was evaluated for its ability to detect these toxins in food. The assay was found to be suitable for detecting type A, B, E, and F botulinum neurotoxins in a variety of food matrices representing liquids, solid, and semisolid food. Specific foods included broccoli, orange juice, bottled water, cola soft drinks, vanilla extract, oregano, potato salad, apple juice, meat products, and dairy foods. The detection sensitivity of the test for these botulinum complex serotypes was found to be 60 pg/ml (1. 9 50 % lethal dose [LD 50]) for botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A), 176 pg/ml (1. 58 LD 50) for BoNT/B, 163 pg/ml for BoNT/E (4. 5 LD 50), and 117 pg/ml for BoNT/F (less than 1 LD 50) in casein buffer. The test could also readily detect 2 ng/ml of neurotoxins type A, B, E, and F in a variety of <b>food</b> samples. For <b>specificity</b> studies, the assay was also used to test a large panel of type A C. botulinum, a smaller panel of proteolytic and nonproteolytic type B, E, and F neurotoxin-producing Clostridia, and nontoxigenic organisms using an overnight incubation of toxin production medium.

To further validate an enteral brown Norway (BN) rat sensitization model under development, we studied specific protein recognition {{to determine whether a}} comparable pattern of proteins is recognized by the rat immune system and the human immune system. Methods: The animals were exposed to either ovalbumin as a positive reference control, hen's egg-white-protein extract, or a cow's milk preparation by daily gavage dosing (0. 5, 1, 2. 5, 5, 10, or 15 mg protein per rat/day) for 9 weeks. No adjuvants were used during the sensitization studies. The specificities of antibodies against hen's egg-white proteins or cow's-milk proteins in sera from orally sensitized rats and food-allergic patients were studied and compared by immunoblotting. Results: The IgG and IgE antibodies to hen's egg-white proteins and cow's-milk proteins present in sera from orally sensitized rats and food-allergic patients showed a comparable pattern of protein recognition. Conclusions: Upon daily intragastric exposure to <b>food</b> allergens, the <b>specificities</b> of the induced antibody responses in the BN rat resemble those found in food-allergic patients.

40|$|Background: Confident {{diagnosis}} of food allergy in children is of central importance for subsequent therapeutic intervention. While controlled oral food challenges are still {{regarded as the}} gold standard diagnostic tool they are time consuming, expensive and may cause severe clinical side effects. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the diagnostic ability of food-specific IgE antibodies in serum (sIgE), the skin prick test (SPT) and the atopy patch test (APT) in predicting the outcome of oral food challenges. Particular emphasis was placed on quantifying test parameters. Methods: We performed controlled oral food challenges with cow’s milk (CM), hen’s egg (HE), wheat and soy in a large number of children. In parallel, specific IgE in serum was measured and skin prick test and atopy patch test were carried out using fresh <b>foods.</b> Sensitivity, <b>specificity,</b> positive and negative predictive values and receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curves were calculated. Logistic regression was used to determine decision points with 95 % and 99 % predictive probabilities for specific serum IgE, mean wheal size of the skin prick test and the calculated skin index (SI). Results: Skin prick test and specific IgE showed the best sensitivity while the atopy patch test had the highest specificity. Choosing a 95 % predicted probability using logistic regression revealed predictive decision points for the SPT of 12. 5 mm for CM and 13. 0 mm for HE (17. 3 and 17. 8 mm for 99 % predicted probability, respectively). However, these criteria were only fulfilled by 2 % and 6 % (0 % and 3 %) of the children. For the specific IgE we were able to calculate the following decision points: HE 12. 6 kU/L (95 %), 59. 2 kU/L (99 %); CM 88. 8 kU/L (90 %). Similar decision points could be determined for the skin index and the ratio of food-specific IgE/total IgE. Combining the APT with either the sIgE measurement or the SPT resulted in improved sensitivity and specificity. Decision points for the sIgE and the SPT showed lower values when combined with a positive APT result. Conclusions: Currently, no single test can confidently diagnose or exclude a clinically relevant food allergy. Oral food challenges can be rendered superfluous in a few selected cases when SPT wheal size diameter or sIgE levels exceed calculated threshold values. In the majority of cases, however, controlled oral food challenges remain the current gold standard in the diagnostic work up of food allergies in children...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Atopic Dermatitis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} skin disease. Food allergens {{are important in}} the pathogenesis in 1 / 3 of the cases. Several mechanisms {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of Atopic Dermatitis. Immediate reactions are identified by both measurement of specific IgE and skin prick test. Atopy Patch Test seems to be relevant in the investigation of patients with suspected delayed-type reactions. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the standardization of this method concerning allergen concentration, occlusion time and interpretation, and determine the specificity and sensitivity of the Atopy Patch Test according to the skin prick test and specific IgE levels in food allergy diagnosis in children with Atopic Dermatitis. METHODS: Seventy-two children, aged 2 - 12 years were selected and followed at the allergy clinic of the Hospital São Zacharias. Skin prick test, specific IgE and food Atopy Patch Test (cow's milk, egg, soy and wheat) were carried out. Three groups were submitted to the Atopy Patch Test: (1) Atopic Dermatitis with or without Rhinitis and Asthma; (2) Rhinitis and or Asthma without AD; (3) Healthy individuals. RESULTS: In group 1, 40 % of the patients presented positive reactions. The longer the exposure time (48 h and 72 h), the higher the sensitivity. In group 2, the test was more specific than sensitive for all the extracts, with increased sensitivity the longer the time of exposure (72 h). In group 3, 8. 3 % presented positive tests.

40|$|The {{hypothalamic}} {{arcuate nucleus}} (Arc) is the presumed target {{site for the}} orexigenic hormone ghrelin which is secreted from the stomach during fasting. Ghrelin directly activates Arc neurones. Similar to exogenous ghrelin, overnight food deprivation also induces c-Fos expression in the Arc of mice. In this study we tested the role of endogenous ghrelin in the fasting-induced c-Fos expression in the Arc of mice. We used NOX-B 11 - 3, the latest generation of the recently developed ghrelin-binding compounds, so-called RNA Spiegelmers (SPM) to block endogenous ghrelin action during <b>food</b> deprivation. The <b>specificity</b> and potency of this compound was also tested in electrophysiological and immunohistological experiments. In electrophysiological in vitro single cell recordings NOX-B 11 - 3 effectively blocked the excitatory effect of ghrelin in the medial Arc (ArcM) of rats while the biologically inactive control SPM had no effect. Furthermore, NOX-B 11 - 3 (15 mg/kg ip) potently suppressed ghrelin-induced (25 µg/kg sc, 12 h after SPM injection) c-Fos expression in the Arc. However, the same dose of NOX-B 11 - 3 when injected {{at the beginning of}} a 14 h fasting period had no effect on the c-Fos expression in the Arc of mice. These results demonstrate that NOX-B 11 - 3 is a long acting compound, which effectively blocks the effect of exogenous ghrelin on neuronal activity in the Arc under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Furthermore, increased ghrelin signalling does not appear to be a necessary factor for the activation of Arc neurones during food deprivation or other fasting-related signals might have masked or compensated the loss of the ghrelin effect...|$|R

The increased consumption of pistachios {{may lead to a}} higher frequency of allergic sensitization and an increased prevalence of allergic reactions to pistachios. Trace amounts of undeclared pistachio allergens can pose serious health risks for food-allergic consumers, including severe anaphylactic reactions. A highly sensitive analytical method, sandwich-type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is applied as a critical tool for food manufacturers and food scientists to detect minute amounts of allergenic food residues in processed foods. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop an ELISA for the detection and quantification of pistachio residues in processed foods. California raw pistachios and a mixture of Californian, Iranian, and Turkish roasted pistachios were used as immunogens to immunize one sheep, one goat, and three rabbits. Both raw and roasted pistachio ELISAs were developed by using pooled sheep antisera as the capture reagent and pooled rabbit antisera as the detector reagent. Binding of antigen-antibody complex was visualized through a colorimetric reaction involving goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (labeled with alkaline phosphatase) and substrate (p-nitrophenyl phosphate). A total of 102 food ingredients were evaluated using the developed pistachio ELISA for potential cross-reactivity. Vanilla ice cream and sugar cookies with known amounts of pistachio were prepared as manufactured model <b>foods.</b> The sensitivity, <b>specificity,</b> and robustness of the assay were determined by the percent of recovery from both of the model foods. The optimized ELISA had a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 3 ̆c 1 ppm 3 ̆e(1 μg/g). Minor cross-reactivity was observed with cashew at a level equivalent to 4 ppm of roasted pistachio. The performance of the ELISA was not affected in the presence of the ice cream and cookie matrices.

40|$|Food falsification is {{a common}} concern, but has been {{mutually}} practiced in the meat industry, especially for processing food products, for realizing an extra profit. The everyday happenings such horse, porcine, rat and dog meats forgeries in various foods have made consumers increasingly worried to safeguard their religious faith, health, money and wildlife in natural habitats. The consumers of the Halal food market have reached to 1. 8 billion and turnover has crossed US Dollar 700 billion in 2012 {{and it has been}} projected to reach at US 1. 6 trillion by the 2030. Since the market is quite large and opportunities in halal food business are huge, it has been targeted for adulteration for a long time. Consumption or mixing of feline ingredients in halal and kosher foods is forbidden and various diseases such as SARS, anthrax and hepatitis could be transmitted through feline meats. However, since feline species are abundant across the world without market price and their meats are consumed in exotic foods, the chances of their adulteration in common meats are very high. For meat specification, DNA-based techniques are preferred over protein and lipid-based molecular identification schemes since DNA biomarkers, especially the short-length one, is extremely stable even under harsh processing condition (heat, pressure and additives chemicals) and compromised states (natural decomposition) where most protein-based markers are denatured or degraded. Although several PCR assays have been proposed for feline species detection, those assays are based on longer length target amplicon which are assumed to break down under food processing treatments. Thus, a reliable detection of feline ingredients is crucial for the safety of consumer health, religious faith and fair-trade economy.

40|$|Opioids and {{antidepressants}} {{are frequently}} {{used for the}} treatment of various pain conditions. A combination of both drug classes may be more effective than either treatment used alone and may result in an opiate-sparing effect. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if motivational-neutral antidepressants with analgesic properties may affect abuse liability of heroin in rats. The effect of venlafaxine and desipramine was investigated with aid of two behavioural techniques; an intravenous drug self-administration (IVSA) and a conditioned place preference (CPP). Because some effects of antidepressants occurs with prolonged administration, effects of both, acute and sub-chronic administration of antidepressants were assessed. To determine whether antidepressants affect reinforcing properties of heroin, male Long-Evans rats were trained to press a lever in order to receive heroin (0. 05 mg/kg/infusion) under a fixed ratio (FR) or a progressive ratio (PR) schedule. A control group was trained in a FR food-reinforced operant procedure. The effect of antidepressants on operant responding for heroin and food was assessed both during acquisition and, in separate groups of rats, during maintenance (i. e., after acquisition) of self-administration behaviour. Daily treatment with venlafaxine (10 mg/kg i. p.) before the operant session attenuated the acquisition of responding for heroin, but not for food. However, when tested during the maintenance phase in rats showing stable responding, acute treatment with venlafaxine only marginally affected operant responding for heroin under a FR 10 schedule of reinforcement, and neither acute nor subchronic (once daily during 4 weeks) venlafaxine treatment affected responding under a PR schedule. Thus, daily treatment with an antidepressant attenuates the acquisition of heroin IVSA in a behaviourally specific manner, while having only marginal effects on maintenance of heroin IVSA. Desipramine (10 mg/kg/i. p.) also attenuated the maintenance of heroin intake under FR but not under PR schedule. However desipramine suppressed responding for <b>food,</b> questioning <b>specificity</b> of its effect. To determine whether effect observed in IVSA experiments was due to an antidepressant-induced attenuation of the rewarding effect of heroin, the CPP paradigm has been used. Antidepressants were administered to the male Sprague-Dawley rats prior to the conditioning sessions or prior to the expression test after conditioning, respectively. In additional experiments both antidepressants were administered for two weeks prior to conditioning, or for one week prior to the expression test, respectively. When tested alone, heroin (0. 05 – 3. 16 mg/kg i. p.) produced a dose-dependent CPP, whereas the antidepressants (1 – 21. 5 mg/kg i. p.) produced neither a CPP nor a conditioned place aversion (CPA). For both antidepressants (10 mg/kg i. p.), neither acute nor repeated pretreatment affected acquisition or expression of heroin (0. 5 mg/kg) CPP. Thus, the CPP study does not support the hypothesis that the previously observed attenuation of acquisition of heroin IVSA by venlafaxine is due to an attenuation of the rewarding effect of heroin. Because venlafaxine attenuated specifically the acquisition and maintenance of heroin IVSA under the FR, but not maintenance under the PR schedule it may be supposed that venlafaxine can delay the development of heroin addiction, however it has no effect on already existing addiction. Decrease in heroin but not in food intake indicated that venlafaxine to some extent can “stabilise” circuits engaged in reward and motivation. Because venlafaxine is effective in treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, it can in principle, display some effects on craving, which is a compulsive drug seeking and taking. On the other hand, venlafaxine did not affect the CPP produced by heroin. Because heroin possesses very high abuse liability, a moderate modulating effect of venlafaxine on it’s reinforcing/rewarding properties might be too weak to be observed across different experimental conditions. Alternatively, the modulation of acquisition of heroin IVSA in the previous study may be related to mechanisms that cannot be modelled with the CPP paradigm. Desipramine attenuated the maintenance of heroin intake under FR schedule, however the observed effect was not specific and the question if desipramine may affect abuse liability of heroin remains open. It is noteworthy that in the present study no indication for an enhanced intake of heroin was found. Therefore, it can be postulated that adding an antidepressant drug, such as venlafaxine, to an opioid {{for the treatment of}} pain would not be expected to enhance the abuse liability of the opioid (if anything, the combination might reduce abuse liability) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Atopic Dermatitis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} skin disease. Food allergens {{are important in}} the pathogenesis in 1 / 3 of the cases. Several mechanisms {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of Atopic Dermatitis. Immediate reactions are identified by both measurement of specific IgE and skin prick test. Atopy Patch Test seems to be relevant in the investigation of patients with suspected delayed-type reactions. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the standardization of this method concerning allergen concentration, occlusion time and interpretation, and determine the specificity and sensitivity of the Atopy Patch Test according to the skin prick test and specific IgE levels in food allergy diagnosis in children with Atopic Dermatitis. METHODS: Seventy-two children, aged 2 - 12 years were selected and followed at the allergy clinic of the Hospital São Zacharias. Skin prick test, specific IgE and food Atopy Patch Test (cow's milk, egg, soy and wheat) were carried out. Three groups were submitted to the Atopy Patch Test: (1) Atopic Dermatitis with or without Rhinitis and Asthma; (2) Rhinitis and or Asthma without AD; (3) Healthy individuals. RESULTS: In group 1, 40 % of the patients presented positive reactions. The longer the exposure time (48 h and 72 h), the higher the sensitivity. In group 2, the test was more specific than sensitive for all the extracts, with increased sensitivity the longer the time of exposure (72 h). In group 3, 8. 3 % presented positive tests. CONCLUSION: APT evidenced a great diagnostic value in late-phase reactions to <b>food,</b> with high <b>specificity.</b> It showed to be a specific and reliable tool in comparison with the healthy group's results. FUNDAMENTOS: A Dermatite Atópica é uma doença inflamatória crônica da pele. Os alimentos são importantes na patogênese da doença em 1 / 3 dos casos. Diversos mecanismos estão envolvidos na fisiopatogenia da dermatite Atópica. As reações imediatas são identificadas pela dosagem de IgE específica e teste de puntura. O teste de contato atópico parece ter relevância na investigação de pacientes com suspeita de reação tardia. OBJETIVOS: Avaliar a padronização do método com relação à concentração do alérgeno, tempo de oclusão e de interpretação; e determinar a especificidade e a sensibilidade do teste de contato atópico em relação ao teste de puntura e a dosagem de IgE específica, no diagnóstico de alergia alimentar em crianças com dermatite Atópica. MÉTODOS: Setenta e duas crianças com 2 a 12 anos foram submetidas a teste de puntura e dosagem de IgE específicas para alimentos (leite de vaca, ovo, soja, trigo). O teste de contato atópico foi aplicado em 3 grupos: (1) Dermatite Atópica com ou sem Rinite e Asma; (2) Rinite e ou Asma sem Dermatite Atópica; (3) Saudáveis. RESULTADOS: No grupo 1, 40 % dos pacientes apresentaram reação positiva. Quanto maior o tempo de exposição, maior foi a sensibilidade. No grupo 2, o teste foi mais específico que sensível para todos os extratos; com aumento da sensibilidade com maior tempo de exposição (72 h). No grupo 3, 8. 3 % apresentaram testes positivos. CONCLUSÃO: O teste de contato atópico mostrou ter valor diagnóstico em relação às reações de fase tardia a alimentos, com elevada especificidade. Mostrou-se um teste específico e confiável ao comparar com os resultados do grupo controle...|$|R
