5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 {{exacerbated}} the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to harvest them {{prior to its}} arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the absence}} of Bertuzzi for the {{remainder}} of the season, Näslund led the Canucks to the Northwest Division title they had lost the previous season. Bertuzzi was replaced on the top line by Matt Cooke. The Canucks' division title placed them third in the Western Conference standings, matching them against the sixth-placed Calgary Flames in the opening round of the 2004 playoffs. In the seventh and deciding game of the series between the two teams, the Canucks faced a one-goal deficit in the final minute of regulation time. With the Canucks having pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker, Näslund stickhandled the length of the ice past two defenders, before shooting the puck on goal. Calgary goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff saved the shot before Cooke scored on the rebound with six seconds left in the game. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort,</b> Calgary subsequently eliminated Vancouver a minute-and-a-half into the subsequent overtime period on a powerplay goal. Näslund finished the playoffs with nine points in seven games.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the storm's passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing {{relief goods}} to {{residents}} throughout the affected provinces. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96percent to 13.03percent.|$|E

25|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> from WWE {{to promote}} the Brock Lesnar versus Goldberg contest, some critics {{expressed}} disappointment with the match, with many in Madison Square Garden booing both competitors and only cheering for Steve Austin {{because of the fact}} that both participants were set to leave the WWE after the event with Goldberg not signing a new contract and Lesnar going to work in the NFL. Goldberg returned to WWE in 2016 and reignited his rivalry with Lesnar, after the pair had been feuding for several months through social media and during promotional work for the WWE 2K17 video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. This would set up a rematch between the two at the 2016 Survivor Series, where Goldberg defeated Lesnar after two consecutive spears and a Jackhammer in 1 minute and 26 seconds. A final match between them occurred at WrestleMania 33 in April 2017, where Lesnar defeated Goldberg in a match for the Universal Championship to end the feud.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, McCotter had {{not reached}} the one percent polling {{threshold}} necessary {{to participate in}} the event's August 11 debate on Fox News.

500|$|At 10:00 on 27 May 1909, {{loaded with}} over 1,000passengers headed for Europe, Princess Alice {{departed}} the Lloyd pier in Hoboken, New Jersey. As she neared The Narrows {{in a heavy}} fog, she steamed to stay clear of outbound French Line steamer [...] and ran hard aground on a submerged rocky ledge near the seawall of Fort Wadsworth {{a few minutes after}} 11:00. After the fog lifted, it was revealed that the bow of Princess Alice had stopped some [...] from the outer walls of the Staten Island fort. Lighthouse tender Larkspur was the first ship to {{come to the aid of}} the Princess, followed by U.S. Army Quartermaster's ship General Meigs and revenue cutter Seneca. No passengers were hurt in the incident and it was determined there was no damage to the hull of the liner. But, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> of attending ships, she remained stuck on the ledge. Eventually, after offloading [...] of cargo from her front hold onto lighters called to the scene, ten steam tugs and power from Princess Alices own engines freed the ship at 01:47 on 28May, almost 15hours after running aground. The force required to free the liner was great enough that she was then propelled into SSMarken, at anchor some distance away, damaging one of that ship's fenders. After then making her way to the nearby New York City Quarantine Station, Princess Alice anchored to reload her cargo, and by 09:05, she was underway again. However, she ran aground again in soft mud in Ambrose Channel at 10:15. This time she was able to free herself and proceeded on to Bremen, a little more than 24hours late. This voyage was further marred by the apparent suicide of a despondent New York attorney on 30 May. The man, headed to the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse, had previously suffered a nervous breakdown and was under the care of a doctor on board the ship at the time he jumped overboard.|$|E
