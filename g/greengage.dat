25|$|The aromas {{and flavor}} notes of Chenin blanc often include the {{descriptors}} of minerally, <b>greengage,</b> angelica and honey. Chenin wines produced from noble rot will often have notes of peaches and honey that develop into barley sugar, marzipan, and quince as they age. Dry or semi-sweet Chenin blanc from the Loire will often have notes apple, <b>greengage,</b> and chalky minerals that develop into more honey, acacia, and quince aromas. New World styles of Chenin, {{such as those}} of South Africa, are more often made to be consume young and exhibit rich tropical fruit notes such as banana, guava, pear, and pineapple. The alcohol level for dessert styles Chenin rarely goes above 12%, which keeps the wines more in balance. Drier styles of Chenin {{are more likely to be}} around 13.5%.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the start}} of the 1904 season, the <b>Greengages</b> played their home games at a {{baseball}} park 8 street and Hawthorne avenue in East Portland. Portland lost their first game 3-2 in 14 innings against the Spokane Indians. On April 26 in a game against the Tacoma Tigers two members of the <b>Greengages</b> were fined US$5 for arguing a strike call. The <b>Greengages</b> were losing money according to team president Dr. Emmett Drake. In June it was rumored that the team was going to be relocated to Salt Lake City, Utah, which the team management denied. On July 1, the league officials announced they were transferring the Portland team to Salt Lake City. Several players refused to play out of protest for the team's relocation from Portland. They were ultimately replaced. In Salt Lake City, the team was known as the [...] "Elders".|$|R
25|$|Asher {{was a child}} actress, and {{appeared}} in the 1952 film Mandy and the 1955 science fiction film The Quatermass Xperiment. She also played the title role in dramatised versions of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass in 1958 for Argo Records. In 1961 she co-starred in The <b>Greengage</b> Summer which was released in the United States as Loss of Innocence. She also appeared in the 1962 film and Disney TV programme, The Prince and the Pauper. British TV appearances included three episodes (1956–1958) of the ITV series The Adventures of Robin Hood, and as a panelist on the BBC's Juke Box Jury.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Greengage</b> plum {{was once}} the most popular plum in America. It is a very flavorful plum, but is too fragile for {{shipping}} over long distances.

2500|$|Although {{his career}} {{declined}} in the early 1960s, two of his own favourite films date from this time – The Comedy Man (1964) and The <b>Greengage</b> Summer (1961) with Susannah York, [...] "one of the happiest films on which I have ever worked." [...] He also enjoyed a revival in the much-acclaimed TV adaptation of The Forsyte Saga (1967) and the Father Brown series (1974).|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{differences}} between Old world and New world styles of Chenin blanc is the fermentation temperature. Old World style producers in the Loire tend to ferment their Chenin blanc at higher temperatures, 60-68°F (16-20°C), than New World producers in South Africa and elsewhere, usually fermenting their whites at temperatures around 50-54°F (10-12°C). This is because Old World wine producers tend not to put a premium on the tropical fruit flavors and aromas that come out more vividly with cooler fermentation temperatures. Chenin blanc can accommodate some skin contact and maceration which will allow extraction of phenolic compounds that could add {{to the complexity of}} the wine. Two of the aromas that skin contact can bring out is the characteristic <b>greengage</b> and angelica notes of Chenin. The grape's characteristic acidity can be softened by malolactic fermentation, which will give the wine a creamier or [...] "fattier" [...] texture as would a period spent aging on the lees. The use of wood or oak aging is up to each individual producer. Old World producers tend to shy away from the use of new oak barrels which can impart flavors of vanilla, spice, and toastiness; though these notes may be desirable for a New World producer. In Savennières there is a tradition of using acacia and chestnut barrels for aging; though acacia can impart a yellow tint to the wine, and chestnut barrels may add some buttery notes.|$|E

Now, I guess that will do for eatables. The presents for the children can go in on top.

60|$|The most curious {{result of}} this {{extremely}} absurd condition of mind is perhaps the alarm of religious persons on subjects of which one would have fancied most of the palpable difficulties had been settled before the nineteenth century. The theory of prayer, for instance, and of Miracles. I noticed a lengthy discussion in the newspapers {{a month or two}} ago, on the propriety of praying for, or against rain. It had suddenly, it seems, occurred to the public mind, and to that of the gentlemen who write the theology of the breakfast-table, that rain was owing to natural causes; and that it must be unreasonable to expect God to supply on our immediate demand what could not be provided but by previous evaporation. I noticed farther that this alarming difficulty was at least softened to some of our Metropolitan congregations by the assurances of their ministers, that, although, since the last lecture by Professor Tyndall at the Royal Institution, it had become impossible to think of asking God for any temporal blessing, they might still hope their applications for spiritual advantages would occasionally be successful;--thus implying that though material processes were necessarily slow, and the laws of Heaven respecting matter, inviolable, mental processes might be instantaneous, and mental laws at any moment disregarded by their Institutor: so that the spirit of a man might be brought to maturity in a moment, though the resources of Omnipotence would be overtaxed, or its consistency abandoned, in the endeavor to produce the same result On a <b>greengage.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Oxford English Dictionary regards [...] "gage" [...] and [...] "greengage" [...] as synonyms. However, not all gages are green, {{and some}} horticulturists make a {{distinction}} between the two words, with <b>greengages</b> as a variety of the gages, scientifically named Prunus domestica subsp. italica var. claudiana. The gages (P. d. ssp. italica) otherwise include the large and usually purple to blackish but occasionally bright yellow round plums (var. subrotunda, e.g. the Ontario plum), as well as the ancient and little-known Austrian varieties Punze (var. rotunda) and Weinkriech (var. vinaria).|$|R
50|$|Pelian cuisine {{specializes in}} charcuterie, its most famed dish being spentzofáï, a hearty stew made of sliced pork sausage that is first cooked on its own, then stewed with {{green and red}} peppers, mild or hot {{as the case may}} be, and {{shallots}} or small onions; eggplant or tomatoes are added when seasonally available. Pelion is also renowned for its orchard fruit, with pride of place going to the firíki, an originally Egyptian apple varietal of very small, oval-shaped, intensely fragrant, crisp and slightly tart apples that withstand long storage without refrigeration. There is also wide cultivation of plums, especially mirabelles and <b>greengages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Greengages</b> {{are widely}} grown in {{particular}} in western Europe. The core of their range extends from France to southern England. In Germany, where they are called Reneklode or Ringlotte, numerous cultivars have been developed too. In Poland and the Czech Republic, they are known as ringle, in Hungary as ringló, and in Slovakia as ringloty. They are widely grown, typically for stewing in syrup to make a compote. At least the green cultivars breed more or less true from seed. Several similar cultivars produced from seedlings are now available; some of these include other plum cultivars in their parentage.

5000|$|Preserving {{sugar is}} a kind of sugar used for making marmalades, jams and {{preserves}} using fruits that are naturally high in pectin (such as plums, redcurrants, blackcurrants, gooseberries, <b>greengages,</b> damsons and Seville oranges). The large sugar crystals dissolve more slowly than those of standard granulated sugar and do not settle {{in the bottom of the}} pot or rise up as froth to the surface. This reduces the risk of burning and the consequent need for stirring. It also allows impurities to rise for easier skimming. Because it minimizes scum, it helps to make jams and jellies clearer.|$|R
