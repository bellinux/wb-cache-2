60|$|Master Gookin's aspect, as <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> was {{doubtful}} and troubled.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> softly, {{still holding}} Snip in his arms.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and passed}} out. The {{secretary}} {{looked at him}} interrogatively.|$|R
5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna {{fear that they}} would be fired if anyone found out and they swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his cooperation is that Milhouse will inherit Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school and social life continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed in front of his classmates by having to say one of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{leading out}} of the city, and steps out to view the sunrise.

Murdoch reintroduces himself as they walk to Shell Beach, beginning their relationship anew.|$|E
2500|$|Act 3 opens as a {{deliberate}} replay of Act1, {{but this time}} with Helena at the ironing-board wearing Jimmy's Act1 red shirt. Months have passed. Jimmy is notably more pleasant to Helena than he was to Alison in Act1. She actually laughs at his jokes, {{and the three of}} them (Jimmy, Cliff, and Helena) get into a music hall comedy routine that obviously is not improvised. Cliff announces that he's decided to strike out on his own. As Jimmy leaves the room to get ready for a final night out for the three of them, <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to find Alison, looking like death. Instead of caring for her he snaps over his shoulder [...] "Friend of yours to see you" [...] and abruptly leaves.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and showed}} her out. Then {{he came back to}} Peter.|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> inner {{room for}} Betty, and {{followed}} her in.|$|R
2500|$|Alex coyly feigns illness to {{his parents}} {{to stay out of}} school the next day. Following an {{unexpected}} visit from P.R. Deltoid, his [...] "post-corrective adviser", Alex visits a record store, where he meets two pre-teen girls. He invites them back to the flat, where he drugs and rapes them. The next morning, Alex finds his droogs in a mutinous mood, waiting downstairs in the torn-up and graffitied lobby. Georgie challenges Alex for leadership of the gang, demanding that they pull a [...] "man-sized" [...] job. Alex quells the rebellion by slashing Dim's hand and fighting with Georgie, then in a show of generosity, takes them to a bar, where Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy elderly woman. Alex breaks in and knocks the woman unconscious, but when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to let the others in, Dim strikes him in payback for the earlier fight. The gang abandons Alex on the front step to be arrested by the police; while in their custody, he learns that the woman has died from her injuries.|$|E
60|$|His knock is {{immediately}} answered by Mr. Crisparkle himself. When <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> candle in hand, his cheerful face falls, and disappointed amazement is in it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--nothing, {{except he}} seems so scary, and keeps his doors locked {{night and day}} both, and when you knock he won't let you in till <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> a crack and sees who it is." ...|$|E
60|$|And so saying <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and led <b>the</b> {{way into}} the house.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and Sophy {{passed out}} before him. She had dropped her veil.|$|R
60|$|He gladly {{accepted}} the invitation. Mrs. Callender stopped him as <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for her.|$|R
6000|$|Jasper murders Edwin inefficiently; {{he has a}} fit; {{while he}} is {{unconscious}} the quicklime revives Edwin, by burning his hand, say, and, during Jasper's swoon, Edwin, like another famous prisoner, [...] "has a happy thought, <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and walks out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dan, I {{think you}} can help me out," [...] {{suggested}} Dick. [...] "You might go to the door and call out that there is a telegram for Belright Fogg. Then, when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> push into the room and we'll follow." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{is fairly}} caught, {{and he gives}} way with his best grace. As <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the nearest room for her ladyship, he furtively consults his watch, and says in his inmost soul, [...] "How am I {{to get rid of}} her before the others come?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{very gently}} <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and they passed in together, closing it behind them.|$|R
50|$|A talent scout, <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of {{opportunity}} and success to many performing artistes and technicians.|$|R
60|$|After some {{twisting}} and turning of the key, the heavy lock yielded, and <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
6000|$|We have a butler! He doesn't buttle, but {{the point}} of the thing is the style. When Fanny gardens, he stands over her and looks genteel. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and I am told waits at table. Well, what's the odds; I shall have it on my tomb--"He ran a butler." ...|$|E
60|$|HOW {{goes the}} night? Saint Giles's clock is {{striking}} nine. The weather is dull and wet, {{and the long}} lines of street lamps are blurred, as if we saw them through tears. A damp wind blows and rakes the pieman's fire out, when <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of his little furnace, carrying away an eddy of sparks.|$|E
60|$|The studio. The easel {{is pushed}} {{back to the}} wall. Cardinal Death, holding his scythe and {{hour-glass}} like a sceptre and globe, sits on the throne. On the hat-stand hang the hats of Sir Patrick and Bloomfield Bonington. Walpole, just come in, is hanging up his beside them. There is a knock. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and finds Ridgeon there.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and found}} himself confronting an {{extraordinarily}} tall and thin young man in evening-dress.|$|R
60|$|With <b>the</b> words <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{of a small}} closet, {{into which}} he shut the Colonel.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> without knocking, without {{stopping}} to listen outside. Not a creature {{was in the}} room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{somewhat}} in this fashion:--W'enever <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> I'll clap {{my hand on}} his mouth to stop his pipe, and you'll slip behind him, throw yer arms about him, and hold on till I tie a handkerchief over his mouth. Arter that we'll tie {{his hands and feet}} with whatever we can git hold of--his own necktie, mayhap--take the keys from him, and git out the best way we can." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here {{is another}} splendid game, T. Sandys, inventor. The girl {{goes into the}} bed, the boy shuts the door on her, and imitates {{the sound of a}} train in motion. <b>He</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and cries, [...] "Tickets, please." [...] The girl says, [...] "What is the name of this place?" [...] The boy replies, [...] "It's Thrums!" [...] There is more to follow, but the only two who have played the game always roared so joyously at this point that they could get no farther.|$|E
60|$|Hodson {{goes to the}} house. When <b>he</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{he finds}} Nora and Aunt Judy on the threshold. He stands aside to let them pass, with {{the air of a}} well trained servant oppressed by heavy trials. Then he goes in. Broadbent rises. Aunt Judy goes to the table and {{collects}} the plates and cups on the tray. Nora goes {{to the back of the}} rustic seat and looks out at the gate with the air of a woman accustomed to have nothing to do. Larry returns from the shrubbery.|$|E
60|$|At <b>the</b> {{moment when}} <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> Julian's {{contempt}} for him burst {{its way through}} all restraints.|$|R
60|$|She stopped breathing; {{her fingers}} closed convulsively on <b>the</b> chair. As <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> she sprang up.|$|R
60|$|Falkenberg {{had already}} departed. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of his room. His {{secretary}} rose hastily to his feet.|$|R
