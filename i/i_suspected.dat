500|$|Hopkins {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers (as happens in the book). [...] "Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's a moral issue there. I {{think it would have been}} a very interesting thing though. I think it would have been very interesting had she gone off, because <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her. I guessed that a long time ago, at the last phone call to Clarice, at the end of SotL, she said, 'Dr. Lecter, Dr. Lecter...'." ...|$|E
500|$|Green {{wrote that}} Campbell [...] "enjoyed taking the 'devil's advocate' {{position}} {{in almost any}} area, willing to defend even viewpoints with which he disagreed if {{that led to a}} livelier debate." [...] As an example, he wrote, Campbell [...] "pointed out that the much-maligned 'peculiar institution' of slavery in the American South had in fact provided the blacks brought there with a higher standard of living than they had in Africa... <b>I</b> <b>suspected,</b> from comments by Asimov, among others– and some Analog editorials I had read– that John held some racist views, at least in regard to blacks." [...] Finally, however, Green agreed with Campbell that [...] "rapidly increasing mechanization after 1850 would have soon rendered slavery obsolete anyhow. It would have been better for the USA to endure it a few more years than suffer the truly horrendous costs of the Civil War." ...|$|E

500|$|The British premiere at the 1988 Edinburgh Festival brought {{critical}} praise: [...] "Through its sheer cleverness, wit, lyrical {{beauty and}} sense of theater, it sweeps aside most of the criticism to which it lays itself open." [...] When the work was finally performed in London, 13 years after its Houston premiere and after {{a long period of}} theatrical neglect, Tempos critic Robert Stein responded to ENO's 2000 production enthusiastically. He particularly praised the performance of Maddalena, and concluded that [...] "Adams's triumph... consists really in taking a plot chock-full of talk and public gesture, and through musical characterisation... making a satisfying and engaging piece." [...] Of the ENO revival in 2006, Erica Jeal of The Guardian wrote that [...] "from its early visual coup {{with the arrival of the}} plane, Sellars' production is an all-too-welcome reminder of his best form". In Jeal's view, the cast met admirably the challenge of presenting the work in a non-satirical spirit. Reviewing the 2008 Portland Opera production (the basis of the 2011 Canadian Opera Company presentation in Toronto), critic Patrick J. Smith concluded that [...] "Nixon in China is a great American Opera. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> that it was a significant work when I saw it in 1987; I was ever more convinced of its stature when I heard it subsequently, on stage and on disc, and today I am certain that it is one of the small handful of operas that will survive." ...|$|E
500|$|The bassline in [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] {{is taken}} from the 1984 Dennis Edwards song [...] "Don't Look Any Further". The chorus of [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] is a play on the chorus of Junior M.A.F.I.A's [...] "Player's Anthem." [...] The phrase [...] "take money" [...] is {{repeated}} throughout the song, which is a play on Junior M.A.F.I.A's recent release [...] "Get Money", {{which is also the}} beat used in [...] "Hit 'Em Up". Faith Evans, who at the time was Biggie's estranged wife, was reportedly seen with Shakur after a public breakup with Biggie. Journalist Chuck Philips spotted Faith Evans at Can Am when he interviewed Shakur a year earlier in 1995. People at the studio told the reporter that Faith Evans also contributed—that the R chanteuse recorded one or more “Take Money” background vocals that would appear on “Hit Em Up.” In his October 1995 interview of the rapper, Philips remembered in 2012, [...] "I was so unaware of the bi-coastal rap war that <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> nothing when Faith Evans appeared with Shakur at Can Am. The estranged wife of Biggie was recording background vocals for [...] "Wonda Why They Call U Bitch", a song which was at the time yet to be released. According to Shakur she had given him gifts of clothing, which he offered as proof of a relationship in an interview. Using this against Biggie in [...] "Hit 'Em Up", Shakur continued to fuel the rumors of a sexual relationship with Evans in the song's line [...] "You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife." [...] Claims of an affair with Evans appear three times in the song.|$|E

My opinion did not change when she played at the Hamilton Club and I got to know her better.

2500|$|Addressing {{his earlier}} {{statement}} comparing actors to cattle, Hitchcock {{said in an}} interview with François Truffaut:I'm not quite sure in what context I might have made such a statement. It may have been made ... when we used actors who were simultaneously performing in stage plays. When they had a matinee, and <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> they were allowing themselves plenty of time for a very leisurely lunch. And this meant that we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time. I couldn't help feeling that if they'd been really conscientious, they'd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab, on the way to the theatre, and get there in time to put on their make-up and go on stage. I had no use for that kind of actor.|$|E

I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E
2500|$|I have it now. Many years ago, when I was {{studying}} for the gallows, I had a dear comrade, a youth {{who was not}} in my line, but still a scrupulously good fellow though devious. He was preparing {{to qualify for a}} place on the board, for {{there was going to be}} a vacancy by superannuation in about five years. This was down South, in the slavery days. It was the nature of the negro then, as now, to steal watermelons. They stole three of the melons of an adoptive brother of mine, the only good ones he had. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> three of a neighbor’s negroes, but there was no proof, and, besides, the watermelons in those negroes’ private patches were all green and small and not up to indemnity standard. But in the private patches of three other negroes there was a number of competent melons. I consulted with my comrade, the understudy of the board. He said that if I would approve his arrangements he would arrange. I said, “Consider me the board; I approve; arrange.” So he took a gun and went and collected three large melons for my brother-on-the-halfshell, and one over. I was greatly pleased and asked: ...|$|E

2500|$|Austin Nichols portrays Julian Baker, Peyton's ex-boyfriend from Los Angeles. [...] "The {{funny thing}} about Austin {{is that there was}} {{initially}} much resistance from the folks who have to OK our casting choices. Which is not rare, by the way," [...] commented Schwahn. [...] "When that happens, I {{pick up the phone and}} try to rationalize with everyone, or pout or bitch or whine and eventually I get my way (and probably get called an ass****) and this leads to Austin Nichols killing it as Julian, just as <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> he would in the first place." [...] Schwahn added, [...] "This is not to say that there aren't good people and good allies working on my show at both the studio and network, just that the fans would be surprised at how things work behind the scenes." [...] A regular from season 7, Julian initially comes to Tree Hill to win Peyton back. He offers to produce a film based on Lucas's first book. At first, Peyton does not reveal to Lucas that Julian is her ex-boyfriend, but she is forced to do so when the plans of the movie take shape. Brooke rebuffs his advances until Peyton gives her blessing when she sees that Brooke has a serious interest in Julian. After Brooke opens up to Julian, they begin a relationship.|$|E
