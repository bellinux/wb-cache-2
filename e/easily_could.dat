500|$|In 2012, Kunis co-starred with Mark Wahlberg in Ted, {{her most}} commercially {{successful}} film to date. The film was directed and co-written by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. Kunis played the girlfriend of Wahlberg's character. When MacFarlane first conceived the project, he considered Kunis {{too young for}} the role. However, the film remained in development {{for several years and}} when it was finally ready to begin production, he ended up casting her. Ted has received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $549million worldwide. Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Kunis [...] "brings some lovely subtle grace notes to a role that <b>easily</b> <b>could</b> have just been 'the pushy girlfriend.|$|E
500|$|Interestingly, this [...] "novel" [...] ("romanzo") {{itself is}} a sort of forgery. As Henry Keazor in the German {{newspaper}} Frankfurter Rundschau could show in 2005 (see: [...] "Gefälscht!", April 12, 2005, No. 84, Forum Humanwissenschaften, p.16), Guarnieri has copied large parts of his book (sometime word by word) from Lord Kilbracken's 1967-biography. Since Guarnieri's brother Giovanni works as a translator, [...] Luigi <b>easily</b> <b>could</b> have had the English text translated into the Italian. Keazor shows that Guarnieri tried to cover his tracks by not referring to the book by Kilbracken – he only mentions (p.212) his earlier and different book (Master Art Forger. The story of Han van Meegeren, New York 1951) which, however, was published under Kilbracken's civil name [...] "John Godley".|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} critical acclaim from critics. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode calling it [...] "A super-sweet {{end to a}} super-sweet series!" [...] Mrs. Northman of television website, TV Fanatic said [...] "Overall, [...] "Hello Goodbye" [...] did wrap up each of our beloved characters lives in a nice pretty bow", they added [...] "We wanted MORE!" [...] The day after the episode's U.S. airing, {{a reporter for the}} British newspaper Daily Mail praised Betty's transformation saying [...] "Gone were the thick-rimmed glasses and braces that once defined America Ferrera's character, and in its place a professional career woman signalling the completion of a four-year metamorphosis." [...] However, some critics felt the ending of the episode was not enough. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald gave the episode a mixed review saying it was [...] "like one long hug with loved ones you don't want to leave," [...] but added the conclusion was [...] "unsatisfying". New York magazine said [...] "The cast of Ugly Betty damn well earned a happy ending — and that's exactly what creator Silvio Horta gave them last night on the series finale". However, they also found the conclusion to be unsatisfying saying [...] "The one-hour finale <b>easily</b> <b>could</b> have been longer, meaning some plotlines went unresolved." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post said [...] "Last night, Ugly Betty attempted to earn a place in TV history, but I fear their last episode will be quickly forgotten by the fans". Wieselman also added [...] "On a show that always favored high drama and cool camp, I was saddened to see everyone get such an expected ending". Wieselman, however, did enjoy the final scene calling it [...] "pitch-perfect".|$|E
500|$|As early reviews {{focused on}} Ben Hawkins, Brother Justin Crowe {{and the meaning}} of Carnivàle, the show's {{supporting}} characters received little to no attention other than having their freak appearances mentioned, according to Varietys Phil Gallo because [...] "they don't play significant parts in the first few episodes." [...] Critics who reviewed full seasons gave more credit. Wendy Tuohy of the Australian newspaper The Age stated that show creator Daniel Knauf [...] "sprinkled enough magical gifts over the carnival's cast of mind readers, fortunetellers, snake charmers, catatonic psychics, conjoined twins, bearded ladies and lizard men to make the bizarre and the macabre appear just about routine." [...] Matt Casamassina of IGN added that [...] "from the opening sequence to the fade out on episode 12 , Carnivàle successfully draws you into the Depression-engulfed world of its many oddly likeable characters. And sure enough, odd best describes these people [...] The show prominently features all manners of freaks, but each is well-crafted, layered, and believable, rather than comical, as <b>easily</b> <b>could</b> have been the case under amateur direction." [...] MSNBC acknowledged the characters [...] "speak in a dialogue that feels authentic, even if that authenticity is a modern interpretation [...] Carnivàle manager Samson, Michael J. Anderson gets the best dialogue, dropping terrifically incomprehensible lines." [...] DVD Talk lauded Amy Madigan (Iris), Tim DeKay (Jonesy), and Clea DuVall (Sofie) as [...] "fantastic choices" [...] with particularly convincing 1930s looks. They highlighted Carnivàles status as an ensemble show, with [...] "the performances of all the supporting characters [...] essential to the show's success. Particularly inspired is the voice of Linda Hunt as the decidedly creepy 'Management' and John Savage as Henry Scudder." [...] A DVDTown review further praised the supporting performances of Patrick Bauchau (Lodz) and Michael J. Anderson (Samson), pointing out that [...] "in fact, every single character on the show, no matter how small, quirky or sinister they are, produce noteworthy performances all round. It is through the efforts of this outstanding cast that makes the entire premise of the show and the period setting so realistic and believable that the audience can't help but get immersed in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{staff at}} Variety {{magazine}} also gave the film a good review and praised the acting. They wrote, [...] "Thesp [...] inserts plenty of menace into a psycho character, never too heavily done, and gets good backing from his costar, Sterling Hayden, as sheriff, {{in a less}} showy role but just as authoritatively handled. Lewis Allen's direction manages a smart piece where static treatment <b>easily</b> <b>could</b> have prevailed." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is a document, a bill, {{which states}} in the year 670 a {{delivery}} of 40 [...] "moyos" [...] (casks of 250 liters) of [...] "aceite de ballena" [...] (whale oil) or [...] "grasa de ballena" [...] (whale blubber) was made from Bayonne to the abbey of Jumièges, between Le Havre and Rouen, for its use in illumination. The authors that assessed this document suggest for such a request {{to be made by}} such a distant monastery that Basque whaling must have been well known – although the oil or blubber <b>easily</b> <b>could</b> have come from a stranded whale whose products were usurped by the church.|$|E
2500|$|Given {{that those}} who retaliated were {{thought to have been}} given more lenient {{penalties}} than those who instigated, and given that — because Carlton were not in the finals — Caspar's penalty represented the first four home-and-home games in 1952, and given that Essendon were, indeed, playing in the 1951 finals, it was generally thought by those present at the tribunal that, if Coleman was to receive any penalty at all, he would be given no more than two weeks. The chairman announced a penalty of four weeks. Many years later, the tribunal's chairman, Tom Hammond, agreed that whilst the tribunal had been technically correct in its penalty, given that [...] "there was no precedent" [...] for regarding retaliation as a lesser offence, that he now believed that the tribunal had been wrong and that it <b>easily</b> <b>could</b> have created such a precedent ...|$|E
2500|$|When President Jimmy Carter in 1979 {{broke off}} {{relations}} with the ROC {{in order to establish}} {{relations with the}} PRC, Congress responded by passing the Taiwan Relations Act that maintained relations, but stopped short of full recognition of the ROC. In 1982 President Ronald Reagan also saw that the Six Assurances were adopted, the fifth being that the United States would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, United States policy has remained ambiguous. In the House International Relations Committee on April 21, 2004, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, James A. Kelly, was asked by Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) whether America's commitment to Taiwan's democracy conflicted with the so-called One-China Policy. He admitted the difficulty of defining the U.S.'s position: [...] "I didn’t really define it, and I’m not sure I very <b>easily</b> <b>could</b> define it." [...] He added, [...] "I can {{tell you what it is}} not. It is not the One-China principle that Beijing suggests." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{agreeing that}} the {{fighting}} on Little Round Top was extremely fierce and soldiers {{on both sides}} fought valiantly, historians disagree as {{to the impact of}} this particular engagement on the overall outcome of the Battle of Gettysburg. The traditional viewone that emerged in the 1880sis that the left flank of the Union army was a crucial position. An example of this view is from 1900: [...] "If the Confederates had seized [...] and dragged some of their artillery up there, as they <b>easily</b> <b>could</b> have done, they would have enfiladed Meade's entire line and made it too unhealthy for him to remain there." [...] An alternative claim is that the hill's terrain offered a poor platform for artillery, and that had Longstreet secured the hill, the Union army would have been forced back to a better defensive position, making the attack on the hill a distraction from the Confederates' true objective. This latter theory is supported by General Lee's writings, in which he appears to have considered Little Round Top irrelevant. In Lee's report after the Gettysburg Campaign, he stated in part, [...] "General Longstreet was delayed by a force occupying the high, rocky hills on the enemy's extreme left, from which his troops could be attacked in reverse as they advanced", suggesting Longstreet was ordered on a course intended to bypass Little Round Tophad the hill been a key objective of the assault, Lee would not have used the phrase [...] "delayed by" [...] in describing the effects of the engagement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{episode was}} {{unanimously}} acclaimed by critics, who largely praised the episode's complexity and writing. Ken Keeler won a 2011 Writer's Guild Award for writing [...] "The Prisoner of Benda." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review, rating it an A-. [...] Handlen compared the episode favorably {{to the season}} 4 episode [...] "The Farnsworth Parabox", writing, [...] "Really, this is pure silly from beginning to end, using the show's internal logic to arrive in unpredictable places, and bringing to life a piece of fan fiction I doubt anyone has ever {{had the courage to}} write. It reminded me more than a little of 'The Farnsworth Parabox': a premise that uses the whole cast to just the right amount." [...] Merrill Barr of Film School Rejects also gave the episode a positive review, praising the character development of Scruffy the Janitor in particular. With respect to the logic puzzle nature of the plot, Barr stated, [...] "I have never understood less {{of what was going on}} in a single episode of Futurama. And I couldn't have loved it more." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode 9.1/10. [...] He praised the intricate plot and writing, also comparing it to [...] "The Farnsworth Parabox" [...] and [...] "Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles", writing, [...] "...this sort of intertwined, Altman-esque plot offers up a level of complexity rarely offered by sitcoms, or any episodic television. 'The Prisoner of Benda' was a perfect example of how Futurama takes an extremely simple concept and executes it in a daring and unique way. It's not as showy as 'A Clockwork Origin' or 'The Late Philip J. Fry' from an animation standpoint, but with writing this tight we could be watching stick figures at 8 frames a second and it would still be worth seeing." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 9.5/10, stating [...] "'The Prisoner of Benda' was an absolutely stellar episode. The high-concept idea of switching minds/bodies was taking [...] to extremes and delivered fantastic lines and great laughs throughout." [...] In response to this episode UGO Entertainment critic Alex Zalben concluded that [...] "this season of Futurama, despite a miss or two, has hit what might possibly be a series high for the past few episodes, and I can't wait to watch the rest. Kudos to Comedy Central for bringing back what is now officially the best animated show on TV." [...] Alasdair Wilkins of io9 also praised the episode's mathematical complexity, saying [...] "This episode is maybe the most epically overstuffed Futurama episode ever, with only the intersecting ensemble piece [...] "Three Hundred Big Boys" [...] even coming close. 'The Prisoner of Benda' <b>easily</b> <b>could</b> have stretched out to a 70-minute DVD movie, but I'm just as happy to see it as 22 minutes of finely concentrated crazy." [...] In an interview, Futurama writer Eric Rogers stated that this was his favorite episode of the season.|$|E
