40|$|Now a days {{entire world}} depends upon {{automobile}}s. In an automobile motion {{is transferred from}} engine to rear wheel through various mechanical links. But differential gear box plays {{a vital role in}} the automobile for transferring motion from engine to rear axle. Normally single differential gear box is used for light weight vehicles but heavy load vehicles two or more rear axles with differential gear boxes are used for transferring maximum amount of power from engine to rear axles. So here it is focused on the mechanical design and analysis of double axle differential gear box as it transmits the power.

40|$|The {{product range}} of the rail vehicle {{industry}} comprises the construction of railroad material for long-distance and short-distance transport. This includes, for example, locomotives and cars, subway, light railway and tramway cars as well as rail vehicle equipment. The development of the industry {{is determined by the}} demand for transport services and government actions for the extension of railways and procurement of suitable vehicle types. In contrast to road vehicles, differential gears are only used in a negligible percentage of rail vehicles. Primarily in the short-distance rail transport sector, the demand for differential gears is growing due to increased drive power, smaller wheel diameters, lower vehicle mass with higher load capacity, the introduction of low-floor technology as well as the requirement of employing ever more quiet vehicles. In hydrostatic self-locking differential gears, oil is supplied to the gears within the <b>differential</b> <b>gearbox.</b> They only rotate relative to each other when the differential gear performs a compensation movement. In this case, oil is transported in the tooth space to the meshing of the gears, where it is displaced due to the meshing and must drain through tight gaps. The pressure generated by this process acts against the compensation movement of the gear, and the drive torque is transmitted to the wheel that has the higher friction. The achievable locking torque is linearly dependent on the differential speed of the drive wheel. This locking effect is achieved without wear-prone components and works automatically without active external intervention. The design space required corresponds to that of conventional differential gears, as the locking effect is integrated in the existing design. (orig.)

40|$|Due to high {{customer}} {{demand for}} safety degree in automotive, the safety functions in vehicles {{have a special}} meaning. Torque vectoring function as an active safety function, generates an additional yaw moment by means of asymmetrical driving forces on both vehicle sides, {{in order to improve}} or correct the steering behaviour. In comparison to the conventional vehicles, the electric vehicles have the advantage to realize this function without special <b>differential</b> <b>gearbox.</b> Furthermore, a high-dynamic torque can be performed by an electrical drive train. The entire torque vectoring function in electric vehicles includes the control of the electrical drive train, the mechanical drive train and the vehicle dynamic. In order to implement a high-performance application, the challenge will be faced, that both the system constraints and uncertainties as well as the control dynamic should be taken into account. In order to achieve a satisfying compromise, the model predictive control (MPC) is chosen as theoretical fundamental for this work, surveyed and implemented for the application. The critical control problems in electrical drive train are represented by parameter variation of the induction motor, the dead time, as well as the current and voltage limitations. Two solutions are implemented to handle the parameter variation. In the first one, the min-max control method is applied. The control problem is described by a linear parameter-varying (LPV) system with polytopic uncertainties. The robustness of the system is ensured by solving the worst case restricted by a Lyapunov function. The other solution is based on the so-called tube MPC method. Instead of a LPV system, a linear time invariant (LTI) system is used. The deviation between the LTI and the real system are limited by a robust positive invariant (RPI) set. By determining the minimum RPI (mRPI), both the robustness and the optimality are ensured. In contrast to other solutions, the system constraints are reformulated by torque constraint in this work instead of the current and voltage constraints. The advantage is that, no approximation to fulfill the constraint form is necessary and the optimality is therefore enhanced. In the mechanical drive train, the primary task is actively damping the oscillation of the transmitted torque. By means of a MPC controller with feedback compensation, the torsional oscillation on the side shaft is significantly suppressed. To complete the torque vectoring function, the yaw rate control as the main component and the tire slip control as auxiliary component are implemented. In addition, the operation strategy is implemented to provide a reliable reference yaw rate depending on the driving situations. Since only standard sensors are available in vehicles, a strategy is implemented for the control software to estimate the values, which are not measurable. The aforementioned subsystems are integrated and validated on a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) test bench. The driving maneuvers specified in ISO 7401 are applied for the tests. The results show, that the implemented function is able to both improve the steering behavior of the vehicle system, and guarantee the vehicle stability up to the system constraints...|$|E

40|$|In the {{automobile}} industry, the mechanical losses resulting from friction are {{largely responsible for}} various kinds of surface damage, such as the scuffing occurring in some mechanical assemblies. These scuffing processes seem {{to be due to}} a local loss of lubrication between certain mechanical elements of the same assembly, leading to a sharp increase in the friction, which can lead to a surface and volume damage in some of them, and even can cause, in the worst case, the whole destruction of the mechanical system if it has continued to operate. Predicting and checking the occurrence of this kind of undesirable phenomena, especially in some principal systems of the vehicle, represents nowadays, a crucial challenge in terms of automobile reliability and safety.

40|$|Iterative {{learning}} control (ILC) algorithms {{are employed in}} many applications, especially these involving single-input and single-output plants undertaking repeated tasks with finite-time interval. ILC is applicable to systems executing a repeated trajectory tracking task, and uses data recorded over previous trials {{in the construction of}} the next control input. The objective is to sequentially improve tracking accuracy as the trial number increases. This method has been shown to operate well in the presence of significant modeling uncertainty and exogenous disturbances. However, for MIMO (multiple input -multiple output) systems, there exist far fewer applications reported in the literature, and minimal benchmarking and evaluation studies have been undertaken. To tackle this shortcoming, this thesis focuses on designing an electromechanical test-bed which can verify the weaknesses and the advantages of various ILC methods on a purpose-built platform. The system has two inputs and two outputs and enables variation of the interaction between inputs and outputs through simple and rapid parameter modification. This interaction variation permits the control problem to be modified, allowing stipulation over the challenge presented to the ILC controller. The system is made up of two back-to-back <b>differential</b> <b>gearboxes</b> with mass-spring damper components to increase the system order and control difficulty. In its standard configuration, two motors provide torque to the two input ports and the two outputs are measured using encoders. This work enables a comparative summary of ILC approaches for MIMO systems, together with modifications for improved performance and robustness, and the development of new control schemes incorporating input and output constraints and point-to point tracking capability. The system can also be configured in a variety of other arrangements, varying the number of inputs and outputs, and allowing noise to be injected using a dc motor. Models of the system are derived using a lumped parameter system representation, as well as purely from experimental input and output data. Simple structure controllers such as proportional-type ILC, derivative-type ILC and phase-lead ILC are then applied to test the combined performance of the controller and the MIMO system, and establish its efficacy as a benchmarking platform. Advanced controllers are then derived and applied and experimental data are used to confirm theoretical findings concerning the link between interaction and convergence rate, input norm and robustness...|$|R

5000|$|The chassis {{featured}} a triple bulkhead monocoque {{made of a}} composite of carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb, which was manufactured by the Lille-based SNPE company. The bodywork was quite bulky, as the sidepods housed large water and oil coolers. The GD-01 had a conventional suspension, featuring wishbones with pushrod-actuated shock absorbers. The car {{featured a}} low-nose configuration, which was gradually being abandoned in favour of higher noses by other F1 teams at the time, although the Reynard engineers had tested both configurations. The car's overall aerodynamic package {{has been described by}} motorsport author Sam Collins as [...] "underdeveloped". The GD-01 was powered by a Ford Cosworth ED V8 engine - a new unit for the three-litre era of F1 that began in 1995 - which was a standard contemporary choice for smaller teams due to its low cost and ease of installation. The engine had a mileage of 400 mi before rebuilds, a weight of 129.5 kg, a rev limit of 13,500 rpm, and maximum power of [...] at 13,200 rpm. It was initially thought that the chassis would be powered by a Mugen-Honda engine as part of a low-key return to F1 for Honda, but negotiations between the parties came to nought. The car's transmission was a six-speed sequential unit built specially for the team by British company Xtrac, which also supplied the team's <b>differential.</b> Xtrac <b>gearboxes</b> were also used in the Minardi M195 and Simtek S951 chassis in 1995.

5000|$|In {{the early}} {{motoring}} days when series production {{did not yet}} exist the process of acquiring a new vehicle needed two major decisions, selection of a vehicle manufacturer and selection of a coachbuilder.

30|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{examples}} of what data, at the time not yet called “big” data, can do when properly collected and analyzed is from the area of sports and refers to the Oakland Athletics baseball team and their coach Billy Beane, {{who was able to}} use statistics and player data to revamp the team from an unsuccessful one into a pretty successful one within a limited time span. The story is well documented in [12] and a movie based on that book. The already mentioned Doug Laney gives a more recent example from sports, namely from the Indy 500 race happening in the USA every year on Memorial Day weekend. According to Laney, a present-day Indy 500 race car is on the inside “smattered with nearly 200 sensors constantly measuring the performance of the engine, clutch, <b>gearbox,</b> <b>differential,</b> fuel system, oil, steering, tires, drag reduction system, and dozens of other components, as well as the drivers’ health. These sensors spew about 1  GB of telemetry per race to engineers poring over them during the race and data scientists crunching them between races. According to McLaren, “its computers run a thousand simulations during the race. After just a couple laps they can predict the performance of each subsystem with up to 90  % accuracy. And since most of these subsystems can be tuned during the race, engineers, pit crews and drivers can proactively make minute adjustments throughout the race as the car and conditions change”. Further details can be found on Laney’s blog, 4 and {{it is obvious that the}} situation for Formula 1 cars 5 or the NASCAR series is similar.|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of fuel cost escalation and increased stringent engine emission regulations, interest in counter-rotating open rotor engines (CRORs) has been renewed. R&D efforts are currently ongoing to develop the technologies required to ensure the appropriate levels of structural integrity, noise, vibrations and reliability. The assessment {{of the impact of}} the main low pressure preliminary design and control parameters of CRORs on mission fuel burn, certification noise and emissions is necessary to identify optimum design regions. These assessments aid the development process when compromises need to be performed as {{a consequence}} of design, operational or regulatory constraints. These assessments are not possible with the state-of-the-art aero-engine preliminary design simulation tools. Novel 0 -D performance models for counter-rotating propellers (CRPs) and <b>differential</b> planetary <b>gearboxes,</b> as well as 1 -D and 0 -D performance models for counter-rotating turbines (CRTs) were developed and verified using available data. These models were used to create 0 -D pusher geared (GOR) and direct drive (DDOR) open rotor engine performance simulation modules allowing the independent definition of the design and operation of each of the two counter-rotating parts of the CRP and CRT. A multi-disciplinary preliminary design simulation framework was built using the novel engine performance modules together with dedicated CROR aircraft performance, engine geometry and weight, gaseous emissions and certification noise simulation modules. Design space exploration and trade-off studies were performed and minimum fuel burn design regions were identified for both the pusher GOR and DDOR. A 160 PAX aircraft flying a business mission of 500 NM was chosen for these studies. Based on the assumptions made, the main conclusions of these studies are as follows. · Fuel burn reductions of ~ 1 - 2 % are possible through optimised propeller control · The propeller diameter for minimum mission fuel burn lies between 4. 26 and 4. 7 m · The design nozzle pressure ratio for minimum mission fuel burn lies between 1. 55 and 1. 6 · CRPs with 13 or 14 blades per propeller provide minimum mission fuel burn · Increasing spacing between the propellers reduces noise significantly (~ 6 EPNdB for each certification point) with a relatively small fuel burn penalty (~ 0. 3 - 0. 5 %) · Relative to unclipped designs, 20 % clipped CRPs reduce flyover noise by at least 2. 5 EPNdB and approach noise by at least 4. 5 EPNdB. The corresponding fuel burn penalty is ~ 2 % for a GOR and ~ 3. 5 % for a DDOR. · Sideline and flyover noise can be reduced by increasing the diameter of the CRP and appropriately controlling CRP rotational speeds. Approach noise can be reduced by either reducing the diameters or the rotational speeds of the propellers. · The rotational speed of the forward propeller for minimum noise is higher than that for minimum mission fuel burn for all the studied CROR designs. · Regardless of clipping, reducing the rotational speed of the rear propeller relative to the forward propeller reduces noise and, to a certain limit, also mission fuel burn. (further reductions in rotational speed would have an adverse effect on fuel burn) · An increase in the number of blades results in an increase in certification noise. The main recommendations for further work are as follows. · Integrating the 1 -D CRT model with the 0 -D DDOR performance model in order to assess the impact of different CRT design criteria at engine and mission levels · Developing preliminary design methods to account for changes in aircraft weight and aerodynamics due to changes in engine design and required cabin noise treatment...|$|R
40|$|Lately the {{discussion}} on how big impact vehicles {{has on the}} environment has grown bigger and bigger. The vehicle manufacturers are building cars, trucks, wheel loaders etc. that are {{getting more and more}} fuel efficient for every year. But where do the engineers at the companies make the improvements? The drivetrain is one area of the vehicle where many different sources of losses are found. The gearbox is one example, where the losses are both dependent and independent on the torque transferred by the gear pairs. The gearbox consists of several components that all of them contribute to the total system power loss. It is therefore of great interest to understand the magnitude of the losses in different components for different operating conditions, and also to be able to determine how they change with, for instance, rotational speed and load. There are currently some commercial software’s on the market that analyses how the losses in a drivetrain are distributed. These tools are useful for engineers when analyzing existing drivetrains, or when developing new products. The software’s shows how losses change depending on components, oils, engine speeds and load which helps the engineers concentrate on the right areas. Power loss calculations within these software’s are often based on simple and generalized methods. For instance could the user be needed to specify a contact friction coefficient of the system that will be held constant during the simulation. For starters a constant friction coefficient is a rather big simplification, and the task of assessing this value for the engineer is an intricate manner. In this Master of Science thesis work a module based, user friendly software is developed. The model is taking the biggest loss sources, for example <b>gearbox,</b> <b>differential</b> and tires into account in a system with static conditions. No losses due to the dynamics in the system will be taken in consideration in this model. The final model is a good base containing most of the components of a person’s vehicle with rear wheel drive. All components from crankshaft to asphalt are modelled in simple modules built by Simulink blocks and Matlab m-code. In the model created in this thesis all calculations are based on formulas from scientific experiments. This makes the loss calculations more advanced and accurate then the generalized formulas in most commercial software’s. It also gives the user bigger opportunities to for example use different methods to obtain the gear tooth contact friction coefficients. Two methods are currently implemented in the model. One method is to use an empirical formula, and the other is to use friction maps generated by experiments. As a result from the research program ProAct, lookup tables with friction coefficient depending on slide to roll ratio and entrainment speed can be implemented in the model. This makes it possible to show the difference in contact friction coefficients between the empirical formula and the friction maps. Ultimately, the purpose of the model {{is to be able to}} evaluate how a change in the system will affect the overall power loss in the drivetrain. A looped simulation between two mineral oils in this model shows that the gear frictional losses has the biggest influence on the total loss of the gearbox in a simulation of 31 investigated cases from 1000 rpm to 4000 rpm with an constant torque input of 100 Nm.
