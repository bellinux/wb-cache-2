She had collaborated much more frequently with Masayuki Mori. As Lady Wakasa, Kyō's costume was modeled after fashion before the Edo period and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> designed to appear similar to a mask common in Noh theatre.|$|E

25|$|It may {{be thought}} strange that I could abstain {{from a woman}} who to most people was so attractive. But though <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain {{circumstances}} in her person which completely checked it.|$|E

This was common from the 1950s through the early 1990s. The 1992 Colonial Echo yearbook includes mention of student Shawn Wilkins who dressed as the mascot. She wore a white dress with fringe, a headband with feathers, and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> painted (p.309).|$|E
25|$|Ann Marie only {{appeared}} onscreen once, in {{the final}} episode, in which she and Dalton renewed their wedding vows (<b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> obscured by her bridal veil); however, she was sometimes seen in shadow in scenes set near their home (her voice was provided by Jennifer Irwin). Their daughter, Tabitha, appeared in the film Duct Tape Forever, played by Tracy Dawson, although there she {{goes by the name}} Mandy.|$|E
25|$|Lady Zhen's {{downfall}} {{was due to}} Guo Nüwang, whom Cao Pi fancied. One {{year after}} Lady Zhen's death, Cao Pi instated Guo as the empress despite opposition from an official, Zhan Qian (棧潛). The historical text Han Jin Chunqiu (漢晉春秋) mentioned that Lady Zhen's body was desecrated after her death – <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> covered by her hair and rice husks were stuffed into her mouth.

25|$|Marie Louise was not {{considered}} attractive, as her features were heavy and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> dominated by a large nose. She was however very charming, and greeted those of all ranks with natural friendliness and sincere concern for their well being. They had two children before his untimely death by drowning on 14 July 1711, the youngest of whom was born after his death. William Charles Henry Friso's birth was met with great relief by the Frisians, and he automatically inherited the title Prince of Orange.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of what Page did in the obscure years after modeling was answered in part {{with the publication of}} an official biography in 1996, Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-up Legend. That year, Page granted an exclusive one-on-one TV interview to entertainment reporter Tim Estiloz for a short-lived NBC morning magazine program Real Life, to help publicize the book. The interview featured her reminiscing about her career and relating anecdotes about her personal life, as well as photos from her personal collection. At Page's request, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> not shown. The interview was broadcast only once.|$|E
25|$|Some 2-peso coins {{were issued}} in 1999 {{to commemorate the}} centenary {{of the birth of}} world-famous writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges; they had an image of Borges' face on one side, and a {{labyrinth}} and the Hebrew letter aleph on the other. In addition, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of Eva Perón, on September 18, 2002 a new 2-peso coin with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> created. It was said that this coin would replace the old AR$2 banknote if inflation continued to be high. None of the 2-peso coins are currently in wide circulation.|$|E

25|$|The Comanche chiefs brought {{only one}} white captive to the meeting, {{as well as}} several Mexican {{children}} who had been captured separately. Muguara refused to deliver more captives {{on the grounds that they}} were held in the rancherías of other chiefs over which he had no authority. The white captive was Matilda Lockhart, a 16-year-old girl who had been held prisoner for over a year and a half. Mary Maverick, who helped care for the girl, wrote almost sixty years after the event that Lockhart had been beaten, raped and had suffered burns to her body. Allegedly, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> severely disfigured, with her nose entirely burned away, a detail which has been commonly included in Texas history descriptions of the incident since the 1890s.|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
25|$|From their later investigations, {{police and}} {{forensic}} experts concluded all the victims {{found in the}} cellar at 25 Cromwell Street had been murdered in this location, and that, like Gough, each had been dismembered in this location. Five victims were murdered and buried in the cellar at Cromwell Street between November 1973 and April 1975. The first of these victims, 15-year-old Carol Ann Cooper, was abducted on 10 November 1973. Cooper lived in the Pines Children's Home in Worcester, and was abducted after spending the evening at a cinema with her boyfriend. She {{had been waiting for}} a bus in Warndon when she vanished, and was likely dragged into Fred's car, where <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> bound with surgical tape and her arms bound with braiding cloth before she was driven to Cromwell Street. At the Wests' address, Cooper was suspended from the wooden beams of the cellar ceiling before her abuse and murder. As had been the case with Lynda, Cooper either {{died as a result of}} strangulation or asphyxiation before her dismembered body was buried in a shallow, cubical grave in the cellar.|$|E

500|$|An A.V. Club {{retrospective}} group review {{praised the}} episode, {{especially for the}} food fight. The reviewers also highlighted the effective short reference and a toast by the characters to their past colleague and friend, the late Coach Ernie Pantusso, and the setting {{of much of the}} episode at Carla's house rather than at the bar. Molly Eichel, one of the reviewers, was especially interested in moments other than the food fight, such as the [...] "childishness" [...] (also described as [...] "devolution") of the characters, Diane's motherliness toward the gang, and Eichel's [...] "favorite part", Vera's long-awaited appearance, even though <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> covered with pumpkin pie.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. He turned to look at her, and saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song at the 2013 YouTube Music Awards on November 3, 2013. She {{arrived on the}} red carpet of the event wearing the same pair of rotten, yellow teeth she wore on the cover art. John Walker from MTV News analyzed Gaga's look to be a combination of the snake from Tim Burton's 1988 fantasy film, Beetlejuice, the Scarecrow character from DC Comics and the rocker Marilyn Manson. During the performance, the singer wore a flannel shirt, her natural hair and a snapback with the NASA symbol altered to read DOPE and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> devoid of any make-up. She performed a piano only version of [...] "Dope", without any other instrumentation and with tears falling down her face. Gaga exited the stage while shaking hands and hugging the members of the audience.|$|E

500|$|The {{nation was}} shocked. Shops put up their shutters. The Prince of Wales wrote to Queen Victoria, [...] "Gladly would I have given {{my life for}} his". Princess Mary wrote to Queen Victoria of the Princess of Wales, [...] "the despairing look on <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> the most heart-rending thing I have ever seen." [...] His younger brother Prince George wrote, [...] "how deeply I did love him; & I {{remember}} with pain nearly every hard word & little quarrel I ever had with him & I long to ask his forgiveness, but, alas, {{it is too late}} now!" [...] George took Albert Victor's place in the line of succession, eventually succeeding to the throne as George V in 1910. Drawn together during their shared period of mourning, Prince George later married Mary himself in 1893. She became queen on George's accession.|$|E
500|$|Actress {{and model}} Sherri Stoner {{served as the}} {{performance}} model for Belle, providing live-action reference for the animators as they drew the character. Belle's tendency to constantly brush her hair away from <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> also inspired by both Stoner and O'Hara. [...] "I was constantly doing that and little quirky things that they would catch," [...] O'Hara told The Guardian. The animators also incorporated O'Hara's eyes, cheekbones {{and the way in}} which she raises her eyebrow into Belle's face. O'Hara felt that Belle originally looked [...] "too perfect," [...] likening the character's appearance to actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon observed inconsistencies in Belle's appearance, writing, [...] "The prettiest and liveliest Belle waltzes with Beast in his marble ballroom and weeps over his body before he's transformed into the Prince" [...] while [...] "The Belle who receives the library from Beast has wider-set eyes and a more prominent mouth than the noticeably slimmer Belle who sings 'Something There'".|$|E
500|$|An {{episode of}} MTV Unplugged {{starring}} Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29, 2014; she performed an acoustic version of [...] "Drive", among several additional tracks from Bangerz.

A close-up of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> shown for much of the performance, although the camera occasionally panned across the stage and revealed that Cyrus was seated on a wooden bench through the full song. Cyrus has performed the track during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. The performance received positive reviews from critics. While performing [...] "Drive" [...] during the first leg of the tour, Cyrus wore a black, floor-length Marc Jacobs gown with subtle sequined lightning stripes down the skirt, sheer black quarter-length sleeves, and a ruffly mock turtleneck. During the second leg of the tour, Cyrus wore a jewel-encrusted black jumpsuit designed by Roberto Cavalli.|$|E
