50|$|<b>Flint</b> <b>glass</b> is <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> {{that has}} {{relatively}} high refractive index and low Abbe number (high dispersion). Flint glasses are arbitrarily defined {{as having an}} Abbe number of 50 to 55 or less. The currently known flint glasses have refractive indices ranging between 1.45 and 2.00. A concave lens of flint glass is commonly combined with a convex lens of crown glass to produce an achromatic doublet lens because of their compensating optical properties, which reduces chromatic aberration (colour defects).|$|R
5000|$|After {{successfully}} {{defending a}} legal {{challenge to the}} patent he held for the achromatic lens the business prospered and he successfully sued his rivals for patent infringement. [...] Dollond's reputation, especially with his father being a Fellow of the Royal Society {{as a result of}} his development and patenting of the achromat, provided the company with the de facto right of refusal on the best <b>optical</b> <b>flint</b> <b>glass.</b> [...] This privilege permitted Dollond to maintain an edge in quality over competitor's telescopes and optical instruments for many years.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanism}} of subsurface crack formation and extension in grinding <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> by single abrasive {{based on the}} dynamic impact effects is studied. Experiments show that the single abrasive grinding cracks of <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> is dynamic impact crack. Analyzing according to crack system, it can be generated that the impact stress in single abrasive regional is cylindrical stress. The mathematical model of single abrasive area impact stress wave is established, and the influence law of the single abrasive grinding impact area on the sub-surface crack depth is derived. According to the experimental results, the single abrasive grinding cracks {{is a kind of}} impact crack, and cylindrical stress wave mathematical model is consistent with the experiment, and the sub-surface crack depth increases in pace with the increase of chord length of impact arc. The dynamic impact crack of <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> in extending downward has its own self-limiting, and occur lateral bending to some extent. 1.

The grinding on K 9 <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> and high speed steel has achieved higher G-ratio than that of traditionally mechanical dressed CBN grinding wheel.
