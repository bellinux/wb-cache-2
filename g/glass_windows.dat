5|$|The work of Morris & Co. {{continued}} during Morris' final years, {{producing an}} array of stained <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> designed by Burne-Jones and the six narrative tapestry panels depicting {{the quest for the}} Holy Grail for Stanmore Hall, Shropshire.|$|E
5|$|Although {{working within}} the Neo-Gothic school of design, they {{differed}} from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained <b>glass</b> <b>windows,</b> and murals. Their stained <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> proved a particular success in the firm's early years {{as they were in}} high demand for the surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} had stained <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> {{and the interior}} was decorated with glazed bricks, similar to other public buildings of this era in the city, such as the Victoria Baths.

5|$|The glass {{industry}} in Hebron was established during Roman rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE). As the ancient Phoenician {{glass industry}} shrank from the exposed cities {{along the eastern}} Mediterranean coastline, the industry migrated inland, to Hebron in particular. Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit {{as part of the}} Drake Collection. Stained <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the Cave of Machpelah, which served as a church during the Crusader era in Palestine. Another example of stained <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> produced in Hebron are those adorning the Dome of the Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded <b>glass</b> <b>windows,</b> table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its leaded <b>glass</b> <b>windows</b> and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E

5|$|An oratory, {{originally}} {{fitted to}} the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891, was decorated with twenty stained <b>glass</b> <b>windows.</b> Ten of these windows are displayed at Cardiff Castle, while the other ten are displayed on site; two missing windows having been returned to the castle in 2011.
