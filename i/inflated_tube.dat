5000|$|In October 1887, John Boyd Dunlop {{developed}} the first practical pneumatic or inflatable tyre for his son's tricycle and, using his {{knowledge and experience}} with rubber, in the yard of his home in Belfast fitted it to a wooden disc 96 centimetres across. The tyre was an <b>inflated</b> <b>tube</b> of sheet rubber. He then took his wheel and a metal wheel from his son's tricycle and rolled both across the yard together. The metal wheel stopped rolling but the pneumatic continued until it hit a gatepost and rebounded. Dunlop then put pneumatics on both rear wheels of the tricycle. That too rolled better, and Dunlop moved on to larger tyres for a bicycle [...] "with even more startling results." [...] He tested that in Cherryvale sports ground, South Belfast, and a patent was granted on 7 December 1888. Unknown to Dunlop another Scot, Robert William Thomson from Stonehaven, had patented a pneumatic tyre in 1847.|$|E

40|$|Tensairity is a {{lightweight}} structural concept, a synergistic combination of an air-beam, cables and struts, which is categorized as a pneumatic structure. The central idea of Tensairity {{is to use}} a low pressure of the internal air to stabilize compression elements against buckling. The basic element consists of a simple air-beam (a low pressure <b>inflated</b> <b>tube),</b> a compression element tightly connected to the air-beam and two tension cables having a spiral shape around the tube. Both the cables and the struts play the role of transferring the applied forces over the air inflated beam; the latter stabilizes then the compression element against buckling. This solution increases the load-carrying capacity compared to a traditional simple air-beam. At the same time, the pressure inside the air-tube can be lowered. Tensairity is, due to its characteristics, especially interesting for temporary and architectural applications, like roof structures, (temporary) bridges and tent structures. The applicability of the concept is not restricted to beams. It is also valid for columns or arches. The simplest Tensairity beam has a cylindrical geometry, but many other shapes are possible, too. Cigar-shaped or spindle-shaped beams still have a circular cross section, but are stiffer than the cylindrical structure.

40|$|A {{so-called}} inflatable beam is a membrane tube which gains its stiffness only by {{a prescribed}} internal pressure. Such lightweight structures are useful in inflatable buildings and particularly in space industry, whenever rapidly deployable and easily transportable structures are required. An inflatable beam {{may look like a}} standard beam, but its mechanism is quite different and a specific mechanical study is necessary in order to establish its governing equations. The only way to correctly take account of the internal pressure — which is a follower load — is to carry out a complete nonlinear analysis before any possible linearization. This work aims to extend the analytical results for isotropic inflatable beams to the practical situation when the beam is made of an orthotropic fabric. It will be shown that the Timoshenko beam model combined with the finite rotation kinematics enables one to correctly account for all the nonlinear terms in the governing equations. A linearization will then be performed to study deformations about the pre-stressed reference configuration. Furthermore, it will be shown how to precisely compute the radius and the length of the <b>inflated</b> <b>tube</b> in the reference state, a very significant issue which is overlooked so far in the literature. All the proposed analytical results will be compared with the numerical ones obtained from a nonlinear 3 D finite element code...|$|E
40|$|Tensairity {{is a new}} {{lightweight}} structural concept {{which can}} be classified as a pneumatic structure. By adding a compression element and cables to an <b>inflated</b> <b>tube</b> a structural system is obtained in which the strut and cables carry the applied load and the air tube transfers forces between both and stabilises the compression element against buckling. The structure combines the favourable features of pneumatics (light, deployable, compact storage and transport volume) with good structural properties and moderate air pressures. Thus, Tensairity is interesting {{for a wide range}} of applications, from roof structures to (temporary) bridges and tent structures. Next to beams the Tensairity concept can also be applied to columns and arches. Tensairity research currently focuses on structural improvements which can contribute to the applicability of the concept. One of these improvements is the use of a stiffening membrane strip inside the pneumatic tube. This ‘web’ is ascribed a positive effect on the stabilisation of the compression element. This thesis investigates the stabilising effect of the <b>inflated</b> <b>tube</b> on the compression element in Tensairity, and particularly the effect of the web on this behaviour. The approach is essentially experimental. First the concept of pressure induced stability and the web effect are investigated analytically and experimentally by means of small models. The models appear to display higher buckling loads for increasing pressures, even approaching the theoretical yield load of the compression element. Furthermore, the web improves the buckling load with a factor 2 in practice. Next, full-scale experiments are performed on two 5 m long Tensairity columns, both consisting of three aluminium struts supported and stabilised by an inflated membrane hull: one without and one with internal webs. For different hull pressures the columns are subjected to an axial compressive load. The responses are analysed and compared, also with FE predictions from ANSYS. For both columns the axial stiffness and the buckling load appear to improve for higher pressures in practice, emphasising the stabilising effect of overpressure. The maximum registered buckling load is over 25 kN, which is a promising result. The column with webs performs better than the one without webs: the increase in stiffness and capacity is around 35 % for an average pressure of 150 mbar. In general this improvement is lower than expected from the small models and the FE results, and not sufficient to counteract the drawbacks of the web model regarding applications, like an increased weight and more complicated fabrication. Thus, the application of a web is at this point not an effective contribution to the functioning of a Tensairity column. Yet, in comparison with a conventional truss column of similar dimensions both Tensairity columns display a sound structural behaviour, and they offer clear advantages in terms of deployability and architecture. A Tensairity column would therefore be especially interesting for temporary applications, e. g. acting as a pole in a tent structure. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
30|$|Figure  3 also {{illustrates}} the deformation {{that occurs when}} we change the direction of tube inflation. For example, we consider the deformation in the following procedure. Initially, L 3, {{which is one of}} the left-handed <b>tubes,</b> <b>inflates</b> (Fig.  3 c); the <b>inflated</b> L 3 <b>tube</b> then comes into contact with the inner wall of a pipe and changes the shape of the device into a left-handed helix that runs parallel to L 3. Then, R 3, {{which is one of the}} right-handed <b>tubes,</b> <b>inflates</b> (Fig.  3 d). When left- and right-handed <b>tubes</b> are simultaneously <b>inflated,</b> the two <b>inflated</b> <b>tubes</b> move in same directions along the same cut plane A–A, while they move in opposite directions and cancel out each deformation along the cut plane B–B. As we described before, the device bends with an inflation force of a tube. When both the right- and left-handed <b>tubes</b> <b>inflate,</b> we can consider the inflations of the tubes as the combined inflation of a tube. Because of the plane symmetry of the helical tubes, which have different directions and the same pitch and radius, the inflation of the tubes cancel each other and deform in a direction perpendicular to the plane of symmetry. We can treat this situation as if we are <b>inflating</b> a virtual <b>tube,</b> whose shape is similar to a planar wave.|$|R

40|$|Lava tubes play {{a pivotal}} role in the {{formation}} of many lava flow fields. A detailed examination of several compound ‘a‘a lava flow fields on Etna confirmed that a complex network of tubes forms at successively higher levels within the flow field, and that tubes generally advance by processes that include flow inflation and tube coalescence. Flow inflation is commonly followed by the formation of major, first-order ephemeral vents which, in turn, form an arterial tube network. Tube coalescence occurs when lava breaks through the roof or wall of an older lava tube; this can result in the unexpected appearance of vents several kilometers downstream. A close examination of underground features allowed us to distinguish between ephemeral vent formation and tube coalescence, both of which are responsible for abrupt changes in level or flow direction of lava within tubes on Etna. Ephemeral vent formation on the surface is frequently recorded underground by a marked increase in size of the tube immediately upstream of these vents. When the lining of an <b>inflated</b> <b>tube</b> has collapsed, ‘a‘a clinker is commonly seen in the roof and walls of the tube, and this is used to infer that inflation has taken place in the distal part of an ‘a‘a lava flow. Tube coalescence is recognised either from the compound shape of tube sections, or from breached levees, lava falls, inclined grooves or other structures on the walls and roof. Our observations confirm the importance of lava tubes in the evolution of extensive pahoehoe and ‘a‘a flow fields on Etna...|$|E
40|$|NASA/JPL's deep-space {{exploration}} {{program has}} been placing emphasis on reducing the mass and stowage volume of its spacecraft's high-gain and large-aperture antennas. To achieve these goals, the concept of deployable flat reflectarray antenna using an inflatable/thin-membrane structure was introduced at JPL several years ago. A reflectarray is a flat array antenna space-fed by a low-gain feed located at its focal point in a fashion {{similar to that of}} a parabolic reflector. The ref 1 ectarray's elements, using microstrip technology, can be printed onto a flat thin-membrane surface and are each uniquely designed to compensate for the different phase delays due to different path lengths from the feed. Although the reflectarray suffers from limited bandwidth (typically < 10 %), it offers a more reliably deployed and maintained flat "natural" surface. A recent hardware development at JPL has demonstrated that a 0. 2 mm rms surface tolerance (l/ 50 th of a wavelength) was achieved on a 3 -meter Ka-band inflatable reflectarray. Another recent development, to combat the reflectarray's narrow band characteristic, demonstrated that dual-band performance, such as X- and Ka-bands, with an aperture efficiency of above 50 percent is achievable by the reflectarray antenna. To mechanically deploy the antenna, the reflectarray's thin membrane aperture surface is supported, tensioned and deployed by an inflatable tubular structure. There are several critical elements and challenging issues associated with the inflatable tube structure. First, the inflatable tube must be made rigidizable so that, once the tube is fully deployed in space, it rigidizes itself and the inflation system is no longer needed. In addition, if the tube is penetrated by small space debris, the tube will maintain its rigidity and not cause deformation to the antenna structure. To support large apertures (e. g. 10 m or beyond) without causing any buckling to the small-diameter inflatable tube during vibration, the tube, in addition to rigidization, is also reinforced by circumferential thin blades, as well as axial blades. Second, a controlled deployment mechanism, such as by using Velcro strips, must also be implemented into the system so that, for very large structures, the long inflatable tubes can be deployed in a time-controlled fashion and not get tangled with each other. Third, the thermal analysis is another critical element and must be performed for the tube design in order to assure that the <b>inflated</b> <b>tube,</b> under extreme space thermal conditions, will not deform significantly. Finally, the dynamic vibration analysis must also be performed on the inflatable structure. This will investigate the response of the structure due to excitation introduced by the spacecraft maneuvering and thus determine any necessary damping. Several reflectarray antennas have been developed at JPL to demonstrate the technology. These include an earlier 1 -meter X-band inflatable reflectarray, a 3 -meter Ka-band inflatable reflectarray, a half-meter dual-band (X and Ka) reflectarray, and the current on-going 10 -meter inflatable structure development. The detailed RF and mechanical descriptions of these antennas, as well as their performances, will be presented during the conference...|$|E

All departments have a good experience in bariatric and/or advanced laparoscopic surgery. Methods. The number of patients studied is 2686 : 1572 underwent ASGB (219 laparotomically and 1353 laparoscopically); 1114 underwent VBG (914 laparotomically and 200 laparoscopically).

Due to the payload size restrictions of the current launch vehicles, deployable structures are the way to go to launch very large structures into orbit. This paper therefore presents the design and simulation of a tensegrity based structure with inflatable rigidizable tubes as compression struts. The literature review showed that inflatable structures are most promising for the development of deployable reflectors larger than twenty meters in diameter. Good compression performance and reliability can be achieved by employing rigidisable inflatable tubes. The concept presented in this paper will focus on the development and simulation of a one meter diameter hexagonal reflector substructure that can be easily expanded to larger diameters due to its modular design. The one meter diameter modular approach was chosen to be able to build a full size benchmark model to validate the numerical data in the future. Due {{to the fact that the}} tensegrity compression elements are not initiating at one specific location, a passive reaction gas inflation technique is proposed which makes the structure independent of any pumps or other active inflation devices.
