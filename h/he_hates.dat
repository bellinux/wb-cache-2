He {{attempts}} to negotiate with Amber, Wilson's girlfriend, about conditions under which they can both have Wilson's company. They are at a standstill, thus House seeks Lisa Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) resolution.

House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E
5|$|Cartman {{frequently}} teases Kenny {{for being}} poor, and derides Kenny's family {{for being on}} welfare. He will also use an awkward pause during a conversation {{as an opportunity to}} casually remind Kenny that <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> him. Cartman's mischievous treatment of Butters Stotch, and the relationship the duo shares has received significant focus in the more recent seasons of the series. This reflects Parker's interest; the scenes between the two are the ones he most enjoys writing.|$|E
60|$|And Mr. Polly {{sat on the}} stile {{and hated}} the whole scheme of life--which was at once {{excessive}} and inadequate as a solution. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> Foxbourne, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> Foxbourne High Street, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> his shop {{and his wife and}} his neighbours--every blessed neighbour--and with indescribable bitterness <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> himself.|$|R
6000|$|But to Michael Trevennack it was life, health, vigor. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> London. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> officialdom. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> {{the bonds}} of red tape that enveloped him. It's hard to know {{yourself}} an archangel-- ...|$|R
60|$|Barrington was ill at ease. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> {{himself and}} <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> his errand.|$|R
5|$|Dr. Foster enlists Homer to help Ned {{learn how}} to {{appropriately}} express emotions. After several failed scripted insults, Homer manages to get Ned to open up about some of his repressed dislikes, finally admitting <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> his parents, after which he immediately feels better. Dr. Foster declares Flanders cured and he is immediately released. Outside the hospital, Ned is greeted by the townsfolk of Springfield. Ned promises that from now on, if anyone does something he does not like, they will hear about it, which Dr. Foster tells him is very healthy.|$|E
5|$|Ron, {{who has an}} {{extremely}} deadpan and masculine personality, actively works to make city hall less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, woodworking, hunting, whisky, and breakfast foods. <b>He</b> <b>hates</b> and fears his two ex-wives, both named Tammy, {{one of whom is}} played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Robert California (James Spader) reveals <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> Nellie Bertram's (Catherine Tate) business plan and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) swings into action to keep Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) from getting fired.

6000|$|The rector {{could not}} stand it. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> light wines. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> cheap things in general. And <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> Gladstone in particular. [...] "Nothing," [...] said he, [...] "that the statesman you speak of ever did could make such wine as that any cheaper. I am sorry, sir, that you don't {{perceive}} the difference." ...|$|R
60|$|He had {{to learn}} to contain himself again, and <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> it. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> her that she was not there for him. And he took himself off, anywhere.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>hated</b> Christophe and {{all that}} made Christophe; <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> pride, and then the idea came to him {{that it is not}} pride that makes Christophes but humility.|$|R
5|$|In {{the process}} of {{destroying}} NESTS, he becomes allied with Maxima, a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death. While Maxima sees K' as a friend and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, who it is revealed is a clone of his sister, Seirah. Even though Whip reveals her identity to K', he ignores this, saying he will do what he pleases. Although <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> The King of Fighters tournaments, he commonly enters them, being asked by someone, or to find NESTS. The participants often criticize him for being antisocial. After destroying NESTS, K' starts recovering his memories, but he suspects he could forget all the people he has met. He also becomes determined to prove he is better than Kyo, instead of being only a clone.|$|E
5|$|K′ is a {{young man}} who lost all his {{memories}} when the NESTS syndicate captured him and injected the DNA of the powerful fighter Kyo into him to copy Kusanagi's pyrokinetic abilities. Angered by what NESTS did to him, K' betrays NESTS and decides to destroy them for using his body and deleting all his memories. Although <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> tournaments, K' uses the King of Fighters tournaments to find NESTS members and defeat them. In his search, he meets allies who have the same goal and joins forces with them. Aside from the main series, K' also appears in several other media series, such as spin-offs and crossover video games, as well as printed adaptations of the series.|$|E
5|$|Noda is a {{self-reliant}} {{young man}} who executes the strategies formed by the SSS and fights with a halberd. He does not listen to anyone other than Yuri, for whom he has adoration, and is antagonistic to almost everyone else. He has a one-sided rivalry with Otonashi. He is a complete idiot whose weakness is education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He {{is not afraid to}} harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way. Though he prefers to fight with his halberd, he sometimes uses guns out of necessity, the type of weaponry that <b>he</b> <b>hates.</b>|$|E
60|$|Frequently <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> Miriam. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> her as {{she bent}} forward and pored over his things. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> her way of patiently casting him up, {{as if he were}} an endless {{psychological}} account. When he was with her, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> her for having got him, and yet not got him, and he tortured her. She took all and gave nothing, he said. At least, she gave no living warmth. She was never alive, and giving off life. Looking for her was like looking for something which did not exist. She was only his conscience, not his mate. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> her violently, and was more cruel to her. They dragged on till the next summer. He saw more and more of Clara.|$|R
60|$|Formerly, White Fang {{had been}} merely {{the enemy of}} his kind, withal a ferocious enemy. He now became the enemy of all things, and more ferocious than ever. To such an extent was he tormented, that <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> blindly and without the faintest spark of reason. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> the chain that bound him, the men who peered in {{at him through the}} slats of the pen, the dogs that {{accompanied}} the men and that snarled malignantly at him in his helplessness. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> the very wood of the pen that confined him. And, first, last, and most of all, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> Beauty Smith.|$|R
60|$|He {{felt sick}} in every fibre. <b>He</b> almost <b>hated</b> the little handbag he carried, which held his flute and piccolo. It seemed a burden just then--a {{millstone}} round his neck. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> the scene <b>he</b> had left--and <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> the hard, inviolable heart that stuck unchanging {{in his own}} breast.|$|R
5|$|This episode {{focuses on}} the events of Valentine's Day for {{the cast and crew}} of TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictional sketch comedy series.

5|$|A remorseful Leslie (Amy Poehler) tells a {{group of}} Recreation Center {{teachers}} the Pawnee budget has been cut by $1,000, and five of their classes {{will have to be}} cut, but exactly which classes has not yet been determined. Later, Leslie and Justin Anderson (Justin Theroux), who have been dating for weeks, have another excellent date in Indianapolis. At the end of the night, they decide their next date will be in Pawnee, and Leslie feels pressure to make their date equally exciting. While talking later with Ann (Rashida Jones), Leslie decides to host a dinner party at her home with all her interesting friends. She invites Mark (Paul Schneider), Tom (Aziz Ansari) and Ron (Nick Offerman), specifically excludes Jerry (Jim O'Heir), and asks Andy (Chris Pratt) to work as the waiter. Andy agrees, even though <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> Justin, Ann's former crush, and Mark, her current boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never knew}} but one keeper who was not,' said Logan. 'That was in Galloway. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> shooting, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> fishing. My {{impression}} {{is that he was}} what we call a [...] "Stickit Minister."' ...|$|R
6000|$|Essentially he was simple. Generally speaking, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> and despised {{in equal}} measure {{whatever}} {{seemed to suggest}} that he personally was not the most perfect human being conceivable. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> all education after fifteen because he had had no education after fifteen, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> all people who did not have high tea until he himself under duress gave up high tea, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> every game except football, which he had played and could judge, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> all people who spoke foreign languages because he knew no language but Staffordshire, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> all foreigners because he was English, and all foreign ways because they were not his ways. Also <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> particularly, and in this order, Londoner's, Yorkshiremen, Scotch, Welch and Irish, because they were not [...] "reet Staffordshire," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> all other Staffordshire men as insufficiently [...] "reet." [...] He wanted to have all his own women inviolate, and to fancy he had a call upon every other woman in the world. He wanted to have the best cigars and the best brandy in the world to consume or give away magnificently, and every one else to have inferior ones. (His billiard table was an extra large size, specially made and very inconvenient.) And <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> Trade Unions because they interfered with his autocratic direction of his works, and his workpeople because they were not obedient and untiring mechanisms to do his bidding. He was, in fact, a very naive, vigorous human being. He was about as much civilised, about as much tamed to the ideas of collective action and mutual consideration as a Central African negro.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is how {{she serves}} me, is it?" [...] {{he said in his}} heart, over and over, {{pressing}} his face in the quilt. And <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> her. Again <b>he</b> went over the scene, and again <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> her.|$|R
5|$|Tyler {{cuts from}} Charlotte's buttocks, frying {{a strip of}} her flesh on a stove. Squires tells of how he began an affair with Monica, Tyler's wife and mother of his twin children, {{destroying}} Tyler's career. Tyler hands Squires the flesh, and he eats, fearing Charlotte will die. Tyler reveals how <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> cryptic crosswords, and how his son entered the Cambridge Crossword Competition, attempting to beat his mother's new husband: Squires. Squires realises that Charlotte is Tyler's daughter. Charlotte and Tyler sought revenge on Squires, but Tyler changed plans so Squires would include clues in the crossword. However, Simon's autopsy—Tyler explains—revealed that Simon and Charlotte were actually Squires's children, meaning Monica and Squires's relationship began earlier than he previously thought. Charlotte is past saving, and Tyler places a bullet on Squires's desk, quoting Chekhov's gun. Squires confirms that his middle name is Hector as he weeps over Charlotte, and Tyler circles something on the crossword. Charlotte is dead, and Squires loads the gun, placing it in his mouth. Blood splatters over the crossword and a second nina: RIP NHS.|$|E
5|$|Trevor {{eventually}} {{discovers that}} Michael set him and Brad up, and that Brad {{is not in}} jail but buried in Michael's fake grave. This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael, but needing him alive for one last heist. When that heist is successful, Trevor is so pleased that he lifts the death vow but still hates Michael. Near {{the end of the}} game, Franklin is given a choice: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or let them live and face their enemies. If the latter is chosen, Trevor kills Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Steve Haines, before capturing Weston, and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin. Trevor once again considers Michael his friend, albeit a friend that <b>he</b> <b>hates,</b> which Michael accepts. If the second option is chosen, Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael's death. If the first option is chosen, Franklin meets up with Trevor, before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant. When Trevor crashes into an oil tank, causing himself to be covered in oil, either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil, setting Trevor alight and killing him. If Trevor and Michael are spared, they continue to spend time together with Franklin, during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad, and refers to himself and Michael as friends.|$|E
25|$|Bella's {{desire to}} become a vampire {{increases}} throughout the series. Edward continues to refuse as <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> being immortal and does not want Bella to suffer the same fate.|$|E
60|$|Reddy Fox {{sat down}} at a safe {{distance}} to watch what Old Man Coyote would do. Inside, Reddy was fairly boiling with disappointment and anger. He felt that <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> Old Man Coyote more than <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> anybody else <b>he</b> knew of. <b>He</b> <b>hated</b> him, yet there wasn't a thing he could do about it. He didn't dare fight Old Man Coyote. All he could do was to sit there {{at a safe distance}} and watch.|$|R
60|$|On {{the morning}} after this {{conversation}} with Alaric, Charley left his lodgings with a heavy heart, and wended his way towards Mecklenburg Square. At the corner of Davies Street he got an omnibus, which for fourpence took him {{to one of the}} little alleys near Gray's Inn, and there he got down, and threading the well-known locality, through Bedford Place and across Theobald's Road, soon found himself at the door of his generous patron. Oh! how <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> the house; how <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> the blear-eyed, cross-grained, dirty, impudent fish-fag of an old woman who opened the door for him; how <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> Mr. Jabesh M'Ruen, to whom he now came a supplicant for assistance, and how, above all, <b>he</b> <b>hated</b> himself for being there.|$|R
60|$|The hoarse, taunting voice failed. Knell {{stepped back}} from the comrade <b>he</b> <b>hated.</b> <b>He</b> was wet, shaking, haggard, but magnificent.|$|R
25|$|One {{thing that}} is {{apparent}} from the Death of a Salesman is the hard work and dedication of Charley and Bernard. Willy criticizes Charley and Bernard throughout the play, {{but it is not}} because <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> them. Rather, it's argued that he is jealous of the successes they have enjoyed, which is outside his standards.|$|E
25|$|But then {{a mysterious}} {{person in a}} Krabby Patty-costume defeats {{all four of the}} {{restaurant}} managers, saves SpongeBob and takes him back to the Krusty Krab. It turns out that the Krusty Krab has gone downhill ever since Mr. Krabs fired SpongeBob and took over as the fry cook. Squidward reveals himself as the person in the costume, and explains that as much as <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), <b>he</b> <b>hates</b> the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both he and Mr. Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again, with Mr. Krabs admitting that he made a huge mistake in firing SpongeBob in the first place. SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook, and puts the restaurant back on track, which brings back all the customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, Mr. Krabs reveals that he has installed a pay toilet that costs a nickel to use, thus making up the nickel that he previously lost by hiring SpongeBob.|$|E
25|$|He was {{revealed}} to be Sakura's older brother, originally named Kai, and is also immortal. <b>He</b> <b>hates</b> humans for two reasons: 1) He thinks {{they are trying to}} control Sakura 2) the emperor put him in a water chamber to drown him over and over again, which eventually did drive him to what is described as insanity. Has a blue stone in his head from drinking the moon spring water and possesses the power to control water.|$|E

5000|$|Creagh then cursed him {{and refused}} to absolve him because he had put a priest to death.
