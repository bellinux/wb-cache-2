5|$|The orbital semimajor axis is only 0.13 AU, {{around a}} third of the average {{distance}} between Mercury and the Sun, and is more eccentric than the orbit of any of the major planets of our solar system. Despite this, it is located in the inner regions of the system's habitable zone, since Gliese 876 is such an intrinsically <b>faint</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5|$|GJ 3021 is a solar twin—a star {{very like}} our own Sun—around 57 light-years distant with a {{spectral}} type G8V and magnitude of 6.7. It has a Jovian planet companion (GJ 3021 b). Orbiting about 0.5AU from its sun, it has a minimum mass 3.37 times that of Jupiter and a period of around 133 days. The system is a complex one as the <b>faint</b> <b>star</b> GJ 3021B orbits {{at a distance of}} 68 AU; it is a red dwarf of spectral type M4V.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} inner planet Gliese 876 c {{and the outer}} planet Gliese 876 e: {{in the time it}} takes planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of the planets change fairly rapidly as they dynamically interact with one another. The planet's orbit has a low eccentricity, similar to the planets in the Solar System. The semimajor axis of the orbit is only 0.208 AU, less than that of Mercury in the Solar System. However Gliese 876 is such a <b>faint</b> <b>star</b> that this puts it in the outer part of the habitable zone.|$|E

5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a <b>faint</b> <b>star</b> in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E
25|$|Winthrop {{also studied}} {{astronomy}} with his 3½ foot refracting telescope. In 1664, {{he wrote a}} letter to Sir Robert Moray regarding a “fifth satellite of Jupiter” that he believed he observed. This was only fifty years after Galileo discovered the first four moons of Jupiter. His letter was cautious since he thought it may be a <b>faint</b> <b>star</b> in close proximity to the other satellites. Winthrop requested that his observations be validated by Lawrence Rooke, Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, but nothing was verified. Dr. Edward Emerson Barnard, who was credited for discovering Amalthea, Jupiter’s fifth moon, wrote “It makes me feel specially humiliated just now, for I have only caught the feeblest glimpses of the 5th satellite with the 40-inch during the past two years. Winthrop’s telescope must have been specially good for him to see this faint object with his imperfect instrument in 1664.” Although today it is assumed that Winthrop probably did see a <b>faint</b> <b>star,</b> he is still credited for being a dedicated and vigilant observer of natural phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Vega also forms one vertex of a {{much smaller}} triangle, along with Epsilon and Zeta Lyrae. Zeta forms a wide binary star visible in binoculars, {{consisting}} of an Am star and an F-type subgiant. The Am star has an additional close companion, bringing {{the total number of}} stars in the system to three. Epsilon is a more famous wide binary that can even be separated by the naked eye under good conditions. Both components are themselves close binaries which can be seen with telescopes to consist of A- and F-type stars, and a <b>faint</b> <b>star</b> was recently found to orbit component C as well, for a total of five stars.|$|E

25|$|The precise {{orientation}} of the Egyptian pyramids affords a lasting demonstration of {{the high degree of}} technical skill in watching the heavens attained in the 3rd millennium BC. It has been shown the Pyramids were aligned towards the pole star, which, because of the precession of the equinoxes, was at that time Thuban, a <b>faint</b> <b>star</b> in the constellation of Draco. Evaluation of the site of the temple of Amun-Re at Karnak, taking into account the change over time of the obliquity of the ecliptic, has shown that the Great Temple was aligned on the rising of the midwinter sun. The length of the corridor down which sunlight would travel would have limited illumination at other times of the year.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah is a bay colt with a <b>faint</b> <b>star</b> on his {{forehead}} and no other white markings.

The stallion's first crop included Holy Bull Stakes winner Cairo Prince, and Social Inclusion, who finished third in the 2014 Preakness Stakes. American Pharoah's dam, Littleprincessemma, was purchased by Zayat in 2007 for $250,000. She raced but did not win either of her two starts in 2008. American Pharoah was her second foal, following allowance race winner Xixixi.

500|$|Circinus is a small, faint {{constellation}} in {{the southern}} sky, first defined in 1756 by the French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille. Its name is Latin for compass, referring to the drafting tool used for drawing circles (it {{should not be confused}} with Pyxis, a constellation that represents a mariner's compass which points north). Its brightest star is Alpha Circini, with an apparent magnitude of 3.19. Slightly variable, it is the brightest rapidly oscillating Ap star in the night sky. AX Circini is a Cepheid variable visible with the unaided eye, and BX Circini is a <b>faint</b> <b>star</b> thought to have been formed from the merger of two white dwarfs. Two sun-like stars have planetary systems: HD 134060 has two small planets, and HD 129445 has a Jupiter-like planet.

500|$|... 493 {{variable}} stars {{have been recorded}} in Circinus, but most have a very small range or are quite dim. Three prominent examples are Theta Circini, T Circini, and AX Circini. Theta Circini is a B-class irregular variable, ranging in magnitude from 5.0 to 5.4. T Circini has a B-type spectrum, ranging in magnitude from 10.6 to 9.3 {{over a period of}} 3.298days, although it is actually an eclipsing binary system rather than a pulsating star. AX is a Cepheid variable that varies between magnitudes 5.6 and 6.19 over 5.3days. It is a yellow-white supergiant of spectral type F8II+, 1600 light-years away. BP Circini is another Cepheid variable with an apparent magnitude ranging from 7.37 to 7.71 over 2.4 days. Both cepheids are spectroscopic binaries, with companions that are blue-white stars of spectral type B6 and 5 and 4.7 solar masses respectively. BX Circini is a <b>faint</b> <b>star</b> that fluctuates between magnitudes 12.57 and 12.62 over a period of 2 hours 33 minutes. Over 99% of its composition appears to be helium. Its origin is unclear, but thought {{to be the result of}} the merger of a helium and a carbon/oxygen white dwarf.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{supernova}} remnants in Cassiopeia. The first, {{which is}} unnamed, is {{the aftermath of}} the supernova called Tycho's Star. It was observed in 1572 by Tycho Brahe and now exists as a bright object in the radio spectrum. Within the 'W' asterism formed by Cassiopeia’s five major stars lies Cassiopeia A (Cas A). It is the remnant of a supernova that took place approximately 300 years ago (as observed now from Earth; it is 10,000 light-years away), and has the distinction of being the strongest radio source observable outside the Solar System. It was perhaps observed as a <b>faint</b> <b>star</b> in 1680 by John Flamsteed. It was also the subject of the first image returned by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory in the late 1990s.
