50|$|In {{accordance}} with this view, post-Flixborough (and {{without waiting for}} the Inquiry Report), ICI Petrochemicals instituted a review of how it controlled modifications. It found that major projects requiring <b>financial</b> <b>sanction</b> {{at a high level}} were generally well-controlled, but for more (financially) minor modifications there was less control and this had resulted in a past history of 'near-misses' and small-scale accidents, few of which could be blamed on chemical engineers. To remedy this, not only were employees reminded of the principal points to consider when making a modification (both on the quality/compliance of the modification itself and on the effect of the modification {{on the rest of the}} plant), but new procedures and documentation were introduced to ensure adequate scrutiny. These requirements applied not only to changes to equipment, but also to process changes. All modifications were to be supported by a formal safety assessment. For major modifications this would include an 'operability study'; for minor modifications a checklist-based safety assessment was to be used, indicating what aspects would be affected, and for each aspect giving a statement of the expected effect. The modification and its supporting safety assessment then had to be approved in writing by the plant manager and engineer. Where instruments or electrical equipment were involved signatures would also be needed from the relative specialist (instrument manager or electrical engineer). A Pipework Code of Practice was introduced specifying standards of design construction and maintenance for pipework - all pipework over 3"nb (DN 75 mm) handling hazardous material would have to be designed by pipework specialists in the design office.The approach was publicised outside ICI; while the Pipework Code of Practice on its own would have combatted the specific fault(s) that led to the Flixborough disaster, the adoption more generally of tighter controls on modifications (and the method by which this was done) were soon recognised to be prudent good practice. In the United Kingdom, the ICI approach became a de facto standard for high-risk plant (partly because the new (1974) Health and Safety at Work Act went beyond specific requirements on employers to state general duties to keep risks to workers as low as reasonably practicable and to avoid risk to the public so far as reasonably practicable; under this new regime the presumption was that recognised good practice would inherently be 'reasonably practicable' and hence should be adopted, partly because key passages in reports of the Advisory Committee on Major Hazards were clearly supportive).|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} large {{punitive damages}} awards that juries have granted to plaintiffs in recent cases against the tobacco industry, and demonstrates why such high awards are a warranted and necessary {{incentive for the}} companies to change their dangerous course of conduct. In State Farm v. Campbell, the United States Supreme Court announced that “few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages” will be constitutional. In a subsequent smoking and health case brought against Philip Morris, however, a state appeals court allowed a punitive damages award that was almost 97 times the compensatory damages award. This decision {{was based on a}} finding that Philip Morris’s conduct was particularly reprehensible. Furthermore, internal tobacco industry documents reveal that the industry knowingly has used its enormous wealth to make it exceedingly difficult for potential plaintiffs to find lawyers, and nearly impossible for those that do to maintain their cases. The industry thus has been able to evade large judgments against it and to maintain its “refuse to settle” policy. This article, therefore, proposes that when a smoking and health plaintiff is successful at trial, the tobacco industry should be subject to a high punitive damages award because: 1) the industry’s behavior is particularly reprehensible; 2) the industry has used its wealth to engage in litigation tactics that have allowed it to evade capture; and 3) a powerful <b>financial</b> <b>sanction</b> is needed to deter lethal misbehavior when the defendant makes billions of dollars addicting consumers to its deadly product...|$|E

Hefty fines which have significant financial consequences on included companies have proved to be effective means in the battle against cartels. However, the law on cartels at EU level has as its aim to deter cartels and sanction the participants. Therefore, in this way, it is not possible to rectify the damage done to all subjects who have fallen victim to cartel acitvity. The Court of the European Union has therefore in several judgements expressed the opinion that private individuals must have at their disposal the possibility of seeking damages. The recent suggestions by the Commission in this direction represent a revolution in private law in Europe. Therefore introducing expensive lawsuits and amending the burden of proof for the first time should equally in the EU provide the possibility of seeking damages from cartels This paper critically presents novelties which should result from the implementation of the suggestions by the Commission.

40|$|In {{response}} to the broad scope of the Enron-era frauds, {{the federal government has}} adopted novel strategies to investigate and prosecute corporate crimes. This Article examines the use of stringent cooperation requirements and deferred prosecution agreements, pursuant to which corporate internal investigations have become extensions of government enforcement efforts. At the same time, liability has shifted markedly to the employee level: Over one thousand individuals have been indicted and convicted since the July 2002 creation of the Corporate Fraud Task Force, while few corporations have been charged. The convergence of corporate cooperation doctrine with the focus on individual targets results in significant unfairness for employees who are compelled to incriminate themselves in the context of internal investigations that are directed by the government. Because of the awkward partnering of public governmental investigations with private corporate compliance efforts, that normative burden on employees may not be offset by enforcement benefits. This Article suggests that the government 2 ̆ 7 s application of a civil regulatory model to criminal cases creates distortions because individual liberty rather than a <b>financial</b> <b>sanction</b> is at stake, because prosecutors do not engage in negotiated governance, and because judicial oversight at the investigative stage is minimal. This article also addresses the constitutional implications of outsourcing corporate criminal investigations and argues that employees interviewed by internal investigators pursuant to the terms of a pending deferred prosecution agreement should enjoy immunity analogous to the Garrity shield that protects public employees. Several strands of Fifth Amendment theory are consistent with the argument the economic pressure, such as the threat of job loss, can {{rise to the level of}} constitutionally significant coercion.

Yet, the need to adequately document medical records, appropriately apply billing codes and accurately charge insurers for medical services {{is essential to the}} medical practice's financial condition. Many physicians rely on office staff and billing companies to process their medical bills without ever reviewing the bills before they are submitted for payment. Some physicians may not be receiving the payment they deserve when they do not sufficiently oversee the medical practice's coding and billing patterns. This article emphasizes the importance of monitoring and auditing medical record documentation and coding application as a strategy for achieving compliance and reducing billing errors. When medical bills are submitted with missing and incorrect information, they may result in unpaid claims and loss of revenue to physicians. Addressing Medical Audits, Part I [...] A Strategy for Achieving Compliance [...] CMS, JCAHO, NCQA, published January 2002 in the Journal of the National Medical Association, stressed the importance of preparing the medical practice for audits. The article highlighted steps the medical practice can take to prepare for audits and presented examples of guidelines used by regulatory agencies to conduct both medical and financial audits. The Medicare Integrity Program was cited as an example of guidelines used by regulators to identify coding errors during an audit and deny payment to providers when improper billing occurs. For each denied claim, payments owed to the medical practice are are also denied. Health care is, no doubt, a costly endeavor for health care providers, consumers and insurers. The potential risk to physicians for improper billing may include loss of revenue, fraud investigations, <b>financial</b> <b>sanction,</b> disciplinary action and exclusion from participation in government programs.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the hospital admission process in relation to two areas associated with known patient related risks, venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment and medicines reconciliation in an English teaching hospital Acute Medical Unit (AMU). National guidance was {{available at the time}} of the study for both of these aspects of care. Government targets with associated financial penalties were set for VTE risk assessment in 2010, there were no similar targets for medicines reconciliation. NHS ethics approval was granted. A novel mixed methodology was used involving direct observations of the patient admissions process, interviews with staff and an audit of case notes. Data were collected over four one-week periods between 2009 and 2011, 36 staff were observed admitting 71 patients, 44 staff were interviewed (25 VTE, 19 medicines reconciliation) and 930 sets of case notes were audited. The observations showed that at the start of the study guidance was rarely followed for both VTE risk assessment and medicines reconciliation. Staff were unaware of its existence and ignorant of the both the associated risks and the level of guideline compliance within the organisation. There were low levels of compliance with local and national VTE guidance until national financial sanctions were introduced when significant increases in the rates of both VTE risk assessment and appropriate prescribing of prophylaxis were seen, however inappropriate prescribing also rose. Observations showed poor medication history taking and prescribing practices, during the study the proportion of items with a prescribing error increased, however the interviews showed that staff did know how to establish an accurate medication history and were aware of the potential problems. A national <b>financial</b> <b>sanction</b> was associated with the effective implementation of VTE guidance however it remains to be seen whether standards can be maintained in a complex high pressure environment. Organisations must also be aware of the potential for unexpected adverse outcomes.
