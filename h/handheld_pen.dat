50|$|Interphase Corporation (NASDAQ:INPH) {{was founded}} in 1974, and filed for Initial Public Offering in 1984. The company stock has been traded in the NASDAQ since then. The company has been {{building}} strage, telecom, and enterprise networking electronic boards in its manufacturing facility, located in Carrollton, Texas. In 2009, the company decided that it needed to branch out to additional markets and applications. In 2010, through a thorough investigation of the interactive whiteboard market, and with a commitment the company made {{to grow in the}} computer vision technical direction, penveu was invented. Under a vail of secrecy, the company has developed the concepts and tested them for two years until unveiling the product at the DEMO conference in Santa Clara, California on April 18, 2012. Since then the company continued to develop the product, test it, and on May 30, 2014, released it to the market. The origin of the name penveu is almost comical. Since the product is made of two electronic boards (one in the <b>handheld</b> <b>pen</b> and one in the base station), the engineering department insisted on naming those two boards. One of them was simple to name: the PEN. The other, as explained in the “Technology” section, is a Video Enhancement Unit, and was thus named by its acronym: VEU. From here, the road to naming the entire product PENVEU was short. It also suggests that penveu is “a pen with a view”, which provides a good explanation of the unique operation of the penveu system.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Little {{is known}} about the manual {{tracking}} of targets that move in three dimensions. In the present study, human subjects followed, with the tip of a <b>handheld</b> <b>pen,</b> a virtual target moving four times (period 5 s) around a novel, unseen path. Two basic types of target paths were used: a peanut-shaped Cassini ellipse and a quasi-spherical shape where four connected semicircles lay in orthogonal planes. The quasi-spherical shape was presented in three different sizes, and the Cassini shape was varied in spatial orientation and by folding it along one of the three bend axes. During the first cycle of Cassini shapes, the hand lagged behind the target by about 150 ms on average, which decreased to 100 ms during the last three cycles. Tracking performance gradually improved during the first 3 s of the first cycle and then stabilized. Tracking was especially good during the smooth, planar sections of the shapes, and time lag was significantly shorter when the tracking of a lowfrequency component was compared to performance at a higher frequency (88 ms at 0. 2 Hz vs. 101 ms at 0. 6 Hz). Even after the appropriate adjustment of the virtual target path to a virtual shape tracing condition, tracking in depth was poor compared to tracking in the frontal plane, resulting in a flattening of the hand path. In contrast to previous studies where target trajectories were linear or sinusoidal, these complex trajectories may have involved estimation of the overall shape, as well as prediction of target velocity...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of force-based input on a handheld device were examined. Twenty-one participants used force input to set 10 different target levels representing consecutive force ranges (0 to 4 N) with visual feedback (digits or bar graphs) or no feedback. Both accuracy and speed were greater with analog feedback (bar graph). Statistical comparisons of adjacent targets/digits indicated that subjects differentiated roughly seven input levels within {{the set of}} ten force ranges actually used. Time taken to input the target force increased significantly {{with the size of}} the target force, suggesting that smaller force ranges should be considered in future implementations of force input. The results are discussed in terms of the design of appropriate feedback for force input.

40|$|Context: Although some {{instruments}} {{have been}} validated for clinical measure of hydration status, new and currently invalid instruments {{are available for}} purchase and clinical use. Athletic trainers commonly use these instruments to assess hydration status for weight checks and body mass loss charts due to their ease of use. However, the validity of these popular instruments {{has not yet been}} established. Objective: To determine the validity of urine specific gravity (USG) for the assessment of hydration status via the following instruments: <b>handheld</b> clinical refractometer, <b>pen</b> style digital refractometer, and midget urinometer as compared to the gold standard urine osmometer (OSMO). Design: Descriptive diagnostic validity study. Setting: Biochemical research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Healthy active men and women (n= 108; mean age= 22 ± 4 yrs; self reported height= 174 ± 20 cm and mass= 75 ± 17 kg) were recruited among faculty and students on a university campus. Interventions: The independent variable was instrument type with four levels: osmometer, <b>handheld</b> clinical refractometer, <b>pen</b> style digital refractometer, and midget urinometer. After recruitment, participants completed an informed consent and a short health history questionnaire to rule out any exclusionary criteria such as kidney disease or chronic urinary tract infection. Participants were then given a clean standard urine cup and asked to provide as much sample as possible, providing more than one cup when possible. Main Outcome Measures: Hydration status was measured by USG and OSM. USG was evaluated by a <b>handheld</b> clinical refractometer, <b>pen</b> style digital refractometer, and midget urinometer. The gold standard OSM was calculated by a freezing point depression osmometer. Z scores were calculated for each instrument and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were evaluated {{to examine the relationship between}} each instrument of USG and OSM. Results: Strong significant correlations were identified for the digital refractometer (r= 0. 814, p< 0. 001) and handheld clinical refractometer (r= 0. 943, p< 0. 001) with OSM. A weak statistically insignificant correlation was established between the midget urinometer (r= 0. 133, p< 0. 142) and OSM. Average hydration status indicated variability among some of the instruments: digital refractometer USG= 1. 0194 ± 0. 0075, clinical refractometer USG= 1. 020 ± 0. 007, urinometer USG= 1. 028 ± 0. 091, osmometer OSM= 743 ± 271) Conclusions: Handheld clinical refractometry can be used confidently for assessing hydration status as it shows a strong significant correlation with the gold standard osmometer, which is consistent with previous literature. Additionally, the use of the pen style digital refractometer showed a strong, significant correlation with the gold standard osmometer and provides clinicians with another option for the clinical assessment of USG and hydration status. The findings of this also study suggest that the use of a midget urinometer should be performed with extreme caution, as it showed a weak correlation with the gold standard osmometer, indicating it might not provide accurate results when used to determine hydration status.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{framework}} for trajectory planning and control of tracked vehicles for rescue environments, based on Augmented Reality (AR). The framework provides the human operator with an AR-based interface that facilitates both 3 D path planning and obstacle negotiation. The interface converts the 3 D movements of a marker <b>pen,</b> <b>handheld</b> by the operator, into trajectories feasible for the tracked vehicle. The framework implements a trajectory tracking controller to allow the tracked vehicle to autonomously follow the trajectories, decided by the operator. This controller relies on a localization system which provides, at real-time, position feedback. The localization system exploits the performance of a Dead Reckoning System together with the accuracy of an ICP-based SLAM in pose estimation, to determine the pose of the tracked vehicle within the 3 D map. We demonstrate the application of the planning framework in autonomous robot navigation for evaluating the robot capabilities in rescue environments. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the trajectory tracking control method. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Arm {{and hand}} {{movements}} are generally controlled {{using a combination}} of sensory-based and memory-based guidance mechanisms. This study examined similarities and differences in visually-guided and memory-guided arm movements, and sought to determine as to what extent certain control principles apply to each type of movement. In particular, the 2 / 3 power law is a principle that appears to govern the formation of complex, curved hand trajectories; it specifies that the tangential velocity should be proportional to the radius of curvature raised to an exponent of 1 / 3. A virtual reality system was used to project complex target paths in three-dimensional (3 D) space. Human subjects first tracked (with the tip of a <b>handheld</b> <b>pen)</b> a single target moving along an unseen path. The entire target path then became visible and the subject traced the shape. Finally, the target shape disappeared and the subject was to draw it, in the same 3 D space, from memory. Most aspects of the movements (speed, path size, shape and arm postures) were very similar across the three conditions. However, subjects adhered to the 2 / 3 power law most closely in the tracing condition, when the entire target path was visible. Also, only within the tracing condition, there were significant differences {{in the value of the}} exponent depending on the size and the spatial orientation of the trajectory. In the tracking and drawing conditions, the exponent was greater than 1 / 3, indicating that subjects spent more time in areas of tight curvature. This may represent a strategy for learning and remembering the complex shape...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose:to study {{changes of}} the intraocular {{pressure}} at high altitude and to compare tonometric measurements and atmospheric pressure. The intraocular pressure (IOP) increase {{is one of the}} favourable factors in the apoptosis or death of the retinal nervous cells and is responsable for the progressive lost of the same cells. Methods:during the "Cho Oyu 2008 " expedition, some tonometric readings were recorded to 13123 ft. at the main base campsat 21066 ft. Four climbers undergone an ophthalmic check-up and a retinal peripapillary fibers thickness study with laser scanning polarimeter (GDx VCC Zeiss) before the depart. During the expedition, tonometric measurements were taken using the <b>handheld</b> instrument Tono <b>Pen</b> Avia (Reichert). Upon returning from the expedition, the four mountain climbers once more underwent ophthalmic examination and a study of the nervous retinal peripapillary fibers using GDxVCC. The readings recorded were analyzed using a Test T. Data collection on web and data elaboration was managed by CoMed research. Results:compared with the readings recorded during the first examination, a rise in the pressure readings was observed during the expedition. The IOP increase proved to be directly proportional to the reduction of the atmospheric pressure. However, when the measurements were taken again a week after, at the same altitude, a fall in the IOP readings was observed with a decrease within original readings. Conclusions:the ascent to high altitude initially determines a IOP increase in healthy subjects. However, the rise in IOP {{does not appear to be}} permanent. After an initial adjustment period, IOP readings returned within normal parameters. GDx measurements taken before and after the expedition are already under observation...|$|R
