Although {{he praised}} the {{economic}} system, and the complex interrelations {{between the various}} buildings, he was critical {{of the lack of}} an in-depth tutorial, the necessity to return to the main menu so as to load a new game, and overly simplistic combat.

5000|$|Like the bards {{throughout}} the ages, Brother Blue was fÃªted by titular nobility; {{he is known}} for the poignancy of his autobiographical tale of telling stories to enthrall, cheer, and uplift an English Duchess, and his feelings of guilt and dismay upon learning of her suicide on the coattails of his departure, wondering [...] "if only" [...] he could have told her <b>just</b> the <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing,</b> given her the <b>one</b> <b>more</b> smile into her soul...|$|R

50|$|Falco {{suspects}} something, but {{the obvious}} suspect is his guest and claiming an injury. Yet Claudia is convinced {{it was not}} an accident, and she asks Falco to investigate. Seeing the site of the death, he is convinced someone else was there when Constans died. Now it is <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> he has to prove.|$|E
50|$|Falk plays Abe Reles, {{a vicious}} thug {{who led the}} Murder, Inc. gang and was {{believed}} to have committed thirty murders, {{for which he was}} never prosecuted. The film was the first major feature role for Falk, who was nominated for a best supporting actor Academy Award for his performance. In his 2006 autobiography, <b>Just</b> <b>One</b> <b>More</b> <b>Thing,</b> Falk said that Murder, Inc. launched his career.|$|E
6000|$|... "Election be hanged!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Don't be childish, Annabel. We are off for {{a second}} honeymoon. <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more.</b> We may be stopped. Don't look so frightened. You called {{yourself}} a murderess. You are nothing of the sort. What you did is called manslaughter, and at the worst {{there is only a}} very slight penalty, nothing to be frightened about in the least. Remember that." ...|$|R

5000|$|Murder, Inc. {{was filmed}} {{in and around}} New York City, and the cast {{consisted}} largely of actors from the off-Broadway theater. Peter Falk recalled in his autobiography <b>Just</b> <b>One</b> <b>More</b> <b>Thing</b> that the film was [...] "no big deal for Twentieth Century Fox. They hired second-tier stars, nobody {{had ever heard of}} them. The cast of off-Broadway stage actors, including me, came cheap. A few dollars a week and a bag of peanuts." ...|$|E
5000|$|The film {{turned out}} to be Falk's {{breakout}} role. In his autobiography, <b>Just</b> <b>One</b> <b>More</b> <b>Thing</b> (2006), Falk said his selection for the film from thousands of other Off-Broadway actors was a [...] "miracle" [...] that [...] "made my career" [...] and that without it, he would not have gotten the other significant movie roles that he later played. Falk, who played Reles again in the 1960 TV series The Witness, was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his performance in the film.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going out}} of preaching, {{at least for the}} present. After things get into shape with me again, I may set up to teach people how to live, but just now I can't do it. I've got all I can do to {{instruct}} myself. <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more.</b> I owe two or three of you here. I've got the money for William Bacon, James Bartlett and John Jennings. I turn the mare and cutter over to Jacob Bensen, for the note he holds. I hain't got much religion left, but I've got some morality. That's all I want to say now." ...|$|R

And, miss'--he clenched his hands till the nails hurt the leathern flesh--'and, miss, there's <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>more</b> I'd like to say. You'll be having {{a good deal of time}} to {{yourself}} for awhile; you'll be able to do a good bit of thinking without anyone to disturb you; and what I'd like you to give your mind to, if you don't object, is just to think whether you can't forget that narrow-chested, God-forsaken blighter who treated you so mean, and get half-way fond of someone who knows jolly well you're the only girl there is.' ...|$|R

50|$|After a {{year and}} a half in the Merchant Marine, Falk {{returned}} to Hamilton College and also attended the University of Wisconsin. He transferred to the New School for Social Research in New York City, which awarded him a bachelor's degree in literature and political science in 1951. He then traveled in Europe and worked on a railroad in Yugoslavia for six months. He returned to New York, enrolling at Syracuse University, but he recalled in his 2006 memoir, <b>Just</b> <b>One</b> <b>More</b> <b>Thing,</b> that he was unsure what he wanted to do with his life for years after leaving high school.|$|E

5000|$|Reporting by The Cancer Letter was key in {{bringing}} the spotlight to problems within a Duke University cancer research group producing problematic research results, {{as reported by the}} CBS investigative journalist show 60 Minutes on March 5, 2012: [...] "Many trusted Anil Potti because Dr. Potti's work had been vindicated. But there was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> - discovered, not by a scientist, but by Paul Goldberg, the editor of a small independent newsletter called 'The Cancer Letter.' Goldberg got a tip from a confidential source: check Dr. Potti's Rhodes scholarship. It was right there on his applications for federal grants. Trouble was it wasn't true." [...] The Duke research group had eleven scientific journal articles retracted, seven others corrected, and one partially retracted. [...] CBS News, 60 Minutes won a Peabody award for the reporting.|$|E

5000|$|Meaning, in contrast, is {{something}} mental. But {{to try to}} put a halt to the name-game of proliferating nonexplanatory synonyms for the mind/body problem without solving it (or, worse, implying that {{there is more than one}} mind/body problem), let us cite <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>more</b> <b>thing</b> that requires no further explication: feeling. The only thing that distinguishes an internal state that merely has grounding from one that has meaning is that it feels like something to be in the meaning state, whereas it does not feel like anything to be in the merely grounded functional state. Grounding is a functional matter; feeling is a felt matter. And that is the real source of Brentano's vexed peekaboo relation between [...] "intentionality" [...] and its internal [...] "intentional object": All mental states, in addition to being the functional states of an autonomous dynamical system, are also feeling states: Feelings are not merely [...] "functed," [...] as all other physical states are; feelings are also felt.|$|E

Later that night, Emma follows through with getting the necklace, but Lily pulls a fast one on Emma by stealing money from Emma's parents and runs away. When Emma returned home, Emma's parents surprised her, having called her social worker, and discovering that Lily is a known criminal. The parents are now upset with Emma for not telling them and allowing such a person into their home; the actions would result in Emma being {{kicked out of the}} house. Later that night, Lily catches up with a now furious Emma at a bus stop, and claims that no matter what she does, everything goes wrong and adding that her [...] "whole life is darkness," [...] but when Emma is around it gets brighter. Lily then begs Emma to stay in her life, but a bitter Emma leaves, saying she is better off alone.|$|E
