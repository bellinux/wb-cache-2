25|$|Former {{editor-in-chief}} Robert McHenry {{believes that}} Britannica failed to exploit its early advantages {{in the market}} for electronic encyclopedias. Britannica had, for example, published the second multimedia encyclopedia titled Compton's MultiMedia Encyclopedia as early as 1989 (the first one being the Academic American Encyclopedia published by Grolier), but did not launch Britannica CD until 1994, a year after Microsoft launched their Encarta encyclopedia. McHenry believes these failures were due to a reluctance among senior management to fully embrace the new technology, caused largely by the overriding influence of the sales staff and management. The sales personnel earned commissions from <b>door-to-door</b> <b>selling</b> of the print encyclopedias, which McHenry believes led to decisions about the distribution and pricing of the electronic products being driven by the desires of the sales personnel rather than market conditions and customer expectations.|$|E

50|$|In England and Europe {{during the}} medieval period, the term 'huckster' was synonymous with peddler. Hucksters and peddlers {{belonged to a}} broad group of resellers who {{purchased}} surplus stocks from weekly provincial markets and fairs and then resold them at larger daily markets or engaged in <b>door-to-door</b> <b>selling.</b> Over time, the distinction between hucksters and peddlers became more pronounced. The term, huckster, came to refer to market-based food vendors while peddlers referred to itinerant vendors {{of a wide range}} of merchandise. Hucksters tended to charge higher prices than producers who were selling at the market places because they added a margin to their cost price.|$|E

50|$|Seats for {{the public}} concerts were sold {{door-to-door}} by uniformed Sergeants. Commissioners Sir William Horwood and Lord Byng both objected to this, as did the Police Federation, claiming that people may feel intimidated into buying tickets and that it detracted from {{the dignity of the}} rank. The Minstrels survived by pointing to the amounts of money they raised for charity. However, Lord Trenchard discovered that ticket sales were entirely dependent on this method of selling and felt that this was a form of blackmail. In 1932, he ordered that the <b>door-to-door</b> <b>selling</b> should cease. The Minstrels attempted to continue by selling tickets from theatre box offices and police stations, but were disbanded the following year.|$|E
