5|$|This {{crocodile}} is to {{be found}} in the <b>freshwater</b> <b>swamps,</b> marshes and lakes of New Guinea, particularly in the interior. It has been known to enter brackish waters such as those of the Fly River estuary but is very rare in coastal areas, and never found in the presence of the competing saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). The animal was first described from the Sepik River area in the north of Papua New Guinea. A separate population is found in the southern half of the island, with a range that extends from southeastern Papua New Guinea to the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. It is separated from the northern population by the New Guinea Highlands, a mountain range that runs along the centre of the island. DNA analysis has revealed these to be genetically separate populations, and there are some differences in their morphology and behavior. There are estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000 New Guinea crocodiles in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The Kaipara Harbour is a {{productive}} marine ecosystem, with diverse habitats and ecotones. There are tidal reaches, intertidal mudflats and sandflats, <b>freshwater</b> <b>swamps,</b> maritime rushes, reed beds and coastal scrublands. The area includes 125 square kilometres of mangrove forest. with subtidal fringes of seagrass.|$|E
25|$|The major {{ecosystems}} include mangrove and <b>freshwater</b> <b>swamps</b> and marshes, sedge prairie, pine savanna, and gallery forest.

50|$|<b>Freshwater</b> <b>swamp</b> forests, or flooded forests, are forests {{which are}} {{inundated}} with freshwater, either permanently or seasonally.

25|$|Saltwater {{crocodiles}} generally {{spend the}} tropical wet season in <b>freshwater</b> <b>swamps</b> and rivers, moving downstream to estuaries {{in the dry}} season, and sometimes travelling far out to sea. Crocodiles compete fiercely {{with each other for}} territory, with dominant males in particular occupying the most eligible stretches of freshwater creeks and streams. Junior crocodiles are thus forced into the more marginal river systems and sometimes into the ocean. This explains the large distribution of the animal (ranging from the east coast of India to northern Australia), as well as its being found in the odd places on occasion (such as the Sea of Japan). Like all crocodiles, they can survive for prolonged periods in only warm temperatures, and crocodiles seasonally vacate parts of Australia if cold spells hit.|$|E
25|$|Palms inhabit {{a variety}} of ecosystems. More than two-thirds of palm species live in humid moist forests, where some species grow tall enough to form part of the canopy and shorter ones form part of the understory. Some species form pure stands in areas with poor {{drainage}} or regular flooding, including Raphia hookeri which is common in coastal <b>freshwater</b> <b>swamps</b> in West Africa. Other palms live in tropical mountain habitats above 1000m, {{such as those in}} the genus Ceroxylon native to the Andes. Palms may also live in grasslands and scrublands, usually associated with a water source, and in desert oases such as the date palm. A few palms are adapted to extremely basic lime soils, while others are similarly adapted to extreme potassium deficiency and toxicity of heavy metals in serpentine soils.|$|E

In New Guinea it is restricted to areas which have a distinct dry season.|$|E

500|$|The New Guinea {{crocodile}} (Crocodylus novaeguineae) {{is a small}} {{species of}} crocodile found {{on the island of}} New Guinea where there are two geographically isolated populations to the north and south of the mountain ridge that runs along the centre of the island. In the past it included the Philippine crocodile, C. n. mindorensis, as a subspecies, but today they are regarded as separate species. The habitat of the New Guinea crocodile is mostly <b>freshwater</b> <b>swamps</b> and lakes. It is most active at night when it feeds on fish and a range of other small animals. A female crocodile lays a clutch of eggs in a nest composed of vegetation and she lies up nearby to guard the nest. There is some degree of parental care for newly hatched juveniles. This crocodile was over-hunted for its valuable skin in the mid 20th century, but conservation measures have since been put in place, it is reared in ranches and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists it as being of [...] "Least Concern".|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} swamp forests {{have almost}} entirely been removed as the plain {{has been converted}} to rice paddies, other agriculture, and urban areas like Bangkok. Much of the wildlife that once inhabited these plains has disappeared, including {{a large number of}} fish in the river systems, birds such as vultures, the Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae), the sarus crane (Grus antigone) and animals such as tigers, Asian elephants, Javan rhinoceroses, and the much-hunted Schomburgk's deer. Today we can only guess at the original habitat and wildlife by comparing it with neighbouring countries. It is believed that the area [...] would have consisted of <b>freshwater</b> <b>swamps</b> inland and salty mangroves on the coast and the river estuaries. The swamp would have been covered in Phragmites marsh grasses. Today there is a small area of this remaining in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, a relic of the original landscape.|$|E
