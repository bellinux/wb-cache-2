40|$|A {{series of}} {{mixtures}} comprising an antiferroelectric liquid-crystal host and a chiral dopant {{is described in}} which the layer spacing variation at the orthogonal smectic-A* (SmA*) to tilted smectic-C* or smectic-C-alpha* (SmC* or SmC alpha*) phase transition changes from the usual strong contraction in the pure system to one {{in which there is}} almost no layer spacing change observed across the transition for dopant concentrations of 7 %. The nature of the orthogonal to tilted phase transition is examined using Raman spectroscopy, to determine the order parameters and in the SmA* phase, and via a generalized Landau expansion to reveal the details of the phase transition itself. The results show that the value of at the orthogonal to tilted transition increases from around 0. 6 to 0. 7 as the dopant concentration increases, while remains constant at approximately 0. 4 irrespective of dopant concentration. Further, the generalized Landau potential measurements prove that the transition is purely second order, while electro-optic measurements confirm that the tilt angle at the transition becomes smaller with increasing dopant concentration. The combined data show that the high-temperature tilted phase regime corresponds to a SmC alpha* phase rather than the mechanism suggested by de Vries that is inferred by the layer spacing data alone. We demonstrate that the lower-temperature SmC alpha*-SmC* phase transition is of first order. Further, the temperature range of the SmC alpha* phase increases dramatically with concentration, from around 2 K in the pure system to around 21 K in the 8 % <b>doped</b> <b>mixture,</b> showing that the chiral dopant plays a role in stabilizing this phase. Indeed, we particularly note that for the 8 % <b>doped</b> <b>mixture</b> all other SmC*-like phases disappear and that the only tilted phase remaining is SmC alpha*.

The effect of DOPE on transfection efficiency was found to be inhibition of the ethyl compound, stimulation or inhibition (depending on amount of DOPE) of the hexyl compound and stimulation {{in the case of the}} octadecyl compound, i. e., DOPE had a beneficial effect on the lipids that formed non-lamellar phases. X-ray diffraction was used to determine the lyotropic phase of the lipid-DOPE mixtures and of the lipid-DNA complex. DNA-lipid complexes tended to be lamellar unless the lipids had a very strong tendency toward the hexagonal phase, in which case the DNA complex was also hexagonal. Thus, a mixture of equal amounts of DOPE and hexyl-DOPC formed a lamellar complex with DNA, although the lipids on their own assumed the hexagonal phase.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} two frontier problems in membrane research. The first {{is about the}} outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria for which there was little prior research. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) bilayer {{as a model for}} the outer membrane, the problem of how antimicrobial peptides pass through the outer membrane were studied by oriented circular dichroism (OCD). The second is about non-lamellar structure of lipids that are important for membrane fusion. Two lipid structures, in the inverted HII phase and the distorted HII phase, respectively, are solved by a novel method through neutron scattering. Lipopolysaccharide bilayer was used to mimic the gram-negative bacterial outer membrane. X-ray diffraction patterns show that LPS forms a well aligned multilayer system. Some ions, such as barium (Ba++), were found to be located at the phosphate group in LPS headgroup. OCD spectra show that alpha-helical peptide mellitin and magainin have two different bound states to LPS multilayer that differs in the orientation with the respect to membrane. At high peptide concentration, they are in the active state, i. e. transmembrane state, whereas at low peptide concentration, they are in the inactive state in which they are oriented parallel to the membrane. In contrast, beta-sheet peptide protegrin only showed the transmembrane state.

With up to 30 mole% lysolipid in <b>DOPE,</b> the <b>mixture</b> maintains the inverted hexagonal (HII) phase in excess water, where increasing levels of lysolipid result in a systematic increase in the HII lattice dimension.

LysoPEs, in contrast, add very small curvatures. When both polar group and hydrocarbon chains of the added lysolipid mismatch those of DOPE, the structural effects are qualitatively different from otherwise.

The method relied on the different permeability of the lipid membrane towards the incident atoms during deposition.

40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} work was the {{investigation}} of the mechanism of the thresholdless hysteresis free electrooptical mode-V-shaped mode - in the chiral smectic C* phase of Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals. The present work was {{based on the assumption that}} the crucial factor for the V-shaped mode is a form of the electric field applied to the FLC layer. Such a specific electric field is the consequence of the dynamic voltage divider formed by the alignment/insulating layers and a FLC layer. To prove this hypothesis, experimental and computer modelling techniques were utilized. In the experiments we investigated a number of FLC mixtures which parameters (spontaneous polarization, viscosity, tilt angle, response time) are varied in a broad range. This was to demonstrate that the V-shaped mode is a general effect in FLC’s and, namely, the dynamic voltage divider plays a crucial role. First, we demonstrated that the FLC cell is real dynamic voltage divider. For that purpose it was demonstrated that the capacitance of the FLC layer of the standard cell filled with the mixture Felix 015 / 000 (Clarian) decreases at more than 10 times upon the application of the external electric field, whereas other parameters (mainly resistivity of both of the layers) are constant. To confirm our assumption about the role of the dynamic voltage divider, we modelled its electrical parameters by attaching external elements a) the capacitor in series to modify the alignment layers capacitance and b) the parallel resistivity to modify the FLC layer conductivity. As a result, we observed the dramatic increase of the value of the inversion frequency. In addition the external capacitance allowed us to measure the voltage applied to the FLC layer. As it was expected, this voltage has a different form and amplitude than the total one. When we plotted the electrooptical response as a function of this voltage on one side and the total voltage on the other side we saw that the electooptical response is really thresholdless and hysteresis free, but only for the latter case. For the former one it has a typical hysteresis loop. It means that the V-shaped switching is rather apparent but not a real effect. The further investigations were implemented in order to understand the role of the parameters of the cell (FLC and alignment/insulating layers thickness) for the performance of the V-shaped mode. For that purpose, we fabricated the wedge FLC cell filled with FLC 438 and having the Al 2 O 3 insulating layers. It was shown that the dependence of the inversion frequency on the FLC layer thickness had two distinguished regions: a) from 0. 8 ?m to 1. 8 ?m, this function went down as it was predicted by the Pikin theory, b) from 0. 6 ?m to 0. 8 ?m it increased, this can be explained by the local variation of the parameters of the cell. During the same time, the saturation voltage gradually decreases, which was also in accordance with Pikin’s theory. Moreover, the computer modelling confirmed these experiments. The influence of the FLC conductivity on the V-shaped mode was investigated in detail. First, we selected the FLC mixture with low spontaneous polarization (Felix 015 / 000) and a thick commercially available EHC cell (2 ?m). According to any previous theory, the existence of the V-shaped under these conditions is impossible. After that, this <b>mixture</b> was <b>doped</b> with TCNQ at two different concentrations (0. 01 % and 1 %) and infiltrated in the cells. Our experiments showed that the inversion frequency for the strongly <b>doped</b> <b>mixture</b> is ten times higher than that for slightly doped one and it is equal to 26 Hz. This result proves that the conductivity of the FLC’s plays a crucial role in the V-shaped switching...|$|R

Pseudo-binary mixtures were also studied as a control. Miscibility behavior was inferred from π–A curves applying the additivity rule by calculating the excess free energy of mixture (ΔGExc). The interaction between the lipids was also deduced from the surface compressional modulus (Cs− 1). The deviation from ideality shows dependence on the lipid polar head type and monolayer composition. For lower DOPE concentrations, the forces are predominantly attractive. However, if the monolayer is DOPE rich, the DOTAP presence disturbs the PE–PE intermolecular interaction and the net interaction is then repulsive. The ternary monolayer EPC/DOPE/DOTAP presented itself in two configurations, modulated by the DOPE content, in a similar behavior to the DOPE/DOTAP monolayers. These results contribute {{to the understanding of}} the lipid interactions and packing in self-assembled systems associated with the in vitro and in vivo stability of liposomes...|$|R

Experimental results show spectral shifts of the typical ROT- 300 absorption and fluorescence bands with respect to that in apolar solvent medium. Data analysis leads consistently to attribute this feature mainly to the freezing of the diffusive movement of the dye molecules confined in the nanodomains of the surfactant liquid crystals, whilst minor effects can be due to interaction with the surfactant polar groups. Potentialities of these novel luminescent nanostructured composites as dye lasers, optical amplifiers and solar concentrators have been highlighted. In particular, under optical pumping using a pulse laser,amplified spontaneous fluorescence emission of the ROT- 300 /HDEHP system above an excitation energy threshold value of about 725 mJ cm- 2 was observed...|$|R
40|$|The fuel sulfur {{content in}} marine fuels has been {{regulated}} in Sulfur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) since January 2015. However, other fuel characteristics are also {{believed to have}} an impact on particle emissions, particularly on the number of particles emitted. This study investigates the impact of the content of aromatics in fuel. To achieve fuel blends with concentrations of aromatics similar to those found in marine fuel oils, i. e. 20 %– 30 % by volume (%vol.), normal diesel oil (4 %– 5 % vol. aromatics) is <b>doped</b> with a <b>mixture</b> of aromatics. Emission measurements are conducted in test-bed engine facilities and particle emissions over a wide size range are analyzed. Results show a decreased number of particles emitted (or not change) with an increase in the aromatic concentration in fuel. This is because there is a reduction in the cetane number of the fuel with an increased aromatic content, which effects the combustion process and results in decreased particle formation. However, when ignition improver is used to increase the cetane number, particle emissions remain at a lower level than for normal diesel oil; thereby emphasizing the presence of other factors in the formation of particles...|$|R

These nanofibers {{are produced by}} anelectrospinning process. Nanofibers are fabricated using polymeric solutions of CoO <b>doped</b> ATO and <b>mixtures</b> of PS: D-limonene and PS:toluene. PSis a base aromatic organic polymer, a non-toxic material, and a versatile catalyst for fiber formation. PSsolutions are made by mixing polystyrene beads and D-limonene or toluene at specific weight percentages. These polymeric solutions of PS: D-limonene and PS:toluene are then mixed with CoO-ATO at various weight percentages. The two solutions are electrospun and the best process parameters optimized to obtain nanofibers with limited beading. Process optimization is completed by analyzing how changes in the electrospinningexperimental set up impact nanofiber formation and production efficiency (speed of formation). CoO-ATO nanofibers are characterizedby scanning electron microscopy, hydrophobicity via contact angle measurements, and viscosity measurements. Additional analysis is conducted to evaluate {{the environmental impact of}} using two different solvents to fabricate the CoO-ATO nanofibers.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the ashing temperature and inorganic additives on the reducing-atmosphere ash fusion temperatures of a mixture of coal-associated minerals was investigated. Different inorganic compounds {{were added to the}} mixture to represent trace minerals in coal or coal ash. The samples were ashed at either 500 °C or 815 °C in air as preparation for ash fusion temperature experiments. The ashing temperature influenced the ash fusion temperatures of the mineral <b>mixture</b> <b>doped</b> with 4 % NaCl, PbCO 3 and CrO 3 at {{one or both of the}} ashing temperatures. The addition of GeS and SrCO 3 resulted in a decreasing trend in the AFTs of the mineral mixture, and that of GeO 2 resulted in an increasing trend. The lowering of the AFTs from the addition of PbCO 3 was comparable to the effect from NaCl. The concept of ionic potential provides an insight into why different additives produce different effects. In general, additives containing elements of low ionic potential (< 25 nm– 1) interact to reduce AFTs. Those with elements of high ionic potential (≥ 100 nm– 1) will raise AFTs. The effect of the inorganic compounds on the mineral mixture is dependent on speciation and decomposition temperature, ashing temperature, and chemistry of the compounds and/or their decomposition productsSasol Technology, Research andDevelopment[URL]...|$|R
