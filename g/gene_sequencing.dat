5|$|Polycystic {{kidney disease}} (PKD) is a slowly {{progressive}} disease affecting Persian and Persian-related breeds, in which fluid-filled cysts expand within the kidneys, destroying functional tissue. While renal cysts are observed {{with a low}} incidence in Maine Coons, PKD {{appears to be a}} misnomer in this particular breed. In a recent study spanning 8 years, renal cysts were documented by ultrasound in 7 of 187 healthy Maine Coons enrolled in a pre-breeding screening programme. The cysts were mostly single and unilateral (6/7, 85.7%) small (mean 3.6mm in diameter) and located at corticomedullary junction (4/6, 66.7%), thus different in size, numbers and location from those observed in Persian-related breeds. In the same study, not only did all six Maine Coon cats with renal cysts test negative for the PKD1 mutation, proving the disease in these cats to be unrelated to the PKD observed in Persians and related breeds, but <b>gene</b> <b>sequencing</b> of these cats failed to demonstrate any common genetic sequences. The presence of renal cysts, in the absence of other changes, does not appear to negatively impact the patients' quality of life, as those for which follow-up was available were reported alive and well in adulthood. Although the exact nature and clinical relevance of renal cysts in Maine Coons is currently unknown, its screening is still recommended for pre-breeding assessment. Ultrasonography is currently the only valid diagnostic method for its detection in this breed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Ambiguity {{is one of}} the {{important}} issues not only in natural and programming languages, but also in <b>gene</b> <b>sequences.</b> In programming languages, the ambiguity is defined as existence of (at least) two distinct derivations that yield a same word. Considering in that line, ambiguity in <b>gene</b> <b>sequences</b> may be interpreted as a <b>gene</b> <b>sequence</b> can be obtained by more than one way such that its intermediate <b>gene</b> <b>sequences</b> are different. Analyzing the ambiguity issues in <b>gene</b> <b>sequences</b> will help us to know the evolution of <b>gene</b> <b>sequences.</b> Recently, in [9] a new variant called Matrix insertion-deletion systems has been introduced as a biologically inspired computing model to represent various bio-molecular structures such as pseudoknot, hairpin, stem and loop, attenuator, dumbbell and cloverleaf. But the ambiguity issues of Matrix insertion-deletion systems has not been analyzed in detail yet. In this paper, we formally define various levels (0, 1, 2, 3) of ambiguity for Matrix insertion-deletion systems based on the components used in the derivation such as axiom, context, string (used for insertion/deletion). Next, we relate the newly defined ambiguity levels of Matrix insertion-deletion systems with bio-molecular structures and analyze their ambiguity issues. We notice that ideal language obeys the level 0 -ambiguity, stem and loop structure obeys level 1 -ambiguity, cloverleaf structure obeys level 2 -ambiguity and orthodox language obeys level 3 -ambiguity.

500|$|Until {{the use of}} <b>gene</b> <b>sequencing</b> {{to create}} phylogenetic trees became practical, phylogenies were created {{on the basis of}} morphology. Such {{traditional}} phylogenies suggested that venom originated in multiple branches among Squamata approximately 100 million years ago. More recent studies using nuclear gene sequences found the presence of similar venom proteins in several lizards within a clade that was named [...] "Toxicofera". This led to the theory that venom originated only once within the entire lineage approximately 170 million years ago. This ancestral venom consisted of a very simple set of proteins, assembled in a pair of glands. The venoms of the different lineages then diversified and evolved independently, along with their means of injecting venom into prey. This diversification included the independent evolution of front-fanged venom delivery from the ancestral rear-fanged venom delivery system. The single origin hypothesis also suggests that venom systems subsequently atrophied, or were completely lost, independently in a number of lineages. The American “rat snakes,” such as Pantherophis guttatus, lost their venom following the evolution of constriction as a means of prey capture. The independent evolution of constriction in the fish-eating aquatic genus Acrochordus also saw the degradation of the venom system. Two independent lineages, one terrestrial and one marine, that shifted to an egg-based diet, also possess the remnants of an atrophied venom system.|$|E
