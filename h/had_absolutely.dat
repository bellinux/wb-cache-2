The couple lived together in Independence, Missouri, while Debora finished her residency, but by 1978 they had separated and then divorced. Debora cited basic incompatibility {{as the reason for}} the divorce—"e <b>had</b> <b>absolutely</b> no common interests", she was later quoted as saying—but the divorce was friendly.|$|E

25|$|For a long time, {{number theory}} in general, {{and the study}} of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the {{canonical}} example of pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly. In particular, number theorists such as British mathematician G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that <b>had</b> <b>absolutely</b> no military significance. However, this vision was shattered in the 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used {{as the basis for the}} creation of public key cryptography algorithms. Prime numbers are also used for hash tables and pseudorandom number generators.|$|E
25|$|In the end, five American battleships were sunk, {{three were}} damaged, and eleven other cruisers, destroyers, and {{auxiliaries}} were sunk or seriously damaged. The Japanese lost only 29 aircraft, while 74 were damaged by anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} ground. The damaged aircraft were disproportionately dive and torpedo bombers, seriously impacting available firepower to exploit the first two waves' success, so {{the commander of the}} First Air Fleet, Naval Lieutenant-General Chuichi Nagumo, withdrew. Yamamoto later lamented Nagumo's failure to seize the initiative to seek out and destroy the US carriers, absent from the harbor, or further bombard various strategically important facilities on Oahu. Nagumo <b>had</b> <b>absolutely</b> no idea where the American carriers might be, and remaining on station while his forces cast about looking for them ran the risk of his own forces being found first and attacked while his aircraft were absent searching. In any case, insufficient daylight remained after recovering the aircraft from the first two waves for the carriers to launch and recover a third before dark, and Nagumo's escorting destroyers lacked the fuel capacity for him to loiter long. Much has been made of Yamamoto's hindsight, but, in keeping with Japanese military tradition not to criticize the commander on the spot, he did not punish Nagumo for his withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|No Qualification was {{required}} for the Bravehearts for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup due to participating in the 2008 tournament. They were drawn in pool C alongside World Cup debutantes Italy and the powerful forwards and fast backs of Tonga. Every team needed to play 3 group games each so Scotland would also play an inter-group game against the other World Cup debutantes the United States. The Scots were underdogs against the Pacific Island nation who were full of NRL talent. But Scotland, {{in front of a}} record crowd at Derwent Park made another upset (like Fiji five years ago) winning a tough match by only a two-point margin {{at the end of the}} match. Scotland's second match was against the Italians at the same venue in front of more than 7,000 fans again who this time witnessed a high scoring draw. Scotland then finished their group stage by beating the United States convincingly. Scotland had almost qualified for the World Cup knockout stage for the first ever time but Italy were still within a chance to finish above Scotland and therefore eliminate Scotland's chances from progressing any further in the 2013 tournament. Italy only needed to win after they were also on 16+ points differential and they were facing Tonga who <b>had</b> <b>absolutely</b> nothing at stake but pride to play for. But, a shock to all, Tonga outclassed the Italians and eliminated them from participating any further in the competition. In the quarter-final they had a rare clash with a rugby league heavyweight. They took on New Zealand in Leeds in front of their biggest attendance away from Scotland. Despite their early defensive pressure that the crowd loved to cheer out loud for, Scotland's lack of experience against the heavyweight nations showed on the scoreboard and were therefore eliminated in a pleasing World Cup performance.|$|E

Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House soon after his announcement, Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position: [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>absolutely</b> no input for nine months. I think I had to be honest with myself and honest with the electorate about that and not pretend." [...] Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny, Lee said there were [...] "certainly lots of large mutterings at the moment in relation to the leader's position". He said he had [...] "minimal involvement" [...] with Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton. [...] "I had a maximum of two or three conversations with Richard Bruton in a total nine months period. I don’t know how my relationship is with [...] " [...] Lee said.|$|E

500|$|The Workmans {{struggled}} with labor problems continually, needing local porters to carry gear {{for them because}} they could not carry a sufficient amount for themselves for a multi-month expedition. [...] They had to transport Mummery tents, eider sleeping bags, camera equipment, scientific instruments, and a large supply of food. The porters were skeptical of the entire venture. The locals rarely climbed mountains and were not used to taking orders from a woman, which made Fanny's position difficult. The Workmans tried to solve these problems with condescension and high-handedness. Kenneth Mason maintains in his history of Himalayan mountaineering, written in 1955, that [...] "The Workmans were, on their journeys, the victims of their own faults. They were too impatient and rarely tried to understand the mentality of the porters and so did not get the best out of them." [...] Labor problems beset all of their expeditions because, as Miller puts it, [...] "Almost alone of Victorian travellers, the Workmans <b>had</b> <b>absolutely</b> no sympathy or even common-sense understanding of the local people, into whose poor and remote villages they burst with trains of followers demanding service and supplies." [...] In her chapter on Workman, Miller argues that the couple, being American, did not have the same sense of caste or class that British explorers had: [...] "the Workmans, like most of their countrymen, plunged in their enterprises headlong, expecting their enormous energy to overcome all obstacles. They were justifiably criticized by the British for their callous, incompetent behavior toward the Indians." ...|$|E
500|$|In Chapter 1 Hitchens {{describes}} abandoning {{religion in}} his youth, and promoting [...] "cruel revolutionary rubbish" [...] as a Trotskyist activist. He claims his generation had become intellectually aloof from religion, rebellious and disillusioned and in Chapter 2 explores further {{reasons for this}} disillusion, including the Suez Crisis and the Profumo Affair. In Chapter 3, Hitchens recounts how he embraced scientific inquiry and adopted liberal positions {{on issues such as}} marriage, abortion, homosexuality, and patriotism. Chapter 4 is a lament for the [...] "noble austerity" [...] of his childhood in Britain. Chapter 5 explores what Hitchens views as the pseudo-religion surrounding Churchill and World War II heroes – a [...] "great cult of noble, patriotic death" [...] whose only equivalent, he claims, was in the Soviet Union. Hitchens then asserts that, [...] "The Christian Church has been powerfully damaged by letting itself be confused with love of country and the making of great wars". In Chapter 6 Hitchens recalls being a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union and a trip to Mogadishu, and how these experiences convinced him that, [...] "his own civilisation was infinitely precious and utterly vulnerable". In Chapter 7 Hitchens charts his return to Christianity, and makes particular reference to the experience of seeing the Rogier van der Weyden painting The Last Judgement: [...] "I gaped, my mouth actually hanging open. These people did not appear remote or from the ancient past; they were my own generation ... I <b>had</b> <b>absolutely</b> no doubt I was among the damned". In Chapter 8 Hitchens examines the diminishing of Christianity in Britain and its potential causes.|$|E
