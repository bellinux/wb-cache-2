5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.

As the light streams in from the right it brightly <b>glints</b> on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E

The ISS takes about 10 minutes to pass from one horizon to another, and will only be visible part of that time because of moving into or out of the Earth's shadow. Because of the size of its reflective surface area, the ISS is the brightest artificial object in the sky, excluding flares, with an approximate maximum magnitude of −4 when overhead (similar to Venus). The ISS, like many satellites including the Iridium constellation, can also produce flares of up to 8 or 16 times the brightness of Venus as sunlight <b>glints</b> off reflective surfaces.

According to Lynn Fox, Björk gave the team the initial sketch of the track in January 2004. Whilst they were doing scribbles for it, they had several phone conversations with the singer and emailed her images to keep her up to date with {{the progress of the}} work. For [...] "Oceania", initial animations took six weeks, then had couple of days preparing for the shoot in Iceland and a few more days after to put all the shots together. Björk's make-up took eight hours to be done and included a hand-collage of tiny crystal gems on her face. Post-production team The Mill was then hired to emphasise the <b>glints</b> that beam from them.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} the chaotic {{verification}} for angular <b>glint</b> of complex radar target. Angular <b>glint</b> {{is a key}} factor in the generation loss probability in radar detections, and the intrinsic physical characteristic and suppression techniques of <b>glint</b> have been a hot topic in radar signal analysis. In this paper, the radar angular <b>glint</b> samples of a typical complex target are calculated by the Greco method based on Phase Gradient method. The simulated <b>glint</b> series fit the prerequisites of chaos for deterministic, nonlinear generation and no regularities in time domain, therefore the analysis the chaotic traits is required. We propose the design of chaotic verification flow, which is proved to be efficient and effective by the experiment of Lorenz Attractor signal model, and the details have been explained. The algorithm flow begins with the determination of optimum time lag and minimum embedding dimension, and is followed by the timedelay reconstruction in phase space. The results are presented with three qualitative verification results of attractor geometry, Poincare section and principal component analysis and two quantitative results of correlation dimension and largest Lyapunov exponent for the <b>glint</b> series. With comparison with results obtained by Lorenz attractor, the chaotic traits of angular <b>glint</b> data are verified. Therefore, the paper has proposed new possible reduction and prediction ideas to refrain angular <b>glint</b> in the digital processing unit of radar receiver in the future...|$|R

50|$|The {{principle}} of operation is purely one of geometric optics: A point light source produces a <b>glint</b> on a curved specular (shiny) surface; this <b>glint</b> appears {{to travel on}} the surface as the eye or light source moves.

The <b>glints</b> had to be recovered and elevated to their proper place in the cosmos.

While at some occasions the movement did appear to step at that direction – for example, in its early days prayer and preparation for it consumed so much time that adherents were blamed of neglecting sufficient Torah study – Hasidic masters proved highly conservative.

40|$|Abstract. In the High Average Power Laser (HAPL) program, we are {{developing}} an integrated target tracking and engagement {{system designed to}} track in three dimensions an IFE target traveling 50 - 100 m/s and to steer simulated driver beams so as to engage it at chamber center with ± 20 mm accuracy. The system consists of separate axial and transverse target detection techniques, and a short-pulse “glint ” laser to provide final steering instructions for beamlet alignment and target engagement by using the target itself as the final reference point. The <b>glint</b> laser overfills the target with a pulsed illumination beam 1 - 2 ms before chamber center, thus reflecting a “glint ” off the target in all directions. The <b>glint</b> return propagates back through the driver beamline and is collinear to the outgoing driver beam except for an offset determined by a wedged dichroic mirror. The wedged mirror accounts for the predefined transit distance of the target between the <b>glint</b> location and the driver beam arrival. This technique allows both the <b>glint</b> return and the driver beam to share a common path. Thus, the <b>glint</b> return represents the target’s final position, but at a small discrete offset from chamber center, and therefore {{can be used to}} steer the driver beams to intercept the target at chamber center. We are currently prototyping this tracking and engagement system on the tabletop at reduced speeds and dimensions to verify feasibility. All subsystems have been characterized and currently we are integrating the <b>glint</b> system into the tabletop demo and using the <b>glint</b> return signal to provide the final steering instructions for the mirror. The <b>glint</b> system’s integration into the tracking and engagement demo and current engagement results are reported. 1...|$|R
