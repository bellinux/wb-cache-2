5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E

5|$|Energy {{efficient}} and sustainability features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more efficient HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy {{efficient and}} <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E
5|$|Many frogs {{are able}} to absorb water and oxygen {{directly}} through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate. The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase {{the area of the}} skin available for respiration.|$|E

25|$|The {{dry suit}} {{may also have}} an {{integrated}} hood, which seals water out around the wearer's face, and <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> wearer's head warm. The integrated hood is often latex rubber that fits tightly around the head, but can also be made from neoprene or membrane to allow an insulating cap to be worn under the hood. Care {{must be taken to}} avoid the hood making a waterproof seal around either of the ears, as this could cause an eardrum bursting outwards at depth.|$|E

25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> food from sticking to itself and the container. If the cooked pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E

25|$|The Sirius {{signal is}} {{separated}} into three carriers, one each {{for the two}} satellites, and the third for the terrestrial repeater network where available. Sirius receivers decode all three 4MHz carrier signals at once to achieve signal diversity. This {{is in contrast to}} XM which uses six carriers and decodes three 2MHz carriers to economize on receiver power consumption and complexity at the cost of channel-changing speed. There is an intentional four-second delay between the two satellite carrier signals. This enables the receiver to maintain a large buffer of the audio stream, which, along with forward error correction, <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> audio playing in the event that the signal is temporarily lost, such as when driving under an overpass or otherwise losing line-of-sight of any of the satellites or ground repeater stations.|$|E
25|$|Forms of {{locomotion}} on land include walking, running, hopping or jumping, dragging and crawling or slithering. Here {{friction and}} buoyancy {{are no longer}} an issue, but a strong skeletal and muscular framework are required in most terrestrial animals for structural support. Each step also requires much energy to overcome inertia, and animals can store elastic potential energy in their tendons to help overcome this. Balance is also required for movement on land. Human infants learn to crawl first before {{they are able to}} stand on two feet, which requires good coordination as well as physical development. Humans are bipedal animals, standing on two feet and keeping one on the ground at all times while walking. When running, only one foot is on the ground at any one time at most, and both leave the ground briefly. At higher speeds momentum <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> body upright, so more energy can be used in movement.|$|E
25|$|From the cordon, plant shoots {{emerge from}} the bud that {{eventually}} develops mature bark and becomes the fruiting cane from which grape clusters will emerge. These canes can be positioned and trained to whatever angle is desired by the grower. Typically, they are positioned upwards {{but they can be}} bent into an arch such as a Pendelbogen or Mosel arch system, or trained to point downwards such as the Scott Henry and Sylvos system. The latter method requires more labor-intensive trellising and training for Vitis vinifera vines which are naturally more inclined to grow upwards rather than down. In systems such as the Scott Henry, this downward growth is achieved by the use of movable wires that first allow the canes to grow upwards until about 2 to 3 weeks before harvest when they are then shifted downwards where the weight of gravity on the hanging grape clusters <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> canes pointing down.|$|E

500|$|In {{the musical}} 1776, which {{tells the story}} of the {{drafting}} and signing of the Declaration of Independence, Stephen Hopkins is a main character, played by veteran character actor Roy Poole. [...] He is depicted as a well-meaning, but cantankerous, maverick politician who readily partakes of alcoholic refreshment, owns a loyal hound-dog (which is intolerantly allowed to wait for Hopkins inside Independence Hall), and whose force of personality <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Continental Congress together. [...] When asked for his vote on opening debate on Virginia's resolution on independence, the representative from Rhode Island to the Continental Congress declares: [...] "I've never seen, heard, nor smelled an issue that was so dangerous it couldn't be talked about. Hell yes, I'm for debating anything!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} from Zap2it, Rick Porter gave the pilot praise for {{bringing}} together the central theme, saying [...] "No other new show this fall {{is attempting to}} tell a bigger story, and we're hoping the rough patches smooth out and it fulfills the potential that's there in its very strong cast and premise." [...] It also cited Jennifer Morrison and Jared Gilmore's performances when they appear in scenes together: [...] "As such it falls to Morrison to move the story along in this world, and fortunately for the audience she's able to pull it off. She gives a confident, grounded performance that <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> show from feeling too fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is a big plus too." [...] He also notes the writers and producers have put together a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: [...] "Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that Once Upon a Time will find its way. But if it doesn't, at least it will go down swinging." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Sahara, {{breeding}} {{takes place}} in the hottest part of the summer on a stony desert plain. When choosing a nest site, the female scrapes several trial hollows before selecting one of them. The main criterion for selection seems to be the porous nature of the underlying rock. Spongy rock heats up less in the sun and provides a cool spot to nest. Also desirable are one or two [...] "cover stones" [...] close by, chosen because their dense structure attracts dew at night, moisture which drains into the soil and gets absorbed by the porous rock which <b>helps</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> nest cool by day. The nest is made in a shallow depression in the ground without any bedding material and two, occasionally three, eggs are laid. The eggs are elongated ovals in shape, buff with grey and brown blotches and speckles. Their colour and shape makes them difficult to distinguish from the pebbles lying around them. Both parents incubate the eggs and their cryptic colouration makes them almost invisible when sitting on the nest. The eggs hatch after about 20 days.|$|E
