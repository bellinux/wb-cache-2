50|$|These factors {{cause an}} {{attenuated}} receiver signal {{and lead to}} higher bit error ratio (BER). To overcome these issues, vendors found some solutions, like multi-beam or multi-path architectures, which use more than one sender {{and more than one}} receiver. Some state-of-the-art devices also have larger <b>fade</b> <b>margin</b> (extra power, reserved for rain, smog, fog). To keep an eye-safe environment, good FSO systems have a limited laser power density and support laser classes 1 or 1M. Atmospheric and fog attenuation, which are exponential in nature, limit practical range of FSO devices to several kilometres.However the Free space optics, based on 1550 nm wavelength, have considerably lower optical loss than Free space optics, using 830 nm wavelength, in dense fog conditions. FSO using wavelength 1550 nm system are capable of transmitting several times higher power than systems with 850 nm and are at the same time safe to the human eye (1M class). Some of Free space optics, as for example EC SYSTEM, use in additional to that Automatic Gain Control in-built to regulate the transmit power of the laser diode depending on the link quality, which is constantly monitored and allowe increase power of laser transmitter to ensure higher reliability of connection in the bad weather conditions.|$|E

The shadowing margin depends upon environment and is calculated from the standard variation of the path loss model and the coverage requirement [19]. In this paper a coverage requirement of 90 % at the edge of the cell is considered. Furthermore, a <b>fade</b> <b>margin</b> of 10 [*]dB is proposed. The <b>fade</b> <b>margin</b> takes the yearly availability of the system into account. The link availability will be affected by clear-air and rain multipath fading. Using the ITU-R P. 530 model [20] described in [21], a <b>fade</b> <b>margin</b> of 10 [*]dB results in a yearly availability of 99.995 % for a cell radius of 10 [*]km.

40|$|A poster to {{show the}} {{applicability}} of fractal rain field models to radio communications system design. Communications systems operating at frequencies above 10 GHz suffer from severe attenuation due to rain, clouds and atmospheric gases, though rain is the dominant factor {{responsible for most of}} the time-variant fading experienced. Systems currently in operation deal with this problem by allocating a fixed <b>fade</b> <b>margin.</b> However, for higher frequencies this is economically unfeasible as the <b>fade</b> <b>margin</b> required to provide a set quality of service becomes too high. For this reason, much attention is being paid to methods of dealing with fades on an adaptive and reactive basis. Such methods are collectively known as Fade Mitigation Techniques (FMTs).

40|$|The signal {{propagation}} at {{the frequencies}} above 10 GHz suffers from significant attenuation due to rain, which {{in case of}} point-to-multipoint systems {{is unlikely to be}} compensated for by available <b>fade</b> <b>margin</b> alone. For this reason and especially thanks to the non-uniform spatial distribution of the rain rate, it is suitable to utilize site diversity concept during planning of point-to-multipoint wireless systems. A database of radar data for numerous types of rain events has been established to enable system testing under different conditions. Outage improvement was studied using space-time simulations of point-to-multipoint systems in a specific area under a specific rain conditions. System outage improvement probability was derived as a straightforward function of the rain <b>fade</b> <b>margin,</b> angle separation and distances of main and diversity hubs.

The main advantage {{of such a}} scheme is that it enables fast receiver synchronization without channel adaptation, while providing robustness to multipath fading and in-band interference. This is important for low-power wireless systems with bursty traffic, such as sensor networks. In this paper a semi-analytical framework for evaluating its bit error rate performance in wideband frequency-selective fading channels is introduced. Some numerical results are presented, based on channel models developed in the IEEE 802. 15. 4 a channel modeling subgroup.

It is based on a model for convective raincells and the lognormal assumption for point rainfall rate statistics. Numerical results are compared with an available set of experimental data taken from a VSAT Earth-station located in Japan. The agreement was found to be quite encouraging.

40|$|For the CCIR 14 -rain climatic {{zones of}} the globe, {{we present a}} {{simplified}} hop length versus <b>fade</b> <b>margin</b> analysis with link reliability as a parameter. The analysis uses Laws-Parsons values for the a and b parameters of A(dB/Km) =a Rb (mm/hr), and considers the two cases of (i) limited rain-cell and (ii) "entire hop in rain". The result is a family of <b>fade</b> <b>margin</b> vs. hop length curves for various reliability objectives, obtained {{for each of the}} 14 -rain zones at a frequency of 50 GHz. A simple frequency scaling rule is also devised to enable similar analysis at frequencies in the range 30 - 70 GHz. It is particularly concluded that an extended hop length of 10 - 20 Km is possible with reasonable reliability if the reduced cell-size concept is applied. If the entire hop is in rain, a limited hop length of one to five kms can't be exceeded even with modest reliability. It is also demonstrated that high resolution global rain map, together with an accurate cell size definition are mandatory for reliable radio link design at mm-wave lengths. © 1987 Plenum Publishing Corporation...|$|E
