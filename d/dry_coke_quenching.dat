On the basis of real data and simulation calculations of the production process of hydrogen from coke gas, emission indicators of carbon dioxide (CF) were calculated.

According to {{the process}} feature of the <b>coke</b> <b>dry</b> <b>quenching</b> (CDQ), the factors of the {{destructive}} mechanism that influence the sequence function properties of the brick were analyzed. The countermeasures have been adopted for the defects of the bricks for CDQ, such as inferior thermal shock stability and short lifetime, etc. In order to search the effect of thermal expansion stress and mechanical load stress on the CDQ, the temperature field and stress field of the flue in the CDQ were analyzed according to the thermal elastic and plastic theory. The Drucker-Prager plasticity model combined with a tension cut-off criterion was described material behavior. All material properties were taken as temperature dependent. The result indicates that the support bracket under high gradient temperature will bring on the highest thermal stress, which {{is the main reason}} of fracture of the support bracket. The cycling temperature has the ability to cause repeated crack propagation throughout the whole service period. To solve this problem, the design of the structure, the method of the heat exchange and the properties of the materials will be improved.

40|$|We try to {{understand}} the role of technological change and diffusion of energy efficient technologies in order to explain the trend of energy intensity developments in the German steel industry. We selected six key energy efficient technologies and collected data to derive their diffusion since their introduction in Germany. Since all technologies have been applied in Germany for more than 30 years we would expect complete diffusion. We found complete diffusion only for basic oxygen furnaces and continuous casting. Newer technologies (i. e. basic oxygen furnace gas recovery, top pressure recovery turbine, <b>coke</b> <b>dry</b> <b>quenching</b> and pulverized coal injection) diffused quicker in the initial phase but then diffusion slowed down. Key improvements in energy efficiency are due to electric arc furnaces (24 %), basic oxygen furnaces (12 %), and continuous casting (6 %) between 1958 and 2012. The contribution of top pressure recovery turbines, pulverized coal injection and basic oxygen furnaces gas recovery accounts in total of about 3 %. If the selected technologies were diffused completely, the future energy consumption could be reduced by 4. 5 % compared to 2012. Our findings suggest that our selection of six technologies is the key driver for energy intensity developments within the German steel industry between 1958 and 2012. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Technology is important to support symbiosis, but few studies in China have focused on this topic at the industrial park level. This research presented {{a case study in}} a national iron and steel industrial park in China. Focus was given onto carbon mitigation through industrial symbiosis technology using substance flow analysis (SFA). Three typical iron and steel industry technologies, including <b>coke</b> <b>dry</b> <b>quenching</b> (CDQ), combined cycle power plant (CCPP), and CO 2 capture by slag carbonization (CCSC) were evaluated with SFA. Technology assessment was further conducted in terms of carbon mitigation potential and unit reduction cost. Compared with the Business as usual (BAU) scenario, application with CDQ, CCPP, and CCSC reduced the net carbon emissions by 56. 18, 134. 43, and 222. 89 kg CO 2 per ton crude steel inside the industrial parks, respectively, including both direct and indirect emissions. Economic assessment revealed that the unit costs for the three technologies were also high, thereby necessitating national financial support.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the management of wood waste generated after demolition of a typical 33 year old <b>coke</b> <b>quenching</b> tower from an integrated steelworks. Wood in the <b>coke</b> <b>quenching</b> tower was treated with traditional waterborne preservative, Copper-Chromium-Arsenic (CCA). Due to the growing environmental concern, changes were introduced in the legislation governing the disposal of waste. Hence, the aim of the thesis was to perform a waste management study by investigating CCA treated wood waste and to develop a waste disposal technique. During the characterisation of the wood waste, elemental analysis was performed to confirm CCA concentration remaining in the treated wood waste. Concentration of CCA elements ranged from 300 mg/kg to 10, 000 mg/kg. The concentration reduced with increase in the years of service life of the treated wood. Leaching tests according to British Standards were performed for different durations from 1 hour to 1 month to determine the leaching behaviour exhibited by the wood. Standard and customised sampling procedures were carried out for leaching tests to study and simulate the loss of CCA from the treated wood during a quenching process. These tests provided a leaching pattern that the loss of CCA follows a trend of As > Cu > Cr which was in agreement with the final concentrations of the quenching tower wood, such that chromium was most resistant to leaching and arsenic was most susceptible to leach. Correlations and linear equations were established between the arsenic-chromium and arsenic-copper leach concentrations. Equations were developed to help in predicting the ratio of leach ability of the CCA elements with respect to each other. It was also found that the wood from the tower contained a substantial amount of iron which was further investigated. The growth ring analysis showed that iron was mainly deposited on the wood surface. The prime sources of iron were identified to be kish, an air borne particulate matter found in steelworks environment as well as coke and coke ash. Leaching studies performed to determine the leachability of iron showed that there was a potential for iron to restrict the mobility of CCA elements in soil. A novel three-step chemical extraction method was developed after analysing the sequential analysis performed with different chemical reagents and leaching behaviour of the CCA wood waste. Step one used sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to break down the wood structure by lignin depolymerisation. The use of NaOH provided alkaline conditions and facilitated the process of lignin depolymerisation mainly to release arsenic as water soluble compounds. This was followed by ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) for release of copper, due to the high affinity of ammonium group to form complexes with copper. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was used as a strong oxidising agent and primarily to release the chromium by forming chromium complexes which are readily soluble in water. The effect of the pH, temperature, concentration and order of the reagent to be used were studied. Therefore, CCA wood was subjected to the three-step process, where the order was designed as NaOH followed by NH 4 Cl and then H 2 O 2 for 1 hour at 100 oC with 1 M, 2 M and 2 M concentration respectively. 98...|$|R
