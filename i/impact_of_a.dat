5|$|Even {{during the}} Cold War, the {{psychological}} <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> battleship was significant.

In September 1983, when Druze militia in Lebanon's Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS New Jersey stopped the firing. Gunfire from New Jersey later killed militia leaders.|$|E

Similarly, an iridium anomaly in core samples from the Pacific Ocean suggested the Eltanin impact of about 2.5 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{grew up on}} {{the family}} farm in North Carolina. He was educated at home and {{received}} little, if any, formal education. Exposed to slaves throughout his childhood, he sympathized with their condition. According to his own account, Coffin became an abolitionist at the age of seven when he asked a slave who was in a chain gang why he was bound. The man replied that it was to prevent him from escaping and returning to his wife and children. The event disturbed Coffin, who considered the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> father being taken away from his family.|$|E
5|$|In extreme western Cuba, {{damage was}} very severe from the strong winds, likened to the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tornado. Severe damage was {{reported}} in Los Arroyos and Arroyos de Mantua. In the latter location, around a dozen people were killed, 50 were injured, and nearly every building in the town was severely damaged; heavy losses also occurred to the tobacco crop. Across western Pinar del Río Province, the hurricane destroyed all communication links. Further from the center, {{the capital city of}} Havana recorded southerly winds of 72mph (116km/h), as well as a minimum pressure of about 999mbar (29.50inHg). Around the country, the hurricane capsized several ships, primarily fishing vessels. The death toll in the country was estimated at around 90. In the days after the storm, Cuban President Zayas authorized about $30,000 in relief aid to send to hurricane victims in Pinar del Río.|$|E

5|$|John Bevan {{had asked}} Newman Smith {{to retain the}} threat of a US {{invasion}} force beyond 28 June when the initial deception was supposed to have ended. Agent Rudloff sent messages on 10, 12 and 18 July referring to the Ironside force. In mid-July, the Allies began Operation Ferdinand, a cover deception for Operation Dragoon, the August 1944 invasion of southern France. The Ironside story was considered as an option in support of Ferdinand, but Noel Wild and Ops (B), the SHAEF deception planners were worried about the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> theoretical US invasion force on the continuing Fortitude deception. It was decided that a new story would be presented to the Germans, suggesting that the Allies intended to bolster French resistance in the south of the country. The operation went largely unnoticed and German interest in the Bordeaux region dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Lillehammer Municipal Council, Oppland County Council and the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage {{rejected}} the location {{because of the}} environmental impact. These institutions instead proposed that the track be built at Huseskogen at Hunderfossen. The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee initially disapproved of the location and in 1990 started looking {{at the possibility of}} constructing the track at Holmenkollen in Oslo. Two routes were considered, one in the same route as Korketrekkeren and one which would run from Gratishaugen at Holmenkollbakken to Midtstuen. Internationally there was support from the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation and the International Luge Federation to build Norway's track in the capital. Concerns about the environmental <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hunderfossen location were raised, particularly regarding visual pollution. However, Hunderfossen was confirmed along with a grant issued by the Parliament of Norway on 24 August 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} envisaged that a {{war with}} Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware of the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blockade on an island nation {{at the heart of}} a maritime empire, they felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E
