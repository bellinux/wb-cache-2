On 20 July, <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> captured the border town of Atme from Ahrar al-Sham. Following the capture of Atme, <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> attempted to capture the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing in its campaign to cut off Ahrar al-Sham from Turkey. On 21 July, a convoy of forces from the Sham Legion and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, which left <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> the previous day, headed to Darat Izza near frontlines between Ahrar <b>al-Sham</b> and <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham.</b> However, before reaching the frontlines, the convoy was intercepted by <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham,</b> and was forced to withdraw. On the same day, a cease-fire agreement was reached between Ahrar <b>al-Sham</b> and <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham,</b> which involved the withdrawal of Ahrar al-Sham from the Bab al-Hawa border crossing and it's control handed over to a civil council. Soon after, <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> forces entered the towns of Maarrat Misrin and Ram Hamdan after Ahrar al-Sham withdrew without fighting.|$|R
50|$|On 7 March, three <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> fighters {{died when}} their vehicle hit an IED {{in the eastern}} Hama province; one of the fighters was {{reportedly}} as young as 14 years old. Later that day, <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> and Ahrar al-Sham signed a ceasefire deal to end the fighting between them, {{and to create a}} new council to resolve their issues diplomatically instead of fighting. However, two days later, clashes broke out between Ahrar <b>al-Sham</b> and <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> again in the Jabal Zawiya region, after <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> attempted to arrest a senior Ahrar al-Sham leader in the area.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 February 2017, a US airstrike killed al-Qaeda {{commander}} Abu Hani al-Masri, {{who was a}} part of Ahrar al-Sham at {{the time}} of his death. It was reported that he was about to defect to <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> before his death. On the same day, <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> official Muslah al-Alyani criticized other groups for not joining <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham,</b> arguing that any group that [...] "fought for Islam" [...] would be bombed, regardless of terrorist designations. In his statement, he indicated that one of the reasons why most Ahrar al-Sham fighters refused to join <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> was because the latter group contained terrorist-designated individuals.|$|R
25|$|Between 14 and 23 July 2017, clashes {{broke out}} between <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> and Ahrar al-Sham in the Idlib area, {{resulting}} in <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> taking {{full control of}} Idlib city and several towns in the governorate.|$|R
50|$|On 12 February, the Bunyan al-Marsous Operations Room, {{of which}} <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> {{is a member}} of, {{launched}} an offensive against the Syrian Army in Daraa's Manshiyah district. <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> forces began the attack with 2 suicide bombers and car bombs.|$|R
50|$|On 2 February, <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham's</b> former JFS forces {{attempted}} {{to occupy a}} bakery in Atarib, the largest bakery in western Aleppo, but withdrew after protests by residents. Several days later, the Uzbek Jihadist group Katibat al-Tawhid wal-Jihad pledged its allegiance to <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Idlib Governorate clashes (July 2017) are {{a series}} of ongoing {{military}} confrontations between Ahrar <b>al-Sham</b> and Hay'at <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> (HTS). During the clashes, <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> attempted to capture the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing, causing concern for Turkey who prefers Ahrar al-Sham in control of the crossing.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the merger, <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> {{has been}} accused to be working as al-Qaeda's Syrian branch on a covert level. However, <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> has officially denied being part of al-Qaeda {{and said in a}} {{statement}} that the group is [...] "fully independent and doesn't represent any foreign body or organization". Furthermore, some factions such as Nour al-Din al-Zenki, which was part of the merger, were once supported by the US. Some analysts reported that the goal of forming <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> was to unite all groups with al-Qaeda's extreme ideology under one banner, and to obtain as many weapons as possible. They also reported that many of the former Jabhat Fateh al-Sham fighters still answered to al-Qaeda, and held an increasing amount of sway over the new group. It has also been claimed that despite the recent formation of <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham,</b> the new group secretly maintains a fundamental link to al-Qaeda, and that many of the group's senior figures, particularly Abu Jaber, held similarly extreme views. Russia claims that <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> shares al-Nusra Front's goal of turning Syria into an Islamic emirate run by al-Qaeda.|$|R

The individuals in italic are defectors from Ahrar al-Sham, which either left to join Jabhat Fateh al-Sham in the last few days of its existence, or joined it's successor group <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham.</b>|$|R

50|$|On 2 March, {{according}} to pro-government sources, the Sham Legion split into three armed groups, while fighting erupted in town of Saraqib, after a brigade in Ahrar <b>al-Sham</b> defected to <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham.</b> The former Ahrar al-Sham brigade had reportedly {{been responsible for}} manufacturing and maintaining Ahrar al-Sham's weapons.

5000|$|Soon {{after the}} group's formation, many local Syrians began {{referring}} to the group as Hetesh, which was an Arabic acronym meant as a pejorative, similar the [...] "Daesh" [...] label applied to ISIL by much of the Arab World.

50|$|From 6 to 8 June, clashes {{broke out}} between <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> and Sham Legion in Maarrat al-Nu'man. The 13th Division and the Free Police joined the {{fighting}} on 8 June.

50|$|Analysts {{have also}} {{reported}} that the group continues to maintain many of al-Nusra Front's al-Qaeda ideologies. It was {{also reported that}} {{a large portion of}} <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham's</b> fighters from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham still refused to disengage from al-Qaeda, and continued to hold a large sway over the group, despite the public re-branding of the group. <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham</b> continues to harbor the former al-Nusra Front's goal of turning Syria into an Islamic Emirate, run by al-Qaeda. If such a governing entity were declared, it would be similar to ISIL's declaration of a Caliphate. The Combating Terrorism Center also reported that despite public statements by some of <b>Tahrir</b> <b>al-Sham's</b> top figures, the group was still largely the same al-Qaeda-aligned group it was, back when it was known as al-Nusra.|$|R
