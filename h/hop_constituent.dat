40|$|Ikigage is a Rwandese {{traditional}} beer {{made from}} sorghum malt and local plants, mainly Vernonia amygdalina “umubirizi”. However, this beer remains less attractive than Western beers of pils type {{because of poor}} hygienic quality, variations of organoleptic quality and limited shelf life. The aim of this work is to characterize ikigage beer {{in order to improve}} its hygienic quality and to reduce the organoleptic variations using the local raw materials. The first part of our study shows that ikigage beer marketed in Rwanda is characterized by the presence of Stapylococcus aureus and many micro-organisms of fecal origin (Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci), by the low ethanol content, high total acidity and an important amounts of proteins. The yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Issatckenkia orientalis), followed by the lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus buchneri), are the predominant microorganisms involved in fermentation of ikigage beer fermentation. Besides, one of the major problems in sorghum beer brewing is the efficient conversion of the starch extracts into fermentable sugars due to the weak activity of β-amylase in sorghum malt. The use of Eleusine coracana “uburo” (Musama variety) malt (30 %), associated with mashing decantation procedure, increases the content of sugar fermentable, maltose particularly, in sorghum wort, and consequently ethanol content in the beer. The second part of our study shows that V. amygdalina, known for its antibacterial properties and its bitterness similar to hops, contributes to the production of methyl salycilate, beta-damascenone and many terpenes compounds (δ- 3 -carene, β-farnesene, farnesol, β-citronellol and linalool), in the sorghum beer “ikigage”. This work reveals also the presence of 14 polyfunctional thiols in beers brewed with ‘non-Western’ raw materials. Among them, the well-known <b>hop</b> <b>constituent</b> 3 -methyl- 2 -buten- 1 -thiol emerged as a key flavour in the unhopped beers containing V. amygdalina. V. amygdalina also contributes to the production of 1 -butanethiol and 4 -sulfanyl- 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone in sorghum beer. However, contrary to hops, V. amygdalina addition during boiling also appears to strongly inhibit the production of 2 -sulfanylethyl acetate. The third part of our study shows that the use of S. cerevisiae in combination with I. orientalis and L. fermentum as starter allows producing ikigage beer having the GRAS (generally recognized as safe) statute while preserving the organoleptic characteristics similar to those of local traditional beer “ikigage” produced by peasants...|$|E
40|$|Sulphanylalkyl {{alcohols}} {{and their}} corresponding acetates were investigated in 14 commercial Belgian beers. Although {{it was the}} major peak at the pulsed-flame photometric detector, the empyreumatic 2 -sulphanylethyl acetate was found at concentrations below its individual odour threshold, estimated at 40 mg/L (0 – 4 mg/L in most fresh beers, 5 – 12 mg/L in three fresh high-bitter beers). Both the Ehrlich pathway and <b>hop</b> <b>constituents</b> contribute to this content. In 11 of the investigated samples, synthesis of 2 SE-A and 3 -sulphanylpropyl acetate (roasted, burned) continued {{during the first three}} months of storage. Although below their individual thresholds, these compounds might interact by synergy with other aged flavours. As yeast was absent from most of the investigated bottles, chemical degradation of precursors is suspected...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{developing}} a new analytical method for the metabolite fingerprinting of bioactive compounds in Humulus lupulus L. (hop), together with a simple extraction procedure. Different extraction techniques, including maceration, heat reflux extraction (HRE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), were compared {{in order to obtain}} a high yield of the target analytes. Dynamic maceration for 30 min with MeOH-HCOOH (99 : 1, v/v) as the extraction solvent provided the best result in terms of recovery of secondary metabolites. The analysis of <b>hop</b> <b>constituents,</b> including prenylflavonoids and prenylphloroglucinols (bitter acids), was carried out by means of HPLC-UV/DAD, HPLC-ESI-MS and MS(2), using an ion trap mass analyzer. An Ascentis Express C 18 column (150 mm× 3. 0 mm I. D., 2. 7 μm) was used for the HPLC analysis, with a mobile phase composed of 0. 25 % formic acid in both water and acetonitrile, under gradient elution. The method validation was performed to show compliance with ICH guidelines. The validated technique was successfully applied to the phytochemical analysis of ten commercial cultivars and twenty-three wild Italian hop genotypes, thus demonstrating to be a reliable and useful tool for the comprehensive multi-component analysis of hop secondary metabolites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Iron has an {{important}} role on the prevention of anemia, which is {{an important}} public health problem. Results from studies, conducted in humans and animals, have shown that iron ions (Fe 2 + and Fe 3 +) have cariostatic properties. Alone or {{in combination with other}} ions, like fluoride and copper, iron has a great effect on the reduction of the cariogenic potential of the sugar. The iron content of beer should be as low as possible. Under normal conditions, the iron content of fermented beer is below 0. 2 ppm. If it is higher in the finished beer, a pickup of iron after fermentation is indicated. Iron is said to enter more readily in solution in a beer highly saturated with CO 2 gas. Highly oxidized beers also dissolve more iron. High amount of iron can contribute to color increase due to an interaction with wort and/or beer tannins and <b>hop</b> <b>constituents.</b> The aim of this work was the implementation and optimizations of some UV-VIS molecular absorption spectrometric methods for determination of total iron from commercial beer samples; the results were compared with those obtained by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) using a spectrometer Shimadzu AA 6200. Also, in this study, was compared the efficiency of different digestion procedures (dry ash procedure and digestion procedure with nitric acid) on beer samples. Prior to analysis, the beer samples were degassed. The most appropriate method for the determination of iron in beer was found FAAS and the concentrations obtained were in the range of 0. 33 - 1. 59 mg/L. For determination of the relative accuracy of the applied methods for iron analysis the “t ” test was performed...|$|R
30|$|From the derived exact {{expressions}} for {{the various}} primary statistics and the corresponding simulation results, {{it is evident that}} the end-to-end channel distribution for different number of hops may deviate significantly in modality, skewness, Kurtosis, etc., due to cascading. The derived performance metrics depend on the number of <b>hops</b> and the <b>constituent</b> distributions. These exact expressions, and the unified approach {{that can be used for}} other cases as well, are expected to be of great use in the realistic system design and performance evaluation of the multi-hop, diversity attaining transparent cooperative systems.|$|R
40|$|The ‘early kettle’ {{hop aroma}} of beer is quite complex, since losses, {{chemical}} oxidations {{as well as}} biotransformations of <b>hop</b> oil <b>constituents</b> occur during the brewing process, resulting in ‘hoppy’ aroma in the final beer that is clearly different from the aroma of raw hops. In this respect, oxygenated terpenoids have been suggested {{to play a major}} role, although their behaviour/formation during the brewing process has not yet been fully understood. By performing lab scale experiments, we have proven that sesquiterpene hydrocarbons can be oxidized during boiling into a whole series of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, some of them being highly flavour-active. In order to verify to what extent these findings are applicable to real brewing practice, we brewed a kettle hopped beer and monitored the hop oil compounds from kettle boil up to the cask. Interestingly, after both early and late kettle hopping we observed an increase in the level of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids {{as a function of the}} boiling time. A huge amount of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was lost during the whirlpool stage whereas the fermentation process led to losses of all hop oil compounds, although the oxygenated sesquiterpenoids were better retained in the green beer. In conclusion, ‘early’ kettle hopping does not lead to spillage of all hop oil compounds, as believed by many brewers, but instead provides significant levels of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, that may be key impact compounds for ‘kettle’ hoppy aroma of beer. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to determination of hop utilisation {{in terms of}} beer bitterness, analytical measurement of the yield of hop aromatisation is not straightforward {{on account of the}} enormous chemical complexity of hop essential oil and hoppy aroma derived thereof. In this paper, selective determination of <b>hop</b> oil-derived <b>constituents</b> in the flavour profile of pilsner beer is achieved through headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Highly enriched floral and spicy hop essences were prepared by density programmed supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), followed by solid phase extraction (SPE), and subsequently added in well-defined amounts to an experimental pilsner, exclusively bittered with purified iso-α-acids extract. In view of reliable measurement of the yield of aromatisation of the pilsner with the respective hop oil fractions, characteristic marker components for the floral and spicy SFE/ SPE hop essences, respectively, were selected. Reliable determination of the selected markers for floral and spicy SFE/SPE hop essences in the aromatised beers turned out to be possible on condition that HS-SPME is combined with GC-MS comprising selected fragment ion monitoring (SIM). Using this approach, application of hop oil preparations can be monitored analytically, allowing improved control and specification of hop aromatisation according to the desired beer flavour. The average yield of beer aromatisation using floral and spicy hop essences was determined at about 95 %. On the basis of their sesquiterpenoid GC-MS/SIM pattern, fresh commercial lager beers could be differentiated, which may be useful for brand fingerprinting and identification. Upon forced ageing of the beers, levels of hop oil-derived sesquiterpenoids, in particular of caryophyllene and humulene epoxides, decrease significantly. In addition, trans-nerolidol is identified as a potential marker for measuring flavour (in) stability of pilsner beer. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Being one of {{the most}} {{consumed}} beverages in the world, much effort has been made to reveal the structures responsible for the sensorial characteristics of beer. Yet, the knowledge on the precise contribution of hop-derived volatiles towards the hoppy aroma of beer is rather fragmented. For a long time, the aroma of fresh beer was believed to be mainly imparted by single compounds. However, increasing evidence showed that sensorial perception of the hoppy aroma of beer is more complex than originally assumed. Moreover, the factors responsible for the perceivable differences originating from distinct hop varieties used for late and dry hopping have not been fully revealed. In order to understand how the choice of the hop variety affects the final aroma of beer, we investigated in a previous study with four different hop varieties how the analytical composition of the volatile fraction changes throughout the brewing process and how that affects the composition of late and dry hopped beers. However, the analysis of four different hop varieties arose more questions. Therefore, in this study, we studied 15 other hop varieties during different stages along the brewing process of single hopped beers and analyzed wort and beer samples via headspace solid-phase micro extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HSSPME GC-MS). Additionally, the profiles of the corresponding hop varieties were determined. This enabled the accurate determination of both the full spectrum of hop oil-derived compounds {{as well as of the}} higher esters and higher alcohols produced during fermentation. Our investigation reveals substantial changes in the volatile patterns of the wort and beer samples, in comparison with the selected hop variety, which arose from the boiling and fermentation processes, as well as the applied late and additional dry hopping techniques. Concentrations of the “floral” (e. g. oxygenated fraction of total hop essential oil composed of monoterpene alcohols, esters, ketones and aldehydes) and the sesquiterpenoid hop oil fractions changed significantly along the brewing process. As expected, concentrations of saturated esters and higher alcohols in beers were shown to be mainly influenced by the fermentation and not by the hop variety. Although the concentrations of practically all other compound classes (especially of linalool and geraniol as the most important monoterpene alcohols) were higher in the dry hopped beers, dry hopping does not affect the original intrinsic qualitative composition of <b>hop</b> oil <b>constituents.</b> Yet, substantial quantitative changes were observed. Furthermore, special attention was paid to the influence of additional dry hopping on the transfer behavior of selected hop derived-monoterpene alcohols. Transfer rates for linalool were comparable for all 15 hop varieties, whereas the transfer rates for geraniol differed significantly which indicates that the selected hop variety is of major importance. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Next to the brewing water, malt and yeast, hops (Humulus lupulus&n bsp;L.) {{constitute}} a basic {{raw material for}} beer production. Several typ es of secondary metabolites present in hops are at the origin of highly characteristic beer flavour attributes, i. e. beer bitterness and ho ppy aroma. Hop-derived beer bitterness is well defined from a chemi cal point of view and, in current brewing practice, beer bitterness can be adequately dosed and controlled because (advanced) hop products with known composition are available, and optimised analytical methods allow reliable quantification of beer bitterness. In sharp contrast with beer bitterness, the precise nature of hoppy aroma of beer is far from comple tely understood. Although it is generally recognised that mainly volatil e constituents present in, or derived from hop essential oil are involve d, hoppy aroma {{is still one of}} the most controversial aspects of beer fl avour. Indeed, flavour-active key compounds causing this highly desirabl e aspect of beer aroma remain to be identified. This gap can be ascribed to the extreme chemical complexity and varietal dependence of hop essen tial oil itself, and to modifications and losses of <b>hop</b> oil <b>constituents</b> that take place along the brewing process. Obviously, introduction of c onsistent and pleasant hoppy aroma continues to be a serious challenge i n view of obtaining a reproducible and sufficiently stable beer flavour. Whereas conventional hopping inherently leads to flavour inconsistency, currently available hop oil products can be adequately dosed at the pos t-fermentation stage in order to attain the desired hoppy aroma or hop-d erived aroma top note in a much more controlled way. In this manner, enh anced consistency of hoppy aroma in the final beer and development of ne w beers with distinct sensory flavour attributes are feasible objectives. However, the spectrum of hop oil products currently available is rathe r limited (in particular, the varietal aspect of hoppy aroma is not full y exploited), and these products often do not give the intended flavour attributes. From an economic point of view, the above mentioned issues a re highly relevant. Beer flavour consistency is of paramount importance for the modern brewing industry (also because of globalisation of the ma rket) and a too variable hoppy aroma will undoubtedly impair brand typic ality and consumer preference. Beer flavour (in) consistency in respec t of hoppy aroma, together with the unresolved issue of the true nature of hoppy aroma of beer, form the rationale of this PhD study. In general, it aimed at (1) preparation of novel hop aromas extracted directly fro m single hop varieties via supercritical fluid extraction, (2) developme nt and implementation of analytical methodologies for determination of t he volatile composition of the hop aromas and reliable measurement of th e yield of aromatisation of beer with the respective hop essences, (3) d etermination of odour impact compounds of hop oil preparations, and (4) investigation of the impact of the novel hop aromas on hoppy character o f pilot beers. First, an extensive literature study is presented (Par t I). An introduction to hops in beer preparation, as well as a comprehe nsive literature review on hop aroma as such and hoppy aroma of beer (th e main topic of this PhD), is provided. The experimental work c omprises 3 different parts (Part II, Part III, and Part IV, respectively), that are all further subdivided into two chapters. In Part II Pro duction of novel varietal hop aromas by supercritical fluid extraction o f hop pellets the unique properties of supercritical carbon dioxide ext raction were evaluated for preparation of different types of varietal ho p aromas from hop pellets. In chapter 1, extraction conditions were opti mised for preparation of single variety total hop essential oils that we re subsequently fractionated by solid phase extraction (SPE), yielding h op oil fractions highly enriched in water-soluble, oxygenated constituen ts (polar hop essences). Next, in chapter 2, a new methodology based on density programmed supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and subsequent S PE fractionation of SFE extracts was developed for preparing floral, cit rus, and spicy hop essences. Sensory properties of all novel hop aromas as such, as well as their impact on beer flavour by aromatising referenc e pilot lagers, exclusively bittered with pre-isomerised hop extract, we re clearly demonstrated and described in both chapters of this study. &nb sp;In Part III Comprehensive chemical-analytical and sensory charac terisation of varietal hop oil preparations, analytical methods based o n headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and GC-MS were optimis ed and implemented to investigate the volatile composition of varietal f loral and spicy hop essences and total hop essential oils (chapter 3). D etailed analytical characterisation of the typical volatile composition of the different types of (fractionated) hop oils, as well as discrimina tion between varietal hop aromas via principal component analysis, were clearly established. In chapter 4, the focus was on determining odour im pact compounds in floral and spicy hop essences (cv. Spalter Select). By application of advanced gas chromatography in combination with olfactom etric assessment, potent contributors to the odour of floral hop essence were identified and several odour-active regions of hitherto unidentifi ed sesquiterpenoid nature were detected in the aromagram of spicy hop es sence. In Part IV Methodology for determination of hop aromati sation of beer and evaluation of the novel hop oil preparations in brewi ng practice, selective determination of <b>hop</b> oil-derived <b>constituents</b> in the flavour profile of pilot lagers was carried out using HS-SPME in co mbination with gas chromatography and advanced mass spectrometry such as tandem MS and selected ion monitoring (chapter 5). This approach allows monitoring the application of hop oil preparations in beer production and, as a result of this, improved control and specification of hop aroma tisation. Next, in chapter 6, the use of the hop oil preparations was in vestigated in brewing practice. In a comparative study, the impact of th e different types of hop aromas on the hoppy character of pilot lagers, as well as on beer flavour stability, was evaluated through both analyti cal and sensory protocols and compared with hoppy character and flavour stability of conventionally hopped pilot lagers. It was found that the c ontent of analytical markers for hoppy aroma (e. g. linalool and oxy genated sesquiterpenoids) as well as the intensity and the qualitative d escription of hoppy aroma, were dependent on the applied hopping technol ogy and on the hop oil fraction used for beer aromatisation. Interesting ly, sensory evaluation of beer ageing demonstrated that hop aromatisatio n, whether performed in the advanced or the conventional way, significan tly masked beer staling. As a result of our work, an innovative hop aroma technology has bee n developed, allowing the preparation of single variety hop essential oi ls and several refined hop oil fractions with pleasant and distinct sens ory attributes. The impact of the novel hop aromas on hoppy character of pilot lagers was clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, specific analytical and sensory tools were optimised and implemented for detailed character isation of the volatile composition of the novel hop aromas, determinati on of key odour impact compounds in hop essences, and determination of t he yield of aromatisation with the hop oil preparations in brewing pract ice. nrpages: 280 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Several {{chemical}} and molecular changes result in beer off-flavors which become recognizable {{after a certain}} storage time thereby reducing the consumer’s acceptance. Elucidating factors and reactions which adversely affect or promote beer staling is therefore of major interest for the brewing industry. The objective of this work was to elucidate the role of reactive oxygen species {{for the formation of}} aroma-active aldehydes as well as to characterize and optimize the anti-staling effects of the hop dosage ultimately aiming to improve the resistance of beer against staling. A pathway for the hydroxyl and hydroxyethyl radical-mediated formation of aroma-active aldehydes by oxidative degradation of their parent amino acids was first investigated in model systems, and its relevance was subsequently examined during beer storage using response surface methodology. The Maillard reaction and consecutive Strecker degradation as initialized from non-oxidative xylose and glucose decomposition as well as the factor Fe 2 + concentration were found irrelevant for Strecker aldehyde formation during beer storage; yet, a linear relationship between Strecker aldehydes formed and total packaged oxygen as well as amino acid concentration could be identified. Oxygen-involvement in the de novo formation of phenylacetaldehyde and benzaldehyde from phenylalanine during beer storage was demonstrated using labeling experiments. Additional lab-scale experiments suggested a relevance of amino acid oxidative degradation during wort production. Albeit varying the concentration of Fe 2 +, a catalyst in radical generation, was found irrelevant for Strecker aldehyde formation within the scope of the beer storage experiments, its withdrawal from reactions by treatment of beers with excess EDTA was perceived to significantly diminish Strecker aldehyde levels. As related to the findings, diminishing oxygen uptake, lowering amino acid concentrations, and rendering iron harmless during beer production and storage can be anticipated to be key strategies to diminish staling. In an attempt to find approaches to counteract staling, antioxidative properties of hop acids and the hop dosage were scrutinized. Hop α-acids were found to complex prooxidative metal ions thereby counteracting free radical formation and promoting autoxidation of Fe 2 + to Fe 3 + thus stabilizing iron in its higher, less harmful, valence state. Accordingly, next to suppressing free radical formation and withdrawing iron from potential reaction partners, one of the main functionality of hop α-acids was found to lie in their capability to counteract recycling of Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + consequently improving oxidative beer stability. UV-VIS measurements suggested a covalent binding between Fe 3 + and hop α-acids and the formation of a complex at a ratio of 3 : 1 (α-acid:Fe 3 +). While α-, β-, and iso-α-acids were shown to complex Cu 2 +, Fe 2 + und Fe 3 + ions, no complexation of Ca 2 +, K+, Mg 2 +, Mn 2 +, and Zn 2 + ions was noticed. The hop acid’s selective complexation behavior can be regarded as very advantageous for beer quality as prooxidative transition metal ions are rendered harmless without adversely affecting the wort’s or beer’s ionic composition. Testing different <b>hop</b> <b>constituents</b> in wort-like model syst 0 ems during incubation at 100 °C demonstrated a high efficacy of hop α- and β-acids in suppressing the formation of 2 -furfural and 3 -methylbutanal, while iso-α-acids were shown to be less effective. Hop α-acids were investigated in greater detail, and α-acid-induced suppression of 3 -methylbutanal formation could be partly traced back to the hop α-acids’ capability to functionally complex Fe 2 +-ions and scavenge organic, carbon-centered radicals thereby suppressing free radical-mediated oxidative degradation of leucine. Constantly allocating fresh α- and β-acids can therefore be seen as a key strategy to counteract staling aldehyde formation during wort production. The knowledge could be successfully adapted to semi-technical beer production and an increased oxidative stability and resistance to staling of beers was achieved by optimization of the hopping technology as verified analytically and sensorial. The malt bill and wort matrix were noticed being crucial for the state of iron and efficacy of the hop dosage. The hopping technology should therefore be adapted to the wort matrix and initial malt bill when aiming to achieve the best optimal utilization. Modestly lower bitter substance yields were found when dosing α-acids later which may be balanced by higher hop dosages. In sum, knowledge about yet unexplored beer staling mechanisms and the anti-staling efficacy of hops, particularly hop acids, could be expanded. Outcomes from this work take the brewing and beverage industry a step further towards producing beers with a higher resistance against staling, from which eventually not only the brewing industry but also customers will benefit. Eine Vielzahl an chemischen und molekularen Vorgängen führt zum Auftreten von Fehlaromen während der Lagerung von Bier und zu einer verringerten Akzeptanz bei Konsumenten. Wissen um Faktoren, die die Geschmacksstabilität von Bier beeinflussen, ist damit von großem Interesse für viele Brauereien. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, die Rolle von reaktiven Sauerstoffspezies in Bildungsreaktionen von Aroma-aktiven Aldehyden aufzuklären, sowie die antioxidative Wirkungsweise von Hopfen, insbesondere Hopfensäuren zu erörtern und optimierte Hopfengaben zu erarbeiten. Ein vorgeschlagener Mechanismus zur Bildung Aroma-aktiver Streckeraldehyde durch Hydroxyl- und Hydroxyethylradikal-induzierten, oxidativen Abbau von Aminosäuren wurde zunächst in Modellsystem bestätigt, und dessen Relevanz für die Bieralterung anschließend mittels Oberflächenwirkungsversuchsplänen untersucht. Während der nicht-oxidative Abbau von Glucose und Xylose im Rahmen der Maillardreaktion sowie eine Veränderung der Fe 2 +-Konzentration nachweislich keinen Einfluss auf die Bildung von Streckeraldehyden hatte, konnte ein linearer Einfluss der Faktoren Sauerstoffgehalt und Aminosäurekonzentration auf die Bildung von Streckeraldehyden während der Bierlagerung belegt werden. Die sauerstoffabhängige Nachbildung von Phenylacetaldehyd und Benzaldehyde aus Phenylalanin während der Lagerung konnte mittels Isotopenmarkierungsexperimenten nachgewiesen werden. Zusätzliche Experimente im Labormaßstab deuteten darauf hin, dass der Sauerstoff-induzierte Abbau von Aminosäuren ebenso bei der Würzeproduktion eine bedeutende Rolle spielt. Dessen ungeachtet, dass der Faktor Fe 2 +-Konzentration bei den durchgeführten Experimenten nicht signifikant war, führte die Zugabe von EDTA zu einer deutlichen Abnahme an Streckeraldehyden nach der Lagerung. Die Vermeidung von Sauerstoffeintrag, Maßnahmen die den Aminosäuregehalt in Würze und Bier erniedrigen, sowie Substanzen, die der prooxidativen Wirkung von Übergangsmetallionen entgegenarbeiten, sind daher in Bezug auf die Minimierung von Alterungserscheinungen als besonders zielführend anzusehen. Zur Erarbeitung von Strategien, die der Bieralterung entgegenstehen, wurde die antioxidative Wirkungsweise von Hopfensäuren in weiteren Versuchen eingehend untersucht. Das antiradikalische Verhalten von α-Säuren konnte auf deren funktionelle Komplexierung von prooxidativen Übergangsmetallionen zurückgeführt werden. Hierbei wurde insbesondere für α-Säuren die Autoxidation von Fe 2 + zu Fe 3 + und Stabilisierung von Eisen im höheren Valenzniveau nachgewiesen. Neben der Radikalunterdrückung und dem Entzug von Eisen von anderen Reaktionspartnern, kann die antioxidative Wirkungsweise von α-Säuren dementsprechend darauf zurückgeführt werden, dass sie der Reduktion von Fe 3 + zu Fe 2 + entgegenwirken. Mittels UV-VIS-Messungen konnte anschließend die Struktur eines α-Säure-Fe 3 +-Komplexes im Verhältnis 3 : 1 (α-Säure:Fe 3 +) vorgeschlagen werden. Während Cu 2 +-, Fe 2 + und Fe 3 +-Ionen von α-, β-, und iso-α-Säuren komplexiert wurden, konnte keine Komplexierung der Metallionen Ca 2 +, K+, Mg 2 +, Mn 2 + und Zn 2 + nachgewiesen werden. Das selektive Komplexierungsverhalten von Hopfensäuren kann daher in Bezug auf die Bierqualität als sehr förderlich angesehen werden, da prooxidative Metallionen komplexiert werden ohne dass dabei die ionische Komposition der Würze oder des Bieres nachteilig beeinflusst wird. Weiterführende Versuche in Bierwürze-ähnlichen Modelllösungen zeigten auf, dass α- and β-Säuren signifikant der Bildung von 3 -Methylbutanal und 2 -Furfural entgegenwirken, während iso-α-Säuren keinen Effekt zeigten. Die Wirkung der α-Säure wurde dabei eingehender untersucht und es konnte belegt werden, dass insbesondere der Radikal-induzierte, oxidative Abbau von Leucin zu 3 -Methylbutanal durch Fe 2 +-Komplexierung und das Abfangen organischer Radikale unterdrückt wurde. Die stetige Gewährleistung adäquater α- und β-Säurekonzentrationen während der Würzebereitung kann daher als zielführend betrachtet werden, um der Bildung von Alterungsaldehyden entgegenzuwirken. Die Resultate wurden schließlich erfolgreich auf die semi-technische Bierproduktion angewandt. Optimierte Hopfengaben konnten erarbeitet und deren positive Wirkung auf die Geschmacksstabilität und Verzögerung von Alterungserscheinungen analytisch und sensorisch bestätigt werden. Die Modifikationen der Hopfengabe führten jedoch zu geringeren Bitterstoffgehalten im Bier, die durch leicht höhere Hopfengaben ausgeglichen werden müssten. Die Hopfengaben sollten dabei methodisch der jeweiligen Würzematrix angepasst werden, um eine größtmögliche Effektivität in Bezug eine Stabilitätssteigerung zu erzielen. Zusammenfassend wurden in dieser Doktorarbeit das Wissen um oxidative Bieralterungsmechanismen und die antioxidative Wirkungsweise von Hopfensäuren erweitert. Darauf aufbauend konnten praktikable Vorschläge erarbeitet werden, um Biere mit einer gesteigerten Resistenz gegen Alterungserscheinungen zu produzieren, von denen nicht nur die Brau- und Getränkeindustrie, sondern letztendlich auch die Endverbraucher profitieren...|$|R
