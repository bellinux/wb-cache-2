40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the plastic buckling of rectangular plates subjected to both intermediate and end uniaxial loads. The plate has two opposite simply supported edges that are parallel to the load direction while the other remaining edges may take any combination of free, simply supported or clamped conditions. Both the incremental theory of plasticity and the deformation theory of plasticity are considered in bounding the plastic behaviour of the plate. The buckling problem is solved by decomposing the plate into two sub-plates at the boundary where the <b>intermediate</b> <b>load</b> acts. Each sub-plate buckling problem is solved exactly using the Levy approach and the two solutions brought together by the continuity equations at the separated interface. There are eight possible solutions for each sub-plate and consequently there are 64 combinations of solutions to be considered for the entire plate. The final solution combination depends {{on the nature of the}} ratio of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>load</b> to the end load, the <b>intermediate</b> <b>load</b> location, aspect ratio, and material properties.

Graded-density materials have been used as impactors; thereby eliminating the tension states generated by the radial stress components during the loading phase. Results of these experiments demonstrate that the time-dependent stress pulse generated during impact allows an efficient transition from the initial uniaxial strain loading to a uniaxial stress state as the stress pulse propagates through the rod.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with structural integrity from a fracture mechanics point of view. The emphasis in this work is on rate effects of fracture toughness but all investigations deal with phenomena or problems within the frame work of non-linear fracture mechanics. In Paper A, three-point bend and compact tension specimens, taken from beam sections of modern and older ordinary C-Mn structural steels, were tested at <b>intermediate</b> <b>loading</b> rates at room temperature and - 30 °C. The experimental work, except the loading rates used, was performed according to ASTM E- 813. In order to investigate transferability of data, full-scale beam sections were also tested at <b>intermediate</b> <b>loading</b> rates. The fracture toughness of C-Mn structural steels depends strongly on the loading rate, and decreases rapidly with increasing loading rate at and just above the maximum prescribed in ASTM-E 813. Fracture toughness data for structures exposed to <b>intermediate</b> <b>loading</b> rates indicate the requirement for testing at appropriate loading rates. In Paper B and C, a similar investigation of both base and heat affected material (HAZ) of a typical {{high strength low alloy}} (HSLA) steel is presented. The results show that the HAZ fracture toughness in HSLA depends strongly on the loading rate and temperature. In Paper D, a finite element analysis of rate dependent crack growth initiation under Mode I plane strain and small scale yielding conditions is presented. The combined effects of a process region, in form of a line shaped cohesive zone model with rate-independent constitutive parameters, embedded in an elastic-viscoplastic isotropically hardening material, were studied. The results show that both process region and material parameters have a significant influence on the rate dependence of the fracture toughness. Parameter sets yielding results that agree qualitatively with experimental observations for an ordinary structural steel tested at low temperatures and <b>intermediate</b> <b>loading</b> rates, were identified. In Paper E, a path independent integral expression for the crack extension force of a two- dimensional circular arc crack is presented. The integral expression, which consists of a contour and an area integral, was derived from the principle of virtual work. It was implemented into a FEM post processing program and the crack extension force was calculated for a circular arc crack in a linear elastic material. Comparison with exact solutions for the effective elastic stress intensity factor shows acceptable accuracy for the numerical procedure used. In Paper F, stable growth of short cracks in an elastic- plastic isotropically hardening material was studied. The investigation was carried out by means of the finite element method. The numerical results indicate that a small variation of the governing constitutive parameters is sufficient to influence the fracture toughness and the extension of the process region at the onset of crack growth, during stable crack growth and at steady-state.

40|$|A novel {{two-stage}} shear-modulated hydraulic {{vortex amplifier}} (U. S. patent 3, 520, 317) has been fabricated and put through preliminary steady-state testing at the 1000 psi supply pressure level with flows up to 15 gpm. The invention comprises a conventional fluidic vortex power stage and a shear-modulated pilot stage. In {{the absence of}} any mechanical moving parts, water may be used as the hydraulic medium thus opening the way to many underseas applications. At blocked load, a control input from 0 to 150 psi was required to achieve an output from 0 to 900 psi; at wide-open load, a control input of 0 to 120 psi was needed to achieve an output from 0 to 15 gpm. The power stage has been found unsuitable for the proportional control mode because of its nonlinear performance in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>load</b> range and because of strong pressure fluctuations (plus or minus 150 psi) in the intermediate control range.

A particular emphasis is also given to investigate the fundamental limitations in excitation control, imposed by non-minimum phases with regard to the open-loop right-half-plane (ORHP) pole.

Moreover, this paper shows the conditional stability in excitation control loop, where either an increase or decrease of the exciter gain causes a destabilization of the systems stability.

Nanocrystalline ceria is very active for the total oxidation of propane under conditions used for oxidative dehydrogenation.
