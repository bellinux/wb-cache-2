40|$|Consumers {{frequently}} share {{stories about}} consumption <b>experiences</b> with others through {{word of mouth}} (WOM). Past {{research has focused on}} how hearing WOM influences the listener; I examine how sharing WOM influences the speaker. My proposed model outlines variables that determine storytelling language, predicts how specific language influences speakers' evaluations of <b>experiences,</b> and identifies the process through which language influences speakers. I test this model in five experimental studies and in a field study using Amazon. com data. I find that stories containing relatively more explaining language influence speakers through a process of sense-making. Sense-making helps consumers understand and recover from <b>experiences</b> by allowing them to figure out why <b>experiences</b> occurred and why they liked or disliked them. Making sense of <b>experiences</b> through explaining language has several consequences for consumers. Explaining language can cause paradoxical effects of WOM in terms of consumers' evaluations of <b>experiences</b> and their intentions to repeat and recommend <b>experiences.</b> Explaining positive <b>experiences</b> can decrease speakers' evaluations of <b>experiences,</b> making <b>experiences</b> less positive and decreasing consumers' willingness to repeat and recommend these <b>experiences.</b> Conversely, explaining negative <b>experiences</b> can increase speakers' evaluations of <b>experiences,</b> making <b>experiences</b> less negative and increasing consumers' willingness to repeat and recommend these <b>experiences.</b> In addition, making sense of and explaining <b>experiences</b> decreases consumers' intentions to spread future word of mouth about their <b>experiences.</b> Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|Certain highly {{emotional}} <b>experiences</b> {{have the}} potential to produce long-lasting and meaningful changes in personality. Two such <b>experiences</b> are spiritual transformations and <b>experiences</b> of profound beauty. However, {{little is known about the}} cognitive appraisals or narrative elements involved in such <b>experiences,</b> how they are similar, and how they differ. In a study of emotion-related narratives, these <b>experiences</b> were found to share many features but also differ in their valence. <b>Experiences</b> of profound beauty are almost always positive, but spiritual transformations are both positive and negative. Moreover, spiritual transformations seem to produce long-lasting change, but <b>experiences</b> of profound beauty, although evocative, do not seem to produce long-lasting change. An emotion approach helps to elucidate two understudied but important emotional <b>experiences...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the paper}} wow <b>experiences</b> are {{explored}} that {{people may have}} re-lated to using information and communication products or services. Based on three projects – including group discussions, a design project, literature reviews and fieldwork – two frameworks are proposed to help companies or organisa-tions to deliver wow <b>experiences</b> to their customers or clients. Wow <b>experiences</b> are defined as strong, positive emotional <b>experiences,</b> surpassing basic or nor-mal <b>experiences.</b> A framework is proposed to understand why wow <b>experiences</b> happen: when something in a certain person, {{who is in a}} certain context and is sensitive to a certain kind of wow, matches with something in a product or ser-vice, that triggers the same kind of wow. Additionally, a framework is proposed to study wow <b>experiences</b> on three possible levels: <b>experiences</b> of using ICT (micro), <b>experiences</b> of communication and cooperation facilitated by ICT (meso), or <b>experiences</b> of a service provided by people using ICT (macro). ...|$|R

5|$|Battles are {{triggered}} {{when the}} player encounters an enemy in the overworld. Battles {{take place in}} a themed arena, using a version of the Active Time Battle system: each side is given a turn in which to perform an action such as attacking. Each side can also interrupt an opponent's action, prolonging their waiting time. At the end of battle, players are granted <b>experience</b> points, which raise their <b>experience</b> level and boost their maximum health and statistics, in addition to in-game currency. Players can form a three-strong party to fight monsters, explore and battle alone, or loan non-active player characters of a similar or lower <b>experience</b> level for a fee, which are then controlled in battle by the game's artificial intelligence. Any character can be loaned to three different people, and the loaned character keeps the <b>experience</b> points and gold that they have earned.|$|E

5|$|During November 2002, New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research {{predicted}} {{that there would}} be an eastwards shift in activity during the season, with more tropical cyclones than normal expected to the east of the date line, due to well established weak to moderate El Niño conditions. As a result, the island nations of Wallis and Futuna, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau, and the Southern Cook Islands were predicted to <b>experience</b> a higher than average number of tropical cyclones. The Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga, French Polynesia, New Zealand and the Northern Cook Islands were predicted to <b>experience</b> an average number of tropical cyclones, while Southern Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia were predicted to <b>experience</b> a reduced number of tropical cyclones. In January 2003, NIWA issued an updated outlook, listing the Northern Cook Islands and French Polynesia as areas predicted to <b>experience</b> an above average number of tropical cyclones. In contrast, Vanuatu was predicted to <b>experience</b> below average cyclone activity. The Solomon Islands and Tonga were now predicted to <b>experience</b> a reduced number of tropical cyclones, with all other countries expected to face the same risk as the November outlook.|$|E
30|$|A {{cognitive}} {{explanation for}} people’s biased retrieval of past <b>experiences</b> appears when we relate them to emotions. Whereas currently <b>experienced</b> emotions (related to a currently <b>experienced</b> event) {{are stored in}} the episodic memory, past <b>experienced</b> emotions (related to previously <b>experienced</b> events) are stored in the semantic memory. The semantic memory is largely susceptible to biases due {{to the influence of}} current beliefs about previously <b>experienced</b> emotions on the retrieval of memories [58]. Thus, memory may make people behave in ways unexplainable by the rational model. These concepts contribute to defining models for the predicted and the remembered utilities, as well as how these models correlate with that of the <b>experienced</b> utility.|$|R

5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of <b>Experience</b> (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize <b>experience</b> – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of <b>experience</b> rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social <b>experience.</b> To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E
5|$|Full focus shifted onto The Missing Link when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their <b>experience</b> to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but instead be a self-contained <b>experience</b> that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone <b>experience,</b> accessible through the main menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the <b>experience</b> jarring for players.|$|E

The findings were viewed within social constructivist and constructionist viewpoints and were contingent on Chickering and Reisser 2 ̆ 7 s model of student development.

40|$|Psychotic <b>experiences</b> {{of varying}} {{severity}} levels {{are common in}} adolescence. It is not known whether beyond a certain severity in the general population, psychotic <b>experiences</b> represent a categorically distinct phenomena to milder psychotic <b>experiences.</b> We employed taxometric analytic procedures to determine whether psychotic <b>experiences</b> in adolescence are taxonic (i. e. categorical) or dimensional. Six different psychotic <b>experiences</b> were assessed in a community sample of approximately 5, 000 adolescents. Three taxometric procedures were conducted. Across all procedures, {{there was no evidence}} of a taxon (i. e. a separate latent population) underlying psychotic <b>experiences</b> in adolescence. Rather, a dimensional structure was supported. The results support the notion that psychotic <b>experiences</b> are continuously distributed throughout the general population, and there is no clear discontinuity between milder and more severe psychotic <b>experiences.</b> Thus, these findings support the use of dimensional approaches to understanding psychotic <b>experiences</b> in etiological studies. In clinical practice, categorical cut-offs are needed: the present findings show that a ‘natural’ break point is not present for identifying severe psychotic <b>experiences,</b> and it is likely therefore that other criteria (such as general functioning) might better aid decision-making with regards to identifying individuals with severe psychotic <b>experiences</b> in need of care during adolescence...|$|R
