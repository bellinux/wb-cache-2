5|$|After {{graduate}} school Ahn moved to Seattle {{and worked as}} a psychotherapist. In late 2002 he was dismissed from his job as the supervisor of a group home for at-risk youth in Seattle, after one of the residents accused him of <b>hugging</b> <b>her</b> and holding her hand. In a 2013 retrospective he penned for news portal Rappler, Ahn contended that her allegations were false; made in retaliation for his sanctioning her with loss of privileges for illegal possession of a controlled substance. Thereafter he left the social services and found work in retail management.|$|E
5|$|A judge banned all filming {{but this}} ruling was {{overturned}} by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not and Jackson {{was surrounded by}} crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming. One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while <b>hugging</b> <b>her.</b> Another woman appeared and hugged him from behind. He then {{fell to the ground}} as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away. After the director helped Jackson get up off the street, he continued to sing and dance. This incident made it into the music video. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela. Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson's production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the death}} spreads, and the interns hurry to his room to find a shocked Stevens, lying on the bed, {{clinging}} to his still form. As they each try to comfort her, {{the cause of his}} death is revealed to have been a blood clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and <b>hugging</b> <b>her.</b> Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who {{did not know how to}} handle Burke's situation, goes to his room and puts her hand on his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program. After everyone begins going their separate ways, Grey remains torn on who she should follow: Shepherd or Dandridge.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and <b>hugging</b> <b>her</b> friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} [...] TV {{debut in}} 2007, Ginia Bellafante from The New York Times recalled {{the scenes of}} Madonna <b>hugging</b> <b>her</b> assistants and dancers and her wishing to be nicer to people she had met.

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic believed that the documentary served its purpose well. [...] "It will convince anybody {{who is on the}} fence about going out to see the 2006 tour to go ahead and buy those expensive tickets already," [...] he added.|$|E
500|$|Pipette then {{tries to}} coax {{the old lady}} into leaving, kissing and <b>hugging</b> <b>her,</b> and {{appealing}} to her (hoped for) good nature.

She cries out in protest that she's too shy for such behaviour, but the old lady assures her that she'll [...] "get over [...] shyness {{after a year or}} two of that sort of thing". Boomblehardt approaches next, and Pipette flings herself on him, crying [...] "Kiss me!". He obliges. She responds, [...] "How dare you take such a liberty! You insolent old man! Kiss me". And so he does. She boxes his ears, much to his confusion, and then retreats into the inn in tears.|$|E

500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today gave a mixed {{review of}} the collaboration, [...] commenting, [...] "Eminem puts in a cameo on 'Love the Way You Lie (Part II)', which extends, but doesn't really add, to their earlier hit about a {{tortured}} relationship from his Recovery album." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner gave a negative {{review of the}} song, stating, [...] "She collaborated with Eminem this summer on the controversial '"Love the Way You Lie"', a song and hotly debated video conflating wild passion with crazed assault. She returns to this on [...] "Loud" [...] with [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)", {{an extension of the}} melody and the arson metaphor, in which Eminem reappears with more histrionic rapping about hating her, loving her, hitting her and <b>hugging</b> <b>her.</b> It's an unnecessary sequel that further muddies the issue: Is this a social statement, or merely an artistic expression about some truly troubled and confused people." ...|$|E
