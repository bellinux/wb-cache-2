5|$|Positioned at the {{national}} grid reference 35770878, Kingston Russell Stone Circle is located on a chalk ridge that is west of Portesham, overlooking Abbotsbury and the sea. The site is located on open downland at a height of 189 metres (620 <b>feet)</b> <b>above</b> sea level.|$|E
5|$|Some places, (for example, the Altiplano in Peru and Bolivia, or {{the plateau}} around Asmara (where the airport is) in Eritrea, and some {{mountain}} passes), are many thousand <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> sea level and travelling to such places after diving at lower altitude {{should be treated}} as flying at the equivalent altitude after diving.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone dropped {{light to}} {{moderate}} precipitation across Puerto Rico, peaking at 11.13inches (283mm) near Ponce. The rainfall increased levels along several rivers across the island, including the Arecibo Big River which was reported at several <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> flood stage. Its passage left about 79,000people without power and 144,000 without water. In the northern {{portion of the}} island, the rainfall caused a mudslides that buried an automobile, which killed its driver.|$|E

50|$|During the St. Lucia's {{flood in}} 1287 180 {{inhabitants}} died, when the seawater rose a <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> the high altar in the church.|$|R
50|$|Accessories {{over the}} second <b>foot</b> (<b>above</b> the main one): expression, tremolo, bass bassoon, clarinet, trumpet, banda, third hand, the tremolo pedal {{combination}} preparabile, tirapieno.|$|R
5|$|The site {{is located}} in the greensand belt, 100 <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> sea level. The {{underlying}} geology is a soft sandstone covered with a stratum of white sand. A Scheduled Ancient Monument, the monument is situated on private land although visitors are permitted entry to it on payment of a small fee to the landowner, who resides in the neighbouring house, Rose Alba.|$|E
5|$|Withypool Stone Circle {{is located}} on the {{south-western}} slope of Withypool Hill, with some sources referring to it as Withypool Hill Stone Circle. The site is at a height of 381 meters (1250 <b>feet)</b> <b>above</b> sea level. It is 670.25 meters (733 yards) east-southeast of Portford Bridge, and two and three-quarter miles south/south-west of Exford.|$|E
5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant destruction, and received little impact on shipping. To the east, there were unconfirmed reports of significant damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but these accounts may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E
50|$|Vamana {{iconography}} {{varies by}} region. Three icons are common, one shows his left <b>foot</b> raised <b>above</b> his knee, the second shows his <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> his navel, {{and the third}} shows it raised above the forehead. These icons respectively symbolize the three worlds - netherworld, earth and heaven - Vamana covered as Trivikrama.|$|R
5000|$|Raised beds: Beds {{where the}} soil has been {{loosened}} and piled {{a few inches}} to over a <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> the surrounding ground heat up more quickly in spring, allowing earlier planting.|$|R
50|$|The ruin {{has been}} reduced to three primary walls, since the south wall rises only a <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> ground level, except for one single-story pier, and was once known for its 10 arches.|$|R
5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been {{increasing the amount of}} wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Jeanne was one {{of three}} November hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico; it was the first {{tropical}} cyclone to attain hurricane strength in the Gulf of Mexico during November. The late season storm surprised maritime interests, and two barges broke free from towing vessels. Indirectly, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation that peaked at 23.28inches (591mm) in Key West. Minor beach erosion occurred along the Texas coast, where tides were two to four <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> normal; coastal flooding affected the state, which was heavily impacted by tropical cyclones in August and September. Jeanne caused no deaths.|$|E
5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E

50|$|Early {{broadcasters}} in the 1950s and 1960s {{quickly realized}} Holston Mountain {{as a prime}} radio-television transmission location {{because it is the}} highest visible point that faces most of the major cities in Upper East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia in the surrounding valley between Knoxville, Tennessee, to southwest of Roanoke, Virginia. As a result, the Holston Mountain ridge is the transmitting site for fivee television stations in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee Television Designated Market Area (DMA). The digital broadcasting antenna for WCYB, PSIP Channel 5, Bristol, Virginia is on Rye Patch Knob, with the top of the antenna 341 <b>feet</b> (104 m) <b>above</b> ground, 2,431 <b>feet</b> (741 m) <b>above</b> the surrounding valley floor, and 4,533 <b>feet</b> (1381.6 m) <b>above</b> mean sea level. The single tower that antenna sits on, is the highest and tallest man-made structure on the mountain, allowing the Virginia station to transmit from the highest broadcasting point in Tennessee, Virginia and Kentucky. The television towers for WJHL, PSIP Channel 11, Johnson City, Tennessee, and WKPT, PSIP Channel 19, Kingsport, Tennessee, are standing side by side in a common broadcasting antenna farm on the southwest slope of Holston High Point, one mile (1.5 km) southwest of Rye Patch Knob. The antenna for WJHL stands 200 <b>feet</b> (61m) <b>above</b> ground, 2,319 <b>feet</b> (707m) <b>above</b> the surrounding valley floor, and 4,370 <b>feet</b> (1,332m) <b>above</b> mean sea level. The antenna for WKPT next door stands 193 <b>feet</b> (58.8m) <b>above</b> ground, also 2,319 <b>feet</b> (707m) <b>above</b> the valley floor, and 4,366 <b>feet</b> (1,331m) <b>above</b> mean sea level.|$|R
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E
5|$|Chatteris is {{situated}} between Huntingdon, St Ives, Peterborough, March and Ely, {{in the middle}} of The Fens—the lowest-lying area in the United Kingdom—with most of the land surrounding the town being below sea level, although the highest point in the Fens (36 <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> sea level) is within Chatteris's parish boundaries. The peaty land surrounding the town is largely used for agriculture, drained by numerous ditches and dykes, and there are two large drainage rivers near the town – the Forty Foot Drain, also known as Vermuyden's Drain, and the Sixteen Foot Drain.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} tropical fruit trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> the ground on pilings to protect against storm surges.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{the boat}} was headed towards shore. When they reached the side {{they found that the}} Beni itself had risen, and the bank, usually seven or eight feet out of water, was now little more than a <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> its level.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look," [...] he continued, {{drawing his}} dagger and making an {{incision}} in the carcass a <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> {{the root of}} the sting, from which he presently drew forth two sacs, each of which held fully a gallon of the deadly liquid.|$|R
50|$|Arabia Mountain is a monadnock in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The peak is 954 <b>feet</b> (290m) <b>above</b> sea level, rising 170 <b>feet</b> (52m) <b>above</b> Arabia Lake reservoir. It is {{now part}} of the Davidson-Arabia Mountain Nature Preserve, a DeKalb County park.|$|R
5|$|On 7 May {{he became}} the 107th non-commissioned officer to receive his CFS certificate. He passed as Second Class Flier. He {{was good enough to}} be {{selected}} as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself. Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching a student in the Airco DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.|$|E
5|$|Positioned at the {{national}} grid reference 35960865, Hampton Down Stone Circle {{is located on the}} southern edge of an open downland ridge at a height of 680 <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> sea level. Located 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) north-west of Portesham on private land, it is positioned on the rim of Portesham Hill and overlooks the coast. Had the vegetation levels been low {{at the time of the}} circle's creation then it would have permitted extensive panoramic views of the coastline. The site is a scheduled monument, and thus accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.|$|E
5|$|The second-ever Elevation X {{match was}} held between Rhino and James Storm, who was {{accompanied}} by Jackie Moore. The bout lasted thirteen minutes and eighteen seconds. In an Elevation X match, both opponents fight on a scaffolding several <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> the ring, in which {{the only way to}} win is for one to fall off and down to the ring. The two brawled at ringside during the opening minutes. Rhino won the match after kicking Storm off the scaffold and down to the ring through a table.|$|E
5000|$|Wolf Rock Cave, {{the only}} known cave in Louisiana, is located just off Parish road 455 (locally known as Johnsonville road) in Vernon Parish. The 70 <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> ground cave is {{situated}} beside Bundick Creek and is a protected by two rock overhangs.|$|R
60|$|Rose {{closed her}} lips tight, {{and her eyes}} flamed with indignant protest, but she said nothing in reply. In her heart {{she knew it was}} a lie. A woman can set her <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> her dead self as well as a man.|$|R
50|$|Lovers' Lane had {{a simple}} single platform, raised one <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> rail level, without any shelter and without lighting. It had no freight facilities. It {{was at the}} road {{junction}} with the Mount (0.3 miles from Watertown) with steps running down towards the lifeboat station.|$|R
5|$|The stones {{themselves}} are small; on average they measure 0.1 metre (4 inches) in height, 0.3 metre (one foot) in width, and 0.1 metres (4 inches) thick. The largest stands approximately 0.5 metres (1.6 <b>feet)</b> <b>above</b> the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely {{have been broken}} since the original erection of the circle. Although {{it is not known}} if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, a sample was taken from one stone and under examination revealed to be a hard, pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} special effects, {{including}} smoke machines and fireworks that erupted during the show. There {{was a giant}} projection screen that resembled the magical mirror from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Also present was a mechanical magic carpet in which Spears sat and flew over the first 100 <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> the crowd. Spears, who had five costumes changes during the show, was joined on stage by eight dancers. The setlist consisted of nine songs, seven from her debut album and two unreleased songs from her then upcoming album, Oops!... I Did It Again (2000).|$|E
5|$|Timberlake's party left Long Island on November 28, 1761. The Holston River's unusually {{low water}} levels almost {{immediately}} stalled the journey, {{as the party}} was forced to drag their canoe over exposed shoals and sandbars. The party ran out of provisions after several days, but McCormack managed to shoot a bear, supplying them with several days' worth of meat. Around December 7, the party explored a stalactite-filled cave situated approximately 50 <b>feet</b> <b>above</b> the river. Timberlake described an incident in which Sumter swam nearly a half-mile in the near-freezing river waters to retrieve their canoe, which had somehow drifted away while they were exploring the cave.|$|E

5000|$|The area sits near Dechmont Hill, an extinct {{volcanic}} rock, 300 <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> sea level. There is evidence, {{written by}} the Welsh chroniclers, that King Arthur's 12th battle, the battle of Calaan, took place there against the two sons of his rival Caw, (or Cawn), king of Strathclyde.See http://www.templum.freeserve.co.uk/history/strathclyde/arthursbattles.htm ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the city}} grew, {{demand for more}} land {{encouraged}} expansion into lower areas more prone to periodic flooding. For most of the 19th century most residential buildings were raised up at least a <b>foot</b> <b>above</b> street level (often several feet), since periodic flooding of the streets was a certainty at the time.|$|R
