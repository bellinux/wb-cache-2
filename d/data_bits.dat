25|$|Many <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> may not convey information. For example, data {{structures}} often {{store information}} redundantly, or have identical sections {{regardless of the}} information in the data structure.|$|E
25|$|The other 59 (or, exceptionally, 60 or 58) {{seconds of}} the minute always begin with at least 100 ms 'off', {{followed}} by two <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> of 100ms each, and end with at least 700ms of carrier.|$|E

25|$|Although two <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> are {{transmitted}} per second, the time code has the property {{that only one}} of them is variable; non-zero B bits are only transmitted when the corresponding A bit has a fixed value.|$|E
25|$|When a key of the {{teleprinter}} keyboard is pressed, a 5-bit {{character is}} generated. The teleprinter converts it to serial format and transmits {{a sequence of}} a start bit (a logical 0 or space), then {{one after the other}} the 5 <b>data</b> <b>bits,</b> finishing with a stop bit (a logical 1 or mark, lasting 1, 1.5 or 2 bits). When a sequence of start bit, 5 <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> and stop bit arrives at the input of the teleprinter, it is converted to a 5-bit word and passed to the printer or VDU. With electromechanical teleprinters, these functions required complicated electromechanical devices, but they are easily implemented with standard digital electronics using shift registers. Special integrated circuits have been developed for this function, for example the Intersil 6402 and 6403. These are stand-alone UART devices, similar to computer serial port peripherals.|$|E
25|$|The raw maximum {{transfer}} rate of 3½-inch HD floppy drives and interfaces, disregarding overheads, {{is as much}} as 1,000kilobits/s, or approximately 83% that of single-speed CD‑ROM (71% of audio CD). This represents the speed of raw <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> moving under the read head; however, the effective speed is somewhat less due to space used for headers, gaps and other format fields.|$|E

25|$|A modern HDD records data by {{magnetizing}} a {{thin film}} of ferromagnetic material on a disk. Sequential changes {{in the direction of}} magnetization represent binary <b>data</b> <b>bits.</b> The data is read from the disk by detecting the transitions in magnetization. User data is encoded using an encoding scheme, such as run-length limited encoding, which determines how the data is represented by the magnetic transitions.|$|E
25|$|DDR3-xxx denotes data {{transfer}} rate, and describes DDR chips, whereas PC3-xxxx denotes theoretical bandwidth (with {{the last two}} digits truncated), and is used to describe assembled DIMMs. Bandwidth is calculated by taking transfers per second and multiplying by eight. This is because DDR3 memory modules transfer data on a bus that is 64 <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> wide, and since a byte comprises 8 bits, this equates to 8 bytes of data per transfer.|$|E
25|$|The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) is {{a digital}} {{computer}} produced for the Apollo {{program that was}} installed on board each Apollo Command Module (CM) and Lunar Module (LM). The AGC provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance, navigation, {{and control of the}} spacecraft. The AGC had a 16-bit word length, with 15 <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> and one parity bit. Most of the software on the AGC was stored in a special read only memory known as core rope memory, fashioned by weaving wires through magnetic cores, though a small amount of read-write core memory was provided.|$|E

The procedures performed inside this block are described in detail in Section 6. Finally, the bit estimates are collected for bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) evaluations. The concept of (data) block in our system will be {{described in more detail}} in Section 7.|$|R

25|$|The more {{accurate}} high-precision signal {{is available for}} authorized users, such as the Russian Military, yet unlike the US P(Y) code, which is modulated by an encrypting W code, the GLONASS restricted-use codes are broadcast in the clear using only security through obscurity. The details of the high-precision signal have not been disclosed. The modulation (and therefore the tracking strategy) of the <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> on the L2SF code has recently changed from unmodulated to 250 bit/s burst at random intervals. The L1SF code is modulated by the navigation data at 50 bit/s without a Manchester meander code.|$|E
25|$|A {{calibration}} header is sent {{before the}} image. It {{consists of a}} 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, a 10ms break at 1200Hz, another 300-millisecond leader tone at 1900Hz, followed by a digital VIS (vertical interval signaling) code, identifying the transmission mode used. The VIS consists of bits of 30 milliseconds in length. The code starts with a start bit at 1200Hz, followed by 7 <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> (LSB first; 1100Hz for 1, 1300Hz for 0). An even parity bit follows, then a stop bit at 1200Hz. For example, the bits corresponding the decimal numbers 44 or 32 imply that the mode is Martin M1, whereas the number 60 represents Scottie S1.|$|E
25|$|The 5 <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> {{allow for}} only 32 {{different}} codes, which cannot accommodate the 26 letters, 10 figures, space, a few punctuation marks and the required control codes, such as carriage return, new line, bell, etc. To overcome this limitation, the teleprinter has two states, the unshifted or letters {{state and the}} shifted or numbers or figures state. The change from one state to the other takes place when the special control codes LETTERS and FIGURES are sent from the keyboard or received from the line. In the letters state the teleprinter prints the letters and space while in the shifted state it prints the numerals and punctuation marks. Teleprinters for languages using other alphabets also use an additional third shift state, in which they print letters in the alternative alphabet.|$|E
30|$|Algorithms {{which do}} not require any {{external}} aiding source, e.g., histogram method [9], Viterbi algorithm [10], extended Kalman filter method [11], and maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithms [12, 13], can determine {{the location of the}} <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> boundaries and the <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> values for a stand-alone GNSS receiver. Authors in [12, 13] showed that the ML algorithms (i.e., ML bit synchronization and ML bit decoding) outperformed the other methods for weak GNSS signals.|$|R
30|$|High-sensitivity GNSS (HSGNSS) {{receivers}} {{are capable}} of providing satellite measurements for signals attenuated by up to about 30  dB [1 – 3]. For HSGNSS receivers, extending integration time coherently is paramount to obtaining higher sensitivity, mitigating multipath and cross-correlation false locks, and avoiding squaring loss. However, longer coherent integration time {{is limited by the}} navigation message <b>data</b> <b>bit,</b> if present. For coherent integration beyond the <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> period, navigation <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> wipe-off is required to avoid energy loss that occurs due to bit transitions. Furthermore, complete bit wipe-off requires the knowledge of bit boundaries and bit values. The processes of determining the location of the bit boundaries and extracting the bit values are herein called bit synchronization and bit decoding, respectively.|$|R

500|$|As {{a result}} of storing <b>data</b> <b>bits</b> using {{capacitors}} that have a natural discharge rate, DRAM memory cells lose their state over time and require periodic rewriting of all memory cells, which is {{a process known as}} refreshing. [...] As another result of the design, DRAM memory is susceptible to random changes in stored data, which are known as soft memory errors and attributed to cosmic rays and other causes. [...] There are different techniques that counteract soft memory errors and improve the reliability of DRAM, of which error-correcting code (ECC) memory and its advanced variants (such as lockstep memory) are most commonly used.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} to show the {{character}} coding rule in computer and information equipment etc to improve the transmission efficiency in telecommunications. In the transmission system, the transmission efficiency can be increased by applying the proper character coding method. In datalink layer, HDSL ptotocol use FLAG byte to identify the frame to frame which consists of <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> stream and other control bytes. FLAG byte constits of " 01111110 ". When <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> stream consist of the consecutive 5 -bit " 1 " after " 0 ", the decoder can not distinguish whether the <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> sequence is flag <b>bit</b> stream or <b>data</b> <b>bit</b> stream. To solve the problem, when the line coder in transmitter detects the consecutive 5 -bits " 1 " after " 0 " in the input data stream, inserts violently the " 0 " after 5 th " 1 " of the consecutive 5 -bit " 1 " after " 0 ". As a result, when the characters are decoded with the above procedure, the efficiency of system should be decreased. This paper shows the character code rule to minimize the consecutive 5 -bits " 1 "...|$|R
