40|$|Textile Technology: The sun-blocking {{properties}} of a textile are enhanced when a dye, pigment, delustrant, or ultraviolet absorber finish is present that absorbs ultraviolet radiation and blocks its transmission through a fabric to the skin. For this reason, dyed fabrics provide better sun protection than bleached fabrics. Since naturally-colored cottons contain pigments that produce shades ranging from light green to tan and brown, it seemed reasonable to postulate {{that they would}} provide better sun protection than conventional bleached cotton, and that natural pigments might prove more <b>durable</b> <b>to</b> <b>laundering</b> and light exposure than dyes, {{but there is no}} published research on the ultraviolet transmission values for naturally-pigmented cottons. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the ultraviolet protection (UPF) values of naturally-pigmented cotton in three shades (green, tan, and brown), and the effect of light exposure and laundering on the sun-blocking {{properties of}} naturally-pigmented cotton. Naturally-pigmented cotton specimens were exposed to xenon light and accelerated laundering, ultraviolet transmission values measured, and UPF values calculated following light exposure and laundering. The naturally-pigmented cottons exhibited significantly higher UPF values than conventional cotton (bleached or unbleached). Although xenon light exposure and laundering caused some fading, the UPF values of naturally-pigmented cotton continue to be sufficiently high so that all three shades continue to provide good sun protection after the equivalent of 5 home launderings and 80 American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists fading units (AFUs) of xenon light exposure...|$|E
30|$|All {{textiles}} {{provide a}} growing environment for these micro-organisms. Natural fibres, such as cotton and wool, are especially susceptible to microbial growth and even dust mites because they retain oxygen, water and nutrients. Micro-organisms can embed themselves in {{clothes in a}} closet, curtains, carpets, bed, bath and kitchen linens, even pillows and mattresses. Many bacteria also grow on the skin while dust mites live on shed, human skin cells that have been deposited on items such as sheets, towels, and clothing. Like a house, a hospital contains an immense amount of textiles with the added threat of high volumes of traffic. Because of the constant flow of people, especially those with infectious diseases, many researchers have focused on creating finishes specifically for hospital use. Both patients and employees {{are at risk for}} cross transmission of diseases and other health issues. The majority of these microorganisms are passed from person to person by various textiles. The increasing rate of drug-resistant bacteria only heightens the importance of finding safe and durable antimicrobial finishes. Several elements and natural compounds have inherent antimicrobial properties. Heavy metals and metallic compounds hold {{a large portion of the}} market for antimicrobial textiles. Cadmium, silver, copper, and mercury are all effective antimicrobial agents. Metal based finishes are fairly <b>durable</b> <b>to</b> repeated <b>laundering</b> making them appropriate for use as a reusable finish. Several natural, non-metallic, antimicrobial finishes exist. One of these natural antimicrobial finishes, Chitosan, is the deacetylated form of Chitin which is a main component in crustacean shells. Chitosan has been shown to be effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [117, 118, 119]. Researchers have responded to problems like this by experimenting with the currently available finishes available. Many antimicrobial textiles are treated with combinations of bioactive substances to enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of the finishes and counter act the negative aspects of the treatments. By combining finishes, the occurrence of drug resistant strains forming from the finish is decreased. Another trend in experimentation with antimicrobial finishes consists of adding antimicrobial agents to synthetic fibres during the spinning process.|$|R
30|$|For yarns dyed {{with black}} walnut and laundered, t test showed a {{significant}} effect (t(16) = − 7.09, p =  0.000) of mordant treatment on the colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>laundering,</b> suggesting that nonmordanted (ΔE =  2.56) yarns outperformed (i.e., had less color change) mordanted (ΔE =  4.61) (Table  4). For yarns dyed with Osage orange and exposed <b>to</b> <b>laundering,</b> t tests indicated significant difference (t(16) =  3.25, p =  0.005) that mordanted (ΔE =  4.26) yarns had less color change than nonmordanted (ΔE =  5.569) conditions. For eastern redcedar yarns exposed <b>to</b> <b>laundering,</b> the difference between mordanted and nonmordanted was significant such that nonmordanted (ΔE =  2.35) yarns had improved colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>laundering</b> over mordanted (ΔE =  3.83) conditions; t(16) = − 4.80, p =  0.000.|$|R

40|$|Two {{mordanting}} agents, aluminum potassium sulfate {{and aluminum}} acetate, in three concentrations (5 %, 10 %, and 20 % owf) were evaluated for colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>laundering</b> and light of natural dye extracts (madder, weld, and coreopsis) on cotton print cloth. The type of aluminum mordant {{had a greater}} influence on colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>laundering,</b> whereas dye type had a greater influence on fastness to light. Aluminum acetate at 5 % owf concentration gave slightly higher Gray Scale ratings for colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>laundering</b> of coreopsis and weld. All treatments had negligible to no staining on cotton. Weld had slightly better colorfastness to light ratings than the other dye types with 20 % aluminum potassium sulfate rating highest. Even though the aluminum acetate mordant improved the colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>laundering</b> on weld and coreopsis at the 5 % and 10 % owf concentrations, it did not improve fastness to light and resulted in slightly lower fastness to light grades on coreopsis...|$|R

30|$|In summary, mordanted {{black walnut}} and eastern redcedar dyed wool yarn had less color change {{compared}} to no mordant for colorfastness to light, while colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>laundering</b> had less change for nonmordanted. These findings {{are similar to}} prior research with black walnut bark dyed on wool gabardine fabric where mordanted had improved lightfastness with no difference between mordant treatment for exposure <b>to</b> <b>laundering</b> (Doty and Haar 2012). Colorfastness <b>to</b> <b>laundering</b> results for Osage orange indicated mordanted had less color change than nonmordanted, however exposed yarns were significantly darker instead of the more typical lightening of hue. While colorfastness to light for Osage orange was not significantly different, the overall color change was also slightly darker. This finding while unusual was not surprising as Osage orange is known to darken over time (Cardon 2007; Richards and Tyrl 2005).|$|R

40|$|How should conspiracies <b>to</b> commit money <b>laundering</b> {{that rely}} on stale {{evidence}} be handled by the federal government?

The Money Laundering Control Act is widely applicable and implies that prosecutors have an unlimited amount of time to bring an indictment for conspiracy <b>to</b> <b>launder</b> money due <b>to</b> the complexity of money laundering crimes.
