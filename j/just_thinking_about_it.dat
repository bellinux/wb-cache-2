50|$|With {{the help}} of a friend, Ray creates a new costume from the {{material}} of the white dwarf star. This time, instead of a belt, Palmer uses an encephalotronic grid in the costume's headpiece to control the costume. The grid is keyed to his unique brainwaves. This enables him to transfer his mass into an unknown dimension which allows him to alter his size and weight <b>just</b> by <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He can even make the new costume appear or disappear with a thought by shifting most of its atoms to or from the other dimension. This allows him to be in costume while at full height or to shrink without having to have his costume appear. He can even increase his weight while remaining six inches (152 mm) tall or reduce his weight while remaining at full size. Ray often does this and is then light enough to ride wind currents, where he actually appears to be flying to a limited degree. Palmer also develops a mental link with the white dwarf matter to which he has been regularly exposed. Most of the mass lies within another dimension. Ray can draw upon that mass and hit with a super-concussive force. He has been shown to punch through concrete walls, crush an exam table and break the axle of a car that is moving at high speed.|$|R

The participants were individuals deemed NGRI by the courts, under Article 20 of the Portuguese Criminal Code. Results demonstrated the unequivocally need to follow up decompensated patients after the court order extinguished and these individuals were free and responsible for their own paths. Literature shows that many of them recidivate and become dangerous. Suggestions are presented for a better framing and psychiatric follow-up.

The news about abuse {{both physical and}} psychological are on the agenda for television, radio, press, in fact... all media. There are thousands of ways of mistreatment and have existed since long before being given publicity. There are cultural abuse (in many countries women are almost considered an animal), religious (the ability to be a representative of God is only masculine). But there's a big difference when one see something like this: Husband kills wife after years of abuse {{with the presence of}} major children. We always talk about trying to avoid the tragedy but... imagine you grow up in that environment, which will certainly create a rejection frm yo toward your father, since it's quite possible that in addition to the abuse with your mother has been also on you.

5000|$|The album's title {{reflects}} the band's [...] "just go for it" [...] mentality during the recording sessions.

[...] The band resolved to go with their instinct rather that worrying excessively, something they felt they had honed through {{two and a half}} years of touring since the last time they had recorded in the studio." [...] Scannell stated that, while none of the tracks overtly reference the September 11 attacks, the event did influence this mentality as well, having an important effect on his inspiration and emotions during the creation of the album.""A lot of the themes in these songs are about taking control of your life and living it the way you want to live it, and acting and doing and not <b>just</b> talking and <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It's really important in the big sense in a post 9/11 world to make sure we all live our life in a way where we feel good <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> There are certainly messages within some of the songs at certain points on the album that deal with feelings of loss and those types of emotions, and also some feelings of, 'Hey, I want to get up and dust myself off and get on with my life.

5000|$|The show always {{opened and}} closed in {{the black and white}} neutral space, usually with the same sentence, or a {{reasonable}} facsimile thereof. Titus was the neutral space's only occupant except in two episodes, when he was replaced by Ken and Erin, respectively, and would appear always wearing similar clothes, with a wooden chair, a lightbulb, and the bland walls. Frequently, props appeared for one-shot gags in the neutral space. Very rarely would anything from the Live Story appear there (one notable exception was Dave's suicide note in [...] "Private Dave"), nor would anything from the neutral space appear in the Live Story.

That was her idea, really, hers and Alex's, to turn it into that kind of song."

5000|$|... "Hanky Panky" [...] was {{recorded}} within the three weeks time taken {{for the whole}} project. Personnel working on the song included Leonard on keyboards, Jeff Porcaro on drums, Guy Pratt on bass and Donna De Lory, Niki Haris and N'Dea Davenport on background vocals. Lyrically, the song deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centered around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a [...] "good spanking". It is performed in an almost comical style, and stemmed from {{a line in the}} film, where Breathless says to Tracy, [...] "You don't know whether to hit me or kiss me". The track has a false introduction and starts slowly with piano, but changes after a few moments into a large jazz and swing song, with a changing bassline and minor to major key-shift in the chorus. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, the song is set in common time, with a moderately slow groove tempo of 70 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's vocals spanning from B3 to D5. The song has a basic sequence of Dm-C-Bm-A7sus in the beginning and changes to Dm-A-B9-A7-Dm-C when the swing starts. During an interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna explained:The spanking thing started because I believed that my character in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why she hung around with people like Al Pacino's character. Warren Beatty asked me to write some songs, one of them, the Hanky Panky song, was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', and in the middle I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> it'. When <b>it</b> came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.The singer had to tone down some of the suggestive lyrics to please the officers at Disney, the producers of Dick Tracy, who were worried about their image. In Ireland, the song was subject to controversy after two women's organizations accused Madonna of glorifying violence against women, specifically on the line [...] "I'll settle for the back of your hand"; one of the groups, the National Women's Council of Ireland, labelled the song [...] "highly dangerous" [...] while the other group, Ireland's Women's Aid, said the line was [...] "extremely harmful". Although initially approving of the idea of [...] "getting spanked"—even admitting her fondness on The Arsenio Hall Show—Madonna later backed down from the theme of spanking, explaining that the lyrics were written as a joke and believed that it was instead her character Breathless Mahoney that liked to get spanked. She added that it should have been obvious that the song was humorous in nature, since Madonna believed her image was more of a dominant person who took charge, contrary to the song's characterization.|$|R

In May was moved up in class to contest his first Group race, the Temple Stakes over five furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. Matched against Roman Warrior at level weights he started at odds of 5/1 and produced his best performance {{up to that time}} taking the lead approaching the final furlong and drawing away to win by two lengths.

In this performance all three acts of a recording of Wagner’s Tristan are played simultaneously. From three corners of the space Wagner’s music swells, surges and subsides in oceanic flux, the characters’ voices ricochet {{back and forth in}} uncanny dialogue with themselves, Wagner’s obsessive leitmotifs echo to and fro ceaselessly across the space. The performance space is arranged as a bedsit in which performer Laurence Harvey, kleinmeister of the unexpected, prepares to cook an elaborate dinner. Is he "at home with art"? We never know if he hears what we hear. But his mundane activities seem to mirror Wagner’s grandiose tragedy of passion and death. As his carefully prepared souffle - a culinary gesamtkunstwerk- rises slowly in the oven he gradually transforms himself into a woman, mixes a potent cocktail, and prepares to join himself for a lonely dinner. At the triumphant climax of Isolde’s Liebestod Harvey removes his tumescent souffle from the oven; on the final statement of Wagner’s love-death theme he seats himself at the table and watches as the souffle sinks before him.

I talk the evidence based talk regularly, but now I am walking the walk in a bigger way than I had ever imagined. Change can be frightening. Moving out of comfort zones is not easy. Having said that, the challenge can be invigorating and the change, refreshing. I find myself welcoming the change as much as I dread it. I’ll face my fears and see it through to the implementation and evaluations and beyond. And hey, no matter what the outcome, it should make for a good paper. If anyone else out there is going through a similar process, I’d be interested in comparing notes. I invite you to try something new this year in your work environment or in your professional activities. Implement a new service; change a process; publish a paper; present at a conference; teach a new workshop. Find out what should work through research and investigation, and go for it. Yes, it may cause anxiety and you may have to spend time convincing others to accept change, but it beats <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Now, if I could just crawl under a reference book until the lab is built I’ll be all set. Call me when it’s done...|$|E
