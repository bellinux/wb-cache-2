40|$|Introduction: Allogeneic haematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) is an established therapy for different malignant and non-malignant diseases. Bacterial and <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> are common complications with high morbidity and mortality. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the frequency, the characteristics and the risk factors of bacterial and invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> during the first year after receiving allogeneic HSCT. Methods: Data from 82 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT for different haemato-logical disorders (Charité University School of Medicine, Clinic for Haematology and Oncology, Berlin, Germany) between 2005 and 2008 were evaluated retrospectively. Patient characteristics such as age, recipient´s sex, underlying disease, donor/recipient sex matching, CMV-serostatus, type of donor, conditioning regimen, GvHD-prophylaxis and in vivo T-cell-depletion were analysed as possible risk factors for bacterial and in-vasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections.</b> Likewise, the reconstitution kinetics of NK cells, CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells in addition to the IgG serum concentration were analysed. Finally the revi-sed EORTC-classification (2008) for invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> was assessed in clinical routine setting. Results: 61 patients (74 %) developed bacterial and/or invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections.</b> In total, 75 bacterial and 17 invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> were documented, 73 % of them occur-red during the first hundred days after allogeneic HSCT. The most frequent grampositi-ve pathogens were Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli prevailed among gramnegative bacteria. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common pathogen causing invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections.</b> Blood stream infection accounted for most of the bacterial (53 %) and pneumonia for most of the invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> (88 %). Two (12 %) of the invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> were classified as „proven“, 13 (76 %) as „probable“ and 2 (12 %) as „possible“ according to the EORTC-classification. Four of the bacterial (5 %) and 3 of the invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> (18 %) were fatal. 76 % of the invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> were treated with caspofungin and/or voriconazole. No significant risk factor for the occurrence of bacterial or invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> during the first year after allogeneic HSCT was identified. Furthermore, the occurrence of bacterial or invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> did not have any significant impact on the patients´ survival. Conclusions: The incidences of bacterial and invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> were comparable to published data. Fungal-related mortality was slightly lower than previously re-ported, possibly due to the application of newer antimycotic drugs in the analysed population. This study shows that infectious complications are still frequent and account for high morbidity and mortality after allogeneic HSCT, therefore further research to impro-ve prophylaxis, diagnosis and therapy is necessary...|$|R
5|$|The fruit bodies contain unique {{chemical}} compounds that {{are derived from}} phenylpropanoids. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in the joints, a main cause of gouty arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce this side effect.

Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including <b>fungal</b> <b>infection,</b> lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's {{case was}} unusual {{as he had}} a <b>fungal</b> <b>infection,</b> Penicillium marneffei, {{which at the time}} had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV {{developed}} into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus—ranging from eating a 1,000-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma at the time. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.|$|E

5|$|The main {{threat to}} this species is habitat disturbance, {{both natural and}} human caused. They are also under great threat of white nosed syndrome, {{pollution}} (especially water pollution) and human disturbance during hibernation. Very low levels of light, noise and heat are sufficient enough to wake hibernating bats. Once awoke the bats begin to expend energy and deplete critical fat reserves. If these disturbances are repeated bats, especially juveniles become very susceptible to death. White nosed syndrome is a <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> that attacks bats while they hibernate. 7 million bats of 6 different species are estimated to have been killed since 2006. There has been a 12 percent decline in eastern small-footed bats from white nosed syndrome alone. Due to their dependency on rare ecological features where they nest they are at particularly high risk from mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, highway construction, wind energy {{and other forms of}} agricultural industrial and residential development.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the spread of Armillaria root rot in {{eucalypt}} forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged. Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years. In one case reported in Ovens, Victoria, the disease was spread to blueberry plants (Vaccinium species) via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting. In individual forest stands, <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees—a discontinuous distribution. Large-scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species. The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands, shrubland, and heath communities. It can be found on a wide range of hosts, but is most commonly associated with (in order of decreasing frequency) jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), bull banksia (Banksia grandis), marri (E.calophylla), Lasiopetalum floribundum, and Acacia saligna. It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo (E. wandoo). The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina, and Pinus radiata in Chile.|$|E

MethodsUsing primarily the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) for incidence and the Maryland Hospital Discharge Data Set (MDHDDS) for costs, we surveyed four systemic <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> in patients who also had HIV/AIDS, neoplasia, transplant, and all other concomitant diagnoses. Using a case-control method, we compared the cases with controls (those without <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> with the same underlying comorbidity) to obtain the incremental hospitalization costs. We used the Student's t-test to determine significance of incremental hospital costs. We modeled outpatient costs {{on the basis of}} discharge status to calculate the total annual cost for systemic <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> in 1998. ResultsFor 1998, the projected average incidence was 306 per million US population, with candidiasis accounting for 75 % of cases. The estimated total direct cost was $ 2. 6 billion and the average per-patient attributable cost was $ 31, 200. The most commonly reported comorbid diagnoses with <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> (HIV/AIDS, neoplasms, transplants) accounted for only 45 % of all infections.

40|$|Abstract Fungi are a {{versatile}} group of microorganisms {{which can be}} freely present in the environment, {{be a part of}} the normal flora of human and animals and have the ability to cause mild superficial infections to severe life threatening invasive <b>infections.</b> Invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> (IFI’s) are those infections where fungi have invaded in to the deep tissues and have established themselves resulting in prolonged illness. IFI’s usually are seen in debilitated and immunosuppressed individuals. There are many reports of IFI’s even in immunocompetent individuals thus making IFI’s a potential threat in the present century. Fungi are saprophytic microorganisms which have evolved mechanisms to survive in the mammalian hosts.
