5|$|Double-strand DNA {{breaks in}} {{bacteria}} are repaired by the RecBCD pathway of <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> Breaks that occur {{on only one}} of the two DNA strands, known as single-strand gaps, are thought to be repaired by the RecF pathway. Both the RecBCD and RecF pathways include a series of reactions known as branch migration, in which single DNA strands are exchanged between two intercrossed molecules of duplex DNA, and resolution, in which those two intercrossed molecules of DNA are cut apart and restored to their normal double-stranded state. <b>Homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> occurs in several groups of viruses. In DNA viruses such as herpesvirus, recombination occurs through a break-and-rejoin mechanism like in bacteria and eukaryotes. In bacteria, branch migration is facilitated by the RuvABC complex or RecG protein, molecular motors that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move the junction. The junction must then be resolved into two separate duplexes, restoring either the parental configuration or a crossed-over configuration. Resolution can occur in either a horizontal or vertical fashion during <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> giving patch products (if in same orientation during double strand break repair) or splice products (if in different orientations during double strand break repair). RuvA and RuvB are branch migration proteins, while RuvC is a junction-resolving enzyme.|$|E

5|$|<b>Homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> {{requires}} {{the presence of}} an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E

5|$|In asexual organisms, {{genes are}} {{inherited}} together, or linked, as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, {{the offspring of}} sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment. In a related process called <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.

Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The Holliday {{junction}} {{is a key}} intermediate in <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> {{a biological}} process that increases genetic diversity by shifting genes between two chromosomes, as well as site-specific recombination events involving integrases. They are additionally involved in repair of double-strand breaks. In addition, cruciform structures involving Holliday junctions can arise to relieve helical strain in symmetrical sequences in DNA supercoils. While four-arm junctions also appear in functional RNA molecules, such as U1 spliceosomal RNA and the hairpin ribozyme of the tobacco ringspot virus, these usually contain unpaired nucleotides in between the paired double-helical domains, and thus do not strictly adopt the Holliday structure.|$|E
5|$|The Holliday {{junctions}} in <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> {{are between}} identical or nearly identical sequences, {{leading to a}} symmetric arrangement of sequences around the central junction. This allows a branch migration process to occur where the strands move through the junction point. Cleavage, or resolution, of the Holliday junction can occur in two ways. Cleavage of the original set of strands leads to two molecules that may show gene conversion but not chromosomal crossover, while cleavage of the other set of two strands causes the resulting recombinant molecules to show crossover. All products, regardless of cleavage, are heteroduplexes {{in the region of}} Holliday junction migration.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades {{in our understanding}} of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run.

5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one strand of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate across to the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it displaces {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which strand was used as a template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might end up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as gene conversion.|$|E
5|$|When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius {{are exposed}} to the DNA {{damaging}} agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in S.solfataricus could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by DNA damage. Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S.acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage.|$|E

40|$|How do {{cells and}} nature "compute"? They read and "rewrite" DNA all the time, by {{processes}} that modify sequences at the DNA or RNA level. In 1994, Adleman's elegant {{solution to a}} seven-city Directed Hamiltonian Path problem using DNA [1] launched the new field of DNA computing, which {{in a few years}} has grown to international scope. However, unknown to this field, ciliated protozoans of genus Oxytricha and Stylonychia had solved a potentially harder problem using DNA several million years earlier.

40|$|Telomeres are ribonucleoproteic {{structures}} that protect {{the ends of}} chromosomes from degradation and fusions. In normal somatic cells, telomere length decreases with each cell division, progressively driving cells to senescence. However, cancer cells acquire unlimited replication potential through reactivation of a telomere maintenance mechanism, which can be either telomerase, an enzyme that adds telomeric repeats {{at the ends of}} chromosomes, or an alternative mechanism (ALT) based on <b>homologous</b> <b>recombinations</b> between telomeric DNA sequences. Although telomeres have been described as heterochromatic structures, it was recently found that they are transcribed into long noncoding RNAs, dubbed TERRA (TElomeric Repeat-containing RNAs), in a large variety of species. Transcription of human telomeres is initiated at subtelomeric promoters and proceeds all along the telomeric tract. In yeast and drosophila, telomere length is able to modulate the expression level of nearby genes, a phenomenon called telomere position effect and attributable to telomeric heterochromatin spreading. Thus, we wondered if TERRA levels could be regulated by a similar mechanism in human cells. Using pairs of syngenic cell lines displaying distinct telomere lengths, we showed that telomere elongation reduces TERRA expression and that this is mediated by increased density of H 3 K 9 me 3 and HP 1 α repressive marks at elongated telomeres. Interestingly, increased H 3 K 9 me 3 density was restricted to telomeric repeats and did not spread upstream, likely due to the binding of CTCF insulating factor near telomeres. Hence, these data suggested the existence of strong barriers against heterochromatin spreading at human telomeres. In {{the second part of the}} PhD thesis work, we focused on the connection between telomeric chromatin properties and the ALT mechanism. Previous studies in mouse suggested that a more open telomeric chromatin may favour ALT by promoting <b>homologous</b> <b>recombinations.</b> To gather more evidences in favour of this hypothesis, we compared telomeric heterochromatin in human fibroblast cell lines with similar genetic background and relying either on ALT or on telomerase and, to increase the number of comparable cell lines, we created cellular hybrids. Agreeing with the hypothesis, we found that ALT telomeres display reduced nucleosome density accompanied by decreased H 3 K 9 me 3 levels. This more open chromatin of ALT telomeres was associated with increased telomere transcription. Altogether, our results bring new insight on human telomeric heterochromatin and on telomere transcription regulation. (BIFA - Sciences biomédicales et pharmaceutiques) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for repairing damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By repairing DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{mechanism}} for the diversification of venom {{is thought to be}} the duplication of gene coding for other tissues, followed by their expression in the venom glands. The proteins then evolved into various venom proteins through natural selection. This process, known as the birth-and-death model, is responsible for several of the protein recruitment events in snake venom. These duplications occurred in a variety of tissue types with a number of ancestral functions. Notable examples include 3FTx, ancestrally a neurotransmitter found in the brain, which has adapted into a neurotoxin that binds and blocks acetylcholine receptors. Another example is phospholipase A2 (PLA2) type IIA, ancestrally involved with inflammatory processes in normal tissue, which has evolved into venom capable of triggering lipase activity and tissue destruction. The change in function of PLA2, in particular, has been well documented; there is evidence of several separate gene duplication events, often associated with the origin of new snake species. Non-allelic <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> (or recombination between DNA sequences that are similar, but not alleles) has been proposed as the mechanism of duplication of PLA2 genes in rattlesnakes, as an explanation for its rapid evolution. These venom proteins have also occasionally been recruited back into tissue genes. Protein recruitment events have occurred at different points in the evolutionary history of snakes. For example, the 3FTX protein family is absent in the viperid lineage, suggesting that it was recruited into snake venom after the viperid snakes branched off from the remaining colubroidae.|$|E

We investigated the time of divergence between the recombinant and parental strains in a Bayesian framework. The recombination was estimated to have occurred during a window of 282 to 76 years before the present.

40|$|Abstract Background Mycoplasma pneumoniae has {{previously}} been characterized as a micro-organism that is genetically highly stable. In spite of this genetic stability, <b>homologous</b> DNA <b>recombination</b> has been hypothesized to lie at the basis of antigenic variation of the major surface protein, P 1, of M. pneumoniae. In order to identify the proteins that {{may be involved in}} <b>homologous</b> DNA <b>recombination</b> in M. pneumoniae, we set out to characterize the MPN 229 open reading frame (ORF), which bears sequence similarity to the gene encoding the single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein of other micro-organisms. Results The MPN 229 ORF has the capacity to encode a 166 -amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 18. 4 kDa. The amino acid sequence of this protein (Mpn SSB) is most closely related to that of the protein predicted to be encoded by the MG 091 gene from Mycoplasma genitalium (61 % identity). The MPN 229 ORF was cloned, and different versions of Mpn SSB were expressed in E. coli and purified to > 95 % homogeneity. The purified protein was found to exist primarily as a homo-tetramer in solution, and to strongly and selectively bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a divalent cation- and DNA substrate sequence-independent manner. Mpn SSB was found to bind with a higher affinity to ssDNA substrates larger than 20 nucleotides than to smaller substrates. In addition, the protein strongly stimulated E. coli Recombinase A (RecA) -promoted DNA strand exchange, which indicated that Mpn SSB may {{play an important role in}} DNA recombination processes in M. pneumoniae. Conclusion The M. pneumoniae MPN 229 gene encodes a protein, Mpn SSB, which selectively and efficiently binds ssDNA, and stimulates E. coli RecA-promoted <b>homologous</b> DNA <b>recombination.</b> Consequently, the Mpn SSB protein may play a crucial role in DNA recombinatorial pathways in M. pneumoniae.
