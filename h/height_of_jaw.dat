40|$|Background: The {{density and}} {{architecture}} of the alveolar trabecular bone are crucial to the stability of an endosseous implant. A significantly higher implant failure rate can be expected when implants are placed in alveolar bone with reduced density and stability. Therefore, the present study aimed to describe the trabecular bone structure of edentulous mandibles. Method: Two hundred and seventy-eight bone sections, including the lateral incisor, first premolar, and first molar regions, were obtained from 128 edentulous lower jaws (68 females and 60 males; mean age: 77. 58 years). Ground sections were prepared for each region using the 'sawing and grinding' technique. The following standard structural histomorphometric parameters were determined using a semiautomatic image analysis: trabecular bone volume, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, and the trabecular bone pattern factor, which describes the connectedness of cancellous bone structures. Also, the maximum <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> section was determined, to detect any possible correlations between vertical height and histomorphometric parameters. Results: All the histomorphometric parameters examined showed an unexpectedly huge range of variation. The mean trabecular bone volume ranged between 20. 9 % and 36. 9 %. The mean trabecular thickness showed values between 165. 9 and 224. 7 孮 The mean trabecular number ranged between 1. 22 and 1. 77 / mm, and the mean trabecular separation ranged between 436. 7 and 720. 0 孮 The mean trabecular bone pattern factor showed values between - 0. 05 and - 3. 01 / mm. The maximum <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> sections showed values between 16. 05 and 23. 42 mm. The trabecular bone volume, thickness, number and connectivity were significantly lower in the molar region than in the incisal and premolar regions. Significant sex-specific {{differences were found in}} all the regions, female mandibles showing a smaller amount and lower connectivity of cancellous bone than male mandibles. No correlation could be found between the maximum <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> and the histomorphometric parameters of the cancellous bone. Conclusion: A possible explanation for the difference in the density between the incisal and the molar region may be that molars are generally lost at an earlier age than anterior and premolar teeth. As a result, atrophy-related resorptive and remodeling processes commence earlier and progress further in this region than in the anterior and premolar regions. Sex-specific differences are probably due to an increased postmenopausal bone loss of the females. No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|Fiona pinnata has two corneous jaws (mandibles), with a denticulate cutting-edge. The {{posterior}} portion is flattened. The corneous {{plates are}} little {{short of the}} size of the buccal mass, and much elongated, well arched and ovate. (When they are entirely isolated, they strongly resemble the shape the valves of a small bivalve of the genus Mytilus). They are smooth, glossy, and of a brownish amber colour, darkest towards the anterior extremity, which gives support to the cutting blade. This is a winglike appendage of no great size, terminating below in a free point, and having the cutting margin arched forward, plain, and nearly at right angles to the general direction of the plate. Above is a small process or fulcrum — the point at which the two plates are articulated.

40|$|East African cichlid fishes {{represent}} one of {{the most}} striking examples of rapid and convergent evolutionary radiation among vertebrates. Models of ecological speciation would suggest that functional divergence in feeding morphology has contributed to the origin and maintenance of cichlid species diversity. However, definitive evidence for the action of natural selection has been missing. Here we use quantitative genetics to identify regions of the cichlid genome responsible for functionally important shape differences in the oral jaw apparatus. The consistent direction of effects for individual quantitative trait loci suggest that cichlid jaws and teeth evolved in response to strong, divergent selection. Moreover, several chromosomal regions contain a disproportionate number of quantitative trait loci, indicating a prominent role for pleiotropy or genetic linkage in the divergence of this character complex. Of particular interest are genomic intervals with concerted effects on both the length and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the lower <b>jaw.</b> Coordinated changes in this area <b>of</b> the oral <b>jaw</b> apparatus are predicted to have direct consequences for the speed and strength <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> movement. Taken together, our results imply that the rapid and replicative nature of cichlid trophic evolution is the result of directional selection on chromosomal packages that encode functionally linked aspects of the craniofacial skeleton...|$|R

This study {{determines the}} {{relationship}} between several characteristics <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> movement and masticatory performance determined by multiple regression analysis and adjusted for occlusal contact area and bite force. Materials and methods. Forty-two young adults with natural dentition participated in this cross-sectional study. Occlusal contact area was determined at the maximum intercuspal position by scanning interocclusal records. Maximum unilateral force was measured {{by means of a}} gnathodynamometer. The <b>height</b> and amplitude <b>of</b> mastication, occlusal glide length, lateral guidance angle, anterior-posterior distance and cycle duration were recorded using the ARCUSdigma II system. Masticatory performance was determined by sieving the Optosil particles resulting from 20 chewing cycles. Results.

5000|$|The maxilla of Bathygnathus {{was found}} around 1845 in a {{community}} {{in the north of}} Prince Edward Island called French River. The bone was uncovered by a landowner named Donald McLeod in a layer of shale at the bottom of his well. This layer was part of a red sandstone formation that bears similarities to younger Triassic sandstones in the United Kingdom, leading geologists to think that the deposit dated back to the Triassic rather than the Permian. Canadian geologist John William Dawson purchased the fossil and was the first to recognize its significance. Dawson brought it to the attention of American paleontologist Joseph Leidy, who described it to the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences in 1854. Leidy identified the bone as a lower jaw, a mistake that was not corrected until English paleontologist Richard Owen reinterpreted it as an upper jaw in 1876. Leidy erected the new genus and species Bathygnathus borealis, which means [...] "northern deep jaw" [...] in Greek as a reference to the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> and its discovery in Canada. He identified it as belonging to a dinosaur, although he never called Bathygnathus a dinosaur in the paper (Dawson later described it as [...] "a carnivorous reptile... one of that giant reptile aristocracy which constituted the highest animal type in the middle or secondary period of geologic time"). Leidy compared Bathygnathus with Thecodontosaurus from the Triassic red beds of the United Kingdom, one of the first dinosaurs to have been described scientifically.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{acquisition}} <b>of</b> <b>jaws</b> {{constitutes a}} landmark event in vertebrate evolution, one that {{in large part}} potentiated their success and diversification. Jaw development and patterning involves an intricate spatiotemporal series of reciprocal inductive and responsive interactions between the cephalic epithelia and the cranial neural crest (CNC) and cephalic mesodermal mesenchyme. The coordinated regulation of these interactions is critical for both the ontogenetic registration <b>of</b> the <b>jaws</b> and the evolutionary elaboration <b>of</b> variable <b>jaw</b> morphologies and designs. Current models <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> development and evolution have been built on molecular and cellular evidence gathered mostly in amniotes such as mice, chicks and humans, and augmented by a much smaller body of work on the zebrafish. These have been partnered by essential work attempting to understand the origins <b>of</b> <b>jaws</b> that {{has focused on the}} jawless lamprey. Chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fish) are the most distant group to amniotes within extant gnathostomes, and comprise the crucial clade uniting amniotes and agnathans; yet despite their critical phylogenetic position, evidence of the molecular and cellular underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> development in chondrichthyans is still lacking. Recent advances in genome and molecular developmental biology of the lesser spotted dogfish shark, Scyliorhinus canicula, make it ideal for the molecular study <b>of</b> chondrichthyan <b>jaw</b> development. Here, following the ‘Hinge and Caps' model <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> development, we have investigated evidence of heterotopic (relative changes in position) and heterochronic (relative changes in timing) shifts in gene expression, relative to amniotes, in the <b>jaw</b> primordia <b>of</b> S. canicula embryos. We demonstrate the presence of clear proximo-distal polarity in gene expression patterns in the shark embryo, thus establishing a baseline molecular baüplan for branchial arch-derived jaw development and further validating the utility of the ‘Hinge and Caps’ model in comparative studies <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> development and evolution. Moreover, we correlate gene expression patterns with the absence of a lambdoidal junction (formed where the maxillary first arch meets the frontonasal processes) in chondrichthyans, further highlighting the importance of this region for the development and evolution <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> structure in advanced gnathostomes...|$|R

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this analysis was to explore the potential association between jaw surgery (as {{a surrogate}} marker for osteonecrosis <b>of</b> the <b>jaw)</b> and the use of oral bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women. METHODS: A claims database was used to identify female patients > or = 45 years <b>of</b> age with <b>jaw</b> surgery claims from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005. Four controls (patients with no claims for jaw surgery) were matched to each jaw surgery case.
