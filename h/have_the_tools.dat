25|$|A {{week after}} Khan joined with new trainer Virgil Hunter it was {{announced}} that he would make his comeback fight against undefeated American Carlos Molina (17–0, 7 KOs). The fight was aired on Showtime, on 15 December 2012, and took place in the LA Sports Arena in California. Khan defeated Molina by TKO in the tenth round and won the WBC Silver light welterweight title. Khan pushed Molina onto the back foot and landed a sharp right hand that cut Molina over the left eye. Khan was stiffened by a right hook in the second before steadying the ship and resuming control of the contest. Molina's cut deteriorating badly and taking plenty of punishment. Referee Jack Reiss suggested his corner pull him {{out at the end of}} the ninth, however Molina was sent out for more, despite it being abundantly clear that he did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> to do Khan much damage. Khan started to let his hands go more in round 10, after which his corner finally decided it had seen enough. Khan landed 312 of 679 punches thrown (46%), an equal amount of jabs and power shots were landed. Molina was less busier, landing 87 of 335 (26%).|$|E

500|$|Slow {{progress}} {{has led to}} frustration, expressed by {{the executive director of}} the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria – Mark Dybul: [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> to end TB as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet, but we are not doing it." [...] Several international organizations are pushing for more transparency in treatment, and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government, although adherence is often sketchy. Commercial treatment providers may at times overprescribe second-line drugs as well as supplementary treatment, promoting demands for further regulations. The government of Brazil provides universal TB-care, which reduces this problem. Conversely, falling rates of TB-infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates but may be tied to increased level of education, income, and health of the population. Costs of the disease, as calculated by the World Bank in 2009 may exceed 150 billion USD per year in [...] "high burden" [...] countries. Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up – as among the 250M rural migrants in China.|$|E

2500|$|Oftentimes {{divorce is}} viewed as {{detrimental}} to one’s emotional health, but {{studies have shown that}} cultivating resilience may be beneficial to all parties involved. The level of resilience a child will experience after their parents have split is dependent on both internal and external variables. Some of these variables include their psychological and physical state and the level of support they receive from their schools, friends, and family friends. The ability to deal with these situations also stems from the child’s age, gender, and temperament. Children will experience divorce differently and thus their ability to cope with divorce will differ too. About 20–25% of children will “demonstrate severe emotional and behavioral problems” when going through a divorce. This percentage is notably higher than the 10% of children exhibiting similar problems in married families. Despite having divorces parents of approximately 75–80% of these children will [...] "develop into well-adjusted adults with no lasting psychological or behavioral problems". This comes to show that most children <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> necessary to allow them to exhibit the resilience needed to overcome their parents’ divorce.|$|E
