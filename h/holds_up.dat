40|$|Abstract This work {{describes}} the hydrodynamics of a plate column of 5 cm inner diameter and 2. 75 m height, operated in a semi-batch manner using an oil-water system {{especially important for}} enzymatic catalyzed reactions. The parameters such as dispersed phase superficial velocity, plate orifice size, number of nozzles, nozzle size and plate spacing, affecting the dispersed phase <b>hold</b> <b>up,</b> were investigated. It was observed that the orifice plate produced an uneven change in drop diameter and hence nozzles were used to study the hydrodynamics. The total and dynamic <b>hold</b> <b>ups</b> determined were increased {{with an increase in}} dispersed phase superficial velocity, while decreased with an increase in a nozzle size. The total <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> decreased, while dynamic <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> slightly increased with an increase in plate spacing. Correlations obtained are found to be appropriate for the estimation of the total <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> and dynamic <b>hold</b> <b>up...</b>|$|R
5|$|Dragon Quest II {{is noted}} for greatly {{expanding}} upon the gameplay {{of the previous}} game, Dragon Quest. The game {{is the first in}} the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship. It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in an open-ended manner. It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles. Compared with its predecessor, Dragon Warrior II offers a wider array of spells and items and a much larger world. The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line was also the first Dragon Quest game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first Dragon Quest game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).|$|E
5|$|Trees {{have their}} roots {{in the ground and}} their trunk and {{branches}} extended towards the sky. This concept is found in many of the world's religions as a tree which links the underworld and the earth and <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> the heavens. In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose roots and branches extend to various worlds. Various creatures live on it. In India, Kalpavriksha is a wish-fulfilling tree, one of the nine jewels that emerged from the primitive ocean. Icons are placed beneath it to be worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants favours to the devout who tie threads round the trunk. Democracy started in North America when the Great Peacemaker formed the Iroquois Confederacy, inspiring the warriors of the original five American nations to bury their weapons under the Tree of Peace, an eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). In the creation story in the Bible, the tree of life and the knowledge of good and evil was planted by God in the Garden of Eden.|$|E
5|$|Black can try {{the minor}} line 4...Nc6 that delays the {{development}} of its dark-square bishop, to develop it along the a1–h8 diagonal instead of the a3–f8 diagonal, depending on the circumstances. But the main line is 4...Bc5 to attack the f2-pawn, forcing 5.e3, blocking in White's bishop on c1, so that after 5...Nc6 White will not have enough pieces to protect his e5-pawn in the long run. Placing the bishop on the c5-square also has subtler points, as Tseitlin explains:At first sight the bishop on c5 lacks prospects, being held at bay by the pawn on e3, and is insecure {{in view of the}} threat to exchange it by Nc3–a4/e4. In reality, posting the bishop here has a deep strategic significance. It <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> the advance of the e- and the f-pawns (assuming the white bishop will go to b2), and thereby secures e5 as a future knight outpost, which in turn restricts the activity of both White's bishops. As to the exchanging threat, the bishop may conveniently retreat on a7 or f8, or even in some cases remain on c5 with support from a pawn on b6.|$|E
