50|$|An <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> {{is a type}} of {{tumor in}} which surface {{epithelial}} cells grow downward into the underlying supportive tissue. It may occur in the nose and/or sinuses or in the urinary tract (bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, urethra). When it occurs in the nose or sinuses, it may cause symptoms similar to those caused by sinusitis, such as nasal congestion. When it occurs in the urinary tract, it may cause blood in the urine.|$|E
40|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> {{may affect}} the (para) nasal cavity.

We used the SNOT- 22 questionnaire to assess the quality of life of patients who had undergone endoscopic surgery for sinonasal <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> between 2000 and 2011. Twenty-seven out of 34 patients returned the questionnaire (79 % response rate). Median follow-up was 6 years (range 1 - 10). Mean age was 58. 9 years (range 40 - 85). Median SNOT- 22 score was 12, while the most frequent postoperative symptom was the need to blow the nose (18 patients) and the most frequent preoperative symptom was nasal obstruction.

40|$|Abstract <b>Inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> are {{uncommon}} papillomavirus (PV) -induced canine skin lesions. They {{consist of}} cup- to dome-shaped dermal nodules {{with a central}} pore filled with keratin. Histologically they are characterized by endophytic projections of the epidermis extending into dermis. Cytopathic effects of PVs infection include the presence of clumped keratohyalin granules, koilocytes and intranuclear inclusion bodies. Different DNA hybridization {{studies carried out with}} a canine oral papillomavirus (COPV) probe suggested that a different PV than COPV might cause these lesions. Canine papillomavirus 2 (CPV 2) was discovered a few years ago in <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> of immunosuppressed beagles. Two other cases, presenting with distinct clinical and histological features have also been described. This study was carried out on four dogs with clinical and histological signs of <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas.</b> Molecular biological analyses confirmed that PV DNA was present in all four lesions but demonstrated that the sequences in each case were different. One corresponded to COPV, the second to CPV 2, and the third and fourth to unknown PVs. These findings suggest that <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> are not caused by one single PV type.

40|$|Abstract. Galectins, {{a family}} of {{endogenous}} lectins, are multifunctional effectors that act at various sites {{and can be used}} in immunohistochemical localization studies of diseased states.

40|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> of {{the bladder}} is an {{uncommon}} urothelial neoplasm. Although it is traditionally {{regarded as a}} benign tumor, there are conflicting data on multiplicity, reccurence rate, and association with urothelial carcinoma. From 2005 to 2011, 14 cases of <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> of the bladder were diagnosed at our hospital. Clinical features of 14 cases were summarized.

40|$|Background and Purpose: a {{substantial}} number of studies have reported evidence on the involvement of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in oral and sinonasal papillomas and carcinomas. Oncogenic HPV subtypes 16 and 18 seem {{to play an important role}} in carcinogenesis, whereas low risk HPV subtypes 6 and 11 are usually characteristic of benign lesions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a role for HPV in the development of sinonasal <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> and squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Materials and Methods: A ten sinonasal <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> and eight squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx were retrieved from archival material. All examined cases showed histological features of HPV infections (koilocytosis, binucleated squamous cells and abnormal mitoses). All cases have been analyzed using in situ hybridization. A wide spectrum probe for HPV was used initially. Further subtyping was carried out using specific probes for HPV low risk and HPV high risk. Results: Of the ten studied cases of <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas,</b> one was positive for both: wide spectrum probe and low risk probe, and one was positive for HPV high risk probe only. One of the eight cases of carcinomas was positive for both HPVDNAprobes: wide spectrum probe and high risk probe. Additional positive reactions for HPV DNA using high risk probe were noted in three examined cases of squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Conclusions: Our study confirms the role of high risk HPV subtypes in carcinomas. In contrast to other studies, one case only suggests the possible involvement of HPV 6 and HPV 11 in etiology of sinonasal <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas.</b> The data concerning of the role of HPV in transformation <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> to squamous cell carcinomas still need further confirmation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Epithelial {{neoplasms}} are uncommon lesions {{affecting the}} sino-nasal tract. There are hardly any {{reports in the}} Indian literature. AIM: To study the incidence, mode of presentation and histological types of sino-nasal epithelial tumours in the surgical pathology material. SETTING AND DESIGN: Retrospective retrieval of all sino-nasal tumours and analysis of epithelial tumours. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All sino-nasal epithelial tumours, biopsied or surgically excised {{over a period of}} ten years, were studied. The tumours were classified as benign or malignant. The histology was correlated with the clinical presentation and investigations. RESULTS: In ten years, there were 120 sino-nasal tumours representing 0. 14 &#x 0025; of all the surgical specimens received. Sixty-nine epithelial tumours (59. 2 &#x 0025;) outnumbered the non-epithelial tumours and were diagnosed on the basis of histopathology. Twenty were benign and 49 malignant; occurring predominantly in males. Benign lesions included four squamous <b>papillomas</b> and 16 <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas,</b> with recurrence in three <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> (21 &#x 0025;). Squamous cell carcinomas were the commonest among malignant tumours and four of these were associated with inverted or cylindrical cell papilloma. The second most frequent malignant tumour was adenoid cystic carcinoma with eight cases. Other rare types included the variants of squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinomas of the non-enteric type, muco-epidermoid carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinomas. CONCLUSION: Sino-nasal epithelial tumours are rare lesions, with male preponderance. <b>Inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> and squamous cell carcinomas are the most frequent neoplasms...|$|R

40|$|Papillomas of {{the nose}} and {{paranasal}} sinuses comprise three morphologically distinct variants—everted papilloma, <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> and cylindric cell papilloma in descending order of frequency. Recurrence of everted papilloma is unusual and malignant change does not occur. However, <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> is associated with multiple recurrences and malignant change. The histology of low grade squamous cell carcinoma {{of the nose}} may mimic that of <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> and low grade squamous cell carcinoma may coexist with <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> and {{be present in the}} same biopsy material. There is a high index of suspicion of concomitant malignancy in the presence of severe atypia or hyperkeratosis. Columnar cell papillomas are also associated with an increased risk of malignancy but the rarity of these lesions makes accurate assessment of malignant potential difficult. The most common diagnostic dilemma for pathologists referring cases for second opinion is the recognition of low grade malignancy versus benign <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> at presentation and in lesions which recur. Recent studies have addressed the requirement for histological parameters to predict the clinical course of these lesions and new molecular markers are being applied to tissue diagnosis.

The surgical management of <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> of the maxillary sinus {{has evolved from}} large en block excisions requiring external incisions to the minimally invasive endoscopic and endoscopic-as-sisted techniques used today. The traditional endoscopic approach involves resection of the inferior turbinate to perform an endoscopic medial maxillectomy, which can cause atrophic rhinitis and shrinking of the maxillary sinus, resulting in difficulty following these patients for recurrence in the office. In this article, we present a series of patients who underwent a modified endoscopic surgical approach for the excision of maxillary sinus <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas.</b> In our approach, we preserve the inferior turbinate to preserve nasal mucosa physiol-ogy.

40|$|Three {{cases of}} urothelial <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma,</b> {{detected}} in two female patients aged 32 and 31 years, respectively {{and in one}} 67 -year-old male patient, are described. <b>Inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> is a benign lesion which occurs in the urinary epithelium with a 20 % incidence in comparison with other urothelial tumours. The male:female ratio is 3 : 1. The histological structure of urothelial <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> {{is similar to that}} of <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> of the nasal and paranasal sinuses. It presents interanastomosed epithelial cords, with transitional cells, which develop in the tunica propria connective tissue. Some cells are distributed in such a way as to constitute vacuolated glandular-like structures. The histogenetic origin of the lesion from Home subtrigonal or Albarran subcervical glands is debatable. Recent aetiological hypotheses have claimed that the origin of the lesion may be related to Brunn's nest hyperplasia and/or to chronic urothelial inflammation. The latter hypothesis would currently appear to be the most accredited: immunostaining for cytokeratins would tend to support a urothelial inflammatory aetiology. In our cases, we achieved a definitive diagnosis of <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> only at histology, because of the specificity of the echotomography and cystoscopy findings.

The role of HPV type 18 in oncogenesis of <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder requires further studies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> of {{the upper}} urinary tract is a rare lesion. To our knowledge, we report here the 32 nd case of <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> of the renal pelvis. A 50 -year-old man {{presented}} with asymptomatic gross hematria. Excretory urography showed a filling defect in the left upper calyx. Computerized tomography showed a poorly enhanced low-density area within the renal pelvis. Since radiographic findings suggested a renal pelvic tumor, the patient underwent total nephroureterectomy. Unexpectedly, a 3 x 2. 5 cm polypoid tumor of the renal pelvis was consistent with <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma.</b> Since this benign lesion is extremely rare within the upper tract and its radiographic characteristics closely resemble those of urothelial carcinoma, the preoperative diagnosis of <b>inverted</b> <b>papilloma</b> {{of the upper}} tract cannot be conclusively established even by modern imaging techniques. Therefore treatment consistent with that for urothelial carcinoma should be applied in this disease entity...|$|E
40|$|<b>Inverted</b> Schneiderian <b>papilloma</b> is an {{uncommon}} benign tumor that presents tendency to recur and propensity {{to be associated}} with malignancy in approximately 10 % of the cases. Some of these lesions are isolated in the maxillary sinus, and predominantly affect white males with mean age of 50 years. We report a case of squamous cell carcinoma arising from <b>inverted</b> Schneiderian <b>papilloma</b> in the maxillary sinus extending to the mouth. The patient was submitted to extraction of a maxillary molar tooth four months before the exacerbation of the symptoms of nasal airway obstruction and facial enlargement. Computed tomography scan revealed a sinonasal mass causing opacification of the right maxillary sinus with destruction of the lateral nasal wall and maxillary sinus floor. The patient was referred to an oncology center for treatment and died from tumor progression one year after the cancer was diagnosed. The intention of this report is to alert dentists to include the <b>inverted</b> Schneiderian <b>papilloma,</b> either associated with squamous cell carcinoma, or not, in the differential diagnosis of maxillary sinus tumors with aggressive behavior, which may extend to the oral cavity or involve roots of teeth...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} {{technique}} to improve the surgical treatment of frontal sinus mucocele and its recurrence. Methods: Nine procedures performed on eight patients {{by a team of}} ENT and Ophthalmic orbital surgeons. Data collected included patient demographics, surgical details, pathological findings and complications. The surgical technique involved an external approach via the upper eyelid skin crease combined with an internal approach with a rigid 4  mm endoscope described below. Following evacuation of the mucocele the sinus was anastomosed to nasal cavity with insertion of silicon stent. All patients had preoperative and postoperative CT scans of the orbit and paranasal sinuses. Result: There were nine operations on eight patients (six males, two female patients, mean age of 57. 25 : range, 15 – 71). Two patients had <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas.</b> All patients presented with non-axial proptosis and diplopia. The mean follow up period was 38. 7 months (range 11 – 99). The only intraoperative complication noted was a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in a patient with a post traumatic mucocele. Post-operative complications included lid scarring in 2 patients. One of the patients had a fistula overlying the affected sinus at presentation. Both patients underwent dermis fat grafting as a second stage procedure and responded well. One patient presented with asymptomatic superior oblique weakness that could be attributed to trauma to the superior oblique intra operatively. There was no case of recurrence of mucocele in our series. One of the <b>inverted</b> <b>papillomas</b> had an early recurrence (within 6 months) that required repeat surgery. Conclusion: Fronto nasal anastomosis restores the anatomy and reduces the chance of recurrence in our experience. The final cosmetic result is excellent and the patient's satisfaction is high...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Preliminary {{results of}} the {{endoscopic}} two-surgeon technique {{for the management of}} benign infratemporal fossa tumors are presented. METHODS: Four patients with juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, a patient with an <b>inverting</b> <b>papilloma,</b> and a patient with a maxillary nerve schwannoma were reviewed. The average age was 22. 7 years; the male-to-female ratio was 5 : 1. The endoscopic anatomy and surgical technique are presented. RESULTS: The two-surgeon technique allowed complete resection of all six tumors extending into the infratemporal fossa. There has been no recurrence of tumor within the infratemporal fossa, after a mean follow-up of 31. 3 months (SD = 11. 2 mo). CONCLUSION: The two-surgeon transnasal technique allows benign infratemporal fossa tumors to be resected endoscopically. Simon Robinson, Nilesh Patel, P J. Wormal...|$|R
