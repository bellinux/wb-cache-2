5|$|Humphreys, a Naval captain, {{had married}} Maria <b>Davenport</b> in 1810, and lived at Bramall Hall {{long before he}} succeeded his father-in-law. He became widely {{respected}} in the Stockport area, but following his succession to the estate in 1829, there were disputes from {{other members of the}} <b>Davenport</b> family who claimed a right to the property. Edmund <b>Davenport,</b> who claimed ancestry from Thomas <b>Davenport,</b> the third son of Peter, unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees.
