5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge. There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival in}} Paris, Banker {{and her team}} were posted to the {{headquarters}} of the Advance Section in Chaumont sur Haute Marne, which was then the headquarters of General John J. Pershing. Five months later, Baker was asked to move to the war front, to the First Army headquarters at Ligny-en-Barrois, south of Saint-Mihiel. On 25 August 1918, she moved to the war front with only five operators helping her. For this operation at Saint-Mihiel, Banker had to make a choice of the best operators for the job, she selected: Suzanne Prevot, Esther Fresnel, Helen Hill, Berthe Hunt, and Marie Lange. Equipped with gas masks and helmets, the women operated from trenches where the <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> real; despite this, those not chosen to go felt left out.|$|E

5|$|Several major {{weaknesses}} in Akagis design were not rectified. Akagis aviation fuel tanks were incorporated {{directly into the}} structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks. Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made firefighting difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars. Adding to the <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> the requirement of the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck. Furthermore, the carrier's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection, and there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Vasey was {{concerned}} about the Japanese strength in the Lae area, which his staff estimated at 6,400, in addition to the 7,000 that Herring's I Corps staff estimated were in the Salamaua area. However, a more immediate <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> posed by the Japanese Fourth Air Army at Wewak. Photographs taken by Allied reconnaissance planes showed 199 Japanese aircraft on the four fields there on 13 August. On 17 August, Whitehead's heavy and medium bombers and fighters, escorted by fighters, bombed Wewak. Taking the Japanese by surprise, they destroyed around 100 Japanese aircraft on the ground. In September, the Japanese Army air forces had at their disposal only 60 or 70 operational aircraft to oppose the Allied air forces in New Guinea, although both the 6th and 7th Air Divisions were in the area.|$|E

25|$|While some {{military}} historians {{point out that}} leaving enemies in your rear is not generally wise, the Mongols proved that indirect attack, and bypassing weaker foes to eliminate the strongest first, can be a devastatingly effective mode of invasion. In this case, those enemies were virtually no danger, given {{the ease with which}} the Muslims destroyed them.

25|$|Even at such long odds, the <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> {{sufficiently}} {{great to}} be taken seriously. It was not considered worthwhile to immediately acquire the uranium, but Tizard's Committee on the Scientific Survey of Air Defence was directed to conduct research into the feasibility of atomic bombs. Thomson, at Imperial College London, and Oliphant, at the University of Birmingham, were tasked with carrying {{out a series of}} experiments on uranium. By February 1940, Thomson's team had failed to create a chain reaction in natural uranium, and he had decided that it was not worth pursuing.|$|E
25|$|For the Allies, {{probably}} the Ottoman's most dangerous weapon were their fireships. These {{had long been}} deployed to devastating effect by the Greek revolutionaries against the Ottomans, who had learnt {{how to use them}} through hard experience. Fireships were posted on the wings of the Ottoman formation, and could, if effectively deployed, wreak mayhem on Allied boats concentrated in enclosed waters, especially as Allied sailors had no experience of this kind of warfare. The <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> graphically demonstrated in the early phase of the battle, when the French ship of the line Scipion narrowly escaped being destroyed by a fireship.|$|E
25|$|By modern {{standards}} CP/M was primitive, {{owing to}} the extreme constraints on program size. With version 1.0 there was no provision for detecting a changed disk. If a user changed disks without manually rereading the disk directory the system would write on the new disk using the old disk's directory information, ruining the data stored on the disk. Starting with 1.1 or 1.2 this <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> reduced: if one changed disks without reading the new disk's directory, and tried to write to it, the operating system would signal a fatal error, avoiding overwriting but requiring a reboot (which took {{no more than a}} few seconds, but entailed losing whatever data you were trying to save).|$|E

25|$|On 26 August 1643, {{all being}} ready, Essex started. Through Aylesbury and round {{the north side}} of Oxford to Stow-on-the-Wold, the army moved resolutely, not deterred by want of food and rest, or by the attacks of Rupert's and Wilmot's horse on its flank. On 5 September, just as Gloucester {{was at the end of}} its resources, the siege of Gloucester was {{suddenly}} raised. The Royalists drew off to Painswick, for Essex had reached Cheltenham and the <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> over; the field armies, being again face to face, and free to move. There followed a series of skilful manoeuvres in the Severn and Avon valleys. At the end, the Parliamentary army gained a long start on its homeward road via Cricklade, Hungerford and Reading.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of fighters {{should have been}} considered a priority, but Hitler and Göring forbade a switch to the {{production of}} defensive fighters. Yet, attrition was having an impact on production. Production in July 1943 amounted to 1,263; by December, it had fallen to 687. The reduction was due to American efforts against aircraft factories. In October 1943, German intelligence reported Allied fighter aircraft were reaching as far east as Hamburg. The P-47 and P-38s were fitted with drop tanks to extend their range. Some reached and crashed near Aachen on Germany's west border. General der Jagflieger Adolf Galland brought this to the attention of Göring, who dismissed the event as a fluke. He asserted that the fighters must have been damaged and glided eastward from a great height. The <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> ignored.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{wrote in}} 1949, that the defence of Calais delayed the German attack on Dunkirk {{and helped to}} save the BEF. In 1950, Guderian denied this but in 1966, L. F. Ellis, the British {{official}} historian, wrote that three panzer divisions had been diverted by the defence of Boulogne and Calais, giving the Allies time to rush troops {{to the west of}} Dunkirk. In 2006, Karl-Heinz Frieser wrote that the halt order issued to the German unit commanders because of the Anglo-French attack at the Battle of Arras (21 May) had more effect than the siege. Hitler and the higher German commanders panicked, because of their fears of flank attacks, when the real <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> of the Allies retreating to the coast before they could be cut off. British reinforcements at Boulogne and Calais had arrived in time to forestall the Germans, when they advanced again on 22 May.|$|E
