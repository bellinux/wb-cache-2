I don’t have any information about that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not jump to conclusions and we should wait {{to find out what}} the evidence says... What we do know is that Hamas often hides amongst innocents and uses innocent people, including children, as human shields." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Angela and I {{exchanged}} glances. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{both have}} laughed {{but for the}} tears which we had seen in his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "The circumstances," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "are peculiar. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> do well {{to consult}} together--you and I, Felix, and Raoul here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to}} have a good chance with her. She has shown herself a very fast boat the few times she has been raced, but so have we, and taking the line through boats <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have both sailed against, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to be able to}} beat her." ...|$|R
60|$|SAVE. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are {{all agreed}} in this matter, and {{therefore}} there needs no more words about it.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{will only}} {{understand}} the full effect of Jo's training model ... {{when we are}} {{well into the next}} millennium. Gillyanne Kayes ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was indeed, sir. At {{one time}} they fairly drove us back, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have beaten them {{even if you}} had not brought help to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know, Dogeetah, but I think not. If {{she were}} dead <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have heard some rumour of the Feast of the eating {{of the dead}} Mother." ...|$|E
60|$|The bare {{idea of this}} is {{no doubt}} horribly repulsive to us, {{but at the same}} time <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{remember}} how repulsive our carnivorous habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no reason}} why he should not change his mind," [...] Borrowdean answered. [...] "Between us, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could induce him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is a {{feel in the}} water,' said Frithiof, 'that I cannot understand. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> run downhills or somethings. She steers bad this morning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, husband, for now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{shall never}} get out of Leyden. I pray that Adrian may not hear of it, that is all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'His {{work has}} some dreadful tendencies. He was, I am informed, either a theist or an atheist, I cannot {{for the moment}} recall which-- <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> make our little course as {{improving}} as possible.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{may not be}} loosed {{on earth}} or in heaven," [...] replied Emlyn solemnly, [...] "yet perchance the sword can cut it. Sir Christopher, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all do well to travel as soon as may be." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have succeeded, {{even though}} the ship was wracked from stem to stern by the terrific buffetings she received, and though she were half {{submerged}} {{the greater part of}} the time, had no further accident befallen us.|$|E
60|$|She {{gave him}} the hand which Arthur had seized upon. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had none of us before seen a smile so {{dazzling}} as hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{had better}} take only nine. If we {{overload}} her she will row so heavily <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall {{be a long}} time overhauling them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly know. Perhaps {{they would}} hardly do <b>that.</b> However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to make}} it legal now--as soon as {{you are able to}} go out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear, nevertheless, {{that he is}} dying,--though it may, perhaps, take a long time. And then poor Mountjoy has disappeared. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> see no one {{till the}} mystery about Mountjoy has been cleared up. And then the story is so very discreditable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excellent," [...] said he, {{recovering}} his good-humor. [...] "Then we'll {{look into}} this matter together. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> begin by seeing Forbes. He can probably tell us all the details we want until we know from what side the case is to be approached." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shame on you, comrades!" [...] he said, in a low, grave voice, that {{instantly}} {{produced a}} dead silence; [...] "shame on you, to quarrel {{on our first}} night in the bush! We've few enough friends in these parts, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> make enemies o' each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unless we {{can find}} a way out of this accursed charnel-house before long, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall add to its company," [...] I said, staring round me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Bertha. We {{must not}} give them reason to say that their neighbors are inquisitive. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are safe if we stand like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can manage. If we {{have not}} flour enough here to spare, I can take my horse and fetch half a sackful from some other village." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Among those {{ornaments}} {{that hung}} about the waist of Rosamund I saw a jewelled knife," [...] answered Godwin, sadly. [...] "She {{can be trusted}} to use it if need be, and after {{that we can be}} trusted to do our worst. At least, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> die in a fashion that would be remembered in this mountain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{hear what}} the man says, Maqueda?" [...] said Orme heavily. [...] "There is some truth in it. It really does not matter to us whether we die {{in the power of}} the Abati or here of starvation; in fact, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> prefer the former end, and doubtless no hand will be laid on you. Will you go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For our sakes, yes; {{for your}} own I am not so sure. To tell you the truth, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have done better never to have started on this mad expedition. However, things look a little more {{promising}} now, though Nam and his company have still to be reckoned with, and we don't seem much nearer the rubies, which are our main object." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{will take}} them," [...] said Godwin, [...] "for faith {{is a poor}} defence against the daggers of these Assassins, who dwell not so far away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, love, {{unless one}} dreams. Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must have dreamt. What was the dream now? Rachel weeping--Rachel weeping--my love, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{are going to}} live here, and I think--I think----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You had {{something}} to do with the planning, too, Paolo. However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may both feel well content with the rewards <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have obtained for two days' work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and I, at any rate, Maggie, {{know the}} truth," [...] he said, [...] "and {{so long as}} we can get no help from the proper quarters, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> do better to let the matter remain as it is. We don't want to direct people's {{attention}} to us. We want to lull suspicion so far as we can, to be free to watch the three." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, mother," [...] he answered; [...] "there {{were none}} on the flats, for {{the grass is}} burnt off; and had not Suzanne beaten out a dry pan for me where the reeds were still green, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have found nothing. As it was I shot badly, hitting the ram in the flank, so that we were obliged to follow it a long way before I came up with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the {{particular}} evening to which I refer," [...] Captain Bannister continued, [...] "it was suggested, by Mrs. Delaporte, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> go round to her rooms and play chemin de fer. There were {{five of us}} altogether--Mr. Bundercombe, Mrs. Delaporte, myself, a Mr. Dimsdale, and the Honorable Montague Pelham, a young gentleman of the best family. When we arrived at Mrs. Delaporte's rooms, however, it transpired that Mr. Bundercombe was wholly ignorant of chemin de fer, and the game was accordingly changed to poker.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did," [...] he {{answered}} gravely. [...] "My name is Mostyn Ray--but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had better have some light. I {{am going to}} get one of the motor lamps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were bound}} {{to get to the}} bottom of it all, if <b>we</b> could; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have,--at last. Perhaps, as you say, we ought to have done it sooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Capital, Mike! Now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can venture, {{and we will}} go the {{shortest}} way. We might very well lose ourselves among these hills, {{if we were to}} try to make a circuit." ...|$|R
