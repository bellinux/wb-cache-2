The engineering {{and design of}} enzymes is a developing, growing research field that is employed in biocatalysis. In the present thesis, combinatorial protein engineering methods are applied {{for the development of}} Candida antarctica lipase A (CALA) variants with broader substrate scope and increased enantioselectivity. Initially, the structure of CALA was deduced by manual modelling and later the structure was established by X-ray crystallography. The elucidation of the structure of CALA revealed several biocatalytically interesting features. With the knowledge derived from the enzyme structure, enzyme variants were produced via iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM), a powerful protein engineering approach. Several of these variants were highly active and enantioselective towards bulky esters. Furthermore, an extensively combinatorial protein engineering approach was developed and investigated. A CALA variant with a spacious substrate binding pocket that can accommodate an unusually bulky substrate, an ester derivate of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory <b>drug</b> (<b>S)</b> -ibuprofen, was obtained with this approach.

Surface tension, solubility studies, contact angles, rotating disk dissolution rates, and powder dissolution rates were compared for hydrocortisone between solutions containing NaTC/lecithin (4 : 1) and NaTC-only under conditions representative of the small intestine (0 – 30 m M NaTC, pH 5. 5, 0. 1 M NaCl). At all concentrations, the solubility of hydrocortisone in NaTC/lecithin was slightly higher (up to twofold) than in the corresponding NaTC-only solutions. At low NaTC concentrations, initial powder dissolution rates were faster in the NaTC/lecithin solutions than in corresponding NaTC-only solutions. In contrast, at high NaTC concentrations, initial powder dissolution rates in the NaTC-only solutions were faster.

Both vancomycin and LY 146032 killed S. aureus, but the time-killing curves differed: the effect of vancomycin was slow, limited, and not related to the concentration of the drug, whereas that of LY 146032 was rapid, extensive, and related to concentration. When strains ATCC 25923 and CIP 6525 were exposed to LY 146032, the population decreased exponentially with time. The killing rate was constant and linked to the concentration by a Michaelis-Menten relationship. The maximum killing rate and the affinity constant of LY 146032, estimated from the data transformed by the Lineweaver-Burk method, differed for the two strains.

40|$|Suicidal drug {{overdose}} {{is a major}} public health issue. In the United States, every year more than 33, 000 people commit suicides. Our study focused {{on the characteristics of}} suicide victims in the state of Maryland. Material and methods: This study was a retrospective review of autopsy cases of all suicide deaths caused by <b>drug</b> (<b>s)</b> or <b>drug</b> (<b>s)</b> with alcohol intoxication investigated by the OCME in Maryland over a 7 -year period from January 2004 to December 2011. All deaths investigated by the OCME that require autopsy examination are subject to comprehensive toxicology testing for drugs and alcohol. The screen tests were performed using gas chromatography (GC) and radioimmunoassay techniques. All detected drugs and/or metabolites were confirmed using GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results: From 2004 to 2011, 434 deaths were certified as suicide. Of the 434 suicidal overdose deaths, 84 % were white, 11 % were African-American, and about 5 % were either Hispanic or Asian. The male and female ratio was almost equal. Their ages ranged 15 - 82 years. Of the 434 suicidal {{drug overdose}} deaths, 277 victims (63. 8 %) consumed a single drug type and 157 (36. 2 %) consumed more than one type of drug. Of the 277 single-drug overdose cases, 71. 1 % suicides were due to prescription drugs, 23. 5 % due to over-the-counter drugs, and 5. 4 % due to street/recreational drugs. Among single-type prescription drugs, analgesic (N = 76), antidepressant (N = 45), and neuroleptic (N = 35) classes were the three leading type of drugs used in suicidal deaths. Oxycodone, morphine, quetiapine, and amitriptyline were the most common prescription drugs in suicidal overdose. Diphenhydramine was the leading over-the-counter drug. Of the 157 victims who consumed more than one drug, combined prescription drugs were present in 54. 1 %, mixed prescription and over-the-counter drugs in 29. 3 %, and prescription drugs/over-the-counter drugs and street drugs in 16. 6 % of cases. Of the multiple-drug overdose suicides, 66. 2 % cases involved antidepressants. Discussion: Suicide is found in every age, racial, and ethnic group. In the USA, poisoning is thethird-leading method of suicide, following firearm injuries and hanging/strangulation. Our study indicates that prescription drugs, such as those in the opioid analgesic, neuroleptic, and antidepressant class (e. g., oxycodone, morphine, quetiapine, amitriptyline, doxepin, and citalopram), are of special concern in the context of suicidal overdose deaths in the state of Maryland.

Phase solubility studies indicated 1 : 1 stoichiometry for all CyDs, with [small beta]-CyD {{being the most}} effective to enhance the solubility of and form the most stable complex with Dpx. 1 H NMR titrations and Job's method of continuous variation were also employed to corroborate the stoichiometry and association constants with [gamma]- and [small beta]-CyDs. The simultaneous evaluation of titration datasets of several Dpx and CyD protons revealed for both CyDs that the best fit was achieved when the coexistence of Dpx[middle dot]CyD and 2 Dpx[middle dot]CyD complexes were assumed. This finding was rather unanticipated considering the smaller cavity size of [small beta]-CyD, which inspired further investigations. The UV hypochromism and circular dichroism spectroscopic data suggested the inclusion of two Dpx molecules into the CyD cavity (albeit {{to a less extent}} with [small beta]-CyD). This conclusion was fully supported by 2 D ROESY and 1 D NOESY NMR spectra, observing NOEs between the inner methine protons of CyDs and both the phenyl and naphthyl ring protons of Dpx.

It was previously shown that acidic extracellular pH stimulated peripheral lysosome trafficking, resulting in increased cathepsin B secretion and tumor cell invasion, which was dependent upon sodium-proton exchanger (NHE) activity. We now demonstrate that HGF induced the trafficking of lysosomes to the cell periphery, independent of HGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. HGF-induced anterograde lysosome trafficking depended upon the PI 3 K pathway, microtubules and RhoA, resulting in increased cathepsin B secretion and invasion by the cells. HGF-induced NHE activity via increased net acid production, and inhibition of NHE activity with 5 -(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) -amiloride (EIPA), {{or a combination of}} the NHE 1 -specific drug cariporide and the NHE 3 -specific <b>drug</b> <b>s</b> 3226 prevented HGF-induced anterograde trafficking and induced retrograde trafficking in HGF-overexpressing cells.

Both a- and b-wave ERG findings and indirect ophthalmoscopic appearance of retinas in all groups were normal.
