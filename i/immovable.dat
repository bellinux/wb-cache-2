They argue that such <b>immovable</b> property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} of registration and material publicity in the register of <b>immovables</b> under Czech law The {{aim of the}} thesis is to analyse two institutes important for the law of <b>immovables.</b> The first institute {{is represented by the}} {{principle of}} registration and by the opposite consensual principle of acquisition ownership to <b>immovables.</b> The second one is the principle of material publicity in the register of <b>immovables.</b> Both institutes are closely related. The thesis is divided into two main parts. First part deals with the mode of acquisition ownership to <b>immovables.</b> It consists of six chapters. First chapter introduces a general base of the problem. Second chapter describes briefly historical evolution of acquisition ownership to <b>immovables</b> and is divided into two subchapters, first one is about the evolution up to the Second World War, the second deals with the modern evolution of the problem {{since the end of the}} Second World War. Third chapter introduces the recent legal regulation and discusses its main deficiencies. Fourth chapter presents the law regulation which is proposed to approval within the scope of the bill of a new Civil Code. This bill has been passed by the Czech government in April 2009 and then introduced before Parliament. The proposers of the bill considered both variants of [...] ...|$|R

Each eye may have up to 17,000 individual light receptors (ommatidia) which in combination provide a broad mosaic view of the surrounding area. One tropical Asian family, the Amphitheridae, has compound eyes divided into two distinct segments. The eyes are usually smooth but may be covered by minute hairs. The eyes of butterflies are usually brown, golden-brown or even red as in the case of some species of skippers.|$|E
5|$|Together with turtles, the tuatara has {{the most}} {{primitive}} hearing organs among the amniotes.

The hair cells are unspecialized, innervated by both afferent and efferent nerve fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800Hz, with peak sensitivity of 40dB at 200Hz.|$|E

5|$|Several {{accidents}} occurred which {{threatened the}} station's safety, {{such as the}} glancing collision between Kristall and Soyuz TM-17 during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents occurred during EO-23. The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO-22 to EO-23, when a malfunction occurred in the backup Vika system, a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG). The Vika malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut Jerry Linenger insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Some of the fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} newer modules were <b>immovable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fire, {{caused by}} the {{malfunction}} of a backup solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between 90 seconds and 14 minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} modules were <b>immovable.</b> The fire occurred during a crew rotation, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three. Access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats was blocked, which would have prevented escape by half of the crew. A similar incident had occurred on an earlier Mir expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for only a few seconds.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalists {{including}} Muzorewa {{signed the}} Internal Settlement, {{under which the}} country became Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979. Mugabe and Nkomo continued fighting; no country recognised the settlement. Smith was part of Muzorewa's delegation that settled with the UK and the revolutionary guerrillas at Lancaster House, and following Zimbabwe's recognised independence in 1980, he was Leader of the Opposition during Mugabe's first seven years in power. Smith was a stridently vocal critic of the Mugabe government {{both before and after}} his retirement from frontline politics in 1987; he dedicated much of his 1997 memoirs, The Great Betrayal, to condemning Mugabe and several UK politicians. As Mugabe's reputation thereafter plummeted amid Zimbabwe's economic turmoil, reckoning of Smith and his legacy improved. Zimbabwean opposition supporters lauded the elderly Smith as an <b>immovable</b> symbol of resistance. He remained in Zimbabwe until 2005, when he moved to Cape Town, South Africa, for medical reasons. After his death two years later, at the age of 88, his ashes were repatriated and scattered at his farm.|$|E

40|$|Even {{though we}} may not realize it, <b>immovables</b> are all around us. Because <b>immovables</b> are usually {{considered}} very valuable, ownership of real estate is examined more comprehensively in comparison to other things. Therefore, the laws of different states pay detailed attention to ownership rights and real estate. The same applies to the Czech Civil Code which came into effect as of 1 January 2014. This thesis is focused on a general explanation of ownership rights and <b>immovables.</b> Furthermore, it focuses on the theoretical analysis {{of the most important}} changes and developments that relate to real estate ownership rights brought about by the new Civil Code {{as well as on the}} consideration of the practical impact of these changes on legal relationships. Within the framework of these particular topics, the thesis refers to court decisions issued prior to the new Civil Code becoming effective, which are, in the author's view, also applicable to legal relationships established under the new civil rules. The basic principles of the operation of the Real Estate Register are also the subject of this thesis because the registration of the ownership rights of the majority of <b>immovables</b> in such a public register is necessary...|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{marriage}} {{which has}} an international recognised legal status, there are no international treaties on recognition of unmarried couple's legal status. If an unmarried couple change residence to different countries, then the local law on where the couple is last domiciled is applied to them. This covers legal status of the relationship, rights, obligations, and all worldwide movable and <b>immovable</b> property. To otherwise interpret the law would mean if the unmarried couple had assets in several different countries, they would then need separate legal cases in each country to resolve all their movable and <b>immovable</b> property.|$|E

50|$|The {{distinction}} between {{these types of}} property is significant {{for a variety of}} reasons. Usually one's rights on movables are more attenuated than one's rights on <b>immovables</b> (or real property). The statutes of limitations or prescriptive periods are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and <b>immovables</b> are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a lien or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.|$|R

25|$|For {{the purpose}} of calculating the amount of free residue in an estate, therefore, the surplus in value of {{encumbered}} assets over {{the amount of the}} encumbrances must be taken into consideration. “It is necessary,” the court held in Ex parte Van Heerden, “to consider whether the surplus of the proceeds of the <b>immovable</b> property, after satisfying the mortgage bonds which have a preferential claim thereon, can be considered as ‘free residue’ within the meaning of that expression as used in the Act.” The definition of “free residue” must be taken to refer to that portion of an estate under sequestration when liquidated, which is not subject to any right of preference.
