50|$|At this time, Stage 19, {{as well as}} {{the second}} <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> room in the center {{building}} between it and 18, is home to Fox Sports Florida and Sun Sports. It is also being used as a storage area for Universal Orlando parade floats, and to train sporting events for My Family's Got Guts, which was a short-lived revival of the classic Nickelodeon game show Guts. The green room had been used as a one for the show, and has remained exactly the same as it did when earlier Nickelodeon productions used it, albeit with new furniture. Much of the Nickelodeon signage is still visible in the second floor hallways including multiple murals of the Ren and Stimpy episode: Space Madness. Currently, the tube that runs above Soundstage 19 {{that was part of the}} tour, is now used for storage of several old props and A/V equipment, along with storage for the Blue Man Group.

40|$|Multimedia {{conferencing}} {{applications are}} an important and widely-used category of Web applications. <b>Floor</b> <b>control</b> is a significant and advanced feature of multimedia conferencing applications. <b>Floor</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms, when introduced in audio/video conferencing, control the media streams such as identifying which participant is allowed to send and who can be seen or heard. This prevents conflict and ensures an optimized use of resources between the conference participants. <b>Floor</b> <b>control</b> is composed of three logical entities: a single <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> server (i. e. entity responsible for managing the floors and their status), one or more floor chairs (moderators), {{and any number of}} regular conference participants. This thesis proposes a SOAP Web services based architecture for <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> in multimedia conferencing. Web services are designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. They are attractive because of their flexibility. There are two types of web services: SOAP Web services and RESTful Web services. In SOAP Web services, interactions between the entities are based on XML and use SOAP, which is embedded in HTTP. RESTful web services are an architectural design style that rely on HTTP, but do not use SOAP. XML is also optional. We propose a set of <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> requirements and use them to review the related work and pinpoint the weaknesses. The proposed architecture includes the main components of <b>floor</b> <b>control.</b> It also includes a comprehensive set of server-side and client-side SOAP web service APIs that expose the <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> capabilities to application developers. The proposed APIs are programming language-independent and provide a higher level of abstraction to the application developers, which enables the interoperability. Furthermore, in the proposed architecture the <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> clients do not interact directly with the <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> server (FCS) but through a gateway accessible using SOAP web services. This opens up the possibility to use different <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> protocols transparently to the <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> clients. Application portability is no longer a problem because floor clients access the floor capabilities independently of the protocol supported by the FCS. We have built a conferencing application with <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> as a proof of concept to demonstrate the new interface for <b>floor</b> <b>control</b> and the feasibility of the proposed architecture. In addition, performance measurements have also been made to evaluate the viability of the architecture. ...|$|E
50|$|This {{led to the}} {{founding}} of the Workmates collective in late 1998/early 1999, a workplace group based out of a London maintenance depot. Workmates was open to all workers regardless of union membership, and sought to organise action on the shop <b>floor,</b> <b>controlled</b> by the workers themselves. The Workmates collective was fully functioning with a delegate council structure for around 18 months into mid-2000. During this time they organised numerous actions with varying degrees of success until staff turnover and the strain on a small number of core activists took its toll. Despite this, the culture of canteen mass meetings has continued for the last decade, and workplace meetings open to all workers are ongoing as of 2011.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years high data rate {{wireless}} transmission has gained considerable attention in hot spot areas, including high buildings. It has been demonstrated that distributed antenna systems (DASs) improve the performance of the indoor environment by covering dead spots. In this paper, the achievable rate is investigated for indoor high data rate wireless transmission in high buildings when DASs are employed. In the system, radio transmission/reception within one or several neighbouring <b>floors</b> is <b>controlled</b> by one central unit (CU) exploiting the entire system bandwidth. In order to efficiently use the spectrum, the same frequency channels are reused among <b>floors</b> <b>controlled</b> by different CUs. The radio signals in high buildings can propagate vertically and reach the neighbouring floors. Therefore, the performance of the system is limited by cochannel interference. Direct propagation inside the building and reflection from nearby buildings are considered in the channel model. The achievable rate of the system is evaluated through analysis and simulation. The impact of representative system parameters on the achievable rate, including the number of remote antenna units (RAUs), the frequency reuse factor, the floor penetration loss, the path loss exponent, and the Nakagami fading parameter, is discussed...|$|R
