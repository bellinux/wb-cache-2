25|$|The most {{familiar}} examples of phases are solids, liquids, and gases. Many substances exhibit multiple solid phases. For example, {{there are three}} phases of solid iron (alpha, gamma, and delta) that vary based on temperature and pressure. A principal difference between solid phases is the crystal structure, or arrangement, of the atoms. Another phase commonly encountered {{in the study of}} chemistry is the aqueous phase, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> substances dissolved in aqueous solution (that is, in water).|$|E

Spinners find an old pitch, one that hasn't been frequently used, more suitable to their deliveries rather than a fresh pitch, one that hasn't come under use as much such as a pitch at the start of the match.|$|E

25|$|If an {{observable}} {{is measured}} {{and the result}} is a certain eigenvalue, the corresponding eigenvector <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the system immediately after the measurement. The act of measurement in matrix mechanics 'collapses' the state of the system. If one measures two observables simultaneously, the state of the system collapses to a common eigenvector of the two observables. Since most matrices don't have any eigenvectors in common, most observables can never be measured precisely at the same time. This is the uncertainty principle.|$|E
25|$|Limerence is {{characterized}} by intrusive thinking and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual.

Basically, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> being completely carried away by unreasoned passion or love, {{even to the point of}} addictive-type behavior. Usually, one is inspired with an intense passion or admiration for someone. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it, and it is thus often dismissed by non-limerents as ridiculous fantasy or a construct of romantic fiction.|$|E
