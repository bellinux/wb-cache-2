40|$|A pot culture {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the cadmium, zinc, manganese and copper concentrations of two Japanese radish cultivars(Raphanus sativus L. cv. Harunomegumi and Raphanus sativus L. cv. Akibutai) grown for 9 weeks in soil whose respective cadmium and zinc concentrations were 3. 3 and 68 mg/kg of dried soil. Both of the Japanese radish cultivars grew normally throughout the growth period, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> being 2. 8 {{times that of the}} roots. <b>The</b> cadmium concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> of both cultivars initially increased for 6 weeks after sowing and then slowed. <b>The</b> cadmium concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> after 9 weeks or growth were respectively 2. 4 and 1. 5 mg/kg for Harunomegumi and Akibutai, this 0. 9 mg/kg diference indicating cultivar dependence. <b>The</b> cadmium concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roots of both cultivars were about one fourth of those of <b>the</b> <b>shoots.</b> <b>The</b> zinc, manganese and copper concentrations varied similarly for both of the cultivars. <b>The</b> zinc concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> did not fluctuate greatly at between 20 and 50 mg/kg, this being similar to <b>the</b> zinc concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roots throughout the growth period. <b>The</b> manganese concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> increased from around 2 to 12 mg/kg during the growth period, while those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roots remained almost constant at around l. 5 mg/kg. <b>The</b> copper concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> tended to be higher than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roots throughout thr egrowth period. <b>The</b> copper concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> after 9 weeks of growth was around l. 2 mg/kg, being 1. 4 times that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roots...|$|R

5|$|The Monbar Hotel {{attack was}} carried out by the GAL, a state-sponsored death squad, on 25 September 1985 in Bayonne, France. The targets were four members of ETA military, whom the Spanish {{government}} believed to be senior figures in the organisation, itself proscribed as a terrorist group in Spain and France. All four people were killed, with a fifth person, apparently unconnected to ETA, injured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> This represented the deadliest attack carried out by the GAL. Although two of the participants were apprehended shortly after the shooting, controversy surrounded the possible involvement of senior figures in the Spanish police.|$|E
5|$|The artwork for {{the album}} was {{produced}} during a photo shoot which remains the most expensive one to be ever developed in Romania, with the total costs amounting to €15,000.

Over 50 male and female models were featured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> which consisted of two different images — an uncensored one leaked onto {{the internet and the}} photograph used to commercialize the album.

40|$|The Effect {{of various}} NaCl levels on <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> content of trace elements, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{seedlings}} of five citrus species namely: Bakraei (Citrus reteculata X C. limetta), Volkamer lemon(C. volkameriana), Sour orange(C. aurantium), Sweet lime (C. limetta) and Mexican lime(C. aurantifolia), were studied in a glasshouse, by a randomized complete block design with factorial arrangement and four replications. One-year old seedlings of each species were grown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pots, containing native soil (pH= 8. 2) and irrigated with water supplemented with 0 (control), 20, 40 and 60 mM NaCl. At {{the end of}} experiment, the amount of Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Cl and B <b>in</b> <b>shoots</b> were determined. <b>The</b> amount of trace elements varied among <b>the</b> species even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control plants (no salt). Salinity had different effects on <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> content of trace elements. Salinity reduced Fe content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> of all species except in Bakraii and sweet lime and increased the amount of Zn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> of all species except <b>in</b> Bakraii. <b>The</b> Mn content was reduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> all species but increased in sour orange. Salinity reduced the amount of Cu <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> of volkamerina but had no effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other species.

5|$|At 3:30p.m., the Kaštela TG {{turned around}} {{once more to}} attack Cape Lovište, but were engaged by nearby coastal {{artillery}} located on Korčula.

Iž sustained heavy damage and ran aground in Torac Bay off Hvar, and was abandoned. Olib sank between Pelješac and Hvar. Her crew was rescued by the remaining vessels in the group. At 7:00p.m., the fleet sailed south from Šćedro towards {{the western part of}} Korčula, seeking shelter as the Sirocco wind strengthened. As the ships approached Korčula, they were fired upon by coastal artillery at Črna Luka and Cape Privala, forcing them to turn west towards Vis. The Vis TG did not engage Croatian positions on 16 November.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the {{movement}} {{began with the}} use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin. Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for its street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans: Michael Brown, resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson, and Eric Garner in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in {{the movement}} have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election. The originators of the hashtag and call to action, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives Matter movement, however, is a decentralized network and has no formal hierarchy.|$|E

On the same day, Wyatt {{sent a message to}} Ike Clanton that he wanted to reconcile their differences, which Clanton refused. Clanton was also acquitted that day of the charges against him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> of Virgil Earp, when the defense brought in seven witnesses who testified that Clanton was in Charleston {{at the time of the}} shooting.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E
5|$|Musker and Clements {{created the}} Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though Katzenberg {{suggested}} actors such as John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy, Williams was approached and eventually accepted the role. Williams came for voice recording sessions during breaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> {{of two other}} films he was starring in at the time, Hook and Toys. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match.|$|E

Contrary to normal shooting schedules, the team had to work fast before the sun came up, since they were portraying a party at night. Following the choreography, every person on set had cues about their position and where their part would come <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting.</b> A number of designers contributed clothing for the singer to wear, including Moschino, Discount Universe, SSUR, Chanel, Majesty Black and shoes by Giuseppe Zanotti.
