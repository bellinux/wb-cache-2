50|$|Traditionally, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean {{are written}} {{vertically}} in columns going {{from top to}} bottom and ordered from right to left, with each new column starting {{to the left of the}} preceding one.

In addition, writing in vertical columns from right to left facilitated writing with a brush in the right hand while continually unrolling the sheet of paper or scroll with the left. Since the nineteenth century, it has become increasingly common for these languages to be written horizontally, from left to right, with successive rows going {{from top to bottom}}, under the influence of European languages such as English, although vertical writing is still frequently used in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.|$|E

David utilized one of Michael Caine's lines in the film, [...] "What's it all about?" [...] as the opening phrase for the song's lyrics. When completed these were set to music by Bacharach.

Specifically, our robot performed scribbling behaviors with different objects on different surfaces and monitored which objects leave marks on which surfaces. The frequency with which marks were detected was used by the robot to group the writing instruments and the writable surfaces into meaningful categories, which capture their functional properties from the robot’s point of view.
