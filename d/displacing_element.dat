40|$|ABSTRACT: A large {{literature}} {{has been devoted}} to the distribution of re-duced forms of English auxiliary verbs, apparently just weak forms of the corresponding full auxiliaries. Limitations on their distribution appear to involve syntactic conditions, such as that they not occur in positions imme-diately followed by the trace of a <b>displaced</b> <b>element,</b> which would put these elements in a class apart from purely phonological (“simple”) clitics. I ar-gue that the simple clitic account is correct, and that the apparent syntactic conditions on the appearance of contracted auxiliaries derive from prosodic structure, combined with regular phonological processes that adjust it.

40|$|In this paper, we {{establish}} a methodology for modeling relative motion between heliocentric displaced orbits by utilizing the Cartesian state variables {{in combination with}} a set of <b>displaced</b> orbital <b>elements.</b> Similar to classical Keplerian orbital elements, the newly defined set of <b>displaced</b> orbital <b>elements</b> has a clear physical meaning and provides an alternative approach to obtain a closed-form solution to the relative motion problem between displaced orbits, without linearizing or solving nonlinear equations. The invariant manifold of relative motion between two arbitrary displaced orbits is determined by coordinate transformations, obtaining a straightforward interpretation of the bounds, namely maximum and minimum relative distance of three directional components. The extreme values of these bounds are then calculated from an analytical viewpoint, both for quasi-periodic orbits in the incommensurable case and periodic orbits in the 1 : 1 commensurable case. Moreover, in some degenerate cases, the extreme values of relative distance bounds can also be solved analytically. For each case, simulation examples are discussed to validate the correctness of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic slope-to-basin facies {{continental}} margin strata underlie area 700 x 200 km across central Yukon Territory, Canada, and collectively define the Selwyn Basin. In a Cordilleran framework, Selwyn Basin strata form a strongly deformed and thrust-faulted package located between the Mackenzie foreland fold-and-thrust belt, and accreted terranes and <b>displaced</b> <b>elements</b> {{of the ancient}} North American {{continental margin}}. Orogeny commenced in the Jurassic as exotic elements of the composite Yukon-Tanana terrane overrode the ancient continental margin. Collision-related deformation had ceased by ca. 100 Ma, and {{was followed by a}} Late Cretaceous (post– 85 Ma) dextral transcurrent regime, which laterally <b>displaced</b> <b>elements</b> of the newly assembled continental margin along the orogen-parallel Tintina fault. In western Selwyn Basin, more than 100 km of structural overlap was accommodated on two main detachments, the Robert Service and underlying Tombstone thrust faults. Internal deformation within the thrust sheets is intense, characterized by shear-related folds and fabrics. Metamorphic grade reaches lower to middle greenschist facies at the deepest structural levels exposed, and is characterized by chlorite-muscovite schists. The onset of deformation is constrained by the Late Jurassic age of the youngest units deformed during orogeny. The end of ductile deformation is constrained by new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages for metamorphic muscovite that range from 104 to 100 Ma. Due to the low metamorphic grade, these ages are interpreted to closely follow the waning of deformation. At ca. 93 ± 3 Ma, isolated granitic intrusions of the Tombstone-Tungsten magmatic belt were emplaced across the western Selwyn Basin in a tensional, postcollisional regime. Restoration of displacement on the Tintina fault places the western Selwyn Basin adjacent to the Yukon-Tanana terrane uplands of east-central Alaska in the Early to mid-Cretaceous. Despite their adjacent positioning in cross-orogen section during orogenesis, the two elements feature some significant differences in Jurassic-Cretaceous deformation. Most notably, the Yukon-Tanana terrane uplands record a significant extensional event at 120 – 105 Ma, which resulted in NW-SE–oriented extension, exhumation of deep structural levels, and voluminous felsic plutonism. In contrast, western Selwyn Basin did not undergo equivalent uplift and extension, and features temporally and spatially restricted plutonism. Within an orogenic framework, the Yukon-Tanana terrane uplands can therefore be considered to represent an exhumed core characterized by high heat flow, whereas the western Selwyn Basin represents an immediate northeastern salient to the exhumed core. These differences have important implications for the geodynamic setting of mid-Cretaceous plutonism across these two major lithologic-tectonic entities of the northern Cordillera. ...|$|R
2500|$|... g modes are {{standing}} internal gravity waves whose principal restoring force is negative buoyancy of vertically displaced material, {{hence the name}} [...] "g mode". They are of relatively low frequency (0-0.4 mHz). They are confined either to {{the interior of the}} sun below the convection zone (the inner 70 per cent by radius), or to the atmosphere. [...] Because they cannot propagate through convectively unstable regions (in which the temperature gradient exceeds the adiabatic lapse rate, buoyancy is positive and the force on a <b>displaced</b> <b>element</b> of fluid is not restoring), the former are practically unobservable at the surface. The g modes are said to be evanescent in the convection zone, and are thought to have residual velocity amplitudes of only millimeters per second at the photosphere, though perhaps they are more prominent as temperature perturbations. Since the 1980s, there have been several claims of g-mode detection, including one claimed in 2007 using the GOLF data.

5000|$|To be more specific, {{there has}} been {{convergence}} in word order, level of agglutination, and incorporation of Spanish grammatical particles and discourse markers in Nahuatl speech. For instance, whereas Nahuatl had an adjective-noun word order Mexicano follows Spanish in its noun-adjective word order (Flores Farfán, 2004). This {{may be due to}} the borrowing of phrases from Spanish incorporating the Spanish particle de, in phrases of the form NOUN + de + ADJ, e.g. aretes de oro meaning ‘gold earrings’ (Hill & Hill, 1986, 239). Furthermore, the incorporation of de in Nahuatl may have also influenced a parallel shift from modifier-head to head-modifier in possessive constructions. That is, Classical Nahuatl had a possessor-possessum/noun-genitive order, but infiltration of the Spanish particle de may have also driven the shift to possessum-possessor/genitive-noun order. Whereas previously possessive noun clauses in the Nahuatl were markedly introduced by an inflected possessum plus and adjunctor in and a possessor, or unmarkedly simply by an possessor and inflected possessum (that is, the in particle was inserted in front of the <b>displaced</b> <b>element</b> of a marked word order), Nahuatl speakers have analyzed the loan de as functioning in a parallel fashion to native in, and used it to create unmarked possessum/possessor constructions in the manner of Spanish, without genitive inflections.|$|R

Alternately in the sonar environment, an array of diversely oriented velocity-hydrophones can exploit DOA information embedded in the acoustic particle velocity vector-field, in addition to the scalar pressure field. Array aperture extension using sparse array configurations enhances direction-finding (DF) accuracy and resolution capabilities without undue increase in hardware and software costs. The main part of this presentation involves the use of electromagnetic vector-sensors, each of which is composed of six spatially co-located, orthogonally oriented, diversely polarized antennas, distinctly measuring all six electromagnetic-field components of an incident multi-source wave-field. The pivotal insight is that the DOA 2 ̆ 7 s may be estimated from the Poynting-vector estimates obtainable from each vector-sensor 2 ̆ 7 s steering vector. This vector-sensor based DF provides DOA estimates independent of the traditional estimation based on the phase shifts between the sensor-array 2 ̆ 7 s spatially <b>displaced</b> <b>elements</b> as in interferometry. ^ These two separate approaches to DOA estimation allow: (1) extension of intervector-sensor spacing in a uniform array geometry beyond the Nyquist half-wavelength maximum in a closed-form ESPRIT-based DF algorithm, while disambiguating the resultant cyclic ambiguity using the Poynting-vector DOA estimates as coarse references, (2) derivation of coarse DOA estimates to initiate a MUSIC-based iterative search algorithm for any irregularly spaced array of vector-sensors, (3) closed-form DF using only one vector-sensor under certain signal scenarios, (4) closed-form DF using any array of sonar vector-sensors at unknown and arbitrary locations.
