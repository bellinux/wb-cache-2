Dynamic <b>impedance</b> mod-ulation {{is found to}} be the most energy-efficient mechanism for transmit pre-emphasis, when compared with impedance-main-taining current and voltage-mode drivers.

50|$|The {{bones in}} the middle ear provide {{impedance}} matching between the eardrum (which is acted upon by vibrations in air) and the fluid-filled inner ear. Horns are used like transformers, matching the impedance of the transducer to the impedance of the air. This principle is used in both horn loudspeakers and musical instruments. Most loudspeaker systems contain impedance matching mechanisms, especially for low frequencies. Because most <b>driver</b> <b>impedances</b> which are poorly matched to the impedance of free air at low frequencies (and because of out-of-phase cancellations between output from {{the front and rear}} of a speaker cone), loudspeaker enclosures both match impedances and prevent interference. Sound, coupling with air, from a loudspeaker is related to the ratio of the diameter of the speaker to the wavelength of the sound being reproduced. That is, larger speakers can produce lower frequencies at a higher level than smaller speakers for this reason. Elliptical speakers are a complex case, acting like large speakers lengthwise and small speakers crosswise. Acoustic impedance matching (or the lack of it) affects the operation of a megaphone, an echo and soundproofing.|$|R

40|$|To control reflections, the {{impedance}} {{of integrated}} circuit output pad drivers must be matched to {{the impedance of}} the transmission lines to which the pads are connected. HP’s HSTL (high-speed transceiver logic) controlled impedance I/O pads use an on-chip impedance matching network that compensates for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Transmission line reflections {{are one of the}} major factors limiting high-speed I/O performance. These reflections can be controlled by matching the <b>driver</b> output <b>impedance</b> to that of the transmission line. Traditional solutions require the use of off-chip components to implement matching termination networks. This adversely impacts board density, reliability, and cost. Integration of the termination network on-chip removes these negative attributes while providing additional advantages. In this paper, we review a solution for an on-chip impedance matching network. Our HSTL (high-speed transceiver logic) family of controlled impedance I/O pads includes single-ended and differential drivers and receivers, along with com-pensation circuitry for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Mea-sured HSTL signal integrity in a large, complex board environment is presented. Parallel versus Series Termination When I/O signal integrity and speed are of utmost importance, many pad designers turn to parallel termination networks. Parallel termination eliminates transmission line reflections. However, parallel termination exacts a costly toll on power dissipation because a dc component is added to power consumption. An alternative termination approach is source series termination. In a point-to-point environment, series termination provides an output driver with a means to absorb incident waves, effectively damping any reflections in the transmission line. Matching a <b>driver’s</b> output <b>impedance</b> to that of the board impedance increases signal integrity and speed while keeping power dissipation to a minimum...|$|R

5000|$|The RMII {{signals are}} treated as lumped signals rather than {{transmission}} lines; no termination or controlled impedance is necessary; output drive (and thus slew rates) need to be as slow as possible (rise times from 1-5 ns) to permit this.

The ratio c = b/a, of outer to inner radii; and the operating voltage V 0 are kept constant. E 0 is varied by changing the capacitance C 0. These numerical experiments were investigated on argon plasma focus at different opera-tional gas pressures (0. 41, 0. 75, 1, 1. 5, 2. 5 and 3 Torr) for two different values of static inductance L 0 (270 and 10 nH). Scaling laws on argon soft X-Ray yield, in terms of storage energies E 0, peak discharge current Ipeak and focus pinch current Ipinch were found. It {{was found that the}} argon X-ray yields scale well with Ysxr 8 1011 I 4 : 12 pinch for the high inductance (270 nH) and Ysxr 7 1013 I 4 : 94 pinch for the low inductance (10 nH), (where yields are in joules and current in kilo amperes). While the soft X-ray yield scaling laws in terms of storage energies were found to be as Ysxr 0 : 05 E 0 : 940 at energies in the 1 – 100 kJ region. The scaling ‘drops ’ as E 0 is increased, and Ysxr scales as Ysxr 1 : 01 E 0 : 330 at high energies towards 1 MJ for 10 nH at argon gas pressure of 1 Torr.

40|$|The ever-growing {{demands for}} {{high-bandwidth}} data transfer {{have been pushing}} towards advancing research efforts {{in the field of}} high-performing communication systems. Studies on the performance of single chip, e. g. faster multi-core processors and higher system memory capacity, have been explored. To further enhance the system performance, researches have been focused on the improvement of data-transfer bandwidth for chip-to-chip communication in the high-speed serial link. Many solutions have been addressed to overcome the bottleneck caused by the non-idealties such as bandwidth-limited electrical channel that connects two link devices and varieties of undesired noise in the communication systems. Nevertheless, with these solutions data have run into limitations of the timing margins for high-speed interfaces running at multiple gigabits per second data rates on low-cost Printed Circuit Board (PCB) material with constrained power budget. Therefore, the challenge in designing a physical layer (PHY) link for high-speed communication systems turns out to be power-efficient, reliable and cost-effective. In this context, this dissertation is intended to focus on architectural design, system-level and circuit-level verification of a PHY link as well as system performance optimization in respective of power, reliability and adaptability in high-speed communication systems. The PHY is mainly composed of clock data recovery (CDR), equalizers (EQs) and high- speed I/O drivers. Symmetrical structure of the PHY link is usually duplicated in both link devices for bidirectional data transmission. By introducing training mechanisms into high-speed communication systems, the timing in one link device is adaptively aligned to the timing condition specified in the other link device despite of different skews or induced jitter resulting from process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations in the individual link. With reliable timing relationships among the interface signals provided, the total system bandwidth is dramatically improved. On the other hand, interface training offers high flexibility for reuse without further investigation on high demanding components involved in high costs. In the training mode, a CDR module is essential for reconstructing the transmitted bitstream to achieve the best data eye and to detect the edges of data stream in asynchronous systems or source-synchronous systems. Generally, the CDR works as a feedback control system that aligns its output clock {{to the center of the}} received data. In systems that contain multiple data links, the overall CDR power consumption increases linearly with the increase in number of links as one CDR is required for each link. Therefore, a power-efficient CDR plays a significant role in such systems with parallel links. Furthermore, a high performance CDR requires low jitter generation in spite of high input jitter. To minimize the trade-off between power consumption and CDR jitter, a novel CDR architecture is proposed by utilizing the proportional-integral (PI) controller and three times sampling scheme. Meanwhile, signal integrity (SI) becomes critical as the data rate exceeds several gigabits per second. Distorted data due to the non-idealties in systems are likely to reduce the signal quality aggressively and result in intolerable transmission errors in worst case scenarios, thus affect the system effective bandwidth. Hence, additional trainings such as transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) EQ trainings for SI purpose are inserted into the interface training. Besides, a simplified system architecture with unsymmetrical placement of adaptive Rx and Tx EQs in a single link device is proposed and analyzed by using different coefficient adaptation algorithms. This architecture enables to reduce a large number of EQs through the training, especially in case of parallel links. Meanwhile, considerable power and chip area are saved. Finally, high-speed I/O driver against PVT variations is discussed. Critical issues such as overshoot and undershoot interfering with the data are primarily accompanied by impedance mismatch between the I/O driver and its transmitting channel. By applying PVT compensation technique I/O <b>driver</b> <b>impedances</b> can be effectively calibrated close to the target value. Different digital impedance calibration algorithms against PVT variations are implemented and compared for achieving fast calibration and low power requirements...|$|R
