5000|$|Volcanism {{affects the}} {{atmosphere}} in two distinct ways: short-term cooling due to reflected insolation, and long-term warming due to increased CO2 levels. Most of the water vapor and CO2 is collected in clouds {{within a few weeks}} to months because both are already present in large quantities, so the effects are limited (Bodenmann et al. 2011). SO2, along with other aerosols and particulates, is responsible for global cooling, nullifying the effects of the greenhouse gas emissions due to its ability to be <b>found</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere and its efficiency at bonding with any water vapor found in the upper [...] "dry" [...] atmosphere. Sulfuric acid is exceptional at blocking solar radiation and it usually takes months to years for it to acquire enough water vapor to fall back to Earth. It has been suggested that a volcanic eruption in 1809 may have previously contributed to a reduction in global temperatures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] - Flow forming is a {{well known}} {{technique}} to produce cartridge case, rocket nose cones, rocket launcher casing etc. for defense industry. As the flow forming is the non linear plastic deformation process, it is required to understand the forces encountered and the strain distributions during the process for the efficient and successful product manufacturing. As it is a non linear plastic deformation process, still the force and strain distribution prediction is quite difficult. So that an attempt is made to predict the forces, stress, strain distributions in the present work, analysis {{has been carried out}} using ABAQUS/Explicit for forward and backward strategies. The work material has been taken as AA 6063 due to its lighter weight, higher formability, ease of availability and versatile applications in aerospace and defense industry. The forces (axial, radial and circumferential) acting during the process have been obtained and reported along with the strain distribution in the length and thickness. It has been found that the axial and radial forces are higher in forward flow forming. The circumferential force is <b>found</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> backward flow forming. Moreover plastic strain distribution along the thickness is <b>found</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> forward flow forming and along length it is <b>found</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> backward flow forming. The study will help to identify suitable strategy before actual production for different material and process conditions...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the slaughter and carcass traits of White and Multicolor Geese varieties reared in Yozgat province. 5 female and 5 male geese at six months old age from each variety were slaughtered and their slaughter and carcass traits were presented. Also, phenotypic correlations between carcass traits were calculated. The differences between the slaughter weight, hot and cold carcass weight, feather, head and foot weights of varieties were found insignificant, while male geese had higher values in terms of these traits. There were no significant differences between varieties and sexes in terms of hot and cold carcass yields and head ratio. Feather and foot ratios were <b>found</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> White geese; whereas, abdominal fat ratio was <b>found</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> Multicolor geese. There were insignificant differences between varieties in terms of carcass part weights, except back weight which was <b>found</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> males. While heart weights of male geese were significantly higher, differences between varieties and sexes in terms of liver and gizzard weight were found insignificant. There were insignificant differences between the carcass parts and edible inner organ ratios of varieties, but breast ratio of females was found higher, while back ratio of males were found higher. Phenotypic correlation coefficients between slaughter weights, carcass weights and hot-cold carcass yields were found significant.
