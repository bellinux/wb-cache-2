50|$|The {{future of}} Saudi Arabian oil is {{complicated}} by the fact that the major Saudi oil fields are extremely old and have been producing oil for decades. Corrosion is becoming a large problem in addition to many other problems that come over time. The result is that most of the easily produced oil is gone from these fields and tapping the rest of the oil <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much more difficult and more expensive. Such increased difficulty and expense may indicate that Saudi Arabian oil fields have already peaked.|$|E

Though unimpressed with the songs lyrics, claiming they [...] "feel more like a logjam of carefully focus-grouped words than anything deeply meaningful", he concluded that [...] "the bottom line is: Light On <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a major hit".|$|E

The first DVD release was on July 7, 2006. The anime series {{was intended to be}} equal to the manga and it was adapted until the 12th tankoubon to avoid filler. According to Junko Koseki (editor of Nana in Shueisha) and Masao Maruyama (president of Madhouse) a second season <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aired once the manga series is finished.|$|E
50|$|Smith {{is furious}} and threatens to ship Yogi to the Siberian Circus, but Boo Boo offers {{to find the}} real Easter Bunny and bring him to the jamboree. Smith states that he stopped believing in the Easter Bunny after he didn't get a {{double-decker}} raspberry-filled dark chocolate egg from him, but happily accepts Boo Boo's offer. Ranger Smith <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferring to Siberia by the commissioner if the jamboree fails. Yogi and Boo Boo seek out the Grand Grizzly in the mountains {{to see if he}} knows anything about the Easter Bunny's whereabouts. The Grand Grizzly instructs Yogi and Boo Boo to seek the big ears in the sky (A grassy hillside {{in the shape of a}} rabbit's head). They reach the mountain, using the park's hot air balloon, only to find that the Easter Bunny has been kidnapped.|$|E
50|$|Carry one.carry allThe National Association of Broadcasters, {{which did}} not return {{requests}} for comment, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unhappy because the FCC plans to allow DirecTV and Dish to down convert broadcasters’ HD signals to a less pristine picture resolution for several years.The satellite giants-which combined serve about 30 million pay-TV subscribers-convinced FCC officials that they lacked the channel capacity to provide every eligible station in HD immediately. They insisted that they needed several years {{to prepare for a}} full HD carriage requirement.HD signals stress capacity because they take up much more bandwidth than digital signal transmitted at lower resolution.The FCC’s HD rules for satellite were far more lenient than the ones originally proposed by FCC chairman Kevin Martin. He started off at full HD carriage in February 2009, coupled with a market-by-market waiver process.Martin scuttled his original plan after DirecTV and Dish Network complained that it was draconian and damaging to their ability to compete with cable.Instead, the FCC decided to give DirecTV and EchoStar until 2013 to carry all stations in HD within any market where they have elected to carry any station's signal in HD format.The “carry one, carry all in HD” principle kicks in when a satellite company starts carrying local signals in HD. DirecTV’s decision to carry local TV signals in HD does not force Dish to do likewise in the same market.|$|E

5000|$|Frontman Steven Wilson {{described}} the album: [...] "Six {{of the songs}} are taken from singles that were released in 1999 and 2000. Sometimes tracks don't make it on to an album first time around not for reasons of quality (or lack of), but perhaps because they just didn't fit onto the album, or {{one member of the}} band wasn't happy with the track. Also perceptions can change and I think we all felt in hindsight that these six tracks deserved to be heard by a wider audience...The remaining 3 tracks we recorded specifically for the album. [...] "Oceans Have No Memory" [...] is a new band recording of a demo that was originally issued on the B-side of the [...] "Piano Lessons" [...] 7 -inch single. [...] "Access Denied" [...] was written and demoed for Lightbulb Sun but no one liked it except me! So I took the opportunity to re-present it to the band for inclusion on Recordings and this time they let me do it. Finally [...] "Buying New Soul" [...] was a song recorded during writing sessions just after Lightbulb Sun was finished. I think if it had been written a couple of months earlier it would have been included on the album. We thought about holding it back for the next album, but in the end we felt that because the next album <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moving into different musical waters it should be released now." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Story of Light is {{the second}} {{installment}} of the Real Illusions trilogy, a [...] "multi-layered melange based on the amplified mental exaggerations of a truth-seeking madman who sees the world through his own distorted perceptions", according to the booklet introduction. In an interview with ClassicRock Revisisted, Vai explained: [...] When I started Real Illusions, which was my last studio record, I {{wanted to do a}} concept record, but I didn’t want {{to do it in the}} conventional way. I wondered what I could do in order to make it different. I wanted it to span a long period of time, as it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one of my life’s greatest works. I wanted to break it up into little pieces and put it out, not in a linear way. If you listen to Real Illusions, then you will just hear a studio album, as you will not be able to put all of the pieces together. If you read the liner notes, then you can start to put little pieces together. The idea is the same with The Story of Light. It is like Real Illusions, as it is a studio album. That said, the songs are all based on characters in the story, but they are not in the right order. The third part of the trilogy, which I will do sometime in the future, will be similar.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{appealing}} aspects of nanoemulsions {{is that they can}} be mass produced using cheap emulsification techniques and the emulsion can hold the carrier fluid's electrical properties while the suspension stability (under specific conditions) can be larger compared to their conventional two phase nanofluid counterparts. One of their major drawbacks is that the heavy use of surfactants to achieve mixture stability leads to hysteresis phenomena in the thermal performance of these fluids. An additional issue-this time to be foreseen from the literature review analysis on nanofluids-is that the stability of the nanoemulsion <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> endangered in high temperature heat transfer as the conventional surfactant chemical composition at those temperatures changes irreversibly (surfactants are destroyed).|$|E
