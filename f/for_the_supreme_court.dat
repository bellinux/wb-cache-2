5|$|States sent Union regiments {{south in}} {{response}} to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, attacked Union troops who were changing trains, and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington. John Merryman, a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, Roger B. Taney, author of the controversial pro-slavery Dred Scott opinion, to issue a writ of habeas corpus, and in June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling.|$|E

25|$|While some {{community}} analysts {{viewed the}} Japanese American inmates merely as research subjects, others opposed the incarceration {{and some of}} the WRA's policies in their reports, although very few made these criticisms public.

Morris Opler did, however, provide a prominent exception, writing two legal briefs challenging the exclusion <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> cases of Gordon Hirabayashi and Fred Korematsu.|$|E
