A canard design is also known to provide good supersonic performance, excellent supersonic and transonic turn performance, and improved short-field landing performance compared to the conventional delta wing design.|$|E

40|$|Early in the Fuels Refabrication and Development (FRAD) program, it was {{recognized}} that safeguards and nonproliferation <b>design</b> <b>criteria</b> {{were needed to}} provide guidance to equipment, process, and facility designers. This need was highlighted by the recent attention given safeguards and proliferation. Because of this heightened concern, {{it was found that}} <b>design</b> <b>criteria</b> that adequately address safeguards and nonproliferation do not now exist. For this reason, a three-day workshop was convened to attempt to collect and organize existing information regarding <b>design</b> <b>criteria.</b> This document is a result of that undertaking and the subsequent efforts required to structure the information. In summary, it was found that domestic and international goals and objectives are reasonably well established.

2500|$|The most {{important}} <b>design</b> <b>criterion</b> for these curves is stopping sight distance. This is the distance a driver can {{see over the}} crest of the curve. If the driver cannot see an obstruction in the roadway, such as a stalled vehicle or an animal, the driver {{may not be able to}} stop the vehicle in time to avoid a crash. The desired stopping sight distance (S) is determined by the speed of traffic on a road. [...] By first finding the stopping sight distance (S) and then solving for the curve length (L) in each of the equations below, the correct curve length can be determined. [...] The proper equation depends on whether the vertical curve is shorter or longer than the available sight distance. Normally, both equations are solved, then the results are compared to the curve length.|$|E

First of all, Researchers made use of literature review and interviews with 31 users to collect important information about key <b>design</b> <b>criteria</b> and guidelines of web interface design, from which a total of 11 major <b>design</b> <b>criteria</b> were identified. After that, a Likert-type 7 point scale was applied to rate 90 website based on 11 <b>design</b> <b>criteria,</b> and 32 subjects were invited to participate in an experiment.

2500|$|The most {{important}} <b>design</b> <b>criterion</b> for these curves is headlight sight distance.

[...] The headlight sight distance (S) is determined by the angle of the headlight and angle of the tangent slope {{at the end of the}} curve. [...] By first finding the headlight sight distance (S) and then solving for the curve length (L) in each of the equations below, the correct curve length can be determined. [...] If the Slength is greater than the headlight sight distance, then this number can be used. [...] If it is smaller, this value cannot be used. [...] Similarly, if the S>L curve length is smaller than the headlight sight distance, then this number can be used. [...] If it is larger, this value cannot be used.|$|E
