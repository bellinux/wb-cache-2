25|$|It {{is presumed}} that Poseidonia harbored {{refugees}} from its mother city, Sybaris, when that city was conquered by Croton in 510 BC. In the early fifth century, Poseidonia's coins adopted the Achaean weight standard and the bull seen on Sybarite coins. A. J.

25|$|Up to 200 {{missiles}} were launched against Iran between 1987 and 1988, killing some 2,000 people. Teheran, Qom and Isfahan became the usual targets. Their poor accuracy, while mostly ineffective {{to conduct a}} major strategic campaign, made of them basically weapons of terror, forcing thousands of refugees out of the main Iranian cities. This exchange of ballistic missiles was indeed known as 'the war of the cities'. The full-scale campaign lasted from 29 February 1988 until April 20, when a truce was agreed by both sides. Iraq, which had been looking <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of compromise gesture from Iran, is largely viewed as the 'winner' by some authors.|$|E
25|$|Graduate {{education}} is a particularly important aspect in BME. While many engineering fields (such as mechanical or electrical engineering) do not need graduate-level training to obtain an entry-level job in their field, the majority of BME positions do prefer or even require them. Since most BME-related professions involve scientific research, such as in pharmaceutical and medical device development, graduate {{education is}} almost a requirement (as undergraduate degrees typically do not involve sufficient research training and experience). This can be either a Masters or Doctoral level degree; while in certain specialties a Ph.D. is notably more common than in others, it is hardly ever the majority (except in academia). In fact, the perceived need <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of graduate credential {{is so strong that}} some undergraduate BME programs will actively discourage students from majoring in BME without an expressed intention to also obtain a master's degree or apply to medical school afterwards.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} {{to complete the}} railway through to Boden sparked interest in Norrbotten {{among the members of}} the Swedish General Staff, and the chief, Axel Rappe, conducted a survey trip to the region in 1887. His report mentioned the changed strategic options due to the railway lines {{on both sides of the}} Gulf and a need <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of fortification in Boden, but he also toned down the earlier thoughts on the Russian interest in the Luleå–Narvik line. Rappe's report directly affected the future stretch of the railway line in Norrbotten. His recommendations, largely based on his and the General Staff's military planning, not to build the line along the coast, or build it all the way to the Swedish-Finnish border at Haparanda were later followed. The subsequent report completed in 1890 by the Neutrality Committee of 1888 (...) with Axel Rappe as one of its memberssuggested that a credible neutrality required an increased defence of the north-eastern border and proposed a budget of 1.3 million Swedish kronor, corresponding in today's money to around US$11 million (as of 2011), for the construction of permanent fortifications in Boden.|$|E
500|$|This {{conceptualisation}} of the Wake as a {{dream is}} a point of contention for some. Harry Burrell, representative of this view, argues that [...] "one of the most overworked ideas is that Finnegans Wake is about a dream. It is not, and there is no dreamer." [...] Burrell argues that the theory is an easy way out for [...] "critics stymied by the difficulty of comprehending the novel and the search <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of understanding of it." [...] The point upon which a number of critics fail to concur with Burrell's argument is its dismissal of the testimony of the book's author on the matter as [...] "misleading... publicity efforts". Parrinder, equally skeptical of the concept of the Wake as a dream, argues that Joyce {{came up with the idea}} of representing his linguistic experiments as a language of the night around 1927 as a means of battling his many critics, further arguing that [...] "since it cannot be said that neologism is a major feature of the dreaming process, such a justification for the language of Finnegans Wake smacks dangerously of expediency." ...|$|E

Michael Piller said that he felt {{that in order to}} be a hero, Picard [...] "should be acting out of a moral and ethical mindset, and stand for principles that are important to mankind". Stewart was later pleased with the film's romantic sub-plot, calling it [...] "charming" [...] and saying that he was [...] "feeling very good about it." [...] He {{thought that the}} film had a lighter tone than previous films, saying, [...] "It shows our crew having a little more fun than we normally see them doing". Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij kiss was cut from {{the final version of the}} film, saying that [...] "It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable to me as I feel the audience were waiting <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant."

500|$|The {{extent of}} Digby's {{knowledge}} of the plot is unknown, but {{in the opinion of}} author Alan Haynes, Digby was shocked by what he heard, and asked what would become of some of their Catholic friends.

[...] None of their friends would be caught in the explosion. [...] He asked if Catesby had spoken of the matter with Garnet, or any other Jesuits; although Catesby was in no doubt that the Jesuits disapproved of any such action, he lied and said that he would not act without their approbation. [...] Catesby then named the other conspirators, and promised Digby that as soon as they reached Gayhurst he would demonstrate that their religion allowed such acts of regicide, thus dissuading the young lord from confessing to Garnet and discovering the Jesuit's opinion of the matter. [...] Catesby told him to rent Coughton Court from the head of the Throckmorton family, so that he would [...] "the better {{to be able to do}} good to the cause [...] ". [...] From there, he was to organise a hunting party (in reality a group of armed men on horseback) and be ready <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of military manoeuvre.

2500|$|France {{followed}} Prussia's lead, {{introducing a}} tunic for their line infantry in 1845. In 1851, the US Army introduced a long type of tunic which {{they called a}} [...] "frock coat".

2500|$|Also {{focusing}} Eisenhower's {{attention on}} the southern drive was concern over the [...] "National redoubt." [...] According to rumor, Hitler's most fanatically loyal troops were preparing to make a lengthy, last-ditch stand in the natural fortresses formed by the rugged alpine mountains of southern Germany and western Austria. If they held out {{for a year or}} more, dissension between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies might give them political leverage <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of favorable peace settlement. In reality, {{by the time of the}} Allied Rhine crossings the Wehrmacht had suffered such severe defeats on both the Eastern and Western Fronts that it could barely manage to mount effective delaying actions, much less muster enough troops to establish a well-organized alpine resistance force. Still, Allied intelligence could not entirely discount the possibility that remnants of the German Army would attempt a suicidal last stand in the Alps. Denying this opportunity became another argument for rethinking the role of the southern drive through Germany.|$|E

2500|$|Due to Polish-Lithuanian tensions, {{the allied}} powers {{withheld}} diplomatic recognition of Lithuania until 1922. Poland {{did not recognize}} independence of Lithuania as Polish leader Józef Piłsudski hoped to revive the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (see the Międzymorze federation) and campaigned <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of Polish–Lithuanian union in the Paris Peace Conference. Poland also {{did not intend to}} make any territorial concessions, justifying its actions not only as part of a military campaign against the Soviets but also as the right of self-determination of local Poles. According to the 1897 Russian census, the disputed city of Vilnius had an ethnic breakdown of 30% Poles, 40% Jews, and 2% Lithuanians; however the percentage of Lithuanians was higher in the surrounding countryside.

The Lithuanians claimed Vilnius as their historical capital and refused any federation with Poland, desiring an independent Lithuanian state.
