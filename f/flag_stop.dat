5|$|Two {{high-level}} island platforms serve {{three of}} the four Northeast Corridor passenger tracks; there is a center passing track, as well as a fifth track on the south side that is only used by CSX and Norfolk Southern freights. Most SEPTA Trenton Line trains and five daily Amtrak trains (two northbound and three southbound) stop at these platforms. Two low-level platforms, a short distance to the west, serve the diverging SEPTA-owned Chestnut Hill West Line. North Philadelphia has been a <b>flag</b> <b>stop</b> on the line since 1993. The station has relatively low inbound boardings; however, it is used by riders from the Chestnut Hill West Line transferring to SEPTA and Amtrak trains to reach jobs in New Jersey and New York.|$|E
5|$|After another {{supermarket}} {{strip to}} the east, a long, gentle divided {{bend in the}} road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY55 comes in from the west. It joins NY22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends {{its name to the}} railroad line. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's Appalachian Trail station. The <b>flag</b> <b>stop</b> allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E

25|$|Langnes was {{established}} as a <b>flag</b> <b>stop</b> in 1928, when the Norwegian State Railways introduced flag stops at {{a large number of}} intersections along the Eastern Østfold Line in order to compete better with bus and truck services.|$|E
25|$|Since special {{arrangements}} {{must be made}} prior to booking trips {{to and from the}} station, it does not appear on many of Amtrak's lists of (active) stations. The station is a conditional <b>flag</b> <b>stop,</b> meaning that the train will only stop if there are passengers ticketed to or from the station and that requires preapproval with reservations several weeks in advance for groups of not less than 20 persons.|$|E
50|$|The PM&M had {{stops at}} Haddonfield, Freeman, Orchard, Springdale, Locust Grove, Cropwell, Marlton, Elmwood Road, Melrose, and Medford. All except Haddonfield, Marlton, and Medford were <b>flag</b> <b>stops.</b>|$|R

25|$|Highway651 {{was assumed}} by the Department of Highways (DHO) {{on the day}} of Canada's Centennial, July1, 1967. At that point in time, Highway101 had not yet been {{completed}} between Wawa and Chapleau, and so the route was connected {{to the rest of the}} province solely by rail. The isolated highway provided access between the community of Missanabie and the <b>flag</b> <b>stop</b> at Dalton, to the south. It was approximately half of the current length of the route.|$|E
25|$|Hafslund Station was {{established}} in 1931, {{with the introduction of}} multiple units on the Eastern Østfold Line. Originally a <b>flag</b> <b>stop,</b> it was situated just east of the bridge. The interchange between the two lines was from 1933 remotely controlled from Sarpsborg Station, as the fist remotely controlled interchange in the country. The Østfold Line was electrified during the late 1930s and early 1940s. The section between Sarpsborg and Halden, and thus the Sarp Bridge, was powered up on 11 November 1940.|$|E
25|$|In 1866, Atherton {{was known}} as Fair Oaks, and was a <b>flag</b> <b>stop</b> on the California Coast Line of the Southern Pacific Railroad between San Francisco and San Jose for the {{convenience}} of the owners of the large estates who lived north of Menlo Park. The entire area was called Menlo Park. It {{had been part of the}} Rancho de las Pulgas that had covered most of the area, which is now southern San Mateo County. There were several attempts to incorporate Fair Oaks, one in 1874 and another in 1911.|$|E
50|$|Rolling Prairie had {{a stop on}} the South Shore Line until 1994, when it {{was closed}} along with several other <b>flag</b> <b>stops</b> with low ridership. The town's {{population}} was close to 500 at the 2000 census.|$|R
50|$|When the Clamdigger {{commuter}} train was revived {{for the last}} time on January 8, 1978, Amtrak added commuter-based <b>flag</b> <b>stops</b> at Groton, Clinton, Madison, Stony Creek, and Branford, in addition to the mainline stations it had served since 1976.|$|R
50|$|Three small {{platforms}} on asphalt crossings {{serve as}} <b>flag</b> <b>stops</b> for MBTA employees only. One platform serves the Fitchburg Line, another the Lowell Line, {{and a third}} the Haverhill Line and Newburyport/Rockport Line (which split a mile north of the CRMF).|$|R
25|$|The NTSB report {{concluded}} that the MARC crew apparently forgot the approach signal aspect of the Kensington color-position signal after making a <b>flag</b> <b>stop</b> at Kensington Station. The MARC train was operating in push mode with the cab control car out front. The Amtrak locomotives were in the crossover {{at the time of}} the collision; the MARC cab control car collided with the lead Amtrak unit, F40PH #255, rupturing its fuel tank and igniting the fire that caused most of the casualties. The second unit was a GE Genesis P40DC #811, a newer unit that has a fuel tank that is shielded in the center of the frame. The official investigation also suggests that the accident might have been prevented if a human-factors analysis had been conducted when modifications to the track signaling system were made in 1992 with the closing of nearby QN tower.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{disjoint}} {{sections of}} South Rolling Road {{that are not}} part of MD 166. The highway begins in the village of St. Denis on a curve at East Street and South Street. South Street leads west and then south to US 1 and East Street provides access to the St. Denis <b>flag</b> <b>stop</b> on MARC's Camden Line. South Rolling Road crosses over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision just west of the train station. The highway makes a right-angle turn east at Railroad Avenue and another right-angle turn north at Cedar Avenue and Arlington Avenue; the latter street provides access to the train station from the north. South Rolling Road meets the western end of Francis Avenue before reaching a dead end adjacent to the I-195I-95 interchange. South Rolling Road begins again {{on the north side of}} the interchange next to the UMBC Training Centers and Tech Incubators. The highway makes a turn at Selford Road just west of that road's crossing of MD 166 and meets the state highway at a pair of carriageways on either side of the park and ride facility.|$|E
500|$|The two {{tracks of}} the Metropolitan Subdivision are {{numbered}} 1 and 2. MARC #286 was on track 2, having made a <b>flag</b> <b>stop</b> at Kensington {{to pick up}} two passengers. The Capitol Limited was also on track 2, having passed a stopped freight train on track 1. Both trains were approaching Georgetown Junction, where the Capitol Limited was to switch to track 1. The signal protecting Georgetown Junction indicated STOP on track 2, which would {{have the effect of}} stopping MARC #286 and permitting the Capitol Limited to change tracks. Before reaching Kensington MARC #286 passed an APPROACH signal. The purpose of that signal was to warn the train's crew that the next signal would be a stop signal and that maximum speed was restricted to [...] For reasons unknown the crew of MARC #286 did not obey this restriction and after departing Kensington the train reached [...] before the crew applied the emergency brakes. The Capitol Limited had reached Georgetown Junction and begun crossing over to track 1. MARC #286 struck the Amtrak train at approximately [...] at 5:39 PM.|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 54. Martin Truex, Jr. {{kicked off}} {{a round of}} green <b>flag</b> <b>stops</b> on lap 89. Harvick pitted from the lead on lap 91 {{and handed it to}} Kyle Larson. He pitted the next lap and the lead cycled to Logano.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 68. The {{second stage}} was only broken up by green <b>flag</b> <b>stops</b> on lap 91, {{which resulted in}} Truex retaining the lead. It ended with him winning the stage and the third caution flew on lap 120 for its completion.|$|R
50|$|On Fridays, {{a special}} midday Northstar Link {{roundtrip}} designated 887F continues to/from downtown Minneapolis, making additional stops at Elk River, Ramsey, Anoka, and Coon Rapids. The northbound trip treats those Northstar stations as <b>flag</b> <b>stops</b> — disembarking passengers must tell the driver at Minneapolis, boarding passengers must call ahead.|$|R
500|$|From laps 81 to 90, pit stops {{were made}} by all the drivers. After Ed Carpenter's stop, one of his wheels came off while he {{attempted}} {{to return to the}} track; he would ultimately finish 15th, eight laps behind. At the end of this series of pit stops under the green flag, Wheldon remained out in front, ahead of Kanaan. By the halfway point of the race, Kanaan had begun to narrow his deficit, which by lap 115 was less than a second. Wheldon, meanwhile, was faced with a mechinical problem—his radio was malfunctioning, preventing him from talking to his pit crew; he later said that he and his team [...] "lost radio contact early on". On lap 122, Kanaan made a pass while coming out of turn two, taking the lead from Wheldon. Soon after, the drivers began their third round of pit stops, and Wheldon took back the lead before Andretti was afflicted with oversteer and crashed into the turn four inside wall on lap 135, bringing out a caution flag. The yellow flag period saw pit stops continue. Castroneves stopped twice on pit lane on top of a prior stop just before the caution; during the second yellow <b>flag</b> <b>stop,</b> he overshot his designated area on pit road, and his car needed to be pushed into position by crew members. With 51 laps left, the caution period ended, and Wheldon slowly built a gap over Kanaan of 1.8834 seconds entering the final 20 laps.|$|E
2500|$|Hølen Station was {{established}} as a <b>flag</b> <b>stop</b> [...] north of the viaduct. It opened on 1931 and was in use until the section of line was closed. The bridge was electrified on 1 September 1930.|$|E
2500|$|Langli Station (...) was {{a railway}} station located at Langli in Ski, Norway. Situated on the Eastern Østfold Line, it was [...] from Oslo Central Station (Oslo S). Established as a <b>flag</b> <b>stop</b> in 1928, it saw limited traffic, with only 15 daily {{boarding}} and disembarking passengers in 2008. It {{consisted of a}} simple wooden side platform and a shed. The station closed on 9 November 2012.|$|E
50|$|Another {{round of}} green <b>flag</b> <b>stops</b> took place with 62 to go. Truex pitted from the lead with 61 to go. Jimmie Johnson pitted from the lead with 60 to go. Logano held the lead for 15 laps before pitting with 45 {{to go and}} Harvick cycled to the lead.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 204. Kyle Busch and Carl Edwards {{kicked off}} {{a cycle of}} green <b>flag</b> <b>stops</b> with 84 laps to go. Brad Keselowski pitted with 83 laps to go and handed the lead to Jimmie Johnson. He pitted the next lap and the lead cycled back to Keselowski.|$|R
50|$|Larson retook {{the lead}} on lap 126. Kyle Busch made an {{unscheduled}} stop for {{what he thought was}} a flat right-front tire on lap 137, only to find out a few laps later the tire wasn't flat. Another round of green <b>flag</b> <b>stops</b> commenced on lap 153 and Larson retained the lead through the cycle.|$|R
