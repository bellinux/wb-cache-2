50|$|In theory {{smartphones}} have {{an advantage}} over hard drives since the OS files are in ROM, and cannot be changed by malware.

50|$|In 2004, {{vulnerabilities}} {{in virtual}} machines running on certain devices <b>were</b> revealed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> bypass the bytecode verifier and access the native underlying operating system. The {{results of this}} research were not published in detail.
