2500|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1946, Morrison appointed Adair Watters [...] {{superintendent of the}} New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) {{in an effort to}} eliminate corruption. But tensions developed when Watters moved to suppress gambling, prostitution, and other vice too zealously for Morrison's liking. Watters resigned in February 1949 because of Morrison's political interference with NOPD activities. Throughout most of the 1950s, scandals continued to be revealed concerning the involvement of the NOPD in graft and vice. [...] In 1952, the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans was established as an independent monitor of the NOPD and the Morrison administration's approach to vice. State Police Colonel Francis Grevemberg, later a two-time gubernatorial candidate, led a series of high-profile raids on New Orleans gambling establishments that embarrassed Morrison and the NOPD for its inactivity. Eventually, retired FBI Agent Aaron M. Kohn was sent from Chicago to investigate NOPD involvement in vice. Kohn later recalled:"After about a year, I began to realize something about the system down <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> <b>Chicago,</b> people were generally {{on one side of the}} fence or the other—honest or crooked. But in Louisiana, there just isn't any fence." [...] He soon complained that Morrison was obstructing his efforts. In 1955, Morrison forced the mayor to ask for Schuering's resignation.|$|E

The Toledo & North Western Railroad (TNW) laid the first tracks through town in 1881-1882. Because Lake City was already established, they built a two-story, frame, combination depot and the southeast edge of town. Because of its convenient location, the TNW also built their repair and maintenance shops in Lake City in the 1880s. [...] They placed their division headquarters <b>here</b> <b>in</b> 1887.

Once acquainted, da Butcher began working on paintings personally meant for Keef. Keef believed that his move to Los Angeles benefited him; {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Keef stated [...] "I got away from all the unnecessary trouble.

He wanted to exhibit his picture--the picture whose very existence he had so carefully guarded--and knew that {{with all of us}} out of the way, afloat upon the Great Lakes, he could come here without our knowledge and enter the picture in the exhibition. It may be he doubted its success--he is diffident in some ways--and thought if it failed none of us at home would be the wiser; but I'm sure that now he has won he will brag and bluster and be very conceited and disagreeable over his triumph. That is the man's nature--to be cowed by failure and bombastic over success. It's singular, come to think it over, how one who has the soul to create a wonderful painting can be so crude and uncultured, so morose and--and--cruel." ...|$|E

I had to undergo a very difficult visit to Los Angeles, California to move my brothers belongings to Chicago. After finally getting all of his personal property settled <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chicago,</b> I manage to get the time to look through some of his items and came across some music tracks that never made the hit charts or just never been heard before. 12 songs became my favorites, and I felted like I must share these tunes with his fans as a special tribute in memories of him. He loved his fans, and I knew his fans loved him. I personally felted that, Jermaine was never really appreciated for his talents and the many people he's helped. For the short period of time, he's touched the hearts of so many. Out of all of his accomplishments, Jermaine Stewart, never received a grammy, and who can forget all those hit tunes. So many to mention and still are played and heard today. Here are some tracks that were not included such as, [...] "Attention" [...] which is the title song on the CD, and its strong message speaks for itself. Also another track titled, [...] "Gone Are Those Days", which brings back memories of yester years {{of all of our}} lives in those hey days of the 70's and 80's.

40|$|It was in 1836 {{that the}} oldest humane society {{currently}} in existence, the Royar Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, {{was founded in}} London. Many others were formed during the nineteenth century, such as the organization I now represent, {{which was founded in}} Chicago in 1899. Above all else, there is one distinguishing feature of this period for me: the movement had what is known in Chicago as clout. In marked contrast to the years following the first World War, humane societies enjoyed support from individuals of wealth, influence, and brains. Let me give some examples: Victoria herself was a patron of that first SPCA before her accession. The first exponent of humane legislation in Parliament was "Humanity Martin, " whose dominions in Galway encompassed 200, 000 acres. From his front door to his gatehouse he had to drive thirty miles. <b>Here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chicago,</b> The Anti-Cruelty Society was formed by the wife of one of the city's most illustrious figures, Theodore Thomas.

We are here to share ideas and to {{speculate}} about what the world might look like if it were challenged, rethought, and rebuilt. We are here to uncover, piece by piece, a sense of our own ambitions for an architecture influenced by today but motivated by tomorrow. We are all speculators and dreamers. We find places for dreaming in our work, our models, our essays, our lectures, our research, and our teaching. Through these activities we speculate on the architecture of tomorrow. Sometimes these speculations hold great promise, while at other times they do not - certainly much of what we do can be improved, refined, qualified, quantified, and genuinely benefit from being computed. This could be horrifying, it could set the scene for an engineered architecture if we do not adapt. But architecture is changing and responding to very fresh and different ways of thinking. As a movement, young architects are questioning their inheritance and establishing new values, new methods, and new forms of practice. We might best think of these young architects as the Generation X of architecture - a generation who shapes discourse through technological, social, and environmental lenses. From its smallest technical process to its highest level of thought, this conference represents the spirit of this movement...|$|E
40|$|Small {{businesses}} are {{the backbone of}} our economy and the lifeblood of our neighborhoods. Yet too often, those businesses don’t know how to navigate local offices and agencies. Cities can and should do more to serve as partners for small businesses. City governments should {{take a look at}} their services through the eyes of small business owners and determine how to improve their experiences. It shouldn’t be difficult to get a business license, and you shouldn’t need to hire a lawyer to guide you through the process, or spend hours waiting to be served at City Hall. When entrepreneurs develop new types of businesses, city regulations should encourage their growth through logical, but not excessive, regulation. Entrepreneurs should have easy access to the tools that will help them succeed. By developing partnerships with lenders in the community, cities can ensure that small businesses have access to the capital they need to open their doors and grow. While cities may not provide business skills education and other support services directly, they should create support networks by empowering community-based or ethnic business organizations to deliver these services. <b>Here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Chicago,</b> my administration has taken several steps to make City Hall a partner to small businesses.
