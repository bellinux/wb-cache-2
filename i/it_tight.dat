25|$|After 25 overs, England were 65 for 5, but the Australian spinners didn't get {{too much}} out of the track. Dot-balls flourished, but the {{partnership}} kept in there, and a second six – from Jones off Hogg – showed their intent. After 35 overs, England were 113 for 5, and required a run a ball, with four overs of Lee and three of McGrath still to negotiate. However, England kept pushing, never letting the run-rate get above 7. Skipper Ponting showed some desperation when he brought Michael Hussey on with nine overs to spare, knowing that the spinners couldn't keep <b>it</b> <b>tight,</b> but got his reward in Hussey's second over when Collingwood was run out for 53 – off 116 balls.|$|E
500|$|Wenger {{has been}} able to {{implement}} his entertaining vision of football, particularly at Arsenal. His team's 5–1 win against Portsmouth in March 2004 was likened to [...] "the magnificently fluid Ajax of the early 70s", and greeted with a standing ovation by the opposition supporters, as the Arsenal players left the field. Wenger's style of play, however, been criticised for inefficiency and a lack of variation to go with technique. He is not renowned for making game-changing substitutions, nor has his tactics helped his teams overcome flexible opponents. His ideals are noticeably different from the pragmatic approach of his rivals, though he has assembled teams to produce disciplined performances, markedly the 2005 FA Cup Final against Manchester United. Defeats in the big games during 2013–14 led to Wenger compromising his attack-minded principles in favour of keeping <b>it</b> <b>tight.</b> The team's approach has been less predictable than when it was built around Fàbregas, with the initial predictability allowing Sir Alex Ferguson to devise a template to beat Arsenal, which involved [...] "good players who can intercept".|$|E
500|$|The Canadians reorganised and on 14 August they {{launched}} Operation Tractable; {{three days later}} Falaise fell. The Allied noose was relentlessly closing around von Kluge's force, and it fell to the 1st Polish Armoured Division to draw <b>it</b> <b>tight.</b> In a meeting with his divisional commanders on 19 August, Simonds emphasised the importance of quickly closing the Falaise Pocket to General Stanisław Maczek. Assigned responsibility for the Moissy–Chambois–Coudehard area, Maczek's 1st Polish Armoured Division had split into three battlegroups—each of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion—and were sweeping the countryside north of Chambois. However, facing stiff German resistance and with Koszutski's battlegroup having [...] "gone astray" [...] and needing to be rescued, the division had not yet taken Chambois, Coudehard, or the Mont Ormel ridge. Galvanised by Simonds, Maczek was determined to get his men onto their objectives as soon as possible. The 10th Dragoons (10th Polish Motorised infantry Battalion) and 10th Polish Mounted Rifle Regiment (the division's armoured reconnaissance regiment) drove hard on Chambois, the capture of which would effect a link-up with the United States 90th Infantry Division who were simultaneously attacking the town from the south. Having taken Trun and Champeaux the 4th Canadian Armoured Division was able to assist, and by the evening of 19 August the town was in Allied hands.|$|E

2500|$|... "Through-holed and wedged" [...] {{is one of}} {{the primary}} means of joining Windsor chair parts. A {{cylindrical}} or slightly tapered hole is bored in the first piece, the matching cylindrical or tapered end of the second piece is inserted in the hole as a round tenon, and a wedge is driven into the end of this tenon, flaring <b>it</b> <b>tight</b> in the hole. The excess portion of the wedge is then cut flush with the surface. This supplies a mechanical hold that will prevail when the glue fails. In general, early Windsor chair joints are held together mechanically, making glue a redundant detail in their assembly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} wrestling masks {{were often}} masks {{attached to a}} top that snapped in the groin making it very uncomfortable for the people wearing it. If the masks were not attached to the top, then they were made from uncomfortable material such as brushed pig skin, leather or suede. It wasn't until a Mexican shoe maker called Antonio Martinez created a mask on request from Charro Aguayo that would become the standard for wrestling masks created since then. The basic design has not changed much over the years, consisting of four pieces of fabric sewn together to create the basic shape that covers the entire head. The mask has openings for the eyes, nose and mouth with colorful trim around the open features, this trim is known as [...] "Antifaz" [...] in Spanish. The back of the mask is open with a [...] "tongue" [...] of fabric under laces to keep <b>it</b> <b>tight</b> enough to not come off accidentally during a match. The first variation in style came when the jaw and mouth area {{was removed from the}} mask to expose the skin. [...] Other masks have solid material over the mouth, nose, eyes or all three, in the case of fabric covering the eyes a stretched fabric that is see through up-close is used.|$|E
