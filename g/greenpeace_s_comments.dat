Toward development of content quality measurement based on emotional comments, they investigate co-relation between emotional comments and popularity measures such as number of replay and bookmark.

40|$|On 12 May 1857, Edward Sieveking read a {{paper on}} {{epilepsy}} to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in London. During the discussion that followed Sir Charles Locock, obstetrician to Queen Victoria, {{was reported to have}} commented that during the past 14 months he had used potassium bromide to successfully stop epileptic seizures in all but one of 14 or 15 women with 2 ̆ 7 hysterical 2 ̆ 7 or catamenial epilepsy. This report of Locock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comment</b> has generally given him credit for introducing the first reasonably effective antiepileptic drug into medical practice. However examination of the original reports raises questions as to how soundly based the accounts of Locock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comments</b> were. Subsequently, others using the drug to treat epilepsy failed to obtain the degree of benefit that the reports of Locock 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comments</b> would have led them to expect. The drug might not have come into more widespread use as a result, had not Samuel Wilks provided good, independent evidence for the drug 2 ̆ 7 s antiepileptic efficacy in 1861...|$|R
40|$|Dr Barrett 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comments</b> on {{our recent}} report on Poverty and the Social Welfare System in Ireland (1988) provide a welcome {{opportunity}} {{to deal with}} some of the points which have been raised in reaction to that report. While some important issues are involved, his comments do not show a clear understanding of them and are for the most part misplaced. We will attempt to clarify the issues raised in Barrett 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comments</b> under five headings. 1. Methodology of Poverty Measurement. 2. Equivalence Scales. 3. Income Concept and the Role of Non-cash Benefits. 4. Reliability of the Data. 5. Policy Relevance of the Report. While some important issues are raised, the main thrust of Barrett 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comments</b> is quite misplaced. The poverty line methodology he criticises is the one widely employed by economists in all developed countries; his attack on the reliability of the income distribution is based on inappropriate evidence; his assessment of the effects of including non-cash benefits is severely flawed, and he confuses measurement of the overall redistributive impact of state policy and measurement of poverty...|$|R

40|$|Historically, {{the most}} {{powerful}} political and organizational leaders {{have been described as}} being charismatic. With technology 2 ̆ 7 s increasing impact on society, these leaders have widespread access to the masses. Utilizing charismatic leadership and media saliency theories, this study aims to analyze the impact that occurred in the Las Vegas convention industry after the President made specific comments concerning Las Vegas. These comments implied that convention spending in Las Vegas was wasteful, and resulted in the cancellation or relocation of over 400 conventions in one week. This research utilizes monthly, aggregate convention data from January 2002 to March 2014 to evaluate the impact of this comment empirically. Time series regression analysis was conducted to estimate the effect of President Obama 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comment,</b> controlling for other factors. The results suggest that President Obama 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comments</b> had a significant negative effect on both convention attendance and the number of meetings held.

40|$|There is {{a tsunami}} of {{literature}} {{on the need to}} demonstrate the value of libraries, and what to measure to achieve that goal. The driving force behind the production and consumption of this literature is the growing consciousness {{of the impact of the}} digital age on the library business model. While this is not a book about the strategic directions libraries should take, the journalist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comments</b> do raise two issues that are absolutely critical to turning the content of this book into something useful for your library or organization. The first is that even though the journalist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>comments</b> could be written off as glib and sar­ castic, and it is quite possible some librarians would find those comments offensive, they do carry a kernel of truth.
