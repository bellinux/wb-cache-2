25|$|A fitness {{landscape}} is {{a representation of}} the fitness where all genotypes are arranged in 2D space and the fitness of each genotype is represented by height on a surface.

25|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} is {{the capacity}} of a single <b>genotype</b> <b>to</b> exhibit a range of phenotypes in response to variation in the environment. For example, in Nemoria arizonaria caterpillars, the cryptic pattern changes according to season and is triggered by dietary cues. In the spring, the first brood of caterpillars resembles oak catkins, or flowers. By the summer when the catkins have fallen, the caterpillars discreetly mimic oak twigs. No intermediate forms are present in this species, although {{other members of the}} Nemoria genus, such as N. darwiniata, do exhibit transitional forms.|$|E
2500|$|Fitness {{is often}} {{defined as a}} {{propensity}} or probability, rather than {{the actual number of}} offspring. For example, according to Maynard Smith, [...] "Fitness is a property, not of an individual, but of a class of individuals — for example homozygous for allele A at a particular locus. Thus the phrase ’expected number of offspring’ means the average number, not the number produced by some one individual.

2500|$|The last {{clause of}} this law {{introduces}} {{what is now called}} soft inheritance, the inheritance of acquired characteristics, or simply [...] "Lamarckism", though it forms only a part of Lamarck's thinking. [...] "The second law was widely accepted at the time.. has been decisively rejected by modern genetics." [...] However, in the field of epigenetics, there is growing evidence that soft inheritance plays a part in the changing of some organisms' phenotypes: it leaves the genetic material (DNA) unaltered (thus not violating the central dogma of biology) but prevents the expression of genes, such as by methylation to modify DNA transcription; this can be produced by changes in behaviour and environment. Many epigenetic changes are heritable to a degree. Thus, while DNA itself is not directly altered by the environment and behavior except through selection, the relationship of the <b>genotype</b> <b>to</b> the phenotype can be altered, even across generations, by experience within the lifetime of an individual. This has led to calls for biology to reconsider Lamarckian processes in evolution in light of modern advances in molecular biology.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "genome size" [...] {{is often}} erroneously {{attributed}} to Hinegardner, even in discussions dealing specifically with terminology {{in this area}} of research (e.g., Greilhuber, 2005). Notably, Hinegardner used the term only once: in the title. The term actually seems to have first appeared in 1968 when Hinegardner wondered, in the last paragraph of his article, whether [...] "cellular DNA content does, in fact, reflect genome size". In this context, [...] "genome size" [...] was being used in the sense of <b>genotype</b> <b>to</b> mean the number of genes. In a paper submitted only two months later (in February 1969), Wolf et al. (1969) used the term [...] "genome size" [...] throughout and in its present usage; therefore these authors should probably be credited with originating the term in its modern sense. [...] By the early 1970s, [...] "genome size" [...] was in common usage with its present definition, probably {{as a result of its}} inclusion in Susumu Ohno's influential book Evolution by Gene Duplication, published in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Flexibility {{stems from}} {{phenotypic}} plasticity, {{the ability of}} an organism with a given <b>genotype</b> <b>to</b> change its phenotype in response to changes in its habitat, or {{to move to a}} different habitat. The degree of flexibility is inherited, and varies between individuals. A highly specialized animal or plant lives only in a well-defined habitat, eats a specific type of food, and cannot survive if its needs are not met. Many herbivores are like this; extreme examples are koalas which depend on Eucalyptus, and giant pandas which require bamboo. A generalist, on the other hand, eats a range of food, and can survive in many different conditions. Examples are humans, rats, crabs and many carnivores. The tendency to behave in a specialized or exploratory manner is inherited—it is an adaptation. Rather different is developmental flexibility: [...] "An animal or plant is developmentally flexible if when it is raised in or transferred to new conditions, it changes in structure so that it is better fitted to survive in the new environment," [...] writes evolutionary biologist John Maynard Smith.|$|E

2500|$|Pharmacogenomics aims {{to develop}} {{rational}} means to optimize drug therapy, {{with respect to}} the patients' <b>genotype,</b> <b>to</b> ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects. [...] Through the utilization of pharmacogenomics, it is hoped that pharmaceutical drug treatments can deviate from what is dubbed as the [...] "one-dose-fits-all" [...] approach. Pharmacogenomics also attempts to eliminate the trial-and-error method of prescribing, allowing physicians to take into consideration their patient's genes, the functionality of these genes, and how this may affect the efficacy of the patient's current or future treatments (and where applicable, provide an explanation for the failure of past treatments). Such approaches promise the advent of precision medicine and even personalized medicine, in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for narrow subsets of patients or even for each individual's unique genetic makeup. Whether used to explain a patient's response or lack thereof to a treatment, or act as a predictive tool, it hopes to achieve better treatment outcomes, greater efficacy, minimization of the occurrence of drug toxicities and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). For patients who have lack of therapeutic response to a treatment, alternative therapies can be prescribed that would best suit their requirements. In order to provide pharmacogenomic recommendations for a given drug, two possible types of input can be used: genotyping or exome or whole genome sequencing. Sequencing provides many more data points, including detection of mutations that prematurely terminate the synthesized protein (early stop codon).|$|E

The yields and resistance stability of these genotypes, however, remain uncertain. The performance of 13 genotypes over 10 different RYMV isolates from 7 localities in Cote d`Ivoire was tested in the screenhouse.
