50|$|Wills Rings are {{expensive}} {{in comparison to}} other seals, such as elastomer O-rings or metallic foil head gaskets. A typical comparison is one ring costing approx. $50 each, around {{the price of a}} high-performance head <b>gasket</b> <b>for</b> a four-cylinder engine.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{shielding}} performance or shielding effectiveness of <b>gaskets</b> <b>for</b> on-board applications when determined {{with either a}} stripline method or a reverberation room method. The shielding performance is considered in the frequency range from 1 up to 40 Ghz. Similar to PCB-level enclosures, <b>gaskets</b> <b>for</b> on-board applications differ significantly from other shielding products, therefore requiring an appropriate definition for their shielding effectiveness. It is shown by full-wave simulations that a 3 rd order polynomial fit of the shielding effectiveness obtained with the stripline method correlates well with the shielding effectiveness obtained with a reverberation room method, {{in which case the}} shielding effectiveness is defined as the ratio between the radiated/received power with and without gasket. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The revised Submarine Rescue Chamber had {{improvements}} {{including a}} soft seal <b>gasket</b> <b>for</b> sealing the submarine/bell interface skirting, and a floor installed to maintain air-space in the bell during raising and lowering.

50|$|In 1945, Pawling Rubber Corporation, a small rubber {{extrusion}} business with fifteen employees opened in Pawling, New York, to make <b>gaskets</b> <b>for</b> military ammunition cases. After World War II, the company diversified into plastics processing. In the mid-50s, Pawling Rubber Corporation entered into two alliances: it acquired Presray Corporation, which {{had developed a}} line of inflatable grippers to handle fragile unfired grinding wheels, and formed an extrusion licensing agreement with the French firm FLT.|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} <b>gasket</b> type <b>for</b> flanged {{connections}} has typically been determined {{on the basis}} of temperature, pressure, and chemical nature of the contained fluid; sealability; ease of handling and installation; expected service life; comparable cost; and other factors. Of ever increasing importance is the environmental performance of the selected gasket with an emphasis on fugitive emissions reduction. All gaskets have some level of fluid leakage but this may vary significantly depending on the type selected. A practical tool using Microsoft ® Excel ® has been developed that can help predict anticipated fugitive emissions of <b>gaskets</b> <b>for</b> which Room Temperature Testing (ROTT) data are available. The construction and application of this tool are described and a relative comparison of tightness parameters and projected fugitive emissions <b>for</b> example <b>gasket</b> types are documented...|$|R
50|$|Mechanically, the Lerma for 1982 {{was almost}} {{the same as in}} 1981.

The standard A998 three-speed automatic transmission got wider gear ratios. The final technical change came in the midyear with a new head design with larger round intake ports, smaller spark plug outlets and a plastic valve cover; making a slightly more powerful engine.|$|R

Also we discuss the energy partition for general p. c. f. fractals, and the relation of it to the uniqueness and stability of a self-similar Dirichlet form. 1...|$|R
50|$|The EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens {{is often}} {{compared}} to the other L series zoom of comparable range, the 24-70mm f/2.8L USM, losing one full stop but gaining image stabilization (IS) in return, stabilizing camera shake up to three stops. It also has rubber <b>gaskets</b> <b>for</b> moisture and dust protection, although weather sealing is only effective if the photographer uses a weather-resistant camera body. Some early production models of the EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens had a flare problem (reportedly the first 10,000 batch) and Canon offered to repair them for free.|$|R
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to {{be overcome}} in the handling of both fluorine and UF6.
