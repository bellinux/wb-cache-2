The state's <b>Industrial</b> <b>Welfare</b> Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E

His stammer, and his embarrassment over it, together with his tendency to shyness, caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis. He played at Wimbledon in the Men's Doubles with Louis Greig in 1926, losing in the first round.

[...] After being chased out of China by the victorious Communists, they had established bases in eastern Burma, and it took several years in the early 1950s to drive them out.

Furthermore, argues that Richardson's work from 1953 to 1972 in the answers it gave to this problem anticipated a number of themes that have only recently acquired prominence in economic theory, specifically in neo-institutionalist thought. The pioneering originality of his work also partly accounts for the relative neglect with which it was originally received. Austria, Co-ordination, Economics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the evolution of}} the supply chain and welfare under economic integration in a three-region framework (one developed and two developing regions), with each region at a different stage of development. Economic integration is measured by the reduction of inter-regional trade costs and by the reduction of communication costs between headquarters and plants of multinational firms. We showed that the increasing number of emerging and developing economies participating in the World economy and their relative competitiveness may considerably change the classic outcomes of the new economic geography. More countries (developed, emerging or developing) may enjoy industry accumulation (or FDIs increase), a periphery being able to become a centre. communication costs, <b>industrial</b> relocation, <b>welfare...</b>|$|R

40|$|In the Spanish {{region of}} Catalonia the {{industrial}} sector sensibly lobbied for the privatization of municipality-produced water services in the period 1996  –  2002. This paper analyzes {{the extent to which}} this result is consequent with observed measures of cross-subsidies in favor of residential consumers. I run a treatment-effects regression on a sample of 133 municipalities in 2000 and 2001. Recent privatization has a positive effect on the weight that the local regulator attaches to <b>industrial</b> users’ <b>welfare</b> when deciding water tariffs. I conclude that an increase of industrial customers’ group size has a twofold effect on the cross-subsidy in favor of residential customers: a direct positive substitution effect and an indirect negative political support effect through lobbying for service privatization. ...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{capitalism}} in Ireland {{took off in}} the late 1950 s and affirmed itself as an inward investment-focused model of development.

Through contextualizing a particular case, my goal is to asses if is possible to attribute the creation of public goods to operations based on the market rules, like Norfund does.
