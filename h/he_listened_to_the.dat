He writes that <b>he</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> John and Ken Show on KFI, and that their discussion of Scientology allowed him to think more critically during his time at the compound. He says that viewing Conan O'Brien make fun of Scientology celebrities changed his views on individuals that the organization had only spoken of internally with reverence.|$|E
25|$|During {{a holiday}} in Killarney, <b>he</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Irish {{broadcaster}} Gerry Ryan on the radio. Evans claims the variety on Ryan's show {{made him want}} to return to radio. Evans was then hired by Virgin Radio to host its breakfast show, prompting an immediate upsurge in station listening figures of 1.8million to 2.6million. His first show was on 13 October 1997, the same day as Kevin Greening and Zoë Ball on Radio 1. Starting at 7:00am, Evans' crew presented the show from Monday to Friday, but without Evans participating on a Friday.|$|E
25|$|Gary Grice {{developed}} {{an interest in}} hip-hop by attending block parties {{as a child in}} the early 1970s. He was involved in breakdance, graffiti, and DJing. Early on he {{developed an}} interest in writing, studying Mother Goose and nursery rhyme. In 1974-76 <b>he</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Last Poets, however he was attracted by profanity rather than content, and didn't understand the underlying messages until many years later. The Last Poets, as well as songs by The Isley Brothers, the Commodores, and the O'Jays had a big part in his early life, especially regarding the tone and cadence of speech. Later on, he began to listen to hip hop and R, for example by Secret Weapon and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.|$|E

In {{the summer of}} 1405 riots swept Rome, driving the Pope from the city in August, stranding Adam and leaving him far from home, separated from patronage and exacerbated by Adam's own dangerous illness, suffered probably as a result. Adam left Rome in June 1406, making his way to Bruges. Here he attended closely to events in Wales and England and again developed his legal work, in France and Flanders this time. <b>He</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plans of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland to overthrow King Henry IV, but adroitly avoided any implication, involvement or commitment to either side.|$|E
25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked at himself in the mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as <b>he</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E

500|$|Irons {{passed on}} the {{invitation}} but gave the demo to his basketball friend, San Diego, California singer Eddie Vedder. Vedder was the lead vocalist for a San Diego band, Bad Radio, and worked part-time at a gas station. <b>He</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. He then recorded the vocals to three of the songs ("Alive", [...] "Once", and [...] "Footsteps") in what he later described as a [...] "mini-opera" [...] entitled Momma-Son. Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} {{prior to}} broadcast was mixed. TVLine Michael Ausiello assessed that the episode would [...] "either be a show-stopping triumph or a spectacular failure," [...] with no possible middle ground. William Keck of TV Guide initially had [...] "serious doubts," [...] which were allayed by {{a visit to}} the set, during which <b>he</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack. Keck likened it to the [...] "much-beloved early seasons of Grey, when music played a vital role on the show." [...] Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson predicted heavy use of Auto Tune, though fellow EW writer Jennifer Armstrong was optimistic that the episode would be a success, commenting: [...] "I have faith. I like musicals, I like Grey. I'm rooting for this to work." ...|$|E
500|$|The intense {{collaboration}} between Dylan and The Hawks {{that produced the}} basement recordings {{came to an end}} in October 1967 when Dylan relocated to Nashville to record a formal studio album, John Wesley Harding, with a different crew of accompanying musicians. The same month, drummer Levon Helm rejoined his former bandmates in Woodstock, after he {{received a phone call from}} Danko informing him that they were getting ready to record as a group. In his autobiography, Helm recalled how <b>he</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recordings The Hawks had made with Dylan, and remembered that he [...] "could tell that hanging out with the boys had helped Bob to find a connection with things we were interested in: blues, rockabilly, R They had rubbed off on him a little." ...|$|E

500|$|Pecheneg troops pillaged Syrmia (now in Serbia) in 1071. As {{the king}} and the duke {{suspected}} that the soldiers of the Byzantine garrison at Belgrade incited the marauders against Hungary, they decided to attack the fortress. The Hungarian army crossed the river Sava, although the Byzantines [...] "blew sulphurous fires by means of machines" [...] against their boats. The Hungarians took Belgrade after a siege of three months. However, the Byzantine commander, Niketas, surrendered the fortress to Duke Géza instead of the king; he knew that Solomon [...] "was a hard man and that in all things <b>he</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vile counsels of Count Vid, who was detestable in the eyes both of God and men", according to the Illuminated Chronicle.|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} {{early morning}} prayers {{at the church}} of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, William Kent and Fanny met Richard Parsons, the officiating clerk. [...] Although he was generally considered respectable, Parsons was known locally as a drunk and was struggling to provide for his family. [...] <b>He</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> couple's plight and was sympathetic, offering them the use of lodgings in his home on Cock Lane, {{to the north of}} St Sepulchre's. [...] Located along a narrow, winding thoroughfare similar to most of central London's streets, the three-storey house was in a respectable but declining area, and comprised a single room on each floor, connected by a winding staircase. Shortly after Mr and Mrs Kent (as they called themselves) moved in, Kent loaned Parsons 12guineas, to be repaid at a rate of a guinea per month.|$|E
500|$|Weezer's self-titled debut album, {{also known}} as the Blue album, was {{released}} in May 1994 and became a commercial success; it was certified gold on December 1 and platinum on January 1, 1995, with sales of over one million. Songwriter Rivers Cuomo wrote that success had [...] "stirred up a lot of mixed feelings in me – 'Yay, I'm happy' as well as 'I'm not sure this is the life I want to lead.'" [...] He had also developed a [...] "huge inferiority complex" [...] about rock music, saying: [...] "I thought my songs were really simplistic and silly, and I wanted to write complex, intense, beautiful music." [...] Touring with Weezer, <b>he</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> operas Aida (1871) and Madama Butterfly (1904), the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), and the musical Les Misérables (1980). Inspired by how these works married music and narrative, he decided to write a rock opera to explore his feelings about relationships, fame, and his life as a touring musician.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack {{contains}} direct musical quotations of some {{classical and}} folk music; the composers also derived a few samples culled {{from other sources}} including commercial pop and rock music. The texture of the work was partially influenced by some salsa, reggae, and dub music. Speaking about Frank Zappa's Make a Jazz Noise Here (1991), Tanaka felt that Zappa {{would have been the}} best at creating a live performance of Mother music, but could not detail Zappa's specific influence on EarthBound. Additionally, he felt that the mix tape [...] (1999) presented a particular selection of artists which embody the ethos of EarthBound, running the gamut from Space Age composer Esquivel to avant-garde trumpeter Ben Neill, along with innovators Sun Ra, Steve Reich, Todd Rundgren, Brian Eno, and Can. Tanaka also mentioned that <b>he</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> various artists compilation [...] (1988) heavily during EarthBounds development. Miscellaneous influences on Suzuki and Tanaka for EarthBound include the music of Michael Nyman, Miklós Rózsa's film score for The Lost Weekend (1945), and albums by various other pop/rock musicians.|$|E
500|$|Miller was {{a member}} of the National FFA Organization in high school. <b>He</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Grand Ole Opry and Light Crust Doughboys on a Fort Worth station with his cousin's husband, Sheb Wooley. Wooley taught Miller his first guitar chords and bought him a fiddle. Wooley, Hank Williams, and Bob Wills were the {{influences}} that led to Miller's desire to be a singer-songwriter. He began to run away and perform in Oklahoma and Texas. At 17, he stole a guitar out of desperation to write songs; however, he turned himself in the next day. He chose to enlist in the United States Army to avoid jail. [...] He later quipped, [...] "My education was Korea, Clash of '52." [...] Near the end of his military service, while stationed in Atlanta, Georgia, Miller played fiddle in the [...] "Circle A Wranglers," [...] a military musical group started by Faron Young. While Miller was stationed in South Carolina, an army sergeant whose brother was Kenneth C. [...] "Jethro" [...] Burns, from the musical duo Homer and Jethro, persuaded him to head to Nashville after his discharge.|$|E
500|$|In {{the view}} of artist Duggie Fields, the Syd Barret-led {{incarnation}} of Pink Floyd exemplified experimental pop. The group found their initial success playing at the UFO Club in London, an underground venue whose objective was to provide an outlet for experimental pop groups. According to The New York Times, Barrett and his subsequent solo albums [...] "became a touchstone for experimental pop musicians". By the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded {{the idea of the}} typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences, which cultural essayist Gerald Lyn Early credits to bands like Cream, Traffic, Blood, Sweat & Tears, and [...] "of course", the Beatles. Drummer John Densmore believed that the Doors were on the cutting-edge of experimental pop music until <b>he</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), which he described as [...] " [...] to have done it all". [...] Martin wrote that, along with the Rolling Stones' Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967), the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper [...] "opened a space" [...] for experimental pop which would be later filled by Jimi Hendrix, Jethro Tull, and the Who's Tommy (1968). Prior to Sgt. Pepper, Gary Usher and Curt Boettcher were Los Angeles-based songwriters and producers who were interested in classical music and the avant-garde. Later cited as fixtures of sunshine pop, they worked together to create their debut studio album, Present Tense (1968). It was credited to Sagittarius, a studio group referred to as an [...] "experimental pop band" [...] by The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray.|$|E
