40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{the robust}} time and {{frequency}} offset tracking algorithms and architecture for high throughput wireless {{local area network}} (WLAN) systems are presented. The designed architecture has feedback and feed forward compensation loop with well <b>defined</b> <b>loop</b> filter coefficients obtained by various experiments for practical implementation. Considered functional blocks include residual CFO estimator, carrier phase estimator, and timing error estimator. In addition to the algorithm descriptions of these blocks, the implementation method is presented, as they are modeled in the floating/cycle and bit true fixed point C model. These C models have been used as a reference for RTL coding and its verification. The design has been implemented successfully on an FPGA device. The proposed tracking method produces results very close to that of the offset-free system. I...|$|E
40|$|A non-radioactive in situ {{hybridization}} {{method is}} described for the localization of transcription units of defined genes to lateral loops of Xenopus laevis lampbrush chromosomes. Two Xenopus cONA probes were used encoding the nucleolar protein N 038 / B 23 and cytokeratin 1 (8). Both proteins {{are known to be}} synthesized in Xenopus oocytes, and Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of the corresponding mRNAs in different oogenic stages. The probes were enzymatically labeled with biotin-dCTP and hybridized to lampbrush chromosomes. The sites of hybridization were detected either by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using rabbit antibodies against biotin and fluorescein-conjugated antirabbit IgG or enzymatically using peroxidase-conjugated streptavi din. The probe encoding the nucleolar protein hybridized to two sets of lateral loops on different bivalents, the cytokeratin probe to at least four. Our finding that each probe hybridized to more than one chromosomal locus may reflect the tetraploid nature of the Xenopus laevis genome or results from cross-hybridization to other transcriptionally active members of the N 038 / B 23 -nucleoplasmin or the cytokeratin-Iamin gene families. The method described should facilitate further {{in situ hybridization}} studies with appropriate genomic clones in order to map specific DNA sequences to <b>defined</b> <b>loop</b> regions and to come {{to a better understanding of}} the relationship between loop organization and gene transcription unit...|$|E
40|$|Parallel {{advances}} in lipidomics and the structural biology of membrane proteins {{over the past}} decade have revealed the highly diverse and complex nature of cell membrane composition. These compositional complexities influence the behaviour of embedded proteins, and a number of biomedically important membrane proteins are now known to be modulated via interactions with their lipid environment. This project aims to apply an array of computational tools to probe and characterize the molecular level detail of these interactions, and obtain information to complement experimental studies. In particular the interactions of modulatory lipid species with the transmembrane domain of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor were addressed using coarse-grained potential of mean force (PMF) calculations. The results suggest this approach, widely applied in other areas of computational biology, may be successfully adapted to probe the strength and selectivity of lipid-protein interactions, and the effects of protein mutation. Subsequently these calculations were applied in tandem with equilibrium simulations to explore cardiolipin interactions with a key mitochondrial transporter, the ADP/ATP Translocase. The data show the coarse-grained model employed is capable of accurately identifying three specific cardiolipin binding sites on the protein, in agreement with prior crystallographic and NMR data. These sites were shown to be specific to cardiolipin, rather than general phospholipid interaction sites. In the third project, prospective predictions were made as to the location of PIP 2 lipid binding sites on the membrane-exposed surface of a class A GPCR, the Neurotensin Receptor 1 (NTS 1). A protein known to specifically bind these lipids from native mass spectrometry (MS) measurements at hitherto unknown regions. The results suggest PIP 2 binds to <b>defined</b> <b>loop</b> regions on the intracellular portion of the protein. Finally, atomistic simulations are applied to examine the effect of a crystallographically resolved cholesterol molecule on the dynamics of a class F GPCR, Smoothened. The data suggest a marked influence of bound cholesterol on intra-domain dynamics of the extracellular region of Smoothened...|$|E

40|$|The enzyme {{porphobilinogen}} deaminase (PBGD; hydroxymethylbilane synthase; EC 2. 5. 1. 61) catalyses a key early {{step of the}} haem- and chlorophyll-biosynthesis pathways {{in which}} four molecules of the monopyrrole porphobilinogen are condensed to form a linear tetrapyrrole. The active site possesses an unusual dipyrromethane cofactor which is extended during the reaction by the sequential addition of the four substrate molecules. The cofactor is linked covalently to the enzyme through a thioether bridge to the invariant Cys 254. Until recently, structural data have only been available for the Escherichia coli and human forms of the enzyme. The expression of a codon-optimized gene for PBGD from Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress) has permitted {{for the first time}} the X-ray analysis of the enzyme from a higher plant species at 1. 45 Å resolution. The A. thaliana structure differs appreciably from the E. coli and human forms of the enzyme in that the active site is shielded by an extensive well <b>defined</b> <b>loop</b> region (residues 60 - 70) formed by highly conserved residues. This loop is completely disordered and uncharacterized in the E. coli and human PBGD structures. The new structure establishes that the dipyrromethane cofactor of the enzyme has become oxidized to the dipyrromethenone form, with both pyrrole groups approximately coplanar. Modelling of an intermediate of the elongation process into the active site suggests that the interactions observed between the two pyrrole rings of the cofactor and the active-site residues are highly specific and are most likely to represent the catalytically relevant binding mode. During the elongation cycle, it is thought that domain movements cause the bound cofactor and polypyrrole intermediates to move past the catalytic machinery in a stepwise manner, thus permitting the binding of additional substrate moieties and completion of the tetrapyrrole product. Such a model would allow the condensation reactions to be driven by the extensive interactions that are observed between the enzyme and the dipyrromethane cofactor, coupled with acid-base catalysis provided by the invariant aspartate residue Asp 95...|$|E

Such an approach introduces a spacetime description [...] a characteristic feature of the histories approach [...] and we discuss {{the extent to which}} the usual loop variables are compatible with a spacetime description. In particular, we discuss the definability of the Barbero connection without any gauge fixing. Although it is not the pullback of a spacetime connection onto the three-surface and it does not have a natural spacetime interpretation, this does not mean that the Barbero connection is not suitable variable for quantisation; it appears naturally in the formalism even in absence of gauge fixing. It may be employed therefore, to <b>define</b> <b>loop</b> variables similar to those employed in loop quantum gravity.

50|$|T {{lymphocytes}} {{regulate the}} growth and differentiation of T cells and certain B cells through the release of secreted protein factors. These factors, which include interleukin 2 (IL2), are secreted by lectin- or antigen-stimulated T cells, and have various physiological effects. IL2 is a lymphokine that induces the proliferation of responsive T cells. In addition, it acts on some B cells, via receptor-specific binding, as a growth factor and antibody production stimulant. The protein is secreted as a single glycosylated polypeptide, and cleavage of a signal sequence is required for its activity. Solution NMR suggests that the structure of IL2 comprises a bundle of 4 helices (termed A-D), flanked by 2 shorter helices and several poorly <b>defined</b> <b>loops.</b> Residues in helix A, and in the loop region between helices A and B, are important for receptor binding.
