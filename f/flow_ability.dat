Synthetic resins evolved as restorative materials since they were insoluble, aesthetic, insensitive to dehydration, easy to manipulate and reasonably inexpensive. Composite resins are most commonly composed of Bis-GMA and other dimethacrylate monomers (TEGMA, UDMA, HDDMA), a filler material such as silica and in most current applications, a photoinitiator. Dimethylglyoxime is also commonly added to achieve certain physical properties such as <b>flow</b> <b>ability.</b> Further tailoring of physical properties is achieved by formulating unique concentrations of each constituent.|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} an experiment {{to determine the}} effects of humidity on angle of repose (flowabilty) of different specialty protein sources. Five specialty proteins sources were used: fish meal, powdered blood meal (AP 301), granulated blood meal (AP 301 G), powdered spray-dried animal plasma (AP 920), and granulated spray-dried animal plasma (Appetein). The specialty protein sources were added at 0, 2. 5, 5, 7. 5, and 10 % to a 70 : 30 corn-soybean meal blend. The experiment was conducted in an environmentally controlled nursery to minimize temperature and humidity fluctuations. There were two relative humidity levels, 34 and 64 %. All samples were placed in the barn 24 h before the experiment was conducted to allow acclimation to the conditions. <b>Flow</b> <b>ability</b> was then determined by measuring angle of repose. Angle of repose is the maximum angle in which a pile of ingredient retains its slope. A large angle of repose represents a steeper slope and poorer <b>flow</b> <b>ability.</b> There was a protein source × inclusion level × humidity interaction observed (P< 0. 01). Humidity increased angle of repose, decreasing <b>flow</b> <b>ability.</b> Angle of repose increased with increasing inclusions of powdered animal plasma and fish meal, resulting in poorer <b>flow</b> <b>ability.</b> Powdered blood cells did not affect angle of repose with increasing inclusion levels. Angle of repose decreased as granular animal plasma and blood cell inclusions increased, improving <b>flow</b> <b>ability.</b> In conclusion, specialty protein ingredients in powder form reduce <b>flow</b> <b>ability,</b> while granulated specialty protein sources improve <b>flow</b> <b>ability...</b>|$|E

Lactose sources were added at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 % to the corn-soybean meal blend. Angle of repose was then measured on these mixtures, as well as on the individual lactose sources. There was a lactose source × level interaction (P< 0. 0001) observed. Increasing lactose source decreased angle of repose, but the coarse whey permeate had a much greater improvement in <b>flow</b> <b>ability,</b> resulting in the interaction.

Adding glycerol improved (P < 0. 01) pellet durability compared to soy oil and the soy oil/glycerol blend treatments. Pigs fed glycerol had increased (linear, P < 0. 03) ADG. Adding soy oil, glycerol, or the soy oil/glycerol blend resulted in similar final BW. Two experiments evaluated the effects of glycerol {{as a replacement for}} lactose on pellet mill production and nursery pig performance. In Exp. 1, pigs were fed one of ten treatments that included 0, 3. 6, or 7. 2 % lactose or 0, 3. 6, or 7. 2 % glycerol and fed in either meal or pelleted form.

The particle size for the corn ground with a roller mill ranged from 1, 235 to 502 microns with standard deviation ranging from 1. 83 to 2. 03. Particle size for corn ground with a hammer mill ranged from 980 to 390 microns with standard deviation ranging from 2. 56 to 2. 12. All samples were dried 12 hours to equalize moisture content. Soy oil was then added at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 % to each sample. <b>Flow</b> <b>ability</b> was determined by measuring angle of repose (the maximum angle measured in degrees at which a pile of grain retains its slope). A large angle of repose represents a steeper slope and poorer <b>flow</b> <b>ability.</b> There was a three-way interaction (P< 0. 05) between particle size, added fat, and mill type. Roller mill ground corn had better <b>flow</b> <b>ability</b> than hammer mill ground corn, and decreasing particle size while increasing added fat, increased the angle of repose. However as particle size decreased and added fat increased, the differences between hammer mill and roller mill ground grain decreased. Corn ground with a hammer mill without added fat had a similar angle of repose to corn ground with a roller mill that had 6 % added fat. For both Experiments 2 and 3, batches of roller mill and hammer mill ground corn were sifted with a Ro-Tap tester through a stack of 13 screens. The material {{on top of each}} screen was then collected. Samples were dried 12 hours to equalize moisture content. Soy oil was added at 0, 4, and 8 % to each sample. In Experiment 2, five roller mill samples were selected from different individual screens with mean particle size ranging from 1, 415 to 343 microns and 5 hammer mill samples ranging from 1, 382 to 333 microns. All samples were selected from the ground corn remaining on top of the individual screens. By selecting samples this way, both roller mill and hammer mill samples had similar particle size standard deviation (PSSD), ranging from 1. 1 to 1. 3.

30|$|High {{performance}} concrete especially {{self compacting concrete}} (SCC) has got wide {{popularity in}} construction industry because of its <b>ability</b> to <b>flow</b> through congested reinforcement without segregation and bleeding. Even though European Federation of National Associations Representing for Concrete (EFNARC) guidelines are available for the mix design of SCC, large number of trials are required for obtaining an SCC mix with the desired engineering properties. The material and time requirement is more to conduct such large number of trials. The main objective of the study {{presented in this paper}} is to demonstrate use of regularized least square algorithm (RLS) along with random kitchen sink algorithm (RKS) to effectively predict the fresh and hardened stage properties of SCC. The database for testing and training the algorithm was prepared by conducting tests on 40 SCC mixes. Parametric variation in the SCC mixes were the quantities of fine and coarse aggregates, superplasticizer dosage, its family and water content. Out of 40 test results, 32 results were used for training and 8 set results were used for testing the algorithm. Modelling of both fresh state properties viz., <b>flowing</b> <b>ability</b> (Slump <b>Flow),</b> passing <b>ability</b> (J Ring), segregation resistance (V funnel at 5  min) as well as hardened stage property (compressive strength) of the SCC mix was carried out using RLS and RKS algorithm.

30|$|In the {{construction}} of heavily reinforced structural members {{one of the biggest}} problems encountered is the compaction of concrete. Improper compaction can lead to low quality and poor performance. In such structures it is difficult to use mechanical vibrators or manual compaction methods and the solution is to develop a mix which does not need compaction. This led to the introduction of self compacting concrete in the late 1980 s by Nagamoto and Ozava (1999). The fresh stage characteristics of SCC include high passing <b>ability</b> to <b>flow</b> through congested reinforcements under its own weight, <b>flowing</b> <b>ability</b> to <b>flow</b> and fill the formwork under self weight and segregation resistance. The above requirements of SCC can be measured using J ring test, slump flow test and V funnel test at 5  min respectively. The hardened stage properties of SCC include its compressive strength, split tensile strength etc. The mix proportioning of SCC is done in such a way that it satisfies the rheological and hardened properties.|$|R

To achieve SCC, many factors must be investigated. Coarse aggregate {{is one of these}} factors that have a significant influence on SCC. This paper presents the coarse aggregate properties such as maximum size, texture and type of coarse aggregate that have a direct effect on achieving SCC. Three types of coarse aggregate are used, namely crush gravel, uncrushed gravel and crush limestone. To determine the workability, different test methods are adopted such as slump flow, V-funnel, L-box and U-box test. It was found that by increasing the maximum size of coarse aggregate, flowability and passing ability reduced.

The Multi-Stage (MUSTA) {{scheme was}} used to {{construct}} the numerical fluxes when the hyperbolically degenerate governing equations, in which the independent eigenvectors can not be found, are numerically solved for dilute particle-gas two-phase <b>flows.</b> The <b>abilities</b> of MUSTA scheme used in various problems were analyzed. It {{was found that the}} MUSTA scheme is effective even for very complicated problem although appropriate total number of stages should be carefully selected. When the total number of stages equals 3 or 4, the MUSTA scheme is as accurate as Riemann solver in most cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of image acquisition, image processing and skin friction computations {{has been developed}} to support skin friction measurements at the Ludwieg-tube facility at DLR. Verification of the oil-film-interferometry technique with analytical tests at different flows with given shear stress distributions showed its advantages and handicaps for skin friction measurements in 3 D gradient <b>flows.</b> The <b>abilities</b> of the thin oil film technique with its application in a short duration wind tunnel were demonstrated on some examples. The comparison of experimental results obtained by different optical skin friction methods demonstrated good agreement. ...|$|R
