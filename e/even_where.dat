5|$|Gonzales v. Raich 545 U.S. 1 (2005) was a {{decision}} in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (6–3) that <b>even</b> <b>where</b> individuals or businesses in accordance with state-approved medical cannabis programs are lawfully cultivating, possessing, or distributing medical cannabis, such persons or businesses are violating federal marijuana laws. Therefore, under federal law violators are prosecuted because the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants the federal government jurisdiction to prosecute marijuana offenses, here defendants violation of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom at present, the {{mainstream}} approach towards representative standing is broad and liberal. The {{focus is on}} whether illegality or some other ground of review can be shown, rather than the applicant's relationship to the illegality complained of.

5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, {{finding that}} {{cannabis}} grown within California for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana. Moreover, because the intrastate medical cannabis market {{contributes to the}} interstate illicit marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. <b>Even</b> <b>where</b> California citizens are using medical cannabis in compliance with state law, those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities for violating federal law.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface <b>even</b> <b>where</b> the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E
5|$|Wall {{was trained}} as a linguist, and the design of Perl is very much {{informed}} by linguistic principles.

5|$|At {{this early}} stage, the term punk {{applied to the}} scene in general, not {{necessarily}} a particular stylistic approach as it would later—the early New York punk bands represented a broad variety of influences. Among them, the Ramones, the Heartbreakers, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and the Dead Boys were establishing a distinct musical style. <b>Even</b> <b>where</b> they diverged most clearly, in lyrical approach—the Ramones' apparent guilelessness at one extreme, Hell's conscious craft at the other—there was an abrasive attitude in common. Their shared attributes of minimalism and speed, however, had not yet come to define punk rock.|$|E

5|$|By 1995, the ARBiH and the HVO had {{developed}} into better-organised forces employing comparably {{large numbers of}} artillery pieces and good defensive fortifications. The VRS was not capable of penetrating their defences <b>even</b> <b>where</b> its forces employed sound military tactics, for instance in the Battle of Orašje in May and June 1995. After recapture of {{the bulk of the}} Republic of Serb Krajina (the Croatian Serb-controlled areas of Croatia) in Operation Storm in August 1995, the HV shifted its focus to western Bosnia and Herzegovina. The shift was motivated by a desire to create a security zone along the Croatian border, establish Croatia as a regional power and gain favours with the West by forcing an end to the Bosnian War. The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed the move as it contributed to their goal of gaining control over western Bosnia and the city of Banja Luka—the largest city in the Bosnian Serb-held territory.|$|E

5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>where</b> metal {{objects such}} as bowls and dishes {{do not seem to}} have {{geometric}} decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object. Both closed designs (which do not repeat) and open or repetitive patterns are used. Patterns such as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12thcentury. Eva Baer notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.|$|E

5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or salted, and they are considered good eating. However, <b>even</b> <b>where</b> halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>even</b> <b>where</b> {{recognisable}} {{facts are}} present, {{their use in}} the History cannot be taken at face value. In the Life of Alexander Severus, the History makes the claim at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip did later ban the practice. Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true — {{the source of this}} is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who in turn sourced it from the Kaisergeschichte), and the History even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the Kaisergeschichte. Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the Kaisergeschichte.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v.

Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise discretion in decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E
