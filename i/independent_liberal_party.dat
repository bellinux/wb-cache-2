25|$|Won in National Elections held on November 6, 2011 was {{the amount}} of 1,569,287 for 62.46% of the total valid votes, at that moment Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra became the presidential {{candidate}} who won a presidential election with the most votes {{in the history of}} Nicaragua, in addition to that obtained a lead of more than 30% of valid votes doubling the number of votes obtained by radial businessman Fabio Gadea Mantilla on behalf of the <b>Independent</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party</b> (PLI) who obtained {{the amount of}} 778.889 votes recorded for 31.00%. The big loser of these elections was the former President Arnoldo Aleman Lacayo candidate Liberal Constitutionalist Party (PLC) who was located in a distant third with a 5.91% equivalent to 148.507 votes. These results hint at a continuing and still fluid change in the correlation of political forces in the country.|$|E
25|$|Although {{initially}} {{willing to}} stand in the 1984 elections, the UNO, headed by Arturo Cruz (a former Sandinista), declined participation in the elections based on their own objections to the restrictions placed on the electoral process by the State of Emergency and the official advisement of President Ronald Reagan's State Department, who feared that their participation would legitimize the election process. Among other parties that abstained was COSEP, who had warned the FSLN that they would decline participation unless freedom of the press was reinstituted. Coordinadora Democrática (CD) also refused to file candidates and urged Nicaraguans not {{to take part in the}} election. The <b>Independent</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party</b> (PLI), headed by Virgilio Godoy Reyes, announced its refusal to participate in October. Consequently, when the elections went ahead the U.S. raised objections based upon political restrictions instituted by the State of Emergency (e.g., censorship of the press, cancellation of habeas corpus, and the curtailing of free assembly).|$|E

2500|$|The Sandinistas were victorious in the {{national}} election of November 4, 1984, gathering 67% of the vote. The election was certified as [...] "free and fair" [...] {{by the majority of}} international observers. The Nicaraguan political opposition and the Reagan administration claimed political restrictions were placed on the opposition by the government. The primary opposition candidate was the U.S.-backed Arturo Cruz, who succumbed to pressure from the United States government not {{to take part in the}} 1984 elections; later US officials were quoted as saying, [...] "the (Reagan) Administration never contemplated letting Cruz stay in the race, because then the Sandinistas could justifiably claim that the elections were legitimate." [...] Other opposition parties such as the Conservative Democratic Party and the <b>Independent</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>party,</b> were both free to denounce the Sandinista government and participate in the elections. Ortega was overwhelmingly elected President in 1984, but the long years of war had decimated Nicaragua's economy.|$|E
