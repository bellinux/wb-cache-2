5|$|In Nikki Stafford's analysis, the {{reactions}} of Buffy, Dawn, Xander, Willow, Anya, and Tara represent stages of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross' five stages of grief in different parts. Joss Whedon stated on the DVD commentary how surprised {{he was at the}} response from viewers who wrote to say that the episode allowed them to accept the death of a close family member, even if they had not acknowledged it <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> years. Joyce's death was the first by natural causes in the series.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{engage in}} ritualised fights to {{maintain}} and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they will engage each other until appeasement occurs. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants {{do this in a}} display of size matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may continue <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> even years in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the crisis}} of the 3rd century was not the {{absolute}} beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since {{the last days of the}} Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years of engagement, they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her father did not approve of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph did not approve of his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> even years at a time, while traveling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E
5|$|During the day, whitetip reef sharks {{spend much}} of their time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which rely on ram {{ventilation}} and must constantly swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its gills and lie still on the bottom. At night, whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes, crustaceans, and octopus in groups, their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices and holes to extract hidden prey. Individuals may stay within a particular area of the reef <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> years, frequently returning to the same shelter. This species is viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. One of the few sharks in which mating has been observed in the wild, receptive female whitetip reef sharks are followed by prospective males, which attempt to grasp her pectoral fin and maneuver the two of them into positions suitable for copulation. Females give birth to one to six pups every other year, after a gestation period of 1013 months.|$|E

5|$|The use of bone {{building}} drugs, like bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL drugs {{require special}} consideration with implants, {{because they have}} been associated with a disorder called Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). The drugs change bone turnover, which is thought to put people at risk for death of bone when having minor oral surgery. At routine doses (for example, those used to treat routine osteoporosis) the effects of the drugs linger <b>for</b> <b>months</b> <b>or</b> years but the risk appears to be very low. Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care. Otherwise, implants can generally be placed and the use of bisphosphonates does not appear to affect implant survival.|$|E

25|$|According to the law, minors {{should be}} {{detained}} {{only as a}} last resort; however, in part due to the absence of juvenile justice or education centers, detention of minors was common.
