500|$|Dinklage played Trumpkin in the 2008 film [...] The {{movie was}} a box office disappointment, with global {{revenues}} of $419.7 million, although film critic Bill Gibron described Dinklage's {{role as a}} [...] "cutesy stereotype {{he has tried to}} avoid". Later that year, he played the title role in Uncle Vanya (directed by his wife, Erica Schmidt) in Bard College's annual Bard SummerScape, the Upstate New York summer stage on the Annandale-on-Hudson campus. [...] In 2010, he appeared in the Australian movie <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>You</b> <b>Too</b> alongside Brendan Cowell and Peter Helliar.|$|E
2500|$|Letters {{can also}} be potent {{conveyors}} of homoerotic feelings; the letters between Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West, two well-known members of the Bloomsbury Group, are full of homoerotic overtones characterized by this excerpt from Vita's letter to Virginia: [...] "I am reduced to a thing that wants Virginia [...] It is incredible to me how essential you have become [...] I shan't make you love me any the more by giving myself away like this --But oh my dear, I can't be clever and stand-offish with you: <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much for that." [...] (January 21, 1926) ...|$|E
6000|$|FENWICK. What do <b>I</b> care? <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> <b>too.</b> Little {{he thought}} of that, little either of you thought of that. His blood--I'll have his blood! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>thee,</b> <b>too.</b> But the day draweth on, and I have my cooking to do ere our master cometh home; {{so let us}} e'en go {{and settle}} this brave fight we have in hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't. You {{asked if}} you could call me Mary, and I said <b>you</b> might, because <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much to deny your {{smallest}} whim. I was going {{on to say that}} it wasn't my name, but you interrupted me." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, Dire Straits {{performed}} alongside Elton John and Eric Clapton at Knebworth Festival, playing three songs: [...] "Solid Rock", [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] and a song which Knopfler prefaced as {{an experimental}} song, unsure {{if they should}} record it on a following record. The song, a blues rock piece with solos by both Knopfler and Clapton, was titled [...] "I Think <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>You</b> <b>Too</b> Much". This song also appeared on the 1990 album Hell To Pay {{as a gift to}} Canadian blues/jazz artist Jeff Healey from Knopfler. This was prior to the time that Knopfler, Illsley and manager Ed Bicknell decided to reform the band the following year.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{punishment}} to me," [...] Grizel said, setting her teeth, [...] "for loving you too much. I know <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much. I think I love {{you more than}} God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's dear of you, Bill, but you're {{promising}} an impossibility. And {{just because}} it's impossible, and because <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much to face {{what would be}} bound to happen, I'm {{going to send you}} away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose it's because <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much. <b>I</b> {{wore the}} passion out. The thought of {{anything}} of that sort horrifies me. I can't look at you now without thinking of Emil and Griffiths. One can't help those things, I suppose it's just nerves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, my dear maid, <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>thee</b> <b>too</b> well {{to think}} of aught save that thou art mine own little one, given back {{to us by the}} will of Heaven. Aye, and so will others think of thee, if thou art good and loving to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Johnson went sadly {{out of the}} room. Then {{she came}} back to the door again, and, opening it, uttered, {{for the first time in}} our service, words of apology and regret: [...] "I hope I ha'n't put you out any. I wanted to go with you, but I ought to knowed I couldn't. All is, <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I vow," [...] said he, [...] "that this is {{the last}} time ever I shall consent to talk law or {{politics}} with you, Philippe. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> well to quarrel with you over other men's affairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, Harry, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> {{with all}} my heart; so much that I can feel almost happy {{that we are going}} to die together. We are affianced now, dear, come what will." [...] And she lifted her face to his.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm sorry, but {{you asked}} me to speak the truth. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much to pretend about your work. It's strong, it's patient {{sometimes}},--not always,--and sometimes there's power in it, but there's no special reason why it should be done at all. At least, that's how it strikes me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then, yes, we did.' Her lips shook; but it {{was with}} some little dignity that she continued: 'I would gladly have told you; for I knew and know I had done wrong. But I dared not; <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> well. Oh, so well! You have been {{everything}} in the world to me--and you are now. Will you not forgive me?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why do you complain, Princess?" [...] {{said the}} King of the Sheep. [...] "Did I {{say that you}} were not to go to the wedding? Set out as soon as you please; only promise me that you will come back, for <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much to be able to live without you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Uma,” said I, “hear reason. I didn’t know, and that’s a fact; and Case {{seems to}} have played it pretty mean upon the pair of us. But I do know now, and I don’t mind; <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much. You no go ’way, you no leave me, I too much sorry.” ...|$|E
60|$|I know I can't do {{anything}} but make trouble for you, I think. I am going to Minneapolis tonight and from there as soon as I can either to New York or Chicago. I will do as big things as I can. I--I can't write <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much--God keep you.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I am not angry, Jane: <b>I</b> only <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> well; and <b>you</b> had steeled {{your little}} pale face {{with such a}} resolute, frozen look, I could not endure it. Hush, now, and wipe your eyes." ...|$|R
60|$|No. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> far <b>too</b> much ever to do that. Believe me, I {{only wish}} you well. Now that the {{bitterness}} is past, I {{see that you}} did the only possible thing. I hope that you'll be very happy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, not a syllable!' she answers, kissing me. 'Oh, my dear, {{you never}} {{deserved}} it, and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> far <b>too</b> well {{to say a}} reproachful word to you, in earnest--it was all the merit I had, except being pretty--or you thought me so. Is it lonely, down-stairs, Doady?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry, but {{you asked}} me to speak the truth. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much to pretend about your work.

60|$|Joc. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> The self-same way; {{and when}} you chid, methought A mother's love start[5] up in your defence, And bade me not be angry.

6000|$|... “Now {{you talk}} silly,” said she. “White man, he come here, I marry him all-e-same Kanaka; very well then, he marry me all-e-same white woman.

6000|$|... "You say <b>you</b> <b>love</b> me, Gustav. <b>I</b> {{tried to}} <b>love</b> <b>you,</b> <b>too,</b> but <b>I</b> never could--never from the first. I tried very hard. Surely you care {{what a woman}} feels, even if she happens to be your wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|Muriel {{rose and}} laid her hand solemnly on his arm. [...] "You will!" [...] she answered, boldly. [...] "You can! You must! I know I can trust your promise for that. This moment, if you like. I would not shrink. But {{you will never}} let me fall alive {{into the hands of}} those wretches. Felix, from your hand I could stand anything.

6000|$|... "Wait," [...] he said. [...] "She {{has made}} her choice, as I knew she would; but I have yet to make mine. And I choose to marry no woman whose love belongs to another living man.

Go to the man you love--you are free!" ...|$|E
60|$|What can a man do, then, {{even under}} such painful circumstances, {{when a girl}} whom he loves with all his heart lets him clearly see she loves him in return quite as truly? Cyril {{would have been more}} than human if he hadn't {{answered}} those notes in an equally ardent and equally desponding strain. The burden of both their tales was always this--even if YOU would, I couldn't, because <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much to impose my own disgrace upon you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> for that, <b>too.</b> It {{was about}} time. I {{began to think}} you {{were never going to}} bring up the subject again. And now that I have offered myself you haven't even accepted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, Barry, {{you know}} well enough that <b>I</b> have never <b>loved</b> but <b>you!</b> Was <b>I</b> ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy! ever so angry, but the least offer of {{goodwill}} on your part did not bring me to your side? Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you, in bestowing {{one of the first}} fortunes in England upon you? Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much and too fondly; <b>I</b> have always <b>loved</b> <b>you.</b> From the first moment I saw you, I felt irresistibly attracted towards you. I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help <b>loving</b> <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so; and in spite of reason and duty.

6000|$|... "I blame myself! I {{should have}} told you before, while there was yet {{time for you to}} withdraw. I should have confessed this to you that night on the terrace in the moonlight.

It was only then that I understood what my supposed skill at golf meant to you, and then it was <b>too</b> late. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>you</b> <b>too</b> much to let you go! I could not bear the thought of you recoiling from me. Oh, I was mad--mad! I knew that I could not keep up the deception for ever, that you must find me out in time. But I had a wild hope that by then we should be so close to one another that you might find it in your heart to forgive. But I was wrong. I see it now. There are some things that no man can forgive.
