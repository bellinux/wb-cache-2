25|$|FATCA was the revenue-raising {{portion of}} the 2010 {{domestic}} jobs stimulus bill, the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, and was enacted as Subtitle A (sections 501 through 541) of Title V of that law. FATCA is controversial because foreign banks {{have been forced to}} comply under threat of a 30% withholding penalty on all their U.S. transactions. The U.S. has yet to comply with FATCA itself, because as of 2017, it has not yet provided the promised reciprocity to its partner countries and it has failed to sign up to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). FATCA has also been criticised for its impacts on Americans living overseas, and implicated in record-breaking numbers of U.S. citizenship renunciations throughout the 2010s. Bills to repeal FATCA have been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, citing its unconstitutionality, particularly its breach of 4th amendment rights, as well as its high <b>implementation</b> <b>costs</b> and lack of revenue generation. A hearing on the unintended consequences of FATCA was held by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on 26 April 2017.|$|E
25|$|Sweden: The Swedish {{government}} administration {{stated that}} the costs of implementation should be considered versus the threatened 30% sanctioned tax which could be applied for non-compliance. Sweden could not estimate the business effect of FATCA, despite that Swedish law requires that the business impact must be evaluated for legislations. In following discussions, it was estimated that each small financial institute (comprising 95% of the FFI’s) would incur 1 million SEK yearly FATCA administration costs. (Documentation of the costs to larger institutions has not been located.) IRS lists 744 FFI’s to date, yielding a minimum estimated yearly cost of 744 million SEK (excludes the cost of the 5% larger institutions), or 7.44 billion SEK over 10 years. The costs to the Swedish government were estimated to be above 15 million SEK for implementation and 15 million SEK per year thereafter, for a 10-year public cost of 165 million SEK. Total FATCA <b>implementation</b> <b>costs</b> in Sweden are estimated to be greater than 7.61 billion SEK. With 9,784,445 inhabitants and 17,000 resident U.S. citizens, the Swedish government cost is 777 SEK per capita, 447,700 SEK per resident US-citizen resident and 937 SEK per adult Swedish account, or an astounding 539,984 SEK per adult resident U.S.-person account.|$|E

2500|$|Solar {{radiation}} management (SRM) techniques {{would seek}} to reduce sunlight absorbed (ultra-violet, near infra-red and visible). [...] This would be achieved by deflecting sunlight away from the Earth, or by increasing the reflectivity (albedo) of the atmosphere or the Earth's surface.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} an {{automated}} techniqueswati: Synthesizing Wordlengths Automatically Using Testing and Induction, {{which uses a}} combination of Nelder-Mead optimization based testing, and induction from examples to automatically synthesize optimal fixedpoint implementation of numerical routines. The design of numerical software is commonly done using floating-point arithmetic in design-environments such as Matlab. However, these designs are often implemented using fixed-point arithmetic for speed and efficiency reasons especially in embedded systems. The fixed-point <b>implementation</b> reduces <b>implementation</b> <b>cost,</b> provides better performance, and reduces power consumption. The conversion from floating-point designs to fixed-point code is subject to two opposing constraints: (i) the word-width of fixed-point types must be minimized, and (ii) the outputs of the fixed-point program must be accurate. In this paper, we propose a new solution to this problem. Our technique takes the floating-point program, specified accuracy and an <b>implementation</b> <b>cost</b> model and provides the fixed-point program with specified accuracy and optimal <b>implementation</b> <b>cost.</b> We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach {{on a set of}} examples from the domain of automated control, robotics and digital signal processing. ...|$|R
