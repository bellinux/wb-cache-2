40|$|The {{main source}} of n- 3 {{long-chain}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in human nutrition is currently seafood, especially oily fish. Nonetheless, due to cultural or individual preferences, convenience, geographic location, or awareness of risks associated to fatty fish consumption, the intake of fatty fish is far from supplying the recommended dietary levels. The end result observed in most western countries {{is not only a}} low supply of n- 3 LC-PUFA, but also an unbalance towards the intake of n- 6 fatty acids, resulting mostly from the consumption of vegetable oils. Awareness of the benefits of LC-PUFA in human health has led to the use of <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> as <b>food</b> <b>supplements.</b> However, {{there is a need to}} explore alternatives sources of LC-PUFA, especially those of microbial origin. Microalgae species with potential to accumulate lipids in high amounts and to present elevated levels of n- 3 LC-PUFA are known in marine phytoplankton. This review focuses on sources of n- 3 LC-PUFA, namely eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, in marine microalgae, as alternatives to <b>fish</b> <b>oils.</b> Based on current literature, examples of marketed products and potentially new species for commercial exploitation are presented...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{group of}} small pelagic fish {{is the largest}} species group landed globally. A {{significant}} proportion of this nutrient-rich food is processed and lost to livestock feed, <b>fish</b> feed, <b>fish</b> <b>oil,</b> pet <b>food</b> and omega-rich vitamins. The nutritional importance of small pelagics as an easily digestible protein source, rich in essential lipids with fatty acids (EPA/DHA), essential amino acids, minerals and vitamins, is well known and documented. Small pelagics contain {{all the elements of}} a healthy and nutritionally optimal food source for humans and are an important contributor to the food and nutritional security of many poor, low-income households in developing countries. Findings: Large-scale and small-scale fisheries {{play an important role in}} contributing to food security and nutrition. Yet, all of the anchovy landings from large-scale fisheries are reduced to animal feed, <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> and pet <b>food</b> in South Africa. The size of the species, labour costs and lack of incentives by the state are some of the challenges to redirecting anchovy for human consumption. This trend is also now prevalent in Tanzania, where most (84 %) of the dagaa fished is reduced to fishmeal in Kenya, mainly to feed chickens. The main challenges are post-harvest handling and sanitation. Conclusions: The redirecting of small pelagics to human consumption will depend on the role of the state in Tanzania and South Africa in investing in post-harvest processing. The role small-scale fisheries play in providing fish for food security needs to be understood in the context of economic viability and of how data are reported in this sector as compared to large-scale fisheries.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} {{benefits of}} <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> are generally attributed to their content of long chain omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Diets rich in these fatty acids {{are known to}} reduce the risk of coronary thrombosis, and are recommended to those who are susceptible to atherosclerosis. In addition, some of these long chain PUFAs play an important role in early infant nutrition, in the development of vital human organs such as the neural tube. However, practical difficulties arise in achieving an adequate daily intake of <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> to obtain these physiological benefits. Per capita fish consumption is low in many countries, especially of oily fish with high levels of omega- 3 PUFAs. <b>Fish</b> <b>oil,</b> while available as a dietary supplement, is not universally appealing in that form. Attempts to incorporate <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> into <b>food</b> formulations have had limited success mainly because of fishy flavours coming through in the consumer products. <b>Fish</b> <b>oil</b> is particularly susceptible to oxidation, which results in fishy, painty and metallic flavours. Hence the main aim of this study was the development of a dried ingredient in which the formulation and related processing conditions were optimised to protect the <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> from oxidation.

40|$|Fatty acids {{with double}} bonds beyond the ninth carbon from the {{carboxyl}} end {{are classified as}} essential for human health, including omega- 3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA). The main sources of omega- 3 fatty acids are fatty fish species such as herring, mackerel, sardine and salmon. Oils from the marine algae Cryptecondium conchii are mainly rich in DHA only, while <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> contains both EPA & DHA. Why is it important to microencapsulate EPA & DHA? Because these fatty acids cannot be synthesized by the human body but have to be obtained through nutrition uptake. The beneficial effects of these fatty acids including lowering cholesterol, decreasing the risk of arrhythmia, lowering the blood pressure, preventing diabetes in pregnancy, and positive effects on joints (relief of arthritis). EPA and DHA also {{play an important role}} in early infant nutrition and the imbalance of these fatty acids is believed to cause a variety of diseases. Because of their sensitivity to oxidation, these fatty acids need to be stabilized to protect them from oxidation. In food application, their interaction with other food ingredients needs to be prevented. Attempts to prevent oxidation to allow omega- 3 fatty acids to fulfill their functions are not trouble-free. <b>Fish</b> <b>oils</b> in their natural state have a taste and smell that make them less attractive to consumers.

The European Commission is currently examining whether the range of foods which may be fortified with novel algae oils can be extended. Against this backdrop the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has assessed the health risk from the elevated intake of the omega- 3 fatty acids DHA and EPA. Against the backdrop of a novel food application for DHA-rich oil from marine microalgae, BfR has estimated that fortification of foods from 14 food groups with algae oil could increase previous intake of long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids roughly fourfold. In various studies, however, high intake levels of this scale have been associated with an elevated cholesterol level, impairment of natural immune de-fence, in particular in older people and a heightened tendency to bleed. Nor has there been any definitive clarification up to now of the long-term effects of an elevated intake of the omega- 3 fatty acids DHA and EPA.

The treatment diets both contained added L-carnitine (300 mg/kg) and 0. 6 % (treatment food 1) or 1. 5 % (treatment <b>food</b> 2) added <b>fish</b> <b>oil.</b> Treatment <b>food</b> 2 also had increased MCT from coconut oil, added corn oil, and reduced animal fat. Composition of serum FA was determined by gas chromatography of FA methyl esters. Metabolomic profiles of serum samples were determined from extracted supernatants that were split and run on GC/MS and LC/MS/MS platforms, for identification and relative quantification of small metabolites. Body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Among dog groups, there was no change in total-lean-body weight, or in serum total protein and serum albumin concentrations, based on time or dietary treatment. Serum concentrations of carnitine metabolites were decreased in geriatric (> 7 years) vs. mature adult (≤ 7 years) dogs, and supplementation with L-carnitine attenuated the effects of aging. The ratio of PUFA to SFA was significantly greater in mature dogs at baseline (P ≤ 0. 05). Serum concentrations of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic FA increased in a dose-dependent manner. Dogs consuming treatment food 2 also had increased serum concentrations of lauric and myristic FA, and decreased concentrations of SFA, MUFA, and arachidonate (all P ≤ 0. 05) and their PUFA to SFA ratio increased. In summary, dietary MCT, <b>fish</b> <b>oil,</b> and L-carnitine counterbalanced the effects of aging on circulating concentrations of these compounds...|$|R

Here, we have systematically compared the metabolic and molecular effects of different HF with varying fatty acid compositions. Male Wistar rats were fed HF diets (42 % energy; fat sources: HF-L - lard; HF-O - olive oil; HF-C - coconut fat; HF-F - <b>fish</b> <b>oil).</b> Weight, <b>food</b> intake, whole-body insulin tolerance and plasma parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism were measured during a 12 -week diet course. Liver histologies and hepatic gene expression profiles, using Affymetrix GeneChips, were obtained. HF-L and HF-O fed rats showed the most pronounced obesity and insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity in HF-C and HF-F was close to normal. Plasma omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega- 3 -PUFA) and saturated fatty acid (C(12) -C(14), SFA) levels were elevated in HF-F and HF-C animals respectively. The liver histologies showed hepatic steatosis in HF-L, HF-O and HF-C without major inflammation. Hepatic SREBP 1 c-dependent genes were upregulated in these diets, whereas PPARalpha-dependent genes were predominantly upregulated in HF-F fed rats. We detected classical HF effects only in diets based on lard and olive oil (mainly long-chain, saturated (LC-SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)). PUFA- or MC-SFA-rich diets did not induce insulin resistance. Diets based on LC-SFA and MUFA induced hepatic steatosis with SREBP 1 c activation. This points to an intact transcriptional hepatic insulin effect despite resistance to insulin's metabolic actions...|$|R

Accuracy of the results was assessed by implementing several quality control tools. Sixty eight samples out of 94 analyzed products exceeded the level of 0. 5 μg/kg for the sum of the four EU marker PAHs (ΣPAH 4). Benzo[a]pyrene exceeded the limit of quantification in 49 samples. The PAH with the highest abundance in all products was chrysene. On average, propolis extracts and other bee products showed relatively high levels of ΣPAH 4 (mean 188. 2 μg/kg), whereas the contamination levels of <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> supplements were very low or mostly undetectable.

40|$|This {{project is}} a part of the Sweaweed project which aims to {{evaluate}} the use of the seaweed species Porphyra umbilicalis and Ulva lactuca grown along the west coast of Sweden, for high value products. This particular project evaluated the use of the seaweed as a source of long chained n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n- 3 PUFA), and as a source of natural antioxidants able to preserve other LC n- 3 PUFA from oxidation. In a first part of the project, different extraction techniques (polytron, sonication and bead beating) were evaluated for their efficiency in extracting lipophilic compounds (carotenoids, chlorophyll and phenolic compounds) from seaweed into sunflower oil. In the second part, lipid oxidation in seaweed-fortified <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> was studied during storage as well as during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. By using a polytron, the highest amounts of carotenoids, chlorophyll and phenolic compounds were extracted from the seaweed into sunflower <b>oil</b> and <b>fish</b> <b>oil.</b> No fortification of LC n- 3 PUFAs was however detected in the sunflower oil fortified with Porphyra umbilicalis or Ulva lactuca. The <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> fortified with Porphyra umbilicalis experienced 29 % less degradation of both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared to pure <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> during storage in room temperature and daylight for 28 days. The <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> fortified with Ulva lactuca experienced 22 % and 37 % less degradation of EPA and DHA compared to pure <b>fish</b> <b>oil.</b> The amount of peroxides after 28 days of storage was 22 % and 21 % less in the <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> fortified with Porphyra umbilicalis and Ulva lactuca. The amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) produced was 40 % and 45 % less in the <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> fortified with Porphyra umbilicalis and 70 % and 68 % less in the <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> fortified with Ulva lactuca after 7 and 28 days of storage compared to pure <b>fish</b> <b>oil.</b> The amount of 4 -hydroxy- 2 -hexenal (HHE) and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (HNE) was higher in the <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> fortified with Porphyra umbilicalis after 7 days, and higher in the <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> fortified with Ulva lactuca after 28 days, when compared to pure <b>fish</b> <b>oil.</b> No significant difference was noticed regarding rancid odor in the different <b>fish</b> <b>oils.</b> The extracted seaweed compounds had no preserving effect against oxidation of <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> during in vitro digestion. Altogether, the fortifying and stabilizing effects from extracting seaweed with <b>food</b> <b>oils</b> were lower than expected, which could be due e. g. to LC n- 3 PUFA being firmly bound in lipid classes that are difficult to extract with such a hydrophobic media as oil.
