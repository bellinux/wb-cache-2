The plane stress condition and Tresca yield criterion were assumed for an elastic-perfectly plastic material. These hypotheses allowed the problem to be formulated by means of ordinary differential equations which were analytically solved. Within these particular conditions, the results gave indications of the effect produced by plasticity on the widely used hole-drilling method for residual stress measurement.

The consequent reduction of the bulk modulus of the liquid phase is here modelled in a simplified manner through a tension cut off on the pore pressure. Two alternative approaches are outlined {{in the framework of}} the finite element method. The first one introduces a unilateral constraint on the nodal pore pressures and involves manipulations on matrices of the assembled mesh, whilst the second approach requires calculations solely at the element level.

40|$|Shell {{elements}} {{are commonly used}} in simulations of sheet metal forming using finite element analysis. Element matrices, due to their complexity, cannot conveniently be calculated in a closed form and therefore numerical integration is employed. The most commonly used rules for through-thickness integration in shell {{elements are}} Gauss quadrature and rules based on the Newton-Cotes formula. Considering the integrand in the expression for the internal force vector, one may state that it is smooth only if during a finite element analysis the material remains in the elastic regime. When the material is in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>regime</b> the integrand becomes non-smooth in, for example, out-of-plane direction since the stress profile may have a point of discontinuity at the surface that separates the elastic and plastic regions. The traditional numerical schemes do not perform well when integrating a non-smooth function and integration error may increase significantly. Therefore, if a shell element is in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>regime,</b> the error due to numerical integration may be large {{and has to be}} dealt with. A large number of sampling points in thickness direction may decrease the error due to numerical integration at the cost of increased computation time. Alternatively, the in- tegration error can be decreased without a drastic increase in the computation time by using an adaptive through-thickness integration. A distinguishing feature of this integra- tion scheme is that the location and/or the number of the sampling points is adapted to the through-thickness stress profile, leading to accurate numerical integration at minimal costs. An adaptive through-thickness integration strategy for shell elements is developed in this report. The strategy consists of several algorithms that locate points of discontinuity in the out-of-plane stress profile, adapt sampling points, update values of internal variables and perform numerical integration. Performance of the integration strategy is evaluated using a problem of bending of a beam under tension. It is shown that with adaptive integration it is possible to obtain accurate results with a very low number of sampling points...|$|E

This report focuses on verification of beam and truss element formulations in DYNA 3 D. An efficient protocol has been developed to verify the accuracy of these structural elements by generating a set of representative problems for which closed-form quasi-static steady-state analytical reference solutions exist. To provide as complete coverage as practically achievable, problem sets are developed for each beam and truss element formulation (and their variants) in all modes of loading and physical orientation. Analyses with loading in the elastic and <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>regimes</b> are performed. For elastic loading, the FE results are within 1 % of the reference solutions for all cases. For beam element bending and torsion loading in the plastic regime, the response is heavily dependent on the numerical integration rule chosen, with higher refinement yielding greater accuracy (agreement to within 1 %). Axial loading in the plastic regime produces accurate results (agreement to within 0. 01 %) for all integration rules and element formulations.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{studies of}} the near tip fields and the effects on void growth rates for a steadily advancing crack through a ductile metal {{in the presence of}} hydrogen, under plane-strain and quasi-static conditions. The computational model determines directly the deformation history of a steadily propagating crack without the need for a priori (transient) analysis that considers blunting of the pre-existing stationary crack and subsequent growth through the associated initial plastic zone. The present approach enables straightforward investigation over a range of geometric constraint configurations encountered in test specimens and structural components by application of a far field KI-T loading. The ductile crack propagation simulated in these studies represents that observed in a high-solubility model material, where the diffusion rate can sustain equilibrium of the hydrogen concentration ahead of the steadily propagating crack tip. The constitutive model accounts for the influence of hydrogen on the <b>elastic–plastic</b> <b>regimes</b> of material response at the continuum level, e. g. hydrogen-induced material softening. The model reflects the amount of hydrogen in the material under stress and the intensity of hydrogen-induced softening in the material. The hydrogen influenced, crack front fields serve as input to an exponential-based characterization of void growth rates which provides qualitative estimates for the impact of hydrogen on tearing resistance curves. The analyses suggest significantly higher void growth rates exist in a hydrogen-charged material than in a hydrogen free material, with a corresponding reduction in tearing resistance in the presence of hydrogen regardless of the level of imposed constraint...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a new {{application}} of the inverse analysis of the depth-sensing indentation technique based on the optimization theory has been satisfactorily demonstrated. The novel approach for determining the mechanical properties from experimental nanoindentation curves has been applied in order to generate the elastic–plastic stress–strain curves of three phases located across the joint of a like-to-like inertia friction weld of a CrMoV steel, i. e. the parent phase of tempered martensite and two child phases formed during the IFW process, martensite in the quenched and over-tempered condition. The inverse analysis carried out in this study consists of an optimization algorithm implemented in MATLAB, which compares an experimental nanoindentation curve with a predicted indentation curve generated by a 3 D finite element model developed using the ABAQUS software; the optimization algorithm modifies the predicted curve by changing the material properties until the best fit to the experimental nanoindentation curve is found. The optimized parameters (mechanical properties) {{have been used to}} generate the stress–strain relationships in the <b>elastic–plastic</b> <b>regime</b> {{that can be used to}} simulate numerically the effects of the variation in material properties arising from phase transformations occurring across the joint during the IFW process of a CrMoV steel. The proposed inverse analysis was capable of fitting experimental load–depth (P–h) curves produced with a Nanoindentation Nanotest NTX unit from three characteristic regions located across the joint where the above mentioned phases are known to exist. The capability of the inverse analysis to build the stress–strain relationship in the <b>elastic–plastic</b> <b>regime</b> using the optimized mechanical properties of the parent metal has been validated using experimental data extracted from the compressive test of an axisymmetric sample of tempered martensite [1].

This dissertation contains three related studies examining {{the evolution of the}} lattice strains and the crystal stresses in fcc polycrystalline aggregates subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. These three studies, which can be read independently, are presented in Chapters 1, 2 and 3. Chapter 1 contains an investigation into the evolution of the orientation dependent lattice strain response in fcc polycrystals under monotonic tensile loading, particularly in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> transition <b>regime</b> leading up to fullydeveloped plasticity. The lattice strains, when plotted {{as a function of the}} macroscopic stress, begin to deviate from linear behavior in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> transition <b>regime</b> when certain sets of crystals begin yielding before others. It is demonstrated that the progression of yielding in different sets of crystals is influenced by a combination of the single crystal elastic and plastic anisotropies, which can be quantified by the directional strength-to-stiffness ratio [1]. Chapter 2 examines the evolution of the lattice strains and the crystal scale stress distributions in fcc polycrystals under fully-reversed, strain-controlled cyclic loading with respect to the concepts of the directional strength-to-stiffness ratio [1] and the vertices of the single crystal yield surface [2], which have previously only been applied to monotonic tensile loading. These two concepts are derived from the single crystal elastic and plastic anisotropic properties and are used to explain observed behaviors in the lattice strain response such as the size and shape of the lattice strain hysteresis loops. Chapter 3 presents a coordinated approach to quantifying the evolution of lattice strains in an AA 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloy under in situ zero-tension cyclic loading using high-energy synchotron x-ray diffraction experiments and crystal-based finite element simulations.

40|$|International audienceA novel {{approach}} for correcting both spatial and drift distortions that {{are present in}} scanning electron microscope (SEM) images is described. Spatial distortion removal is performed using a methodology that employs a series of in-plane rigid body motions and a generated warping function. Drift distortion removal is performed using multiple, time-spaced images to extract the time-varying relative displacement field throughout the experiment. Results from numerical simulations clearly demonstrate that the correction procedures successfully remove both spatial and drift distortions. Specifically, {{in the absence of}} intensity noise the distortion removal methods consistently give excellent results with errors on the order of +/- 0. 01 pixels. Results from the rigid body motion and tensile loading experiments at 200 x indicate that, after correction for distortions, (a) the displacements have nearly random variability {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 02 pixels; (b) the measured strain fields are unbiased and in excellent agreement with previous full-field experimental data obtained with optical illumination; (c) the strain field variability is on the order of 60 microstrain in all components with a spatial resolution on the order of 25 pixels. Taken together, the analytical, computational and experimental studies clearly show that the correction procedures successfully remove both spatial and drift distortions while retaining excellent spatial resolution, confirming that the SEM-based method can be used for both micromaterial and nanomaterial characterization in either the elastic or <b>elastic-plastic</b> deformation <b>regimes...</b>|$|R

The onset of plastic flow is observed at sharp corners of the particles and is followed by localization of strain between particles. Clustering of particles generates more inhomogeneous plastic strain in the matrix. Particle stress estimated by Raman technique is in agreement with FEM calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the crack-front response during sustained ductile tearing in structural metals at quasi-static rates using high resolution finite element computations. At load levels approaching the steady-growth regime, well-established computational methods that model material damage break down numerically as vanishingly small load increments produce increasingly {{large amounts of}} crack extension. The computational model adopted here determines the deformation history of a steadily advancing crack directly {{without the need for}} a priori (transient) analysis that considers blunting of the pre-existing stationary crack and subsequent growth through the associated initial plastic zone. Crack extension occurs at the remotely applied, fixed loading without the need for a local growth criteria. This numerical scheme utilizes a streamline integration technique to determine the elastic-plastic fields, generalized from a two-dimensional to a fully three-dimensional setting and implemented within mixed Matlab/C++/F- 90 based software. Modifications of the conventional finite element formulation lead to an efficient procedure [...] readily parallelized [...] and determine the invariant near-front fields, representative of steady-state growth, on a fixed mesh in a boundary-layer framework. In the small-scale yielding regime, the crack front does not sense the existence of remote boundaries, and computational results retain a strong transferability among various geometric configurations where near-front, plastic deformation remains entirely enclosed by the surrounding linear-elastic material. The global stress intensity factor (KI) and imposed T-stress fully specify displacement constraints along the far-field boundary, and in a three-dimensional setting, the panel thickness reflects the only natural length scale. The initial studies in this work consider steady crack advance within the small-scale yielding context under plane-strain conditions and mode I loading. These analyses focus on steady crack growth within a hydrogen-charged material to explore primary features of the streamline integration methodology while providing new results relevant to hydrogen embrittlement at engineering scales. Ductile crack propagation occurs through a homogeneous, high solubility material characteristic of niobium and through a steel weld in the presence of hydrogen. The constitutive model includes the influence of hydrogen on <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>regimes</b> of material response at the continuum level, e. g. hydrogen-induced material softening, based on the hydrogen-enhanced, localized plasticity (HELP) mechanism, and reflects the amount of hydrogen in the material under stress and the intensity of hydrogen-induced softening in the material. Achievements using this two-dimensional framework encouraged further extensions of the research to a fully three-dimensional setting. Subsequent work, and the focal point of this thesis, develops a finite element formulation to investigate key features of the elastic-plastic fields near a steadily advancing crack under three-dimensional, small-scale yielding conditions. The computational model represents a structurally thin component constructed of a material (e. g. Al and Ti alloys) with flow stress and fracture toughness properties that together limit the size of the in-plane plastic zone during steady growth to no more than several multiples of the plate thickness. These studies consider a straight crack front advancing under local and global mode-I loading in a moderately hardening material. The nonsingular T-stress provides a first-order estimate of geometry and loading mode (e. g. tension vs. bending) effects on elastic-plastic, crack front fields. The T-stress has a marked effect on measured crack-growth resistance curves (J-da) [...] trends most computational models confirm using a two-dimensional setting. In the first computations of this type to be modeled, the 3 D numerical results here demonstrate similarity scaling of the crack front response [...] stresses, strains, and displacements [...] in terms of two non-dimensional loading parameters. These fields serve as input to key engineering failure models for brittle and ductile crack growth and provide estimates of the apparent fracture toughness linked to changes of the material flow response, geometry, and applied loading.

40|$|AbstractA new {{formulation}} for elastic-perfectly plastic {{contact in}} the normal direction between two round surfaces that is solely based on material properties and contact geometries is developed. The problem is formulated as three separate domains: the elastic regime, mixed elastic–plastic behavior, and unconstrained (fully plastic) flow. Solutions for the force–displacement relationship in the elastic regime follow from Hertz’s classical solution. In the fully plastic regime, two well supported assumptions are made: {{that there is a}} uniform pressure distribution and there is a linear force–deflection relationship. The force–displacement relationship in the intermediate, mixed <b>elastic–plastic</b> <b>regime</b> is approximated by enforcing continuity between the elastic and fully plastic regimes. Transitions between the three regimes are determined based on empirical quantities: the von Mises yield criterion is used to determine the initiation of mixed elastic–plastic deformation, and Brinell’s hardness for the onset of unconstrained flow. Unloading from each of these three regimes is modeled as an elastic process with different radii of curvature based on the regime in which the maximum force occurred. Simulation results explore the relationship between the impact velocity and coefficient of restitution. Further comparisons are made between the model, experimental results found in the literature, and other existing elastic–plastic models. The new model is well supported by the experimental measurements of compliance curves for elastic–plastic materials and of coefficients of restitution from impact studies, and in elastic-perfectly plastic regimes is demonstrated to be more accurate than existing models found in the literature...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA phenomenological {{study of}} {{parabolic}} and spherical indentation of elastic ideally plastic materials {{was carried out}} by using precise results of finite elements calculations. The study shows that no "pseudo-Hertzian" regime occurs during spherical indentation. As soon as the yield stress of the indented material is exceeded, a deviation from the,purely elastic Hertzian contact behaviour is found. Two elastic-plastic regimes and two plastic regimes are observed for materials of very large Young modulus to Yield stress ratio, E/σy. The first <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>regime</b> corresponds to a strong evolution of the indented plastic zone. The first plastic regime corresponds to the commonly called "fully plastic regime", in which the average indentation pressure is constant and equal to about three times the yield stress of the indented material. In this regime, the contact depth to penetration depth ratio tends toward a constant value, i. e. hc/h= 1. 47. hc/h is only constant for very low values of yield strain (σy/E lower than 5. 10 - 6) when aE*/Rσy is higher than 10, 000. The second plastic regime corresponds to a decrease in the average indentation pressure and to a steeper increase in the pile-up. For materials with very large E/σy ratio, the second plastic regime appears when the value of the nondimensional contact radius a/R is lower than 0. 01. In the case of spherical and parabolic indentation, results show that the first plastic regime exists only for elastic-ideally plastic materials having an E/σy ratio higher than approximately 2. 000...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhat {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a Hertzian contact can undergo plasticity either at the macroscale, due to an accidental overload, or at an asperity scale, due to the presence of surface defects and/or roughness. An elastic solution does not explicitly consider the surface velocity or loading history, but it is also apparent that a moving (rolling) load will not yield the same residual stress and strain distribution as a purely vertical loading/unloading. Three-dimensional (3 D) analysis is also more complex than the two-dimensional (2 D) problem because it implies a change in the surface conformity. This paper presents the results of a numerical investigation of frictionless elastic-plastic elliptical point contacts with a moving load, as compared to a purely vertical (indentation) load. In the present analysis, both bodies may behave in an elastic-plastic mode. Both kinematic and isotropic hardening are considered to account for repeated rolling contacts. The contact pressure and the plastic strain are found to be reduced when the two bodies are elastic-plastic, as compared to the case in which one of the bodies remains elastic. Numerical results also indicate that at a given load intensity, the maximum contact pressure and equivalent plastic strain are affected by the contact geometry (circular and elliptical point contacts) and differ significantly when the load is moving as compared to purely vertical indentation. Although the maximum elastic contact pressure (Hertz solution) is often used as a control parameter for rolling contact fatigue analysis, whatever the geometry of the contact (point, elliptical, or line contact), the results presented here show that the effective contact pressure and subsequent residual strains are strongly dependent on the contact geometry in the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Johnson's {{expanding}} cavity model {{estimates the}} hardness of a perfectly plastic material in a regime called elastic plastic. This relationship is obtained by a differential analysis associated with self-similar {{nature of the}} conical indentation. As a first step we obtain a similar result by studying a particular state of the indentation associated with {{the balance of the}} hydrostatic core. This new formulation is based on the equivalence between the volume displaced by the indenter and the volume compressed elastically in the solid. In a second step, this principle of equivalence of the displaced volume is used {{to take into account the}} presence of a piling-up. The volume displaced by the indenter is equal to the volume compressed elastically in the following zones: the hydrostatic core, elastic zone and plastic zone in which the additional volume of the piling-up must be added. With the knowledge of the contact height obtained by finite element model, which leads to the determination of the volume of the piling-up, the new fundamental relationship is applied to a material with a very low yield stress. The characteristic of this material is similar to that of a rigid perfectly plastic material. By decreasing the cone angle, the indentation regimes are successively the pseudo-elastic regime, <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>regime</b> and purely plastic regime. The Johnson's model only describes the elastic plastic regime. The new formulation describes the elastic plastic regime and the regime called "purely plastic" where the mean pressure is constant. On the basis of our results, this regime seems not to be a purely plastic regime but rather a plastic elastic regime. This result is in agreement with the results of the study of the influence of Poisson's ratio we have already done...|$|E
40|$|One mode {{by which}} a {{structure}} can fail in an unstable manner is ductile crack propagation from a pre-existing defect. Two approaches have been suggested to predict the conditions for such an instability. These are the T approach of Paris et al. and the I approach of Turner. The Paris T approach {{is based on the}} stability of the equilibrium state between the applied value of the J integral and the J versus crack extension material resistance curve. Under linear elastic conditions instability may be interpreted as occurring when the second differential of available energy (with respect to crack extension) exceeds that required for crack extension. In the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>regime</b> this interpretation is lost and the tearing modulus approach uses the J integral as a crack tip field characterising parameter. The Turner approach, on the other hand, is based on the balance between the energies available and required for crack extension. Under linear-elastic conditions instability occurs when the first differential of available energy exceeds that required for crack extension. Under elastic-plastic conditions the Turner approach continues to be an energy balance with the driving force being the elastic energy release rate, I, rather than the linear-elastic energy release rate, G. A comparison of the two approaches has been carried out by re-analysing the instability results of Paris et al., obtained using single-edge-notched, three-point bend specimens under conditions where the J integral can be considered as a crack tip field characterising parameter. Under these conditions both approaches, although based on different assumptions, are numerically similar and the predicted conditions for instability are in good agreement with experimental results. In addition, the two approaches are shown to be numerically similar for the case of centre-cracked tension specimens under limit load conditions. This agreement in two geometries of differing constraint gives tentative support for the generality of this result...|$|E
40|$|Multiphase flows {{are fairly}} complex {{and they are}} usually studied as a bulk. In this thesis, these flows are {{approached}} by looking at single particle interactions (particle-particle and particle-wall). This work presents experimental measurements of the approach and rebound of a particle colliding with a "deformable' surface in a viscous liquid. The complex interaction between the fluid and the solid phases is coupled through {{the dynamics of the}} flow as well as the deformation process. A simple pendulum experiment was used to produced single controlled collisions; steel particles were used to impact different aluminum alloy samples (Al- 6061, Al- 2024, and Al- 7075) using different aqueous mixtures of glycerol and water as a viscous fluid. The velocity of the particle before and after the collision was estimated by post-processing the particle position recorded with a high speed camera. For the combination of materials proposed, the elastic limit is reached at relatively low velocities. The deformations produced by the collision were analyzed using an optical profilometer. The measurements showed that the size of the indentations is independent of the fluid media. It was found that the size of the indentations was the same for collisions in air than {{for the rest of the}} collisions using various viscous fluids. The results show that the plastic deformation is only a function of the impact velocity and the material properties. The normal coefficient of restitution and deformation parameters account for losses due to lubrication effect and inelasticity, identifying then, the dominant energy loss mechanism during the collision process. According to the strain imposed in the samples due to the collision, the deformations were either elastic or elastic-plastic. The equivalent load due to the impact velocities used in this work did not reach the fully-plastic regime. For the collisions in air, different models were used to compare the experimental results showing that the <b>elastic-plastic</b> <b>regime</b> is not well characterized by only the material properties and the impact velocity. The time-resolved contact force was measured during the process of the indentation for the dry collision experiments using a quartz load transducer. The experiments clearly show four different regimes depending on the impact Stokes number: lubrication effect and elastic deformation, lubrication effect and elastic-plastic deformation, elastic deformation with no hydrodynamic effects, and elastic-plastic deformation with negligible lubrication effect. An analysis of the erosion of ductile materials during immersed collisions is presented. The size of the crater formed by the impact of a single particle against a ductile target can be estimated from theory, and these estimates agree well with experimental measurements...|$|E
