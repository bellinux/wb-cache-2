40|$|Background: Family {{members of}} Enterobacteriaceae {{are found in}} small numbers {{associated}} with acute diarrhea. These species are sometimes mistaken for ETEC. ^ Methods: Forty-four non-E. coli species from travelers 2 ̆ 7 diarrhea are compared to 30 strains of Escherichia coli (ETEC) and 30 strains of normal flora E. coli. Tissue culture supernatants were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for amounts of IL- 8, IL- 1, and IL- 1 ra. Amounts of heat-stable (ST) and heat-labile (LT) enterotoxins were assayed from cell culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunoassay. PCR was use to determine which species was positive colonization factor antigens, CFA/I, CS 3, and CS 6. ^ Results: Normal flora E. coli significantly induced the production of more IL- 8 than non- E. coli and ETEC. Normal E. coli also induced the production of more IL- 1 and IL- 1 ra than ETEC. Non-E. coli produced more ST than ETEC. A small percentage of enterotoxigenic non- E. coli <b>gram</b> <b>negatives</b> and ETEC were positive for CFA/I and CS 6. None of the strains were positive for CS 3. ^ Conclusions: Non-E. coli enterotoxigenic <b>gram</b> <b>negatives</b> were similar to ETEC in their virulence factors. Identification and further study of these non-E. coli strains is important for understanding their pathogenic role in acute diarrhea. ...|$|R

Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella, along with an outer membrane similar to other Gram-negative bacteria. Because of their double-membrane envelope, Borrelia bacteria are often mistakenly described as <b>Gram</b> <b>negative</b> despite the considerable differences in their envelope components from Gram-negative bacteria.

Interactions mediated through signaling molecules are also thought to occur between the gut flora and their host, {{as part of their}} commensal or symbiotic relationship. <b>Gram</b> <b>negative</b> microbes deploy bacterial outer membrane vesicles for intra- and inter-species signaling in natural environments and at the host-pathogen interface.|$|E
25|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs), {{also called}} host defense peptides (HDPs) {{are part of}} the innate immune response found among all classes of life. Fundamental differences exist between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may represent targets for antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are potent, broad spectrum antibiotics which demonstrate potential as novel therapeutic agents. Antimicrobial peptides have been demonstrated to kill <b>Gram</b> <b>negative</b> and Gram positive bacteria, enveloped viruses, fungi and even transformed or cancerous cells. Unlike the majority of conventional antibiotics it appears as though antimicrobial peptides may also have the ability to enhance immunity by functioning as immunomodulators.|$|E

25|$|Endotoxemia is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of colic and warrants aggressive treatment. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) is released from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria when they die. Normally, endotoxin is prevented from entering systemic circulation by the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa, antibodies and enzymes which bind and neutralize it and, for the small amount that manages to enter the blood stream, removal by Kupffer cells in the liver. Endotoxemia occurs {{when there is an}} overgrowth and secondary die-off of <b>gram</b> <b>negative</b> bacteria, releasing mass quantities of endotoxin. This is especially common when the mucosal barrier is damaged, as with ischemia of the GI tract secondary to a strangulating lesion or displacement. Endotoxemia produces systemic effects such as cardiovascular shock, insulin resistance, and coagulation abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{sinusitis}} {{is usually}} precipitated by an earlier {{upper respiratory tract}} infection, generally of viral origin, mostly caused by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses, others caused by adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, and metapneumovirus. If the infection is of bacterial origin, the most common three causative agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Until recently, Haemophilus influenzae {{was the most common}} bacterial agent to cause sinus infections. However, introduction of the H. influenza type B (Hib) vaccine has dramatically decreased H. influenza type B infections and now non-typable H. influenza (NTHI) are predominantly seen in clinics. Other sinusitis-causing bacterial pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus and other streptococci species, anaerobic bacteria and, less commonly, <b>gram</b> <b>negative</b> bacteria. Viral sinusitis typically lasts for 7 to 10 days, whereas bacterial sinusitis is more persistent. Approximately 0.5% to 2% of viral sinusitis results in subsequent bacterial sinusitis.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of antimicrobial stewardship programs on the multidrug resistance patterns of bacterial isolates. The study comprised an initial retrospective analysis of multidrug resistance in bacterial isolates for one year (July 2007 -June 2008) followed by prospective evaluation of the impact of Antimicrobial Stewardship programs on resistance for two years and nine months (July 2008 -March 2011). Setting A 300 -bed tertiary care private hospital in Gurgaon, Haryana (India) Findings Methods Study Design • July 2007 to June 2008 : Resistance patterns of bacterial isolates were studied. • July 2008 : Phase I intervention programme Implementation of an antibiotic policy in the hospital. • July 2008 to June 2010 : Assessment of the impact of the Phase I intervention programme. • July 2010 to March 2011 : Phase II intervention programme: Formation and effective functioning of the antimicrobial stewardship committee. Statistical correlation of the Defined daily dose (DDD) for prescribed drugs with the antimicrobial resistance of <b>Gram</b> <b>negatives.</b> Results Phase I intervention programme (July 2008) resulted in a decrease of 4. 47 % in ESBLs (E. coli and Klebsiella) and a significant decrease of 40. 8 % in carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas. Phase II intervention (July 2010) brought a significant reduction (24. 7 %) in carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas. However, the resistance in the other <b>Gram</b> <b>negatives</b> (E. coli, Klebsiella, and Acinetobacter) rose and then stabilized. A positive correlation was observed in Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter with carbapenems and cefoperazone-sulbactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam showed a positive correlation with Acinetobacter only. E. coli and Klebsiella showed positive correlation with cefoparazone-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam.
