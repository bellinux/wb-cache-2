I {{probably}} shouldn't {{have done that}} picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, {{and this was the}} structure to do them in. There was so much room to create a world. But I got strong indications from Raffaella and Dino De Laurentiis of what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> they expected, and I knew I didn't have final cut.|$|E
25|$|Shyamalan had {{an early}} {{desire to be}} a filmmaker when he was given a Super 8 camera at a young age. Though his father wanted him to follow in the family {{practice}} of medicine, his mother encouraged him to follow his passion. By the time he was seventeen, the Steven Spielberg fan had made forty-five home movies. On each DVD release of his films (beginning with The Sixth Sense and with the exception of Lady in the Water), he has included a scene from one of these childhood movies, which he feels represents his first attempt at the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E
25|$|The film {{rights were}} picked up by Rogue Pictures in 2006, with the remake being the first film {{produced}} by Wes Craven's new production studio Midnight Pictures. Craven, who wrote and directed the 1972 original, was interested to see what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> could be produced on a large budget, as the limited funds in 1972 forced him to eliminate scenes {{he had wanted to}} film to tell a complete story. Alleca's original script included elements of the supernatural, which prompted the studio to reject it and bring in Ellsworth to perform a rewrite. One of the elements director Iliadis wanted to avoid with this film, given its graphic nature, was turning it into torture porn — a subgenre of horror popularized by the Saw franchise. For Craven and Iliadis, The Last House on the Left primarily illustrates how even the most normal of families can be driven to evil acts if pushed too far.|$|E

500|$|Ugetsu {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a masterwork of Japanese cinema and a definitive piece during Japan's Golden Age of Film. It {{is one of a}} number of films that is arguably more popular in western countries than it is in Japan. Japanese film historian Tadao Satō remarked that while this film, along with Mizoguchi's other works of the period The Crucified Lovers and Sansho the Bailiff, was probably not meant specifically to be sold to westerners as an [...] "exotic" [...] piece, it was perceived by studio executives as the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> that would not necessarily make a profit in Japanese theaters but would win awards at international film festivals.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Lee {{writes that}} Hitler's {{vision of the}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> that was likely to engage the German public proved to be less {{effective}} than the more subtle approach advocated by Goebbels. For example, the documentary film Der Ewige Jude (The Eternal Jew) that Hitler commissioned was so crude and strident that many audiences were repelled by the grotesque imagery and the film was a box-office flop. The failure of Der Ewige Jude convinced Goebbels that the most effective approach for disseminating propaganda was subtle and indirect. Lee writes that Goebbels had learned to [...] "introduce propaganda as a subliminal message {{within the context of}} a story with which the audience could identify." [...] The Nazi antisemitic message was more subtly and artfully presented in the feature film format that Goebbels preferred.|$|E

500|$|Tender Mercies {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Richard Corliss of Time {{declared it}} the [...] "best American {{movie of the}} new year". Carol Olten of The San Diego Union-Tribune declared Tender Mercies the best movie of 1983, and [...] "the most poignant, but forthright, film of the year, with a brilliant performance by Robert Duvall". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This is a small, lovely and somewhat overloaded film about small-town life, loneliness, country music, marriage, divorce and parental love, and it deals {{with all of these}} things in equal measure. Still, the absence of a single, sharply dramatic story line is a relatively {{small price to pay for}} the plainness and clarity with which these other issues are defined." [...] She also praised Beresford's direction, which she said lent the movie a light touch. The Times Canby wrote, [...] "In all respects Tender Mercies is so good that it has the effect of rediscovering a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>film</b> fiction that has been debased over the decades by hack moviemakers, working according to accepted formulas, frequently to the applause of the critics as well as the public." [...] Leonard Maltin gave it three out of four stars, applauding Duvall in particular and describing it as a [...] "winning but extremely low-key film", though he characterized Foote's screenplay as [...] "not so much a story as a series of vignettes". David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor praised the film for its values, for underscoring the good in people and for avoiding flashiness and quick cuts in favor of a subtle and deliberately paced story, while maintaining a PG rating and omitting sex, drugs and violence. He also felt, however, that it tended toward melodrama on a few occasions and that the soundtrack had [...] "a bit of syrupy music ... especially at the end".|$|E
