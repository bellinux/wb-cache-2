[...] If the Crown Prince should die early, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one of the princes would not be your lord in the future. [...] How can you disrespect them?" [...] Wei, seeing what was happening, spoke bluntly, [...] "Ever since Zhou Dynasty, succession is always from father to son, not to brothers, to prevent plotting by younger sons and stop infighting at their origin. [...] This is what the rulers need to be careful about." [...] Emperor Taizong thereafter approved Wang's proposal.|$|E
