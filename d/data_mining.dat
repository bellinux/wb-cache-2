40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} are usually deployed for monitoring given physical phenomena {{taking place in}} a specific space and over a specific duration of time. The spatio-temporal distribution of these phenomena often correlates to certain physical events. To appropriately characterise these events-phenomena relationships over a given space for a given time frame, we require continuous monitoring of the conditions. WSNs are perfectly suited for these tasks, due to their inherent robustness. This paper presents a subtractive fuzzy cluster means algorithm and its application in <b>data</b> stream <b>mining</b> for wireless sensor systems over a cloud-computing-like architecture, which we call sensor cloud <b>data</b> stream <b>mining.</b> Benchmarking on standard mining algorithms, the k-means and the FCM algorithms, we have demonstrated that the subtractive fuzzy cluster means model can perform high quality distributed <b>data</b> stream <b>mining</b> tasks comparable to centralised <b>data</b> stream <b>mining...</b>|$|R
