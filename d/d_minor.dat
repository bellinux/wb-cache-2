5|$|In 1891, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} his Piano Concerto No. 1 (which {{became his}} first official opus) and afterwards in July, a small piece, Prelude in Fmajor, which he revised later {{to include the}} cello. It was at this time, in 1892, that the Morceaux de fantaisie were composed. In 1891 Rachmaninoff also composed his Suite in <b>D</b> <b>minor</b> for orchestra, considered lost until the manuscript was found in 2002, leading to the discovery that a previously-unattributed composition for piano is a reduction for solo piano of this Suite. The suite is in four movements: Lento: Allegro moderato in <b>D</b> <b>minor,</b> Lento in B minor, Menuetto in F-sharp major, and Allegro in D major.|$|E

The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have {{had anything to do with}} the death of his parents in the mid-1880s.

Fitting’s Lemma {{shows that}} the “Fitting ideal,” the ideal of <b>d</b> × <b>d</b> <b>minors</b> of φ, annihilates the cokernel of φ and is a good approximation to the whole annihilator in a certain sense. In characteristic 0 we define a Fitting ideal in the more general case of a map of graded free modules over a Z/ 2 -graded skew-commutative algebra and prove corresponding theorems about the annihilator; for example, the Fitting ideal and the annihilator of the cokernel are equal in the generic case. Our results generalize the classical Fitting Lemma in the commutative case and extend a key result of Green (1999) in the exterior algebra case. They depend on the Berele-Regev theory of representations of general linear Lie superalgebras. In the purely even and purely odd cases we also offer a standard basis approach to the module coker φ when φ is a generic matrix...|$|R
5|$|I. Molto moderato. This {{movement}} {{employs a}} three-key exposition. The first theme introduces a G-flat trill that anticipates the following harmonic events – {{a shift to}} G-flat major in the central section of the main theme, and, after {{a return to the}} tonic, an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor {{at the start of the}} second theme. After a colorful harmonic excursion, the third tonal area arrives in the traditional dominant key (F major). In contrast to the previous sonatas, here the development section elaborates on several different themes from the exposition. It reaches a dramatic climax in <b>D</b> <b>minor,</b> in which the first theme is presented, fluctuating between <b>D</b> <b>minor</b> and the home key, in a manner similar to the parallel passage from the previous sonata (see above). In the recapitulation, the bass line in the first theme rises to B-flat instead of descending to F (as in the exposition), and the second theme enters in B minor, instead of F-sharp minor. The rest of the exposition is repeated without alterations, transposed a fourth up, meaning that it returns to the home key, B-flat, for the third tonal area. The coda once again recalls the first theme, although only fragmentarily.|$|E

5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures.

The Prelude in <b>D</b> <b>minor,</b> a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution.

Bülow conducted two concerts, Edward Dannreuther led the orchestra in two concerts. August Manns, the conductor of a series of orchestral concerts held at the Crystal Palace and an admirer of Liszt's works, led four concerts. The majority of instrumentalists engaged were also members of the Crystal Palace orchestra to ensure the level of performance was as high as possible. Among guest soloists was the noted violinist August Wilhelmj, who played the Bach Chaconne in <b>D</b> <b>minor</b> at one concert.|$|E
5|$|Beer's first {{keyboard}} instructor was Franz Lauska, a pupil of Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and a favoured {{teacher at}} the Berlin court.

5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in <b>D</b> <b>minor,</b> optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E

The concerto consists of three movements. The first, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Mozart's earlier concertos. The second movement, Larghetto, is in the relative major of E-flat and features a strikingly simple principal theme. The final movement, Allegretto, returns to the home key of C minor and presents a theme followed by eight variations.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{supported}} {{himself as}} an organist at the English Church, where the chaplain had previously known Bache's brother Edward. As {{his reputation as a}} performer grew, he also came into demand as a teacher. These two activities guaranteed financial security. He also became acquainted with several young gifted musicians, including fellow Liszt pupil Giovanni Sgambati and violinist Ettore Pinelli. During this time, Bache began exploring the two-piano repertoire, especially the arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poem Les préludes and Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy, which he performed with Sgambati in concert. The two-piano arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poems would become an important feature of Bache's concert series once he returned to England. He was also active in chamber music—the works he performed during this time include Chopin's cello sonata, the David-Pinelli Violin Variations, Mendelssohn's <b>D</b> <b>minor</b> piano trio, a piano trio by Anton Rubinstein and a Schumann violin sonata arranged for viola.|$|E
