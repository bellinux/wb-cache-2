5|$|Stefanie Rabatsch (née Isak; born 28 December 1887 – died unknown, after 1973) was an Austrian {{woman who}} was alleged by August Kubizek {{to have been an}} unrequited love of then-teenage Adolf Hitler. Her Jewish-sounding maiden name has been subject to {{speculation}} in this context. However, there is no evidence apart from Kubizek that Hitler ever <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> attachment.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the US Navy {{sought to}} acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from {{aircraft}} carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, but only the smaller Little Boy bomb; {{it could only be}} operated by the large Midway class aircraft carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no tailhook, so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have to end with it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Navy {{had been}} tasked with {{building}} a rocket to lift satellites into orbit, but the resulting Vanguard rocket launch system was unreliable. In 1957, with {{the launch of}} Sputnik 1, a growing belief within the United States existed that it was lagging behind the Soviet Union in the emerging Space Race. American authorities then chose to use von Braun and his German team's experience with missiles to create an orbital launch vehicle.

He <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> itch to race that he disguised himself as a lady and entered a Powderpuff Division Race when he was 15. In 2011, he drove for Tommy Baldwin Racing in the Sprint Cup Series, alternating between the Nos. 35 and 36 teams, with sponsorship from Luke & Associates.|$|E
25|$|In 1857, Auguste Mariette, {{founder of}} the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, {{unearthed}} the much later Inventory Stela (estimated DynastyXXVI, c.678–525BC), which tells how Khufu came upon the Sphinx, already buried in sand. Although certain tracts on the Stela are considered good evidence, this passage is widely dismissed as Late Period historical revisionism, a purposeful fake, created by the local priests with the attempt to certify the contemporary Isis temple an ancient history it never <b>had.</b> <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> act became common when religious institutions such as temples, shrines and priest's domains were fighting for political attention and for financial and economic donations.|$|E

Bhumibol's birthday (5 December) was declared the national day, replacing the previous national day, {{the anniversary of the}} Siamese revolution of 1932 (24 June). Upon Sarit's death on 8 December 1963, an unprecedented 21 days of mourning were declared in the palace. A royal five-tier umbrella shaded his body while it lay in state.

While the DG had prima facie {{evidence to show that}} the goods had not been exported, the applicant had submitted his own evidence to rebut this finding. The nature and effect of the evidence was to nullify the factual basis upon which the DG had made his decision. It was sufficient that the applicant's evidence <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> effect, and the DG, in failing to recognize this while placing undue weight on his own evidence, had misdirected himself as to the nature and effect of the evidence required to prove the export of the goods.|$|E
25|$|Gasparotto and Moduco {{would not}} be the only victims of Montefalco's investigations, however, for during late 1581 he had heard of a widow living in Udine named Anna la Rossa. While she did not claim to be a benandante, she did claim that she could see and {{communicate}} with the spirits of the dead, and so Montefalco had her brought in for questioning on 1 January 1582. Initially denying that she <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> ability to the inquisitor, she eventually relented and told him of how she believed that she could see the dead, and how she sold their messages to members of the local community willing to pay, using the money in order to alleviate the poverty of her family. Although Montefalco intended to interrogate her again at a later date, the trial ultimately remained permanently unfinished.|$|E
25|$|When {{treasure}} has {{vested in}} the Crown and {{is to be}} transferred to a museum, the Secretary of State is required to determine whether a reward should be paid by the museum before the transfer to the finder or any other person involved in the finding of the treasure, the occupier of the land {{at the time of the}} find, or any person who had an interest in the land at the time of the find or has <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> interest at any time since then. If the Secretary of State determines that a reward should be paid, he or she must also determine the market value of the treasure (assisted by the Treasure Valuation Committee), the amount of the reward (which cannot exceed the market value), to whom the reward should be paid and, if more than one person should be paid, how much each person should receive.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} hastily approved several special {{laws for}} {{use during the}} Stammheim trial. Lawyers were excluded from trial {{for the first time}} since 1945, after being accused of various inappropriate actions, such as helping to form criminal organisations (Section 129, Criminal Law). The authorities invaded and checked the lawyers' offices for possible incriminating material. Minister of Justice Hans-Jochen Vogel stated proudly that no other Western state <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extensive regulation to exclude defense attorneys from the trial. Klaus Croissant, Hans-Christian Ströbele, Kurt Groenewold, who had been working preparing for the trial for three years were expelled the second day of the trial. On 23 June (1975), Croissant, Ströbele (who had already been expelled) and Mary Becker were arrested, and in the meantime police invaded several defense attorneys' offices and homes, seizing several documents and files. Ströbele and Croissant were remanded and held for 4 weeks and 8 weeks accordingly. Croissant had to pay 80,000 Deutschmarks, to report weekly to police station as well as having his transport and identity papers seized.|$|E
25|$|Corinna {{breaks down}} and {{admits that she}} is unable to cope with their rebellious {{daughter}} and agrees that Jerome can look after her – especially as Nan/Zoe has <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> immediate impact. Eventually she confesses that she had hoped this meeting {{would lead to a}} reconciliation between her and Jerome. Jerome is delighted by this and tells Corinna that Nan/Zoe is only an actress. Corinna is hurt by the deception and calls Geain from the bedroom so that they can leave. Geain reveals that her discovery that Nan/Zoe is actually an android – but she likes her and wants to stay with her. Under Mervyn's questioning Jerome explains that Nan/Zoe is a NAN 300F. Mervyn explains that the company which made them went out of business following a tragic incident with a baby. Jerome argues in defence of Nan/Zoe but Mervyn and Corinna try to separate her from Geain. Geain doesn't want to be separated. Nan/Zoe mistakes Mervyn for a child molester and knocks him unconscious for a while.|$|E
25|$|After {{the arrival}} of William the Conqueror in England in 1066, the whole of England was quickly {{subjected}} to Norman rule. However, in Northumbria there was great resistance to the Normans, and in 1069 the newly appointed Norman Earl of Northumbria, Robert de Comines and 700 of his men {{were killed by the}} local population at Durham. The Northumbrians then marched on York, but William was able to suppress the uprising. That same year, a second uprising occurred when a Danish fleet landed in the Humber. The Northumbrians again attacked York and destroyed the garrison there. William was again able to suppress the uprising, but this time he took revenge. He laid waste to the whole of the Midlands and the land from York to the Tees. In 1080, William Walcher, the Norman bishop of Durham and his followers were brutally murdered at Gateshead. This time Odo, bishop of Bayeux, William’s half brother, devastated the land between the Tees and the Tweed. This was known as the ‘Harrying of the North’. This devastation is reflected in the Domesday Book. The destruction <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> effect that the North remained poor and backward at least until Tudor times and perhaps until the Industrial Revolution. Newcastle suffered in this respect {{with the rest of the}} North.|$|E
