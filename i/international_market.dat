5|$|These {{industrialization}} measures proved largely unsuccessful {{given that}} coca remained illegal in most nations outside Bolivia, thus depriving the growers of an <b>international</b> <b>market.</b> Campaigning against this, in 2012 Bolivia {{withdrew from the}} UN 1961 Convention which had called for global criminalisation of coca, and in 2013 successfully convinced the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs to declassify coca as a narcotic. The U.S. State Department criticised Bolivia, asserting that it was regressing in its counter-narcotics efforts, and dramatically reduced aid to Bolivia to $34 million to fight the narcotics trade in 2007. Nevertheless, the number of cocaine seizures in Bolivia increased under Morales' government, as they sought to encourage coca growers to report and oppose cocaine producers and traffickers. However, high levels of police corruption surrounding the illicit trade in cocaine remained a continuing problem for Bolivia.|$|E

Findings: <b>International</b> <b>marketing</b> in Sub-Sahara Africa is growing steadily, driven largely by rapid changes in socio-economic and demographic characteristics of consumers in this market.

5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in <b>international</b> <b>market</b> prices of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|Challenges for the {{localization}} teams include space limitation (due to {{data storage}} and/or on-screen space), achieving a natural dialogue flow despite multiple plot branches and script lines being stored out of order, and, when voiced footage is not re-recorded for lip movement, dealing with file length and lip-synch limitations. When {{the same team}} works on different games in a series such as Final Fantasy, they often need to adopt different writing styles depending on the setting of their games. Another point to consider is humorous elements that do not translate properly into English, and different cultural expectations about character interactions. The localization process depends on {{factors such as the}} development teams' wishes, as well as budget and schedule. Traditionally, translation usually started late in development or after the original Japanese release, but recent titles have been translated during initial development, making the translators appear more like additional planners or consultants and not just translators-this was the case for Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XV. A few titles, like The Bouncer, have actually been recorded in English first and then adapted to Japanese. The Last Remnant also adopted this approach, featuring motion-capture and dialogue synched to English rather than Japanese actors. This was done due to the company's wish to create a title for the <b>international</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E

50|$|Global {{marketing}} {{is not a}} revolutionary shift, it is an evolutionary process. While the following {{does not apply to}} all companies, it does apply to most companies that begin as domestic-only companies. <b>International</b> <b>marketing</b> has intensified and is evident for approximately nearly all aspects of consumer’s daily life. Local regions or national boundaries no longer restricted to the competitive forces. To be successful in today's globalized economy, it is a must for the companies to simultaneously be responsive to local as well as global market conditions and varying aspect’s related to the <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> process. Hence, <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> skills are an important ingredient for every company, {{whether or not it is}} currently involved in exporting the activities for the endorsement of the brand or the company. The internationalized marketplace has been transformed very quickly in recent years by shifts in trading techniques, standards and practices. These changes have been reinforced and retained by new technologies and evolving the economic relationships between the companies and the organizations which are working for the trade across the globe. This assignment project work is just an attempt to get integrate these developments and attempts in the field of the market journalism into the burgeoning literature on <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> process as well as on recent research findings on the <b>International</b> <b>marketing.</b> The research emphasis within the subject has evolved alongside changes in the stress given to key aspects of <b>international</b> trade <b>market.</b> The pre-occupation of early researchers with exports and selling is being replaced by a more balanced view which gives increasing weight to other aspects of <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> such as licensing, joint ventures, and overseas subsidiaries. In effect, the traditional ethnocentric conceptual view of <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> trade is being counterbalanced by a more accurate global view of markets. This process of change is tracked in this paper and the growing importance of a strategic and organizational approach to <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> is emphasized in this article theory. Focused attention is paid to the heterogeneous nature of <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> process. The diversity of the globalized situations is matched by the variety of enterprises which play a vital part in the marketing exploration process. There is also explanation focuses on the matching of the available company resources and marketing goals in successful <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> trade.

5|$|Increasingly, {{however, the}} ice trade {{began to focus}} on {{supplying}} the growing cities on the east coast of the U.S. and the needs of businesses across the Midwest. The citizens of New York City and Philadelphia became huge consumers of ice during their long, hot summers, and additional ice was harvested from the Hudson River and Maine to fulfil the demand. Ice began to be used in refrigerator cars by the railroad industry, allowing the meat packing industry around Chicago and Cincinnati to slaughter cattle locally, sending dressed meat east for either the internal or overseas markets. Chilled refrigerator cars and ships created a national industry in vegetables and fruit that could previously only have been consumed locally. American and British fishermen began to preserve their catches in ice, allowing longer voyages and bigger catches, and the brewing industry became operational all-year around. As U.S. ice exports diminished after 1870, Norway became {{a major player in the}} <b>international</b> <b>market,</b> shipping large quantities of ice to England and Germany.|$|E
