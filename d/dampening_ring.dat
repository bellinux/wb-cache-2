50|$|The RingMute is a <b>dampening</b> <b>ring</b> (Patent US 7049501 B2) that {{attaches}} to the bell rim of a standard Bb trumpet. Since the mute {{is attached to the}} outside of the trumpet and is not placed inside the trumpet, it is known as an external mute. The construction consists of a lightweight urethane foam ring held in place by an adhesive strip. The distinctive round shape of the RingMute is maintained over time by a cardboard (or similar material) round mold that is placed inside the <b>dampening</b> <b>ring</b> where the bell rim would normally go. The purpose of the RingMute is twofold:1)According to the University of New South Wales, Sydney Australia, the highest overtones that typically give the trumpet its brassy sound, are emitted at the bell rim.(Brass Acoustics: An Introduction(newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/brassacoustics.html). The absorbent foam <b>dampening</b> <b>ring</b> is attached to the bell rim of a Bb trumpet and assists in diminishing the higher overtones. This is helpful when performing in small areas where the sound of a trumpet can be overbearing but the performer wishes to maintain an open trumpet sound. 2)The other use of the RingMute is when practicing in apartments or close areas where the sound can be disturbing to others. An interesting feature that the RingMute possesses that many mutes do not is that intonation is basically unaltered. With almost all internal mutes such as Harmon, Straight, Cup, Renuzit, etc. that are fitted into the trumpet, the main tuning slide must be extended from its normal setting in order to be in tune. This adjustment is due to the opening of the trumpet bell being plugged. The RingMute <b>Dampening</b> <b>Ring</b> (by virtue of being an external mute and fitted onto the trumpet)requires no altering of the main tuning slide.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an active damping circuit {{which uses a}} 90 ° phase-shift feedback loop to <b>dampen</b> the <b>ringing</b> of nuclear resonance probes just after the RF excitation. The damping does not operate during the reception of the nuclear signal and there is therefore no loss in efficiency or in sensitivity as {{would be the case}} for permanent damping. The use of a high voltage FET as a gated duplexer to isolate the RF transmitter after the pulse is also described. The circuit damper is especially useful at low frequencies and {{we have been able to}} reduce the recovery time of a series resonant circuit (Q = 50) to less than 7 μs. at 3 MHz using this feedback scheme and the gated duplexer...|$|R
5000|$|The cymbals may {{be played}} by closing them {{together}} with the foot pedal, which creates a [...] "chck" [...] sound or striking them with a stick, which may be done with them open, closed, open and then closed after striking to <b>dampen</b> the <b>ring,</b> or closed and then opened to create a shimmering effect {{at the end of}} the note. Depending on how hard a hi-hat is struck and whether it is [...] "open" [...] (i.e., pedal not pressed, so the two cymbals are not closed together), a hihit can produce a range of dynamics, from very quiet [...] "chck" [...] (or [...] "chick") sounds, done with merely gently pressing the pedal; this is suitable for soft accompaniment during a ballad or the start of a guitar solo, to very loud (e.g. striking fully open hats hard with sticks, a technique used in loud heavy metal music songs).|$|R
40|$|One of {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} western world today is heart diseases, and {{atherosclerotic}} plaque that ruptures in the coronary arteries is believed {{to be one of the}} main causes of heart attacks. The Capacitive Micromachined Transducer has good acoustic matching with fluids, and is considered a good candidate for improving intravascular ultrasound diagnostics. Further evaluation and characterization of a CMUT operating in immersion has been the objective of this thesis, and it is a continuation of the work started in the project Characterization of Capacitive Ultrasound Transducers. The same CMUT have been studied in both, but a backing layer was added to it for the testing done during the work on this thesis. Pulse-echo measurements with the CMUT immersed in rapeseed oil have been performed, and there has also been conducted measurements to find the attenuation of the oil. The results from the attenuation measurements have then been employed to simplify the analysis of the pulse-echo measurements. Any definitive characteristics for the CMUT was not found during these tests due to disturbances in the frequency responses. This is suspected to be because of line resistances and parasitic capacitances in the system. This suspicion is supported by the findings from studying the impedance response of the system. The backing layer added to the CMUT have proved to be very effective in <b>dampening</b> the <b>ringing</b> effect on the pulses emitted by the CMUT. There have also been signs of unexpected alteration of the CMUTs frequency characteristics. One possible source of this is that the process of adding the backing layer have resulted in that the layer exerts force on the CMUT, and by this changing the tension of the membranes...|$|R
40|$|Constraints and {{uncertainties}} are presented for modeling of an ultralow-velocity zone layer (ULVZ) {{at the base}} of Earth's mantle using an SKS wave with small segments of P wave diffraction at the SKS core entry and exit locations, called SP_dKS. Source or receiver effects are ruled out as causes for the SP_dKS anomalies used to map ULVZ structure, since systematic SP_dKS-SKS travel time moveout behavior is present in profiles of recordings of a given earthquake at many seismographic stations and also for many events recorded at one station. The southwest Pacific region produces strong variability in observed SP_dKS/SKS amplitude ratios (compared to synthetic seismograms), which geographically corresponds to an anomalous ULVZ region. Accurate determination of absolute ULVZ thicknesses requires knowledge of, in addition to magnitude of P wave velocity (V_p) reduction in the layer, the magnitude of S wave velocity (V_S) reduction and density (ρ) perturbation (if any). Synthetic seismogram experiments demonstrate several key points regarding uncertainties and constraints in modeling ULVZ structure: (1) thicker layers (up to 300 km thick) with mild reductions (e. g., − 2. 5 to − 5. 0 %) cannot reproduce the anomalous SP_dKS behavior seen in the data; (2) for ULVZ layers less than 10 km thick, strong trade-offs exist between discontinuous velocity reductions and linear gradient reductions over a thicker zone; (3) uncertainties preclude precise determination of magnitude of δV_P and δV_S reductions, as well as the δV_S:δV_P ratio; (4) large density increases within the ULVZ (e. g., up to 60 % and more) can efficiently broaden and delay the peak of the energy that we identify as SP_dKS for models with strong velocity reductions in the layer; (5) models with extreme Q reductions in the ULVZ can affect SP_dKS waveforms, and <b>dampen</b> spurious <b>ringing</b> energy present in Sd waveshapes due to the ULVZ; and (6) the minimum required V_p reduction for the most anomalous data (around − 10 %) trades off with thinner ULVZ structures containing larger velocity reductions (with possible density increases as well) ...|$|R
