5000|$|The Fiat SOHC {{used the}} full gamut of {{induction}} techniques through its long production run. The original 128 and 138 series engines originally used a single <b>down-draught</b> <b>carburettor.</b> The carburettor was normally of progressive twin-choke design (two asymmetric sized chokes operated progressively) {{such as the}} Weber DMTR and DATR of the X1/9. Multi Point fuel Injection (MPI) was introduced late in the 138 series to help meet lowered emission requirements in the US. The original MPI system comprised a large cylindrical plenum running parallel to the engine with individual runners to each inlet port and a single throttle controlling air-flow into the plenum. This plenum was pressurised in the Mk I Uno Turbo. The plenum was slightly redesigned to a more angular [...] "box" [...] shape for the 3rd Generation engines and was again pressurised for the Uno and Punto GT Turbo models. For the 3rd Generation engines the down-draft carburettor was replaced with a Single Point fuel Injection system (SPI) in the base-level models. The SPI system mounts on a manifold {{similar to that of}} the carburetted models and looks, as well as acts, much like a single-choke carburettor with a single throttle plate but no venturi and a centrally mounted single injector.|$|E
50|$|This car was {{announced}} and a sample {{displayed at the}} October 1950 motor shows in Paris and at Earls Court on stand 145. Its full-width body was built on a Standard Vanguard chassis with an engine given twin <b>down-draught</b> <b>carburettors</b> and a higher output. This envelope type coachwork incorporated more power actuated components than any previous British car. Those components including: headlights concealed behind shutters automatically opened when the headlights were switched on; convertible head; windows; seat; and radio aerial.|$|R
50|$|Robin Hamilton built {{a second}} Le Mans styled DBS V8 car {{based on the}} look of RHAM/1 {{as it was in}} 1978. The car was {{assembled}} for Peter Griggs who wanted a replica of the car. The car, with chassis number DBSV8/10071/R featured a fibre glass front end and Piper prepared V8 engine, but the car had no turbocharger. Fuel injection was replaced by 48 IDA <b>down-draught</b> Weber <b>carburettors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Standard-Triumph {{experienced}} {{financial difficulties}} {{at the beginning}} of the 1960s and was taken over by Leyland Motors Ltd in 1961. This released new resources to develop the Herald and the car was re-launched in April 1961 with an 1147 cc engine as the Herald 1200. The new model featured rubber-covered bumpers, a wooden laminate dashboard and improved seating. Quality control was also tightened up. Twin carburettors were no longer fitted to any of the range as standard although they remained an option, the standard being a single <b>down-draught</b> Solex <b>carburettor.</b> Claimed maximum power of the Herald 1200 was , as against the [...] claimed for the 948 cc model. One month after the release of the Herald 1200, a 2-door estate was added to the range. Disc brakes became an option from 1962.|$|R
