However, MMF-related side effects often necessitate dose reduction, which may expose patients to {{a higher risk of}} acute rejection and graft loss. This study's aim was to examine the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> MMF dose <b>reduction</b> during the first post-transplant year and its impact on acute rejection, overall and death-censored graft loss. Methods: Single-center retrospective analysis of 749 renal transplant recipients treated with MMF in their initial maintenance immunosuppressive protocol. Results: In 365 patients (48. 7 %) a total of 530 MMF dose <b>reductions</b> were done. <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> were hematologic toxicity (46. 5 %), infection (16. 1 %), gastrointestinal side effects (12. 3 %), malignancy (2. 1 %), study protocol (14. 6 %), and unknown (13. 5 %). MMF dose reduction as such was not an independent predictor of acute rejection or graft survival, although reductions in ≥ 50 % of initial dose were significantly associated with acute rejection. Conclusions: In this retrospective cohort, by far the most important <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> MMF dose <b>reduction</b> during the first post-transplantation year was hematologic. MMF dose reductions in ≥ 50 % increased the risk of acute rejection but did not compromise graft survival. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|The {{accumulation}} of metals in the earthworm tissues {{might be the}} <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> of leachable concentration of metals during vermicomposting of S. natans. Similar results were also reported by Jain et al. (2004) and Singh and Kalamdhad (2013). The evidence of cutaneous absorption of metals by earthworms was reported by Suthar (2009). The leachability of metals might have also reduced due to increase in pH and complexity of metal humic substances. An increase in the pH of vermicompost resulted in an increase of surface negative charge, which increased cationic adsorption, formation of metal hydroxyl species that have a greater affinity for adsorption sites than the metal cations, and precipitation of metal as metal hydroxides (Maity et al. 2008). Another <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the <b>reduction</b> of leachable metal concentration during vermicomposting was the affinity of the metals with the functional groups –OH or –COO– of humic substances of the vermicompost (Kang et al. 2011). The threshold limits for heavy metal contamination are 20  mg/kg for Cd, 100  mg/kg for Cr and 100  mg/kg for Pb (US EPA method 1311, 1992). Therefore, {{the results of the}} TCLP test confirmed that the heavy metals’ concentrations in all trials were under the threshold limits for compost use for agriculture purposes.|$|R

In 2010, a blizzard severely damaged or killed many mangrove trees in southern China.

30|$|The {{diffusion}} and permeation of chlorides decrease with time. The main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> of chloride ingress can {{be summarized}} reduction of porosity which can block the chloride ion intrusion (Kwon et al. 2009; Thomas and Bamforth 1999), reduction of diffusion which makes the ion transport slow into the concrete (Yoon et al. 2017; Park et al. 2009), enhanced hydration which can make more absorption of chloride ions (Ishida et al. 2009; Leng et al. 2000), and decreasing gap of chloride ion concentration between {{the inner and outer}} boundary conditions which reduces the concentration gradient (Welty et al. 1989). The time-dependent diffusion has been studied for a long time with considering changing properties of concrete but they are focused only on crack-free concrete (Thomas and Bamforth 1999; Lingjie et al. 2017). Crack width also changes with time due to the steady reaction of cement hydration and auto-healing enhanced by relative humidity (Japan Society of Civil Engineering 2002).|$|R

Initially, particulate-free film surfaces obtained soon after rf sputter deposition in N- 2 ambient conditions becomes covered with microstructures, forming pores in the film when exposed to air. LiPON films are deposited on Ti coated silicon in addition to bare silicon, ruling out the possibility of stress-related rupturing from the LiPON/Si interface. The reduction of nitrogen, phosphorus, and increased presence of lithium, oxygen and carbon over the film surface lowers the ionic conductivity of LiPON films when exposed to air.

However, there was no change in mandibular intermolar width (Table  6). The authors in [9] stated that ankyloglossia limits the upward movement of the tongue, thus preventing the formation of lip seal during swallowing, leading to tongue thrusting, which in turn can cause open bite. Also, the upward movement of the tongue is necessary for the creation of normal width of the hard palate. Inability of the tongue to lift upward results in unrestricted buccinator muscle activity, resulting in constriction of maxillary arch, which could be the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> in maxillary intermolar width and intercanine width in group 1. Reduction of mandibular intercanine width can be due to pull of the short lingual frenum resulting in constriction of mandibular anterior region.

40|$|Abstract. We study Hydrogen sulfide gas {{detection}} properties of pure and 1 % copper oxide added WO 3 thin films. The spin coated deposits on alumina substrates were annealed at 500 °C for 1 hour {{in order to}} improve the crystallinity of the films. The sensitivity of pure tungsten oxide is poor even at temperatures of about 100 °C but the doped samples exhibit good response to H 2 S gas. Our data show sensitivity of about 1500 in 10 ppm diluted gas in air at 100 °C. The films are sensitive to the gas even at 250 ppb (sensitivity about 2) H 2 S concentration at 100 °C but with rather long recovery time. Crystal structure, morphology and chemical composition of samples were studied by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. We suggest that Cu 2 O dopants dissociate H 2 S molecules and spillover of the hydrogen atoms onto the cracked WO 3 surface. The reaction of dissociated H 2 S with adsorbed oxygen is the main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> of resistivity. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{acoustic}} noise emissions caused by the transformer operating {{as a part of}} DC/DC converter in an industrial resistance spot welding system. The discussed DC/DC converter is schematically shown in Fig. 1. The three-phase alternating voltages (u 1, u 2 and u 3) are rectified and smoothed in order to obtain almost constant DC-bus voltage UDC. The H-bridge inverter is used to supply the transformerćs primary winding with voltage pulses uH. The two transformerćs secondary windings are connected to the two output rectifier diodes (D 1 and D 2) which provide the direct welding current iL flowing through the load represented by LL and RL. A new control scheme forresistance spot welding systems was proposed in [1, 2]. During the testing of the proposed control scheme it became evident that the proposed control scheme not only improves utilization of the iron core and prevent it from becoming saturated, but also substantially reduces the acoustic noise emissions caused by the transformer. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>reduction</b> of acoustic noise emission are discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The most {{commonly}} used method for estimating the time domain parameters of an autoregressive pro-cess {{is to use the}} Yule-Walker equations. The Yule-Walker estimates of the parameters of an autoregressive process are known to often be highly biased. There is a Fourier transform relationship between the au-tocovariance sequence for an autoregressive process (the estimates of which are used in the Yule-Walker equations to estimate the time domain parameters) and the spectrum, a frequency domain representation of the autoregressive process. Tapering has been proven to reduce the bias of both the periodogram, a naive estimator of the spectrum, as well as the time domain parameter estimates. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the <b>reduction</b> in bias in the periodogram is intuitive, but no intuitive <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the similar <b>reduction</b> in the bias of the time domain estimators has previously been given.
