25|$|Metal {{tumbling}} {{is used to}} burnish, deburr, clean, radius, <b>de-flash,</b> descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare {{parts for}} further finishing, and break off die cast runners. The process is fairly simple: a horizontal barrel {{is filled with the}} parts which is then rotated. Variations of this process usually include media, water, or other lubricants. As the barrel is rotated the material rises until gravity causes the uppermost layer to landslide down to the other side. The barrel may also have vanes, typically made of rubber, which run along the inside of the barrel. As the barrel turns the vanes catch and lift the parts, which eventually slide down or fall.|$|E
25|$|Mass {{finishing}} is a {{group of}} manufacturing processes that allow large quantities of parts to be simultaneously finished. The goal of this type of finishing is to burnish, deburr, clean, radius, <b>de-flash,</b> descale, remove rust, polish, brighten, surface harden, prepare parts for further finishing, or break off die cast runners. The two main types of mass finishing are tumble finishing, also known as barrel finishing, and vibratory finishing. Both involve the use of a cyclical action to create grinding contact between surfaces. Sometimes the workpieces are finished against each other; however, usually a finishing medium is used. Mass finishing can be performed dry or wet; wet processes have liquid lubricants, cleaners, or abrasives, while dry processes do not. Cycle times can be as short as 10minutes for nonferrous workpieces or as long as 2hours for hardened steel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Flash light due to photographing widely {{appears in}} video {{sequences}} especially in those obtained from news interviews, conferences and sports matches. When a flash picture is encoded, the intensity changes drastically and non-uniformly so that motion estimation {{can not find}} a well-matching block in reference pictures. Accordingly, much more bits are generated than the neighboring non-flash pictures. In this paper, a novel flash picture coding method which represents a new concept of video coding is proposed. Based on human vision system (HVS) property, rather than encoding the original flash picture, it encodes an artificial flash picture which is made up of an artificial non-flash (or <b>de-flashed)</b> picture and some parameters for flash effect modeling. Experiments show the proposed flash picture coding method greatly reduces the coded bits of the flash picture while still provides a competitive subjective quality...|$|R
2500|$|Metal balls {{start as}} a wire. The wire is sheared to give a pellet with a length {{approximately}} {{the size of the}} desired ball [...] (OD). This pellet is then headed into a rough spherical shape. Next, the balls are then fed into a machine that <b>de-flashes</b> them. The machine does this by feeding the balls between two heavy cast iron or hardened steel plates, called rill plates. One of the plates is held stationary while the other rotates. The top plate has an opening to allow balls to enter and exit the rill plates. These plates have fine circumferential grooves that the balls track in. The balls are run through the machine long enough so that each ball passes through many of these grooves, which ensures each ball is the same size, even if a particular groove is out of specification. The controllable machine variables are the amount of pressure applied, the speed of the plates, and how long the balls are left in the machine.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Manufacturing defects or {{errors are}} always the key {{concerns}} of any manufacturing industry. The success of any organization depends {{on the quality of}} product especially right product produced. This work is to be done in small blow moulding company, which manufactures the Air duct for automobile air conditioners. The initial research shows the past trends of rejection is between 8 - 9 % which includes human error in material removal, wrong fitting of clamp, molding defects, etc. the need is to reduce that to compete in highest competitive market and to continuous satisfaction of customer. One of the successful tool for finding the failure mode and its effect in manufacturing process is PFMEA (Product failure mode effect analysis). By PFMEA we can find out how critical the process is and we can take action to reduce the failure in product and improve the manufacturing process. After the complete study of the manufacturing process and production data – failure causes, failure rate, & other relevant data etc, FMEA discovered the weak processes in the form of higher risk priority number in the manufacturing of product, which required reducing by identifying and implementing mitigation actions and this will improve the process and product quality & productivity. After execution of process FMEA for center duct of air conditioning product, it is identified that major area of failure of center duct during manufacturing are as follows: 1. <b>De-flashing</b> during manual process 2. Moulding defects left out during inspection Hence it provided the potential failures of the product so preventive steps can be taken to improve quality of product and productivity...|$|R
