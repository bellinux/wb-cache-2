5|$|Burton and Roosevelt had a {{complicated}} history. Burton, {{as a leader}} at the 1900 Republican National Convention, was perhaps instrumental in Roosevelt's securing his party's nomination. Roosevelt's last appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (whose jurisdiction, at the time, included appeals from Kansas) had been William Cather Hook, a choice favored by Burton's political opponents: Senator Chester <b>I.</b> <b>Long</b> (R-KS) and Governor Willis J. Bailey (R-KS). When the next vacancy opened on the Eighth Circuit, Burton and his allies favored the appointment of Charles Blood Smith. D.W. Mulvane was unsuccessful in pressing Smith's candidacy in a June 1903 meeting with Roosevelt.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th Century, Long Branch was {{considered}} the Monte Carlo of America. A white flag was raised when women went in the ocean; a red pennant was hoisted to begin the males-only sessions. In August 1861, Mary Todd Lincoln took a vacation in Long Branch and began a tradition of dignitaries from the nation’s capital to become regular guests. From the Gilded Age up until the era before World War <b>I,</b> <b>Long</b> Branch {{was one of the}} nation’s premier summer vacation spots, drawing the wealthy to its stately large homes.|$|E

500|$|The first chorus on the {{beginning}} of Psalm 25, [...] "" [...] (Lord, <b>I</b> <b>long</b> for you. My God, I hope in you.), is [...] "waywardly constructed despite its relative brevity". It is episodic, emphasizing a descending chromatic scale motif. The musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes [...] "the graphically chromatic phrases of the opening sinfonia and the following chorus; these are evocative of {{the suffering of the}} world".|$|E
500|$|... (For Thee, O Lord, <b>I</b> <b>long),</b> , is {{an early}} church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach {{composed}} for an unknown occasion. It is unique among Bach's cantatas in its sparse orchestration and in the independence and prominence of the chorus, which is featured in four out of seven movements. The text alternates verses from Psalm 25 and poetry by an unknown librettist. Bach scored the work for four vocal parts and a small Baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins, bassoon and basso continuo.|$|E

500|$|Retiring {{from the}} stage during World War II, Bosse {{considered}} moving back to Norway's capital Oslo, the home of her childhood and youth. [...] Both her children had settled there. [...] The move was delayed for ten years, during which she travelled whenever possible, and when it took place in 1955, she perceived {{it to be a}} mistake. Her brother Ewald's death in 1956 left her the only survivor of the fourteen children of Anne-Marie and Johann Heinrich Bosse. [...] "How <b>I</b> <b>long</b> desperately for Stockholm", she wrote to a friend in 1958. [...] "My whole life is there." [...] She became chronically melancholy, enduring failing health and bitter memories of the final phase of her career at Dramaten.|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] {{translates}} to [...] "The Beautiful Island" [...] in English. The song has four lines sung in Spanish, a theme which Madonna later incorporated in her 1987 single [...] "Who's That Girl". The lyrics begin by describing Madonna {{as a tourist}} who prays [...] "that the days would last, they went so fast" [...] simultaneously isolating the other Latin people as them ("you can watch them go by"). In her book Women and popular music, author Sheila Whiteley said that the chorus of the song places its emphasis on the incantatory present participle ("Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free, this is where <b>I</b> <b>long</b> to be"). The song draws connotations from the supplicant before its explicit focus on the chorus.|$|E
500|$|In 1957 Bánáthy began {{enlarging}} {{a concept}} for a leadership development program. As Council Training Chairman in the Monterey Bay Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, he received {{strong support from}} the Council Executive and Council Executive Board for his proposal to train boys in leadership skills. He was assisted by fellow Hungarians Joe Szentkiralyi (aka St. Clair, Chair of the Hungarian Language Department at the Army Language school) and Paul Sujan (Hungarian Language Instructor at the Army Language school); Fran Peterson ({{a member of the}} National Council and a Scoutmaster from Chular, California); and Maury Tripp (a Scouter from Saratoga, California, a member of the National Council, and a research scientist).

500|$|The {{nation was}} shocked. Shops put up their shutters. The Prince of Wales wrote to Queen Victoria, [...] "Gladly would I have given {{my life for}} his". Princess Mary wrote to Queen Victoria of the Princess of Wales, [...] "the despairing {{look on her face}} was the most heart-rending thing I have ever seen." [...] His younger brother Prince George wrote, [...] "how deeply I did love him; & I {{remember}} with pain nearly every hard word & little quarrel I ever had with him & <b>I</b> <b>long</b> to ask his forgiveness, but, alas, it is too late now!" [...] George took Albert Victor's place in the line of succession, eventually succeeding to the throne as George V in 1910. Drawn together during their shared period of mourning, Prince George later married Mary himself in 1893. She became queen on George's accession.|$|E
500|$|After Francis' death, Franklin became {{involved}} in promoting inoculation in Philadelphia: he published many studies on its value, working with several physicians, including the famed William Heberden at the Pennsylvania Hospital, which he helped found. In 1774, he founded the [...] "Society for Inoculating the Poor Gratis", {{in order to help}} the poor people of Philadelphia afford inoculation. In his autobiography, Franklin writes: [...] "In 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox taken in the common way. <b>I</b> <b>long</b> regretted bitterly and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention {{for the sake of the}} parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen." ...|$|E
500|$|Twenty-six bars {{from the}} last two lines of the chorus are copied almost identically. The lyrics of these same lines, [...] "Through the sycamores the candle lights are gleaming, On {{the banks of the}} Wabash, far away" [...] is also {{borrowed}} from, and changed to [...] "the gleaming candle lights, are still shining bright, through the sycamore trees". The first part of the chorus, [...] "Oh the moonlight's fair tonight along the Wabash", is also reused and changed to [...] "When I think about the moonlight on the Wabash, then <b>I</b> <b>long</b> for my Indiana home". Under Theodore's guidance, Dresser's estate accused Hanley of plagiarism and threatened to bring a suit against Paull-Pioneer Music Corporation, the publisher of [...] "Back Home Again in Indiana". Despite lengthy discussions no action was ever taken to resolve the dispute, largely due to the ambiguous nature of U.S. copyright laws in the early 20th century and the estate's lack of finances.|$|E

In a letter to his brother, Lewis would later confide [...] "that part of Rostrevor which overlooks Carlingford Lough is my idea of Narnia".

He is in such haste that I was forced to go halves with him in hiring a packet boat at the rate of £5 on purpose to be almost “drounded,” or what was very near as extravagant a reason, to humour my fellow traveller, for we came over in so prodigious a storm that nothing but our light heads could have kept us from the bottom." ...|$|E
