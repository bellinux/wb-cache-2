40|$|Background: Contact {{hypersensitivity}} quantitative {{risk assessment}} (QRA) for <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> {{is being used to}} establish new international standards for all <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> that are potential skin sensitizers. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the retrospective clinical data on three <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> in order to provide a practical assessment of the predictive value of the QRA approach. It is important to have data to assess that the methodology provides a robust approach for primary prevention of contact sensitization induction for <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> identified as potential sensitizers. Methods: This article reviews clinical data for three <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> cinnamic aldehyde, citral, and isoeugenol to assess the utility of the QRA approach for <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients.</b> Results: This assessment suggests that had the QRA approach been available at the time standards were established for these <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients,</b> the clinical response might have been noticeably improved. Prospectively, with the establishment of QRA-derived standards, there should be a continued downward trend in patch test-positive rates for cinnamic aldehyde, citral, and isoeugenol over time. Conclusion: While it is recognized that the availability of retrospective data is limited, a longitudinal review of these data gives confidence that the QRA approach should be an effective tool for primary prevention. This study also highlights the importance of continued active monitoring of clinical patch-test data for <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} study we {{investigated}} the antibacterial activity of <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> against Legionella pneumophila, a causative agent of severe pneumonia. Among the 41 different <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> tested, {{we found that the}} natural <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> oakmoss (OM) and birch tar oil (BT), which contain many components, exhibit potent antibacterial activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, % (v/v)) of OM and BT were 0. 0020 and 0. 0024, respectively and were lower than that of cinnamic aldehyde (0. 0078), which has been previously shown to possess high antimicrobial activity. In a time?kill assay of OM and BT at MIC and two times MIC, the colony forming units (CFU) of the microbe were reduced to between 10 ? 3 to 10 ? 4 of the original CFU after 1 h co-incubation. After this time, the CFU gradually decreased in number, but remained above detection levels even after a 48 -h co-incubation, except for BT at two times MIC. In contrast, at a concentration of 0. 1 % OM and BT (approximately 50 times MIC), CFU were not detected after co-incubation for 1 h. Another 18 <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> including ketone, aldehyde, lactone, acid, phenol derivative, aliphatic alcohol and quinoline also exhibited a lesser degree of antibacterial activity against L. pneumophila at a MIC of less than 0. 10...|$|R

However, the fact that a chemical is a skin sensitizer does not mean it cannot be formulated into consumer products at safe levels.

50|$|A perfumer is a {{term used}} for an expert on {{creating}} perfume compositions, sometimes referred to affectionately as a Nose (French: le nez) due to their fine sense of smell and skill in producing olfactory compositions. The perfumer is effectively an artist who is trained in depth on the concepts of fragrance aesthetics and who is capable of conveying abstract concepts and moods with fragrance compositions. At the most rudimentary level, a perfumer must have a keen knowledge of a large variety of <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> and their smells, {{and be able to}} distinguish each of the <b>fragrance</b> <b>ingredients</b> whether alone or in combination with other fragrances. As well, they must know how each ingredient reveals itself through time with other ingredients. The job of the perfumer is very similar to that of flavourists, who compose smells and flavourants for many commercial food products. The practice of perfume-making has recently attracted academic interest among major research funding agencies.|$|R
