500|$|... a. [...] "A {{few weeks}} [...] ago I was DJing {{a party and}} a young twentysomething {{came up to me}} to request 'some old-school.' I asked for clarification– after all, Run DMC and LL Cool J are {{considered}} old-school, but technically, they invented the new school. The response: 'I don't know, some Tribe Called Quest or something.' After gently picking my jaw from off the floor, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my crates and wondered to myself, 'If Tribe is old-school, what does that make Kurtis Blow? In utero?'"—Oliver Wang, [...] "Book report", San Francisco Bay Guardian, April 6, 2003.|$|E
2500|$|This novel caused Adams {{to become}} acquainted with the {{well-known}} scientist Richard Dawkins. As Dawkins explains, [...] "As soon as I finished it, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> page one and read it straight through again – the only time I have ever done that, and I wrote to tell him so. He replied {{that he was a}} fan of my books, and he invited me to his house in London." [...] Adams would later introduce Dawkins to the woman who was to become his third wife, the actress Lalla Ward, best known for playing the character Romana in Doctor Who. One of her early serials on the programme was City of Death, which Adams wrote, and which shares certain plot elements with the novel.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house, {{with my head}} {{feeling very}} old on my young shoulders.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> bear her company, and we {{were now}} come near {{the head of the}} brae above Dean village. At this word I stepped in front of her like one {{suddenly}} distracted.|$|R
60|$|With {{reluctance}} <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the gorgeously changing {{spectacle of}} the canyon and crawled in to the rim wall. At the narrow neck of stone I peered over to look down into misty blue nothingness.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> {{and went}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the wagons even more quietly than I had come.|$|R
60|$|But {{now that}} chance was gone, and as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my two companions I felt utterly nonplussed.|$|E
60|$|Sheepishly confessing that I {{thought we}} had, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> bed, and claimed ten hours more of delicious rest.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the house}} with a sigh. I am afraid that I had as little faith in {{medicine}} as Guest himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "--then stopped. 'Here,' I said, 'is {{an outcast}} like myself. This {{is the man}} for me.' So <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> and came <b>to</b> you--you. And--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "''Twas me fault,' says I. 'I {{came here}} {{for the same reason}} meself. Look at the lights, Norah,' <b>I</b> says, <b>turning</b> my <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the sea--'ain't they pretty?' ...|$|R
60|$|Then I saw Snell hunching {{down on a}} bench, a nerveless and shaken man {{if there}} ever was one. He had been a hanger-on round the {{gambling}} dens, the kind of sneak <b>I</b> never <b>turned</b> my <b>back</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at that window, that dear little window!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> see him {{point to}} a small {{protruding}} oriel, above us, relieved against the purple brickwork, framed in chiselled stone and curtained with ivy.|$|E
60|$|We saw the {{professor}} off the premises in his dried clothes, and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> put the fowls to {{bed in a}} happier frame of mind than I had {{known for a long}} time. I whistled rag-time airs as I worked.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{sit down}} once more I heard two men {{get up from}} behind a number of packing-cases on the pier, and walk away. I had not noticed them before, and I {{wondered}} if they had overheard the conversation which had taken place.|$|E
6000|$|Since, then, no grace I find [...] Taught me of trees, <b>Turn</b> <b>I</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my kind, [...] Worthy as these. There {{at least}} smiles abound, There {{discourse}} trills around, There, now and then, are found [...] Life-loyalties.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss Hume’s theory {{of pride and}} the ‘remarkable mechanism’ of sympathy. In {{the first part of}} the paper I outline the ways in which Hume’s theory can {{accommodate}} the sense in which the passions are directed on things or possess intentionality while still holding to his view that passions are simple feelings. In the second part of the paper I consider a problem internal to Hume’s account of pride which arises in his discussion of the love of fame and the functioning of sympathy; I explain how the tensions can be reconciled by recognising that Hume’s theory of sympathy is more nuanced than has commonly been recognized. In the third part <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the evaluation of Hume’s theory of pride and argue that while it is unfair to complain that Hume does not make self-evaluation a central component of pride, Hume’s treatment of the idea of self in his theory of the passions is inadequate because he can make no proper room for the phenomenon of vicarious pride...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding his {{relationships}} with foreign dictators, Coe said in 2007, [...] "I never invite them. They come to me. And I do what Jesus did: <b>I</b> don’t <b>turn</b> my <b>back</b> <b>to</b> any one. You know, the Bible {{is full of}} mass murderers." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{other day}} I became confused. I needed {{a ray of}} light. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> those school days for aid. But in all the nasal harmonies we whined forth from those hard benches I could not recall one that treated of the voice of {{agglomerated}} mankind.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} {{difficult}} to go to a house this night. I did not want to approach any of them. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house of the peering woman. She had looked hen-like and anxious. She would be glad of a visitor to help her pay her rent.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur le marquis," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have good}} news for you; the demon wolf is in the forest. I saw him making his way along a glade an hour since as I {{was on my way}} thither. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> follow him, and tracked him to a ravine in the hills choked with undergrowth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Lady Angela," [...] he said, [...] "I am most distressed {{that you}} should have been a witness of this--extraordinary incident. I have been trying to adapt myself to the methods of your country, but, alas! I cannot say that I am enamoured of them. Here, it seems, that gentlemen who differ must behave like dustmen. Will you pardon me if <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> my <b>back</b> <b>to</b> you for a moment? I see a small mirror, and I am {{convinced}} that my tie and collar need readjustment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Next morning I was lending a mate a hand {{painting}} a boat, when I {{saw the two}} children coming along the sand again, and I wondered to myself whether they would know me again, or think any more of me, and though I wanted {{them to do so}} <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the way they was coming, and went on with my painting. Somehow I felt wonderful glad when I heard their little feet come, pattering along the sand, and they sang out: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> my <b>back</b> <b>to</b> guard her, {{and felt}} a bolt strike my back-piece; then {{we were in the}} fosse, and all the Scots that might be were between her and harm. Swiftly they bore her out of the fray, into a little green vineyard, where was a soft grassy ditch. But the English so cried their hurrah, that it was marvel, and our men gave back in fear; and had not the Bastard come up with a fresh company, verify we might well have been swept into the Loire.|$|R
60|$|Apparently we had,--for the moment, at any rate. I claimed my own belongings, and {{had them}} sent down to the omnibus. Then I handed my {{companion}} in {{and was on the}} point of joining her, when I saw walking along the platform, within a few feet of us, the policeman to whom I had appealed. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
60|$|L. Neith did {{not wait}} {{to hear what he}} would say. When <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> look at her, she was gone; and I only saw the level white cloud form itself again, close to the arch of the sun as it sank. And as the last edge of the sun disappeared, the form of Pthah faded into a mighty shadow, and so passed away.|$|E
6000|$|... "They were so {{in earnest}} {{that they did}} not notice me," [...] {{continued}} Dora. [...] "I was going to walk away when I saw them, but then I overheard the name of Walt Wingate and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> learn what they were saying about that bad man. It seems both the mate and the assistant engineer have been talking to Wingate, and Wingate has made them an offer." ...|$|E
60|$|When we {{had reached}} a point some ten feet from the secret doorway I halted my companion, and cautioning him to remain {{absolutely}} motionless until I gave the prearranged signal <b>I</b> quickly <b>turned</b> my <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the door through which I could almost feel the burning and baleful eyes of our would be executioner.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; not but I was a Methodist once--ay, for {{a length}} of time. 'Twas owing to my taking a house next door to a chapel; so that what with hearing the organ bizz like a bee through the wall, and what with finding it saved {{umbrellas}} on wet Zundays, I went over to that faith for two years--though I believe I dropped money by it--I wouldn't be the man to say so if I hadn't. Howsomever, when I moved into this house <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> my old religion. Faith, I don't zee much difference: be you one, or be you t'other, you've got to get your living.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Lit Pub {{reviewer}} Edward J. Rathke {{found the}} novel to be {{a remedy for}} heartbreak: [...] "The next thing I knew, the sun was rising and my heart was breaking, but in a good way, the way that resurrects you, that shows you everything you forgot to pay attention to, forgot to remember, and I closed {{it because it was}} done, again, finished for the third time, and <b>I</b> could’ve <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> page one and began again, which is how the first two readings happened, in consecutive days, because this book burns you, burrows deep, and smolders, lives, reconnects cells, and balances chemistry." ...|$|R
60|$|As the brutes, {{growling}} and foaming, rushed {{upon the}} almost defenseless women I {{turned my head}} that I might not see the horrid sight. The yells and laughter of the green horde bore witness to the excellent quality of the sport and when <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the arena, as Kantos Kan {{told me it was}} over, I saw three victorious calots, snarling and growling over the bodies of their prey. The women had given a good account of themselves.|$|E
60|$|My {{blood was}} aflame, and I was not minded {{to wait for}} our meeting at Reaux. Consigning Mademoiselle {{to the care of}} Michelot, who stood panting and {{bleeding}} from a wound in his shoulder, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my dead horse, and plucking the remaining pistol from the holster I ran down to {{the very edge of the}} water. The boat was not ten yards from shore, and my action had been unheeded by St. Auban, who was standing in the stern.|$|E
6000|$|Girls on the Border came to womanhood early. At fifteen {{my sister}} Harriet {{considered}} herself {{a young lady}} and began {{to go out to}} dances with Cyrus and Albert and Frances. She was small, moody and silent, and as all her interests became feminine I lost that sense of comradeship with which we used to ride after the cattle and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my brother who was growing into a hollow-chested lanky lad--and in our little sister Jessie we took increasing interest. She was a joyous child, always singing like a canary. SHE was never a [...] "trial." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{it relates}} to Miss Minna, or to her mother," [...] <b>I</b> suggested. Fritz <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the first page {{and looked up at}} me, red with anger. [...] "More abominable slanders! More lies about Minna's mother!" [...] he burst out. [...] "Come here, David. Look at it with me. What do you say? Is it the writing of a woman or a man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for the first, sir, I can't say I do. The {{distances}} we all know, as {{we measure}} them from point to point; {{and as for}} boxing the compass, <b>I</b> will <b>turn</b> my <b>back</b> <b>to</b> no admiral in his Majesty's fleet. Nothe, nothe and by east, nothe, nothe-east, nothe-east and by nothe, nothe-east, nothe-east and by east, east-nothe-east, east and by nothe-east--" ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} {{men at the}} corner of the square who had stopped also, and who were {{standing}} talking together. After a moment's reflection <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> so as <b>to</b> pass them. One moved as I came near, and turned the corner leading from the square into the street. The other remained stationary. I looked at him as I passed and instantly recognised one of the men who had watched me before I left England.|$|R
