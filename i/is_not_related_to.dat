5|$|In 2008, Nauru {{recognised}} Kosovo as {{an independent}} country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia.

On 15 July 2008, the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9million of development aid received from Russia. The Nauru government claims this aid <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> its recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia.|$|E

5|$|The Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) {{is a large}} Australian predatory {{freshwater}} fish of the Maccullochella genus and the Percichthyidae family. Although the species is called a cod in the vernacular, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the Northern Hemisphere marine cod (Gadus) species. The Murray cod {{is an important part}} of Australia's vertebrate wildlife—as an apex predator in the Murray-Darling River system—and also significant in Australia's human culture. The Murray cod is the largest exclusively {{freshwater fish}} in Australia, and one of the largest in the world. Other common names for Murray cod include cod, greenfish, goodoo, Mary River cod, Murray perch, ponde, pondi and Queensland freshwater cod.|$|E
5|$|The chewing of cud by {{animals such as}} cows, goats, and giraffes is {{considered}} normal behavior. These animals are known as ruminants. Such behavior, though termed rumination, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> human rumination syndrome, but is ordinary. Involuntary rumination, similar to what is seen in humans, has been described in gorillas and other primates. True merycism, {{as opposed to the}} cud-chewing process in ruminants, is also a normal part of the digestive process in some other animals, such as kangaroos.|$|E
5|$|Within the Lithostrotia, Opisthocoelicaudia {{has been}} found to be closely related to the genera Alamosaurus, Neuquensaurus, Rocasaurus and Saltasaurus, {{together}} forming the family Saltasauridae. Interrelationships of these genera are contested. Many scientists considered Opisthocoelicaudia to be most closely related to Alamosaurus, with both genera forming a monophyletic group, the Opisthocoelicaudiinae. Other scientists came to the conclusion that the Opisthocoelicaudiinae is paraphyletic (not forming a natural group). Contradicting most other studies, Upchurch and colleagues in 2004 argued that Alamosaurus has to be placed outside the Saltasauridae as a close relative of Pellegrinisaurus, and therefore <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Opisthocoelicaudia at al.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{a similar}} overall appearance, A.hygrometricus <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the true earthstars of genus Geastrum, {{although}} historically, {{they have been}} taxonomically confused. The species was first described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801 as Geastrum hygrometricus. In 1885, Andrew P. Morgan proposed that differences in microscopic characteristics warranted {{the creation of a}} new genus Astraeus distinct from Geastrum; this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities. Several Asian populations formerly thought to be A.hygrometricus were renamed in the 2000s once phylogenetic analyses revealed they were unique Astraeus species, including A.asiaticus and A.odoratus. Research has revealed the presence of several bioactive chemical compounds in the fruit bodies. North American field guides typically rate A.hygrometricus as inedible.|$|E
5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{inspired}} by films such as The Prisoner of Zenda, If I Were King and Viva Zapata!. Ramachandran, in an account about the film he wrote in 1959, mentioned three specific differences from The Prisoner of Zenda. In the original, the look-alike and the queen have an intimate relationship while in Nadodi Mannan, Veerangan rejects Manohari's advances. When she realises that Veerangan is not Marthandan, she addresses him as her brother instead. Secondly, the look-alike {{was related to the}} king and shared the same interests. Veerangan <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> Marthandan and initially has contrasting qualities until they meet. Thirdly, the character of Vijayavarman, and the sequences in Kanni Theevu, do not feature in the original, while these were incorporated as part of Nadodi Mannans main plot.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{stars on the}} flag is fixed at 12, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the number of member states of the EU (although the EU did have 12 member states {{at the time of}} Maastricht Treaty). This is because it {{originally}} was the flag of the Council of Europe. In 1953, the Council of Europe had 15 members; it was proposed that the future flag should have one star for each member, and would not change based on future members. West Germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of Saarland, and to have its own star would imply sovereignty for the region. Twelve was eventually adopted as a number with no political connotations and as a symbol of unity. While 12 is the correct number of stars, sometimes flags or emblems can be found that incorrectly show 15 (as of the rejected proposal) or 25 (as suggested by some after the expansion of the EU to 25 member states in 2004). However, the flag also remains that of the Council of Europe, which now has 47 member states.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 2010, based on specimens collected in February, 2009 from Benton County, Oregon. Before this, {{it had been}} known locally for several years as the Oregon brown truffle, and assumed to be an undescribed species of Leucangium, based on its overall resemblance to and similar habitat as the Oregon black truffle, Leucangium carthusianum; it was given the provisional name Leucangium brunneum. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences revealed that the species <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the truffle genera of the family Tuberaceae, including Tuber, Dingleya and Reddellomyces. Rather, it has close affinity with the hypogeous (below the soil surface) genera of the Morchellaceae, including Fischerula, Imaia, and Leucangium, but both genetic and morphological characters are sufficiently distinct to warrant designation as a distinct genus. All four hypogeous Morchellaceae genera produce huge spores, with sizes ranging from 32 to 100micrometers (μm). Both Kalapuya and Imaia have asci (spore-bearing cells) that have thick cell walls when young, but become thin when mature—a trait not shared with Fischerula. The authors explain that although the hypogeous Morchellaceae genera share the trait of large spore size, striking differences in spore structure and other morphological difference in microscopic characters would have ruled out placing {{them in the same}} family as Morchella, {{were it not for the}} convincing molecular evidence proving their relatedness.|$|E
