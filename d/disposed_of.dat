40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the possibilities <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> water resources {{as a resource}} that is {{of interest to the}} Republic of Croatia from the aspect <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> the right of ownership as a property right and <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> the subject matter of property law. It also makes a distinction between <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> water resources {{on the one hand and}} <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> public water resources as public property for common usage on the other hand. The concept, definition and legal status of water resources are presented in the introduction, as the basis for an analysis of the possibility <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of,</b> or limiting the disposal of, water resources. Further, an analysis is made of the basic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> property rights in general, and <b>of</b> <b>disposing</b> <b>of</b> resources that are of interest to the Republic of Croatia and public property for common usage...|$|R

5|$|The {{single largest}} {{producer}} of food {{waste in the}} United Kingdom is the domestic household. In 2007, households created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste – accounting for 19 per cent of all municipal solid waste. Potatoes account for the largest quantity of avoidable food disposed of; 359,000 tonnes per year are thrown away, 49 per cent (177,400 tonnes) of which are untouched. Bread slices account for the second food type most <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> (328,000 tonnes per year), and apples the third (190,000 tonnes per year). Salad is <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> in the greatest proportion - 45 per cent of all salad purchased by weight will be thrown away uneaten.|$|E

5|$|Churchill fully tooled-up—that is, installed, {{assembled}} and made ready for productive use—the Gatling Gun factory {{that opened in}} Birmingham in 1889. This was despite being an undischarged bankrupt. He had formed a partnership with his son, Charles Henry Churchill, and in 1888 he obtained another partner when John William Wright Gabriel <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> his family's interest in a drugs manufacturer, Gabriel and Troke, and joined the Churchills. This partnership may explain how {{he was able to}} complete the work in Birmingham despite his financial status. Despite the assertion by biographer David Jeremy that J W W Gabriel <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> the drugs manufacturing interest, a notice in The London Gazette for 1885 shows his father, John Wild Gabriel, ending a partnership with Troke, and that Troke then formed a similar arrangement with another person.|$|E

50|$|Drug {{disposal}} is the discarding of drugs. Individuals commonly <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> unused drugs {{which remain}} {{after the end}} of medical treatment. Health care organizations <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> drugs on a larger scale for a range of reasons, including having leftover drugs after treating patients. Failure to properly <b>dispose</b> <b>of</b> drugs creates opportunities for anyone to take them inappropriately if they are stored. Inappropriate disposal of drugs can cause drug pollution.|$|R

5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} <b>disposed</b> <b>of</b> by the Ohio General Assembly after the {{resignation}} of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise {{to protect him from}} the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it. Garfield, as the president's key legislator, gained considerable prestige and respect for his role. When Congress debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E
