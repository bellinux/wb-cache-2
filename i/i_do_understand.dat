Little other {{understanding}} can I have of him. The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me, until I do hear from you how the matter standeth, or how this evil should light upon me, considering what the malicious world will bruit, as I can take no rest.|$|E

When Gibson asked if she thought Roe v. Wade should be overturned, she replied, [...] "I think it should and I think that states {{should be able to}} decide that issue." [...] Palin also said that she hoped [...] "to reach out and work with those who are {{on the other side of}} this issue, because I know that we can all agree on the need for and the desire for fewer abortions in America and greater support for adoption, for other alternatives that women can and should be empowered to embrace, to allow that culture of life." [...] Gibson noted that Republican presidential nominee John McCain allows exceptions for rape or incest, and asked, [...] "Do you believe in it only in the case where the life of the mother is in danger?" [...] Palin answered, [...] "That is my personal opinion." [...] When pressed on the matter, she said, [...] "My personal opinion is that abortion allowed if the life of the mother is endangered.

60|$|ANN. You seem to {{understand}} all the things I don't understand; but you are a perfect baby in the things <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>understand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|She {{thought a}} moment. [...] "Because {{in that case}} I mightn't have understood? But that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>understand</b> is just what you've always meant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, by Jove! I think <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>understand.</b> As sure {{as you are}} {{a living}} girl he will give back Castle Richmond to Herbert Fitzgerald." ...|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. I cant tell you. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>understand</b> it myself. The prayer meeting set me free, somehow. I {{should never}} have done it {{if it were not}} for the prayer meeting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>understand</b> {{something}} of the kind," [...] Cliffe admitted. [...] "Still, if the revolutionists prove too strong for you, I'll lose any additional money I may let you have." ...|$|R
6000|$|THE GENERAL. I suppose {{thats an}} epigram. <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>understand</b> epigrams. I'm only a silly soldier man. Ha! But I {{can put a}} plain question. Is Leo to be {{encouraged}} to be a polygamist? ...|$|R

6000|$|ZOO. You {{are getting}} out of my depth: <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>understand</b> a word you are saying. Married and {{questionable}} taste convey nothing to me. Stop, though. Is married an old form of the word mothered? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no reason," [...] Rochester admitted. [...] "It {{is simply}} a matter of policy. Frankly, I mistrust you. There are points about your behaviour, ever since in a foolish moment I asked you to stay at Beauleys, which <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>understand.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>understand</b> Lord Guerdon's sudden {{recognition}} of you, and even suddener death. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>understand</b> why it has amused you to fill the head of my young ward, Lois Champneyes, with foolish thoughts. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>understand</b> why you should stand between my wife and the writers of a blackmailing letter. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ask you for any explanation.

6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied, [...] "you are not dull. Your {{feelings}} {{towards me}} are obvious and very natural. Mine towards you I {{am not so}} sure of.
