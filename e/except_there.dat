5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, <b>except</b> <b>there</b> is a hole through the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the mandrel and {{do not have to be}} reproduced with each replacement.|$|E
25|$|After 1954, North Vietnam {{became a}} {{communist}} country and Scouting {{ceased to exist}} there. In South Vietnam, Vietnamese Scout Association maintained the same structure as before, <b>except</b> <b>there</b> were no geographical regions.|$|E

The Extended Edition was released in the United States in June 2011. It has a runtime of 263 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{theatrical}} Blu-ray {{version of}} The Lord of the Rings {{was released in}} the United States in April 2010. There were two separate sets: one with digital copies and one without. The individual Blu-ray disc of The Fellowship of the Ring was released in September 2010 with the same special features as the complete trilogy release, <b>except</b> <b>there</b> was no digital copy.|$|E
5000|$|Saturdays <b>excepted,</b> <b>there</b> {{are also}} several peak-hour limited stop {{services}}, towards Glasgow in the morning, and towards Lanark in the evening. The Glasgow bound limited stop services are well used, and normally full on departure from Wishaw.|$|R

2500|$|Trivial {{examples}} <b>excepted,</b> <b>there</b> are {{no known}} easy methods for producing geomagic squares. To date, two approaches have been explored. [...] Where the pieces {{to be used}} are polyforms, or shapes built up from repeated units, an exhaustive search by computer becomes possible.|$|R
25|$|The District elects a {{delegate}} to the House of Representatives, who has the usual rights of membership, such as seniority and committee membership, <b>except</b> <b>there</b> is no formal vote. The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified on March 29, 1961, gives the people {{a voice in the}} electoral college {{of the size of the}} smallest state (three votes).|$|E
25|$|Brief fights {{are similar}} <b>except</b> <b>there</b> is no forearm locking. The losing {{combatant}} seems to use kicking more often, perhaps to parry the thrusts of the eventual winner. A winner is decided when a kangaroo breaks off {{the fight and}} retreats. Winners are able to push their opponents backwards or down to the ground. They also seem to grasp their opponents when they break contact and push them away. The initiators of the fights are usually the winners. These fights may serve to establish dominance hierarchies among males, as winners of fights have been seen to displace their opponent from resting sites later in the day. Dominant males may also pull grass to intimidate subordinates.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{recording}} {{which developed}} {{during the time that}} early radio was becoming popular (1925) benefited from the microphones and amplifiers used in radio studios. The early electric recordings were reminiscent tonally of acoustic recordings, <b>except</b> <b>there</b> was more recorded bass and treble as well as delicate sounds and overtones cut on the records. This was in spite of some carbon microphones used, which had resonances that colored the recorded tone. The double button carbon microphone with stretched diaphragm was a marked improvement. Alternatively, the Wente style condenser microphone used with the Western Electric licensed recording method had a brilliant midrange and was prone to overloading from sibilants in speech, but generally it gave more accurate reproduction than carbon microphones.|$|E
60|$|Smiles <b>excepted,</b> <b>there</b> {{is nothing}} {{so hard to}} {{classify}} as a kiss. Mr Meggs's notion was that he kissed Miss Pillenger much as some great general, wounded unto death, might have kissed his mother, his sister, or some particularly sympathetic aunt; Miss Pillenger's view, differing substantially from this, may be outlined in her own words.|$|R

50|$|Jemez high tones {{are similar}} to those of Mandarin Chinese, <b>except</b> <b>there's</b> a {{characteristic}} slight rise at the end. Voiced consonants tend to lower the onset of pitch in high tones. If there are several high tones in a row, the pitch also tends to rise throughout. Falling tones fall from the level of high to mid pitch.|$|R
500|$|The 16thcentury {{also brought}} about major {{religious}} changes: the Saxons converted to Lutheranism, {{while most of}} the Hungarians converted to Calvinism or Unitarianism; only the Székelys remained more than the other [...] "nations" [...] Catholic. In 1568, the Transylvanian Diet at Torda decreed the free worship of these four [...] "received denominations", but Orthodoxy still continued to be only tolerated. The Romanians' status worsened in this period. The Diets of 1554 and 1555 decided that a Catholic or Protestant peasant could not be accused of a crime <b>except</b> <b>there</b> were seven Catholic or Protestant witnesses against him, while an Orthodox peasant could be accused if there were three Catholic or Protestant or seven Orthodox witnesses. The Diet of 1559 also decreed that Romanians who had settled on lands abandoned by Catholic serfs were obliged to pay the tithe.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Except</b> <b>there</b> was a problem: the Wang model (the six {{instructions}} of the 7-instruction Post-Turing machine) {{was still}} a single-tape Turing-like device, however nice its sequential program instruction-flow might be. Both Melzak (1961) and Shepherdson and Sturgis (1963) observed this (in the context of certain proofs and investigations): ...|$|E
2500|$|The Dodge Lancer, {{which had}} been almost {{identical}} to the Valiants of 1961–62, was replaced in 1963 by the Dart. The Dart was available in all the same body styles as the Valiant, <b>except</b> <b>there</b> was no Dodge equivalent of the Barracuda. All Darts used a larger, [...] wheelbase, except for wagons which used the Valiant's [...] wheelbase.|$|E
60|$|No boy is {{admitted}} {{before he is}} seven years old, or after he is nine; and no boy can remain in the school after he is fifteen, King's boys and 'Grecians' alone <b>excepted.</b> <b>There</b> are about 500 Governors, {{at the head of}} whom are the Sovereign and the Prince of Wales. The qualification for a Governor is payment of 500 pounds.--Ibid.|$|R

2500|$|... "Let no man deceive you by any means: {{for that}} day shall not come, <b>except</b> <b>there</b> come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Except</b> <b>there</b> is a problem: If {{based on}} the counter machine chassis this computer-like, von Neumann machine will not be Turing equivalent. It cannot compute {{everything}} that is computable. Intrinsically the model is bounded {{by the size of}} its (very-) finite state machine's instructions. The counter machine based RASP can compute any primitive recursive function (e.g. multiplication) but not all mu recursive functions (e.g. the Ackermann function [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|During Holy Week, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the {{services}} {{are similar to}} those during Great Lent <b>except</b> <b>there</b> is no reading of Kathismata, and instead of the normal Lenten hymns which replace the Kontakion, the Kontakion of the day (i.e., that day of Holy Week) is chanted. [...] On Great Thursday and Saturday, the Little Hours are more like normal, except that a Troparion of the Prophecy, prokeimena, and a reading from Jeremiah are chanted at the First Hour on Great Thursday. On Great Friday, the Royal Hours are chanted.|$|E
50|$|A JUO's rank {{insignia}} {{is identical}} to the SUO's, <b>except</b> that <b>there</b> is no chevron underneath the Austrian knot.|$|R
50|$|Yonin game {{notation}} is {{the same}} as that of shogi, <b>except</b> that <b>there</b> are four columns instead of two.|$|R
5000|$|The participial tenses are similar, <b>except</b> that <b>there</b> is a tone on the subject-marker {{as well as}} the penultimate: ...|$|R
2500|$|Before a team {{begins a}} game {{they must have}} five players {{who are capable of}} playing in the front row in the team. If a front row player gets sent off or {{suspended}} and no one on the field can play in the front row at the next scrum the team captain chooses another player to leave the field {{to be replaced by a}} reserve front rower. If due to send offs or injury there are no replacement front row players available then the scrums become uncontested. Uncontested scrums are subject to the same laws as normal scrums, <b>except</b> <b>there</b> is no pushing and the team putting the ball into the scrum must win it. When a scrum is awarded close to the tryline the attacking team can push the opposition back into the in-goal, controlling the ball in the scrum. If the ball crosses the tryline and a player grounds it a [...] "pushover try" [...] is scored.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cardioid}} microphone is effectively a superposition of an omnidirectional and a figure-8 microphone; for sound waves {{coming from the}} back, the negative signal from the figure-8 cancels the positive signal from the omnidirectional element, whereas for sound waves coming from the front, the two add to each other. A hyper-{{cardioid microphone}} is similar, but with a slightly larger figure-8 contribution leading to a tighter area of front sensitivity and a smaller lobe of rear sensitivity. [...] A super-cardioid microphone {{is similar to a}} hyper-cardioid, <b>except</b> <b>there</b> is more front pickup and less rear pickup. [...] While any pattern between omni and figure 8 is possible by adjusting their mix, common definitions state that a hypercardioid is produced by combining them at a 3:1 ratio, producing nulls at 109.5°, while supercardioid is produced with about a 5:3 ratio, with nulls at 126.9°. The sub-cardioid microphone has no null points. It is produced with about 7:3 ratio with 3-10dB level between the front and back pickup.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the staminate flowers has been interpreted differently. The original describers of the species, Aaron Goldberg and Cirilo Nelson, considered that each staminate flower was basically just a single stamen, with a flattened filament about 3–5mm long grading into an anther about 2.5mm long. Two staminate flowers from the original specimen were re-examined by Andrew Doust and Peter Stevens. They concluded that each staminate flower definitely had two anthers, closely pressed together. They were unable to make a firm choice between two interpretations. The first is that the staminate flowers are basically as described by Goldberg and Nelson, <b>except</b> <b>there</b> are two stamens with fused or closely pressed filaments and anthers rather than one. The second, which they preferred, is that Goldberg and Nelson's [...] "filament" [...] is actually a pedicel (i.e. a stem on which {{the parts of the}} flower are carried) and that their [...] "anther" [...] consists of two closely pressed structures each made up of a tepal with a fused anther inside it. Either way, the flowers of Haptanthus hazlettii have [...] "a morphology unlike that of any other angiosperm".|$|E
50|$|The {{climate is}} very {{similar to that of the}} Beaujolais {{wine-growing}} area, <b>except</b> that <b>there</b> is a stronger Mediterranean influence.|$|R
