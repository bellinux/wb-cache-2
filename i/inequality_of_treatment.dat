There are few studies <b>of</b> potential <b>inequalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> that arise from a primary care context. This study investigated the existence <b>of</b> such <b>inequalities</b> in the medical management of post myocardial infarction in older patients. Methods A comprehensive chart audit was conducted of 142 men and 81 women in an academic primary care practice. Variables were extracted on demographic variables, cardiovascular risk factors, medical and non-medical management of myocardial infarction. Results Women were older than men. The groups were comparable in terms of cardiac risk factors. A statistically significant difference (14. 6 %: 95 % CI 0. 048 – 28. 7 p = 0. 047) was found between men and women for the prescription of lipid lowering medications. 25. 3 % (p = 0. 0005, CI 11. 45, 39. 65) more men than women had undergone angiography, and 14. 4 % (p = 0. 029, CI 2. 2, 26. 6) more men than women had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Conclusion Women are less likely than men to receive lipid-lowering medication which may indicate less aggressive secondary prevention in the primary care setting. </p...|$|R

The Defence Minister, Dr Lewis Moonie, announced that [...] "British groups", [...] "British citizens" [...] and [...] "UK citizens" [...] {{would be eligible for}} compensation. The clarification of this requirement was that a claimant had to have been born in the United Kingdom or had a parent or grandparent born in the United Kingdom - the [...] "bloodlink". Complaints were made by many who considered themselves British who could not meet the criteria, including the political scientist Professor Jack Hayward, born in Shanghai to a father born in India and a mother born in Iraq. Abraham published her report - A Debt of Honour (after a phrase used by Dr Moonie) — in July 2005. She found four instances of maladministration: the scheme was devised hurriedly and with a lack of clarity about eligibility; that the announcement of the scheme was so imprecise as to give rise to confusion; that there was a failure to ensure that the [...] "bloodlink" [...] requirement would not lead to unequal treatment; and that there was a failure to inform applicants about the [...] "bloodlink2 clarification when they were sent an eligibility questionnaire. The report recommended that the scheme be reviewed so that it would not operate {{in a way that would}} unequally treat Hayward and others in a similar situation. The report was published under s10(3) as the Government only partially accepted the recommendations but refused to accept that there had been <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> or to review the scheme. The Select Committee published its own report on the matter, endorsing the recommendations of Abraham, in January 2006. In March 2006 the Ministry of Defence announced that it had made changes to the eligibility criteria, abandoning the [...] "bloodlink" [...] requirement and paving the way for Hayward and others to become eligible for compensation.|$|E

40|$|What {{is known}} and Objective: Variations in market uptake of an orphan drug have {{important}} implications with respect to access to care and <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to quantify both the sales and volume uptake of orphan drugs in Europe and to assess whether a countrys gross domestic product (GDP) and/or health technology assessment (HTA) influences the orphan drugs market uptake. Methods: We analysed the numbers of orphan drugs launched and the sales and volume uptake for 17 orphan drugs in 23 European countries from 2001 until the beginning of 2010 using the IMS Health database. Countries were clustered based on GDP and the availability of a formal HTA-organization. Results and Discussion: The uptake of orphan drugs varied across European countries. The highest volumes and contributions of orphan drugs in the first year occurred in countries with a high GDP (and implicitly, a higher budget for healthcare), independently of the existence of an HTA-organization. In contrast, in countries with a low GDP, orphan drugs were less available when there was a formal HTA-organization. There, budgetary restrictions can cause the exclusion of less cost-effective orphan drugs. What is new and Conclusion: We observed substantial variation in the market uptake of orphan drugs. Such variation may {{have important implications}} with respect to access to care and <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> The uptake of orphan drugs could be promoted through the clinical added value of orphan drugs (CAVOD) project and various conditional pricing and reimbursement mechanisms...|$|E

Do these trends indicate the importance of capital markets in the development process or are they not a required pre-requisite? These issues are taken up in this paper. Starting from an examination of the theoretical basis of the link between financial development and growth, the paper examines the empirical findings in this regard. The literature in this area is found to exhibit two broadly competing perspectives.

40|$|In this contribution, {{we started}} with a {{description}} of the fundamental protection of individual rights that exist under Dutch national law and the agencies that have primary responsibility for protecting those rights. Next, we described the process for enacting tax legislation, including the intervention of the courts and the Council of State and intermediary organisations in the legislative process for tax law proposals. Then we analysed the independent taxing powers of decentralised authorities. With regard to the outline of the procedure to challenge tax laws that conflict with fundamental rights, it was shown that the taxpayer has a right to advance the challenge. He can do so without the support of the tax administration. The way in which the principle of equality restricts the legislative power to tax in the Netherlands was the subject of the rest of this paper. This fundamental principle is the most important judicial instrument to check seriously flawed tax legislation. The judiciary has the task to ensure the legislature's compliance with the principle of equality. Because of the (still) existing ban on constitutional review, Acts of Parliament are tested against Article 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention) and Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As with regard to the method of judicial interpretation, the Dutch Supreme Court always demands an objective and reasonable justification for any <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> This method to decide whether a tax statute violates the principle of equality is in conformity with the method applied by the European Court of Human Rights. As for testing tax law against the principle of equality, the Dutch Supreme Court acknowledges the primary (wide) margin of appreciation of the legislator. This holds for judging the equality of cases as well as for judging whether there is an objective and reasonable justification for any <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> If the Court establishes a violation of the principle of equality, it acts very carefully. If no unambiguous resolution is available to eliminate the unjustified unequal treatment of equal cases, the Court leaves the choice to the legislator, which subsequently has to bring the legislation in line with the principle of equality in the short term. Our analysis of several issues concerning the principle of equality in Dutch tax law which the Court has dealt with show that the Dutch Supreme Court has made a valuable contribution to the constitutional system of checks and balances. The Court underlines the significance of the principle of equality for fair tax legislation. After all, each violation of the principle of equality damages the quality of the tax system. However, in our opinion, the room for deference by the Supreme Court to the policy views of the tax legislator should be more limited. To conclu...|$|E

The Court has dealt with several issues concerning the principle of equality in Dutch tax law. This fundamental principle is the most important judicial instrument to check seriously flawed tax legislation. Thus, the case law of the tax division of the Netherlands Supreme Court is in line with the case law of the ECtHR. The judiciary has the task to ensure the legislature's compliance with the principle of equality. As for testing of tax law against the principle of equality, the Netherlands Supreme Court acknowledges the primary margin of appreciation of the legislator. This goes for judging the equality of cases as well as for judging whether there is an objective and reasonable justification for any <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> Most courts, therefore, seldom 'overrule' the legislature.

40|$|Purpose - The {{construction}} {{industry has been}} criticized for cultural intolerance and its poor industrial image. The ethnically diverse construction workplace in Hong Kong (HK) is frequently noted as a place in which racial harassment and discrimination occurs. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the discriminatory experiences and working conditions experienced by ethnic minority (EM) construction operatives in HK. Design/methodology/approach - A mixed-method approach was adopted, including a questionnaire survey and focus group discussions. The survey identified the thoughts of EM construction workers about racial discrimination and harassment in the workplace. The focus group discussions were aimed at further exploring the discriminatory practices on HK construction sites and possible discrimination-coping strategies. Findings - Questionnaire data from 100 EM site operatives and labourers mainly from Nepal and Pakistan, but some few from other Asian countries as well as, plus two focus group discussions suggested that indirect and subtle forms of racial harassment do exist on HK construction sites. The operatives sampled reported the existence of <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> in their working life. Communication difficulties caused by language barriers affect work relationships between different cultural groups on construction sites. EM site operatives tend to interact with workers of similar cultural and ethnic groups. On the corporate/company level, language support and translations of safety procedures notices and policies, should be established to bring staff together and promote a more inclusive and harmonious workplace. Originality/value - The paper offers insights into the racial discrimination problems in the construction sector in an Asian context, which has been less explored. It aims to provide insight into the EM construction worker's situation in HK as well as the need for developing workplace-specific policies that protect against discrimination and protect the rights of EM workers.

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Beveridge saw idleness as the curse of {{unemployment}} that had afflicted so many in the 1930 s. The cure to idleness was work, and Beveridge believed that the state should make sure work was available for all who wanted it. His thinking was clearly a product of his era. Writing in 1942 he was influenced by the war, but he was also heavily influenced by the thinking of Keynes. Beveridge accepted Keynes’ logic and believed that a government could and should tackle this issue to ensure full employment was achieved. A Social State for 2015 has to be built upon a series of assumptions: 1. That those who would wish to work and who are denied the opportunity to do so are prejudiced against as a result; 2. Leaving people unemployed when they could be and want to be working is economically irresponsible; 3. The vast majority of people who are unemployed have to be fed, housed, clothed, educated and be provided with health care and other services when unemployed. As such unemployment has a double cost to society; the unemployed person is maintained and yet makes no direct contribution to economic well being within the economy whilst society suffers the social consequences of the idleness it has imposed; 4. The <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>treatment</b> between those in and out of work imposes a social cost both on those suffering the impact <b>of</b> that <b>inequality</b> directly and on society at large; 5. Unemployment denies people the chance to fulfil their potential, at least part of which is realised for most people through the process of work. This imposes costs beyond the lost value of economic output. For these reasons we believe it makes economic, environmental, social and medical sense to tackle unemployment whilst equity, justice and social harmony are also enhanced...|$|R

This article explores the implicit logic in the above safety program and relates it to its socio-economic context {{as well as to the}} country’s authoritarian tradition, in the following manner: first, the context of violence that accompanies the emergence of youth as a category and its development in Argentina are briefly described. Secondly, violence is assessed from the perspective of the so-called authoritarian solution, which represents the most easily recognizable of all courses of action, and this fact, in turn, legitimates its implementation. Finally, presents a reflection articulating the <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> of young people and their constant search for recognition. Keywords: Youth; inequality; violence; politics. El siguiente artículo pretende profundizar los estudios a fin de desnaturalizar la relación juventud-violencia para lo cual presenta el trabajo de campo realizado en una ciudad mediana del interior de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, donde se implementa el programa de seguridad Patrullas Urbanas. El trabajo indaga en la lógica implícita en él, vinculándola al contexto socio-económico, pero fundamentalmente a la tradición autoritaria del país. Para ello, primero describe brevemente el contexto de violencia que enmarca el surgimiento de la categoría de juventud y su desarrollo en la Argentina. En segundo lugar, propone el análisis de la violencia a partir de lo que denomina la solución autoritaria, la cual representa aquella fácilmente reconocida por los diferentes actores, lo cual legitima su puesta en práctica. Finalmente, presenta una reflexión articulando en el análisis la desigualdad en el trato y la búsqueda de reconocimiento por parte de los jóvenes...|$|E

40|$|Based on the 1971 Census of Canada, {{the extent}} of {{fertility}} differentials as well as possible sources of variation in fertility behaviour of the major Asian ethnic groups [...] Chinese, Japanese, East Indian and other [...] are studied. Ethnic fertility differentials are examined in their socio-economic and historical context, based on a historical review of Asian ethnic groups in Canada. It is found {{that each of these}} ethnic groups have experienced <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> and discrimination in areas such as employment and services. Also documented are differences in socio-economic characteristics which are shown to be related to family size differences. It is indicated that Japanese are better integrated in the majority society in terms of their socio-economic characteristics. This examination suggests that the lower family sizes of characteristics. This examination suggests that the lower family sizes of Japanese women compared to the Chinese and East Indians may in fact reflect their structural assimilation in Canadian Society. Chinese tend to have larger family sizes and are low on socio-economic indicators. The East Indians are intermediate in their fertiltiy behaviour and have a young age structure.;The theoretical perspective used for explaining the differential fertility among Asian groups is the minority group status hypothesis. Since there has been no consensus regarding the validity of this hypothesis, it has been revised based on comments and criticisms that were available. The revision of the hypothesis tries to distinguish between the two explanations, one involving reduced minority fertility based on structural factors and another involving high minority fertility due to subcultural factors. The revised hypothesis also includes the introduction of new concepts such as 2 ̆ 2 ascribed 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 perceived 2 ̆ 2 minority status. The minority which is conscious of its minority status {{is referred to as the}} 2 ̆ 2 perceived 2 ̆ 2 minority and the one which is not conscious of its status is called an 2 ̆ 2 ascribed 2 ̆ 2 minority. The reconceptualization of the hypothesis also emphasizes the measurement of key theoretical concepts including the new concepts introduced. The revised hypothesis has been used to explain the family size differences of Chinese and Japanese in Canada. The results suggest stronger support for the minority status hypothesis among the Chinese indicating further declines in their fertility due to structural factors and similar weaker support among the Japanese is due to their perceived mobility...|$|E
