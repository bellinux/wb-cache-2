5|$|At {{the end of}} the century, some of {{the most}} widely read Russian {{literary}} figures focused on feminist motifs in their works. In his later years, Leo Tolstoy argued against the traditional institution of marriage, comparing it to <b>forced</b> <b>prostitution</b> and slavery, a theme that he also touched on in his novel Anna Karenina. In his plays and short stories, Anton Chekhov portrayed a variety of working female protagonists, from actresses to governesses, who sacrificed social esteem and affluence for the sake of financial and personal independence; in spite of this sacrifice, these women are among the few Chekhovian characters who are truly satisfied with their lives.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for <b>forced</b> <b>prostitution</b> around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a dark room, lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to cry from fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and to sex markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into <b>forced</b> <b>prostitution.</b> Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E

25|$|For {{victims of}} {{specifically}} trafficked {{for the purpose}} of <b>forced</b> <b>prostitution</b> and sexual slavery, initiation into the trade is almost always characterized by violence. Traffickers hunt down their victims and employ practices of sexual abuse, torture, brainwashing, repeated rape and physical assault until the victim submits to his or her fate as a sexual slave. Victims experience verbal threats, social isolation, and intimidation before they accept their role as a prostitute.|$|E

Women and young girls were not only subjected to rape, but also forced marriage, torture, <b>forced</b> <b>prostitution,</b> being sold into slavery and sexual mutilation.|$|E
50|$|Trafficking of {{children}} includes recruiting, harbouring, obtaining, and transporting children {{by use of}} force or fraud {{for the purpose of}} subjecting them to involuntary acts, such as commercial sexual exploitation (including prostitution) or involuntary labour, i.e., enslavement. Some see human trafficking as the modern form of slavery. Human trafficking is the trade of human beings and their use by criminals to make money. The majority of trafficking victims are adults, predominantly made up women <b>forced</b> into <b>prostitution</b> (although men are trafficked also), but children make up a significant number of the victims <b>forced</b> into <b>prostitution.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The English Collective of Prostitutes campaigned {{against the}} Policing and Crime Act 2009, which {{originally}} included proposals to criminalise anyone {{involved in the}} sex industry, {{whether or not there}} was force or coercion; target safer premises; seize and retain money and assets, even without a conviction; increase arrests against street workers; arrest men on [...] "suspicion"; imprison sex workers who breach a compulsory rehabilitation order. The ECP argued that these measures would <b>force</b> <b>prostitution</b> underground, exposing sex workers to greater danger and preventing them coming forward to report violence and access health and other services.|$|R

25|$|Human {{trafficking}} victims {{may experience}} complex trauma {{as a result}} of repeated cases of intimate relationship trauma {{over long periods of time}} including, but not limited to, sexual abuse, domestic violence, <b>forced</b> <b>prostitution,</b> or gang rape. Complex trauma involves multifaceted conditions of depression, anxiety, self-hatred, dissociation, substance abuse, self-destructive behaviors, medical and somatic concerns, despair, and revictimization. Psychology researchers report that, although similar to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Complex trauma is more expansive in diagnosis because of the effects of prolonged trauma.|$|E
25|$|The colonial {{government}} embarked on several measures {{to address the}} serious social problems facing Singapore. For example, a Chinese Protectorate under Pickering was established in 1877 {{to address the needs}} of the Chinese community, including controlling the worst abuses of the coolie trade and protecting Chinese women from <b>forced</b> <b>prostitution.</b> In 1889 Governor Sir Cecil Clementi Smith banned secret societies, driving them underground. Nevertheless, many social problems persisted up through the post-war era, including an acute housing shortage and generally poor health and living standards.|$|E
25|$|Some {{international}} human rights groups (like the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Nordic Council and Amnesty International) expressed concern {{that there would be}} an increase in the trafficking of women up to and during the World Cup.

They called upon the German authorities to monitor sex venues during the World Cup and provide support for the victims of trafficking.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{communities}} appointed vice {{commissions to}} investigate the extent of local prostitution, whether prostitutes participated in it willingly or were forced into it {{and the degree to}} which it was organized by any cartel-type organizations. The second significant action at the local levels was to close the brothels and the red light districts. From 1910 to 1913, city after city withdrew this tolerance and forced the closing of their brothels. Suffrage activists, especially Harriet Burton Laidlaw and Rose Livingston, worked in New York City's Chinatown and in other cities to rescue young white and Chinese girls from <b>forced</b> <b>prostitution.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, UN Peacekeepers {{have been}} the subject of {{numerous}} accusations of abuse ranging from rape and sexual assault, to pedophilia and human trafficking. Complaints have arisen from Cambodia, East Timor and West Africa. In Bosnia-Herzegovina prostitution associated with trafficked women skyrocketed and often operated just beyond the gates of U.N. compounds. David Lamb, a regional human rights officer in Bosnia from 2000 to 2001 claimed “The sex slave trade in Bosnia largely exists because of the U.N. peacekeeping operation. Without the peacekeeping presence, there would have been little or no <b>forced</b> <b>prostitution</b> in Bosnia.” In addition, hearing held by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2002 found that members of SFOR were frequenting Bosnian brothels and engaging in sex with trafficked women and underage girls.|$|E
25|$|<b>Forced</b> <b>prostitution</b> {{and sexual}} slavery are {{considered}} contemporary manifestations of this historical crime, {{and can be}} found anywhere in the world. Women are often entrapped by deceit or coercion with the promise of better life and remain entrapped by force or debt bondage. Forced marriage can also be considered a form of slavery, notably when the bride has no right or opportunity to refuse marriage. This form of marriage can also result out of a kidnapping of girls in order to sell them as brides, a widespread phenomena in China. Once married and raped, there girls are often kept under lock and key until they have a child, at which time they will be less likely to leave because {{they do not want to}} abandon their child.|$|E
5000|$|Before 2007, selling sex was illegal: {{according}} to the 206th article of the Icelandic Penal Code (almenn hegningarlög): [...] "Anyone engaging in prostitution for own upkeep shall be subject to imprisonment for up to 2 years." [...] That paragraph was deleted in 2007, as the [...] "government argues most people who solicit sex {{do so because they}} have no other choice or because they are <b>forced</b> into <b>prostitution</b> by others. By making soliciting sex legal, the government believes individuals who have been <b>forced</b> into <b>prostitution</b> would rather come forward and lead police to those responsible."This move was supported by international women's groups.|$|R
