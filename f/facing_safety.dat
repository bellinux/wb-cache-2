But the Administration has an opportunity to bolster the oversight of programs like 340B to ensure the most vulnerable are protected and no one is abusing the program.

40|$|Accidental {{injury is}} {{a major cause of}} {{mortality}} and morbidity among children, warranting research on their risk perceptions. Three hundred and seven children aged 10 - 11 years assessed the frequency, danger and personal risk likelihood of 8 accidents. Two socialcognitive biases were manifested. The frequency of rare accidents (e. g. drowning) was overestimated, and the frequency of common accidents (e. g. bike accidents) underestimated; and the majority of children showed unrealistic optimism tending to see themselves as less likely to suffer these accidents in comparison to their peers, offering superior skills or parental control of the environment as an explanation. In the case of pedestrian accidents, children recognised their seriousness, underestimated the frequency of this risk and regarded their own road crossing skill as protection. These findings highlight the challenging task <b>facing</b> <b>safety</b> educators who, when teaching conventional safety knowledge and routines, also need to alert children to the danger of over-confidence without disabling them though fear...|$|E
40|$|The Hong Kong {{construction}} industry is currently facing ageing problem and labour shortage. There are opportunities for employing ethnic minority construction workers {{to join this}} hazardous industry. These ethnic minority workers are prone to accidents due to communication barriers. Safety communication is playing an important role for avoiding the accidents on construction sites. However, the ethnic minority workers are not very fluent in the local language and <b>facing</b> <b>safety</b> communication problems while working with local workers. Social network analysis (SNA), being an effective tool to identify the safety communication flow on the construction site, is used to attain the measures of safety communication like centrality, density and betweenness within the ethnic minorities and local workers, and to generate sociograms that visually represent communication pattern within the effective and ineffective safety networks. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present the application of SNA for improving the safety communication of ethnic minorities in the {{construction industry}} of Hong Kong. The paper provides the theoretical background of SNA approaches for the data collection and analysis using the software UCINET and NetDraw, to determine the predominant safety communication network structure and pattern of ethnic minorities on site...|$|E

Previous studies concentrated mainly on the attenuation of noise by safety helmets, and were made under conditions untypical of day-to-day motorcycling. During town driving the sample equivalent continuous noise level (s. leq) ranged from 63 to 90 dB(A), the intercom giving the highest peak levels. On the open road s. leq was up to 105 dB(A); exposure to this level for only 15 min would exceed the present recommended maximum of 90 dB(A) for an 8 h working day...|$|R
