5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made <b>in</b> <b>Hebron.</b> Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made <b>in</b> <b>Hebron</b> during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made <b>in</b> <b>Hebron</b> would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E
5|$|The glass {{industry}} <b>in</b> <b>Hebron</b> was established during Roman rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE). As the ancient Phoenician {{glass industry}} shrank from the exposed cities {{along the eastern}} Mediterranean coastline, the industry migrated inland, to Hebron in particular. Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit {{as part of the}} Drake Collection. Stained glass windows made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the Cave of Machpelah, which served as a church during the Crusader era in Palestine. Another example of stained glass windows produced <b>in</b> <b>Hebron</b> are those adorning the Dome of the Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, {{the newly}} {{appointed}} Ottoman pasha ("governor") of the sanjak ("district") of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to subdue the rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil Pasha marched towards Hebron with his army in July 1855, and after crushing the opposition, {{he ordered the}} local shaykhs to summon to his camp. Several of the shaykhs, including {{the leader of the}} 'Amr clan and Muslih al-'Azza, did not obey the summons. Kamil Pasha then requested that the British consul in Jerusalem, James Finn, serve as an envoy and arrange a meeting with Muslih. Finn sent his vice-consul to assure Muslih of his safety <b>in</b> <b>Hebron</b> and convinced him to meet with Kamil Pasha. Muslih was well received <b>in</b> <b>Hebron</b> and returned to Bayt Jibrin escorted by twenty of the governor's men. Soon after, the Kamil Pasha paid a visit to Bayt Jibrin to settle affairs and collect the town's overdue taxes. Kamil Pasha took an oath of loyalty from all the local shaykhs in the Hebron region, including those under the rule of Muslih al-'Azza.|$|E

5|$|Although the Koran {{does not}} mention details of Joseph's burial, Islamic {{tradition}} points to Nablus as being the authentic site. However, some early Islamic geographers identified the Cave of the Patriarchs <b>in</b> <b>Hebron</b> as housing his tomb. While Ali of Herat (1119), Yaqut (1229) and Ibn Battuta (1369) all report the Hebron traditions, they also mention {{the existence of a}} tomb of Joseph at Nablus. Later Muslim chroniclers even mention a third site purporting to be the authentic tomb, near Beit Ijza.|$|E
5|$|Decline {{in market}} demand {{combined}} with movement restrictions {{imposed by the}} Israeli military {{have led to a}} deterioration of the local economy, particularly in the trade and the stone-cutting industries.

5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied <b>in</b> <b>Hebron.</b> The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{the glass}} was melted using local raw materials, {{including}} sand from neighbouring villages, sodium carbonate (from the Dead Sea), and coloring additives such as iron oxide and copper oxide. Nowadays, recycled glass {{is often used}} instead. Glass production <b>in</b> <b>Hebron</b> is a family trade, the secrets {{of which have been}} preserved and passed down by a few Palestinian families who operate the glass factories located just outside the city. The products made include glass jewellery, such as beads, bracelets, and rings, as well as stained glass windows, and glass lamps. However, due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, glass production has suffered a decline.|$|E

5|$|In Islamic tradition, Bayt Jibrin is {{the burial}} {{place of the}} sahaba (companion) of the prophet Muhammad, Tamim al-Dari, who was famously known for his piety and briefly served as the Governor of Jerusalem in the late 7th century.

5|$|The Six-Day {{war began}} when Israel {{launched}} {{air strikes against}} Egypt's air force on 5 June 1967. The war ended in an Arab defeat and Israel's occupation of several Arab territories, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although Nasser and his Arab allies had been defeated, Arafat and Fatah could claim a victory, in {{that the majority of}} Palestinians, who had up to that time tended to align and sympathize with individual Arab governments, now began to agree that a 'Palestinian' solution to their dilemma was indispensable. Many primarily Palestinian political parties, including George Habash's Arab Nationalist Movement, Hajj Amin al-Husseini's Arab Higher Committee, the Islamic Liberation Front and several Syrian-backed groups, virtually crumbled after their sponsor governments' defeat. Barely a week after the defeat, Arafat crossed the Jordan River in disguise and entered the West Bank, where he set up recruitment centers <b>in</b> <b>Hebron,</b> the Jerusalem area and Nablus, and began attracting both fighters and financiers for his cause.|$|E
5|$|As part of Muhammad Ali's {{modernization}} policies, Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian {{governor of}} the Levant, issued conscription orders for a fifth of all Muslim males of fighting age. Encouraged by rural sheikh Qasim al-Ahmad, the urban notables of Nablus, Hebron and the Jerusalem-Jaffa area did not carry out Ibrahim Pasha's orders to conscript, disarm and tax the local peasantry. The religious notables of Safad followed suit. Qasim and other local leaders rallied their kinsmen and revolted against the authorities in May 1834, taking control of several towns. While {{the core of the}} fighting was in the central mountain regions of Palestine (Samaria and Judea), the revolt also spread to the Galilee, Gaza and parts of Transjordan. Jerusalem was briefly captured by the rebels and plundered. Faced with the superior firepower and organization of Ibrahim Pasha's troops, the rebels were defeated in Jabal Nablus, Jerusalem and the coastal plain before their final defeat <b>in</b> <b>Hebron,</b> which was leveled. Afterward, Ibrahim Pasha's troops pursued and captured Qasim in al-Karak, which was also leveled.|$|E

5|$|In 1556 the sheikdom {{was led by}} Sheikh Abu Rayyan bin Sheikh Manna, who was {{succeeded by}} Sheikh Muhammad Abu Rabban in 1560. Olive oil was the primary {{commodity}} that Bani Zeid Nahiya produced and the product was sold to local Ottoman officials and soap factories in Nablus. The Ottomans imposed taxes on olive oil, wheat and barley, and the sheikh was responsible for paying the revenues of collected taxes to the Ottoman authorities. In addition, Bani Zeid was required to finance a waqf (religious endowment) to the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Ibrahimi Mosque <b>in</b> <b>Hebron.</b> In 1596 both Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima appeared in Ottoman tax registers and both villages paid taxes on wheat, barley, olive trees, fruit trees, vineyards, goats and/or beehives. Deir Ghassaneh had a population of 76 households, all Muslim, while Beit Rima had 54 Muslim households and 14 Christian households.
