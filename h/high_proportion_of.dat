40|$|According to narrative-informed {{approaches}} to psychotherapy, self-narratives {{that no longer}} align with lived experience, and thereby impede coherent meaning-making, often bring individuals into treatment. Exposure to trauma can result in fragmented or disorganized self-narratives, and Emotion-focused Therapy for Trauma (EFTT) (Paivio & Pascual-Leone, 2010) is one treatment approach that helps trauma clients access, explore, and integrate traumatic memories into coherent personal narratives. The Narrative-Emotion Process Coding System (NEPCS 2. 0; Angus Narrative-Emotion Marker Lab, 2015) is a video-based coding system that consists of 10 narrative-emotion markers (i. e., client storytelling processes) that have been divided into three NEPCS marker subgroups, based on their degree of narrative-emotion integration: Problem, Transition, and Change markers. The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the relationship between NEPCS markers and outcome (i. e., recovered vs. unchanged) across stage of therapy in a complex trauma sample receiving EFTT (N = 12 clients). The key hypotheses included: recovered clients would have significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Transition markers in the early and middle stages of therapy, and significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Change markers in the late stage of therapy, while unchanged clients would have significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Problem markers across all stages of therapy. Additionally, recovered clients would have significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> shifting (i. e., movement between one NEPCS marker and a different NEPCS marker), and significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> productive shifting (i. e., movement away from Problem markers), whereas unchanged clients would have <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> unproductive shifting (i. e., movement to Problem markers). Results suggested that, in line with theoretical expectations and previous NEPCS research applications, recovered clients showed significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Transition and Change markers, whereas unchanged clients demonstrated <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> Problem markers. Increased levels of NEPCS shifting, or flexibly moving between NEPCS markers, was also associated with recovery. Furthermore, recovered clients demonstrated significantly <b>higher</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> productive shifting, while their unchanged counterparts demonstrated more unproductive shifting, suggesting that the type of narrative flexibility may be an important prognostic indicator. A direction for future NEPCS research is to elucidate therapeutic interventions that facilitate client movement from unproductive to more productive modes of narrative-emotion processing...|$|R

5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively <b>high</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
