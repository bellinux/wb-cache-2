50|$|The {{rhizomes}} of aromatic ginger {{have been}} reported to contain cineol, borneol, 3-carene, camphene, kaempferol, kaempferide, cinnamaldehyde, p-methoxycinnamic acid, ethyl cinnamate, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>p-methoxycinnamate.</b> Extracts of the plant using methanol have shown larvicidal activity against the second-stage larvae of dog roundworms (Toxocara canis). It was also found to be effective as an amebicide in vitro against three species of Acanthamoeba, which cause granulomatous amebic encephalitis and amebic keratitis. In 1999, the rhizome extract was found to inhibit activity of Epstein-Barr virus. Further research has demonstrated the extract effectively kills larvae of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus and repels adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, both of which are serious disease vectors. As a result of these findings, research is underway to evaluate the plant extract's use as an insect repellent, with preliminary findings suggesting it is not an irritant to the skin of rats.|$|E
40|$|Background Many tumors express {{on their}} {{receptor}} tyrosine kinases vascular endothelial growth factor activity associated with angiogenesis. Inhibition of angiogenesis through reduction of tyrosine kinase activity is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The present study aimed {{to determine the}} mechanism and potency of <b>ethyl</b> <b>p-methoxycinnamate</b> (EPMC) isolated from Kaempferia galanga as angiogenesis inhibitor. Methods A laboratory experimental study was conducted using chorio-allantoic membranes (CAMs) of nine-day old chicken eggs induced by 60 ng {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF). <b>Ethyl</b> <b>p-methoxycinnamate</b> (EPMC) potency was determined at dosages of 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg and compared with celecoxib 60 mg as reference drug and one negative bFGF-induced control group. Neovascularization and endothelial cell count in CAM blood vessels were evaluated. To predict the antiangiogenic mechanism of EPMC, a docking study was performed with the Molegro Virtual Docker program on tyrosine kinase as receptor (PDB 1 XKK). Results Angiogenesis stimulation by bFGF was prevented significantly (p< 0. 05) by EPMC at dosages of 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg and this activity was dose dependent. Molecular docking showed interaction between EPMC functional groups and tyrosine kinase amino acids at Met 766, Met 793, Thr 854, Thr 790, Gln 791 and Ala 743. There was an association between EPMC antiangiogenic activity and docking study results. Conclusions <b>Ethyl</b> <b>p-methoxycinnamate</b> is a potential new angiogenesis inhibitor through interaction with tyrosine kinase. EPMC could be a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of angiogenesis-related diseases...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the potential estrogenic effect of galangal root extract on prevention of osteoporosis and as an anti-cholesterol agent. In-silico test is performed to measure the molecular interactions between <b>ethyl</b> <b>p-methoxycinnamate</b> and ethyl cinnamate with estrogen receptor protein (1 QKM) and in-vivo tests conducted by the ovariectomy method on female Wistar rats. Thirty female Wistar rats were divided into six treatment groups. Group I is the normal mice and the group II-VI is the ovariectomies rats. Ovariectomy surgery performed at 70 days of age rats. Group II is the baseline of ovariectomized rats. Group III rats treated with CMC-Na 0. 5 % (control). Group IV rats are treated with estradiol 2 μg/kg BW/day while the group V and VI rats are rats treated with galangal root ethanol extract (500 and 1. 000) mg/kg BW/day. Administration of the test material was performed for 30 days. At the end of the experiment, a blood sample was taken from orbital sinus for measurement of blood lipid levels. All the rats were sacrificed for necropsy procedures. The results showed that galangal root ethanol extracts significantly decrease the cholesterol and LDL levels, and enhance the femur bone density. However, extract has not significantly effect in decrease the triglyceride and enhance the HDL levels of ovariectomized rats. There were almost the same binding energy between <b>ethyl</b> <b>p-methoxycinnamate,</b> ethyl cinnamate and 17 β-estradiol on 1 QKM protein with binding energy is - 94. 9984; - 949 948 and - 94. 9982 respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oils were extracted using the hydrodistillation method from four Zingiberaceae species; Zingiber officinale var. rubrum, Zingiber amaricans, Kaempferia galanga, and Boesenbergia pandurata. Volatile components of all extracts {{were analyzed by}} gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques. The major constituents of Zingiber officinale, Zingiber amaricans, Kaempferia galanga, and Boesenbergia pandurata were identified as E-citral (20. 98 %), zerumbone (40. 70 %), <b>ethyl</b> <b>p-methoxycinnamate</b> (58. 47 %) and camphor (57. 97 %), respectively. Kaempferia galanga and Zingiber amaricans were rich in sesquiterpenes whereas Boesenbergia pandurata and Zingiber officinale var. rubrum contained mostly monoterpenes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the antibacterial properties of ethyl-p-methoxycinnamate and p-methoxycinnamate acid from Kaempheria galanga L. Ethyl-p-methoxycinnamate was isolated from the n-hexane rhizome extract of Kaempheria galanga L. Separation and purification of this compound was carried out with vacuum liquid chromatography and column chromatography. Hydrolysis of ethyl-p-methoxycinnamic under alkaline conditions obtained p-methoxycinnamic acid with a good yield of 85 %. The structure of the compounds were charactrized with IR, NMR spectrophotometer (1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR) and mass spectrophotometer. The antibacterial properties of the compounds were evaluated using microdilution methods against B. cereus ATCC 11778, L. monocytogenes ATCC 7644, E. coli ATCC 25922, S. enterica sv Typhimurium ATCC 14028, and E. aerogenes ATCC 13048. The compounds showed weak antibacterial properties. Only <b>ethyl</b> <b>p-methoxycinnamate</b> showed the strongest antibacterial activity, especially against B. cereus ATCC 11778 bacteria with MIC values of 62. 5 mg /mL. The change of the functional groups provided no {{significant impact on the}} antibacterial activity...|$|E
