Not that Steele was worse than his time; on the contrary, a far better, truer, and higher-hearted man than most who lived in it. But things were done in that society, and names were named, which would make you shudder now. What would be the sensation of a polite youth of the present day, if at a ball he saw the young object of his affections taking a box out of her pocket and a pinch of snuff: or if at dinner, by the charmer’s side, she deliberately put her knife into her mouth? If she cut her mother’s throat with it, mamma would scarcely be more shocked. I allude to these peculiarities of bygone times as an excuse for my favourite, Steele, who was not worse, and often much more delicate than his neighbours.|$|R
5000|$|Nethanel ben Isaiah (14th century) was a Yemenite Jewish rabbi, Biblical {{commentator}} {{and poet}} {{of the fourteenth}} century. He {{is best known as}} the author of a homiletic commentary on the Torah entitled Nur al-Zulm wa-Mashbah al-Hikm, or what is simply translated into Hebrew as Sefer Me'or ha-Afelah (ספר מאור האפלה). The first notice of this work was given by Jacob Saphir, who saw a manuscript of it at Hirbah, a small town in Yemen, in 1863. But the beginning of the manuscript was missing, and Saphir's statement that the author's name was Isaiah and that the title was Al-Nur wal-Zulm depends only <b>upon</b> <b>hearsay.</b> Two other manuscripts, one in Berlin and one in the Bodleian Library, bear the author's name, Nethanel ben Isaiah, and the full title of the work, Nur al-Zulm wa-Mashbah al-Hikm wa-Ikhraj al-Ma'ani fi al-Wujud Ba'd al'Adm. Alexander Kohut published a monograph on this work, giving some extracts, under the title [...] "Light of Shade and Lamp of Wisdom" [...] (New York, 1894). This title is given by Kohut as the translation of the Arabic title, though [...] "Light out of Darkness" [...] would be a more fitting translation, since Nethanel's introduction shows that his object was to comment on the obscure passages so as to make sure that their meanings should not escape the student.|$|R

40|$|In 2004, the U. S. Supreme Court held in Crawford v. Washington that {{testimonial}} hearsay is inadmissible {{at trial}} unless the declarant {{is available for}} cross-examination. Courts have subsequently struggled to define “testimonial hearsay,” but have often vaguely defined it as an out-of-court statement made for {{the primary purpose of}} establishing past events for use in future prosecution. Although Crawford intended to protect a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, in doing so, it overlooked the holding’s detrimental effects on two particular types of victims: domestic violence and rape victims. Under Crawford, domestic violence and rape victims’ out-of-court statements are likely to be considered testimonial because the sensitive and personal nature of these incidents often results in substantial deliberation prior to any declaration, as opposed to the impromptu declarations made during so-called ongoing emergencies. In turn, these statements are likely viewed as made for future prosecution. Moreover, domestic violence and rape victims have especially compelling and uniquely fragile psychological reasons to be unavailable for cross-examination, including being at risk at for re-traumatization. Yet, despite these reasons, Crawford still places pressure on these victims to be cross-examined in front of their perpetrators because testimonial hearsay evidence is often determinative in these types of trials, and thus an unavailable victim would lead to an increased likelihood of the perpetrator escaping conviction. This sensitivity and consequential unreliability surrounding the admissibility of testimonial <b>hearsay</b> <b>upon</b> which domestic violence and rape cases rely also disincentives prosecutors from pursuing these cases, further exacerbating the unlikelihood of conviction. To alleviate the detrimental impacts that Crawford has on both victims and trials, this Article suggests that Crawford’s essential terminology must be narrowly defined, exceptions to the ruling must be expanded upon, and victims must be adequately safeguarded...|$|R

60|$|If any {{one were}} to ask me how I knew that these {{beautiful}} creatures were of supreme social value, I should be obliged to own that it was largely an assumption based <b>upon</b> <b>hearsay.</b> For all I can avouch personally in the matter {{they might have been}} women come to see the women who had not come. Still, if the effects of high breeding are visible, then they were the sort they looked. Not only the women, but the men, old and young, had the aristocratic air which is not aggressive, the patrician bearing which is passive and not active, and which in the English seems consistent with so much that is human and kindly. There is always the question whether this sort of game is worth the candle; but that is a moral consideration which would take me too far from the little scene I am trying to suggest; it is sufficient for the present purpose that the English think it is worth it. A main fact of the scene was the constant movement of distinguished figures within the sacred close, and up and down the paths past the rows of on-lookers on their penny chairs. The distinguished figures were apparently not the least molested by the multiplied and concentrated gazes of the on-lookers, who were, as it were, outside the window, and of the street. What struck one accustomed to the heterogeneous Sunday crowds of Central Park, where any such scene would be so inexpressibly impossible, was the almost wholly English personnel of the crowd within and without the sacred close. Here and there a Continental presence, French or German or Italian, pronounced its nationality in dress and bearing; one of the many dark subject races of Great Britain was represented in the swarthy skin and lustrous black hair and eyes of a solitary individual; there were doubtless various colonials among the spectators, and in one's nerves one was aware of some other Americans. But these exceptions only accented the absolutely English dominance of the spectacle. The alien elements were less evident in the observed than in the observers, where, beyond the barrier, which there was nothing to prevent their passing, they sat in passive rows, in passive pairs, in passive ones, and stared and stared. The observers were mostly men, and largely men of the age when the hands folded {{on the top of the}} stick express a pause in the emotions and the energies which has its pathos. There were women among them, of course, but the women were also of the age when the keener sensibilities are taking a rest; and such aliens of their sex as qualified the purely English nature of the affair lost whatever was aggressive in their difference.|$|R

50|$|The only {{authority}} for the particulars of his ejection is John Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy, where the author is {{not sure of the}} Christian name, and calls him Mikefer, but says he was descended from a branch of the imperial line of Russia, and was sent to England by Mr. Joseph Bidell, a Russian merchant, to be educated at Oxford, when his and his two brothers' lives were in danger from a powerful faction in Russia. In an article in the ‘S. D. U. K. Dictionary,’ Mr. Thomas Watts is unable to connect this story definitely with any records in Russian historians. He became rector of Woolley, in Huntingdonshire, in 1618, and was ejected in or about 1643. It appears that the ‘fifths’ were duly paid to him by his successor. At the Restoration in 1660 he was reinstated, but after some time retired to his son's house at Hammersmith, where he died. The particular hardships he endured are narrated by Walker, but, they are not worth recording, as they are given <b>upon</b> mere <b>hearsay,</b> derived from a letter from Peter Phelips, minister of Woolley, to Mr. Clavel.

40|$|Debate {{concerning}} {{the limits of}} judicial power over expert witnesses remains active and in its early states. Commentators charting the course of judicial opinions observe {{that some of the}} modern regulatory proposals have yet to enlist official adoption. Part of the problem may relate to recognition of questions. Courts will adjudicate critical issues only when they are made aware of them. The burden of calling attention to an expert 2 ̆ 7 s flawed bases falls squarely on trial lawyers who must make astute and incisive objections. In this formative period of legal development important decisions will be made. The future direction of courtroom control over the burgeoning onslaught of expert opinion will be shaped in the years immediately ahead. For this reason, it is vital that the aforementioned debate continue. Positions previously advanced need to be refined and reiterated. Courts should be alerted to the issues. As judges become aware of significant questions [...] questions which are sometimes subtly lodged in the tangle of an appellate record [...] information about how to resolve them needs to be readily at hand. Into this uncertain world Professor Imwinkelried 2 ̆ 7 s article [47 Mercer L. Rev. 447 (1996) ] comes, and it makes a worthwhile contribution. Imwinkelried 2 ̆ 7 s focus on Federal Rule of Evidence 703 is rightly directed. That rule, like no other, will control most of the future development of expert witness law. Rule 703 {{is at the core of}} significant inquiries which confront our courts. Can the expert 2 ̆ 7 s proponent formally introduce the <b>hearsay</b> reports <b>upon</b> which an expert relies to supply his courtroom opinion? Is a trial judge precluded from testing the credibility of the underlying data the expert used to reach her conclusions? Imwinkelried raises these questions, and they will be the targets of this commentary as well...|$|R
60|$|The cult of Alfred was {{a popular}} cult, from the {{darkness}} of the ninth century to the deepening twilight of the twentieth. It is wholly as a popular legend that I deal with him here. I write as one ignorant of everything, except that I have found the legend of a King of Wessex still alive in the land. I will give three curt cases of what I mean. A tradition connects the ultimate victory of Alfred with the valley in Berkshire called the Vale of the White Horse. I have seen doubts of the tradition, which may be valid doubts. I do not know when or where the story started; it is enough that it started somewhere and ended with me; for I only seek to write <b>upon</b> a <b>hearsay,</b> as the old balladists did. For the second case, there is a popular tale that Alfred played the harp and sang in the Danish camp; I select it because it is a popular tale, at whatever time it arose. For the third case, there is a popular tale that Alfred came in contact with a woman and cakes; I select it because it is a popular tale, because it is a vulgar one. It has been disputed by grave historians, who were, I think, a little too grave to be good judges of it. The two chief charges against the story are that it was first recorded long after Alfred's death, and that (as Mr. Oman urges) Alfred never really wandered all alone without any thanes or soldiers. Both these objections might possibly be met. It has taken us nearly as long to learn the whole truth about Byron, and perhaps longer to learn the whole truth about Pepys, than elapsed between Alfred and the first writing of such tales. And as for the other objection, do the historians really think that Alfred after Wilton, or Napoleon after Leipsic, never walked about in a wood by himself for the matter of an hour or two? Ten minutes might be made sufficient for the essence of the story. But I am not concerned to prove the truth of these popular traditions. It is enough for me to maintain two things: that they are popular traditions; and that without these popular traditions we should have bothered about Alfred about as much as we bother about Eadwig.|$|R
6000|$|With Maurice I had {{for some}} time been acquainted through Eyton Tooke, who had known him at Cambridge, and {{although}} my discussions with him were almost always disputes, I had carried away from them much that helped to build up my new fabric of thought, {{in the same way}} as I was deriving much from Coleridge, and from the writings of Goethe and other German authors which I read during these years. I have so deep a respect for Maurice's character and purposes, as well as for his great mental gifts, that it is with some unwillingness I say anything which may seem to place him on a less high eminence than I would gladly be able to accord to him. But I have always thought that there was more intellectual power wasted in Maurice than in any other of my contemporaries. Few of them certainly have had so much to waste. Great powers of generalization, rare ingenuity and subtlety, and a wide perception of important and unobvious truths, served him not for putting something better into the place of the worthless heap of received opinions on the great subjects of thought, but for proving to his own mind that the Church of England had known everything from the first, and that all the truths on the ground of which the Church and orthodoxy have been attacked (many of which he saw as clearly as anyone) are not only consistent with the Thirty-nine Articles, but are better understood and expressed in those Articles than by anyone who rejects them. I have never been able to find any other explanation of this, than by attributing it to that timidity of conscience, combined with original sensitiveness of temperament, which has so often driven highly gifted men into Romanism, from the need of a firmer support than they can find in the independent conclusions of their own judgment. Any more vulgar kind of timidity no one who knew Maurice would ever think of imputing to him, even if he had not given public proof of his freedom from it, by his ultimate collision with some of the opinions commonly regarded as orthodox, and by his noble origination of the Christian Socialist movement. The nearest parallel to him, in a moral point of view, is Coleridge, to whom, in merely intellectual power, apart from poetical genius, I think him decidedly superior. At this time, however, he might be described as a disciple of Coleridge, and Sterling as a disciple of Coleridge and of him. The modifications which were taking place in my old opinions gave me some points of contact with them; and both Maurice and Sterling were of considerable use to my development. With Sterling I soon became very intimate, and was more attached to him than I have ever been to any other man. He was indeed one of the most lovable of men. His frank, cordial, affectionate, and expansive character; a love of truth alike conspicuous in the highest things and the humblest; a generous and ardent nature, which threw itself with impetuosity into the opinions it adopted, but was as eager to do justice to the doctrines and the men it was opposed to, as to make war on what it thought their errors; and an equal devotion to the two cardinal points of Liberty and Duty, formed a combination of qualities as attractive to me as to all others who knew him as well as I did. With his open mind and heart, he found no difficulty in joining hands with me across the gulf which as yet divided our opinions. He told me how he and others had looked <b>upon</b> me (from <b>hearsay</b> information), as a [...] "made" [...] or manufactured man, having had a certain impress of opinion stamped on me which I could only reproduce; and what a change took place in his feelings when he found, in the discussion on Wordsworth and Byron, that Wordsworth, and all which that name implies, [...] "belonged" [...] to me as much as to him and his friends. The failure of his health soon scattered all his plans of life, and compelled him to live at a distance from London, so that after the first year or two of our acquaintance, we only saw each other at distant intervals. But (as he said himself in one of his letters to Carlyle) when we did meet it was like brothers. Though he was never, in the full sense of the word, a profound thinker, his openness of mind, and the moral courage in which he greatly surpassed Maurice, made him outgrow the dominion which Maurice and Coleridge had once exercised over his intellect; though he retained to the last a great but discriminating admiration of both, and towards Maurice a warm affection. Except in that short and transitory phasis of his life, during which he made the mistake of becoming a clergyman, his mind was ever progressive: and the advance he always seemed to have made when I saw him after an interval, made me apply to him what Goethe said of Schiller, [...] "er hatte eine furchtliche Fortschreitung." [...] He and I started from intellectual points almost as wide apart as the poles, but the distance between us was always diminishing: if I made steps towards some of his opinions, he, during his short life, was constantly approximating more and more to several of mine: and if he had lived, and had health and vigour to prosecute his ever assiduous self-culture, there is no knowing how much further this spontaneous assimilation might have proceeded.|$|R
