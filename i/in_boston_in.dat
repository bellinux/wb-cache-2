5|$|Hazelton had {{a studio}} {{at the old}} Harcourt Building <b>in</b> <b>Boston</b> <b>in</b> 1904, when a severe fire burned the life's work of several artists {{including}} Hazelton, Joseph DeCamp, and William M.

5|$|In 1629, the Massachusetts Bay Colony's first {{governor}} John Winthrop led {{the signing}} of the Cambridge Agreement, a key founding document of the city. Puritan ethics and their focus on education influenced its early history; America's first public school was founded <b>in</b> <b>Boston</b> <b>in</b> 1635. Over the next 130 years, the city participated in four French and Indian Wars, until the British defeated the French and their Indian allies in North America.

5|$|In the 19th century, {{approaches}} to Handel in German and English-speaking countries diverged further. In Leipzig in 1856, the musicologist Friedrich Chrysander and the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus founded the Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft {{with the aim}} of publishing authentic editions of all Handel's works. At the same time, performances in Britain and the United States moved away from Handel's performance practice with increasingly grandiose renditions. Messiah was presented in New York in 1853 with a chorus of 300 and <b>in</b> <b>Boston</b> <b>in</b> 1865 with more than 600.|$|E
5|$|Propagated {{from seed}} {{collected}} by William Baxter in southern Australia, common heath was introduced into cultivation in England by the Clapton Nursery in 1825.

In 1873, a variety known as Epacris impressa alba was recorded as being grown commercially for cut flowers <b>in</b> <b>Boston</b> <b>in</b> the United States. While initially popular – over seventy cultivars appeared in the literature at the time – most have since disappeared.|$|E

Adams's parents were devout Puritans and members of the Old South Congregational Church. The family lived on Purchase Street in Boston. Adams was proud of his Puritan heritage, and emphasized Puritan values in his political career, especially virtue.|$|E

5|$|Since {{they were}} not given {{boarding}} passes for Flight11 in Portland, Atta and Omari checked in and went through security <b>in</b> <b>Boston.</b> <b>In</b> the rushed check-in after the flight from Portland, airline officials did not load Atta's bags on Flight11. Suqami, Wail al-Shehri, and Waleed al-Shehri also checked in for the flight in Boston. Wail al-Shehri and Suqami each checked one bag; Waleed al-Shehri did not check any bags. CAPPS selected all three for a detailed luggage check. As the CAPPS' screening was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|Southard {{was born}} <b>in</b> <b>Boston</b> <b>in</b> 1876 to Martin Southard and Olive Wentworth Knowles. His {{paternal}} ancestors included Mayflower passenger and Plymouth Colony leader Myles Standish. Olive Southard was descended from early residents of New Hampshire and Maine. Frederick Parker Gay, one of E. E. Southard's longtime friends and his posthumous biographer, wrote that Southard's parents were only modestly successful academically. His {{mother was a}} schoolteacher for several years; his father, who supervised a cotton-waste factory and established a trucking business, earned enough money to ensure that Southard {{did not have to}} work during his undergraduate and graduate studies.|$|E

5|$|After {{reading the}} novella, Mansfield was {{intrigued}} by {{the opportunity to play}} a dual role. He secured the right to adapt the story for the stage in the United States and the United Kingdom, and asked Sullivan to write the adaptation. The play debuted <b>in</b> <b>Boston</b> <b>in</b> May 1887, and a revised version opened on Broadway in September of that year. Critics acclaimed Mansfield's performance as the dual character. The play was popular in New York and on tour, and Mansfield was invited to bring it to London. It opened there in August 1888, just before the first Jack the Ripper murders. Some press reports compared the murderer to the Jekyll-Hyde character, and Mansfield was suggested as a possible suspect. Despite significant press coverage, the London production was a financial failure. Mansfield's company continued to perform the play on tours of the U.S. until shortly before his death in 1907.|$|E
