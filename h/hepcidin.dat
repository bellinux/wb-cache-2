25|$|Although this {{mechanism}} is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, {{it can cause}} problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces <b>hepcidin</b> in response to inflammatory cytokines, <b>hepcidin</b> levels can increase {{as the result of}} non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of anemia of chronic disease, in which not enough iron is available to produce enough hemoglobin-containing red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Anaemia, {{caused by}} both chronic blood loss from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract and reduced absorption {{due to the}} up-regulation of <b>hepcidin</b> should also be treated, and this often {{requires the use of}} parenteral iron.|$|E
25|$|Iron export {{occurs in}} a variety of cell types, {{including}} neurons, erythrocytes, macrophages and enterocytes. The latter two are especially important since systemic iron levels depend upon them. There is only one known iron exporter, ferroportin. It transports ferrous iron out of the cell, generally aided by ceruloplasmin and/or hephaestin (mostly in enterocytes), which oxidize iron to its ferric state so it can bind ferritin in the extracellular medium. <b>Hepcidin</b> causes the internalization of ferroportin, decreasing iron export. Besides, <b>hepcidin</b> seems to downregulate both TFR1 and DMT1 through an unknown mechanism. Another player assisting ferroportin in effecting cellular iron export is GAPDH. A specific post translationally modified isoform of GAPDH is recruited to the surface of iron loaded cells where it recruits apo-transferrin in close proximity to ferroportin so as to rapidly chelate the iron extruded.|$|E
25|$|The human bodyâ€™s rate of iron {{absorption}} {{appears to}} respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, {{the extent to which the}} bone marrow is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. The body also absorbs less iron during times of inflammation, in order to deprive bacteria of iron. Recent discoveries demonstrate that <b>hepcidin</b> regulation of ferroportin is responsible for the syndrome of anemia of chronic disease.|$|E
25|$|Anemia {{is by far}} {{the most}} common {{abnormality}} of the blood cells which can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. The chronic inflammation caused by RA leads to raised <b>hepcidin</b> levels, leading to anemia of chronic disease where iron is poorly absorbed and also sequestered into macrophages. RA may also cause a warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The red cells are of normal size and color (normocytic and normochromic). A low white blood cell count usually only occurs in people with Felty's syndrome with an enlarged liver and spleen. The mechanism of neutropenia is complex. An increased platelet count occurs when inflammation is uncontrolled.|$|E
25|$|These {{intestinal}} lining {{cells can}} then either store the iron as ferritin, which {{is accomplished by}} Fe3+ binding to apoferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into feces), or the cell can release it into the body via the only known iron exporter in mammals, ferroportin. Hephaestin, a ferroxidase that can oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps ferroportin transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells. In contrast, ferroportin is post-translationally repressed by <b>hepcidin,</b> a 25-amino acid peptide hormone. The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, enterocytes synthesize more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to iron deficiency anemia. Iron absorption from diet is enhanced {{in the presence of}} vitamin C and diminished by excess calcium, zinc, or manganese.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{regulation}} of iron metabolism is still poorly understood, a clear model of how haemochromatosis operates is still not available. A working model describes the defect in the HFE gene, where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of transferrin, which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE {{is only part of}} the story, since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE genotype. A possible explanation is the fact that HFE normally plays a role in the production of <b>hepcidin</b> in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.|$|E
500|$|Iron uptake is tightly {{regulated}} by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake. Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people {{as a result of}} a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6 and leads to abnormally low levels of <b>hepcidin,</b> a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders, known medically as hemochromatosis. Many people have an undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload, and are not aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, people should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to be the cause of 0.3 to 0.8% of all metabolic diseases of Caucasians.|$|E
2500|$|The {{expression}} of <b>hepcidin,</b> which only occurs in certain cell types such as hepatocytes, is tightly controlled {{at the transcriptional level}} and {{it represents the}} link between cellular and systemic iron homeostasis due to hepcidin's role as [...] "gatekeeper" [...] of iron release from enterocytes into the rest of the body. Erythroblasts produce erythroferrone, a hormone which inhibits <b>hepcidin</b> and so increases the availability of iron needed for hemoglobin synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|To reduce {{bacterial}} growth, plasma {{concentrations of}} iron are lowered {{in a variety}} of systemic inflammatory states due to increased production of <b>hepcidin</b> which is mainly released by the liver in response to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-6. This functional iron deficiency will resolve once the source of inflammation is rectified; however, if not resolved, it can progress to Anaemia of Chronic Inflammation. [...] The underlying inflammation can be caused by fever, inflammatory bowel disease, infections, Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), carcinomas, or following surgery.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to killing bacteria directly {{they have been}} demonstrated to {{have a number of}} immunomodulatory functions that may be involved in the clearance of infection, including the ability to alter host gene expression, act as chemokines and/or induce chemokine production, inhibiting lipopolysaccharide induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting wound healing, and modulating the responses of dendritic cells and cells of the adaptive immune response. Animal models indicate that host defence peptides are crucial for both prevention and clearance of infection. It appears as though many peptides initially isolated as and termed [...] "antimicrobial peptides" [...] have been shown to have more significant alternative functions in vivo (e.g. <b>hepcidin).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hepcidin</b> is {{the master}} {{regulator}} of iron metabolism and, therefore, most genetic forms of iron overload {{can be thought of}} as relative <b>hepcidin</b> deficiency in one way or another. For instance, a severe form of iron overload, juvenile hemochromatosis, is a result of severe <b>hepcidin</b> deficiency. The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the hemojuvelin gene (HJV or RGMc/repulsive guidance molecule c). The exceptions, people who have mutations in the gene for ferroportin, prove the rule: these people have plenty of <b>hepcidin,</b> but their cells lack the proper response to it. So, in people with ferroportin proteins that transport iron out of cells without responding to hepcidin's signals to stop, they have a deficiency in the action of <b>hepcidin,</b> if not in <b>hepcidin</b> itself.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the recent}} {{discovery}} of <b>hepcidin</b> and its function in iron metabolism, anemia of chronic disease {{was seen as}} the result of a complex web of inflammatory changes. Over the last few years, however, many investigators have come to feel that <b>hepcidin</b> is the central actor in producing anemia of chronic inflammation. <b>Hepcidin</b> offers an attractive Occam's Razor (parsimonious) explanation for the condition, and more recent descriptions of human iron metabolism and <b>hepcidin</b> function reflect this view.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after this}} discovery, {{researchers}} discovered that <b>hepcidin</b> production in mice increases in conditions of iron overload {{as well as}} in inflammation. Genetically modified mice engineered to overexpress <b>hepcidin</b> died shortly after birth with severe iron deficiency, again suggesting a central and not redundant role in iron regulation. The first evidence that linked <b>hepcidin</b> to the clinical condition known as the anemia of inflammation came from the lab of Nancy Andrews in Boston when researchers looked at tissue from two patients with liver tumors with a severe microcytic anemia that did not respond to iron supplements. The tumor tissue appeared to be overproducing <b>hepcidin,</b> and contained large quantities of <b>hepcidin</b> mRNA. Removing the tumors surgically cured the anemia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hepcidin</b> is a {{regulator}} of iron metabolism. <b>Hepcidin</b> inhibits iron transport by binding to {{the iron}} export channel ferroportin {{which is located}} on the basolateral surface of gut enterocytes and the plasma membrane of reticuloendothelial cells (macrophages). <b>Hepcidin</b> ultimately breaks down the transporter protein in the lysosome. Inhibiting ferroportin prevents iron from being exported and the iron is sequestered in the cells. [...] By inhibiting ferroportin, <b>hepcidin</b> prevents enterocytes from allowing iron into the hepatic portal system, thereby reducing dietary iron absorption. The iron release from macrophages is also reduced by ferroportin inhibition. Increased <b>hepcidin</b> activity is partially responsible for reduced iron availability seen in anemia of chronic inflammation, such as renal failure.|$|E
50|$|In lab mice, <b>hepcidin</b> {{has been}} found to have {{anti-inflammatory}} properties. This is a negative feedback: it reduces the inflammation which caused the elevated <b>hepcidin</b> level.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hepcidin</b> is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the HAMP gene. <b>Hepcidin</b> {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of the entry of iron into the circulation in mammals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hepcidin</b> {{exists as}} a preprohormone (84 amino acids), prohormone (60 amino acids), and hormone (25 amino acids). Twenty- and 22-amino acid {{metabolites}} of <b>hepcidin</b> also {{exist in the}} urine. Deletion of 5 N-terminal amino acids results in loss of function. The conversion of prohepcidin to <b>hepcidin</b> is mediated by the prohormone convertase furin. This conversion may be regulated by alpha-1 antitrypsin.|$|E
5000|$|... Î²-thalassemia, one of {{the most}} common {{congenital}} anemias, arises from partial or complete lack of Î²-globin synthesis. Excessive iron absorption is {{one of the}} main features of Î²-thalassemia and can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. The serial analyses of Î²-thalassemic mice indicate hemoglobin levels decreases over time, while the concentration of iron in the liver, spleen, and kidneys markedly increases. The overload of iron is associated with low levels of <b>hepcidin.</b> Patients with Î²-thalassemia also have low <b>hepcidin</b> levels. The observations led researchers to hypothesize that more iron is absorbed in Î²-thalassemia than is required for erythropoiesis. Increasing expression of <b>hepcidin</b> in Î²-thalassemic mice limits iron overload, and also decreases formation of insoluble membrane-bound globins and reactive oxygen species, and improves anemia. Mice with increased <b>hepcidin</b> expression also demonstrated an increase in the lifespan of their red cells, reversal of ineffective erythropoiesis and splenomegaly, and an increase in total hemoglobin levels. From these data, researchers suggested that therapeutics to increase <b>hepcidin</b> levels or act as <b>hepcidin</b> agonists could help treat the abnormal iron absorption in individuals with Î²-thalassemia and related disorders. [...] In later studies in mice, erythroferrone has been suggested to be the factor that is responsible for the <b>hepcidin</b> suppression. Correcting <b>hepcidin</b> and iron levels in these mice did not improve their anemia.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in HJV are {{responsible}} {{for the vast majority of}} juvenile hemochromatosis patients. A small number of patients have mutations in the <b>hepcidin</b> (HAMP) gene. The gene was positionally cloned. Hemojuvelin is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart, and to a lesser extent in the liver. One insight into the pathogenesis of juvenile hemochromatosis is that patients have low to undetectable urinary <b>hepcidin</b> levels, suggesting that hemojuvelin is a positive regulator of <b>hepcidin,</b> the central iron regulatory hormone. As a result, low <b>hepcidin</b> levels would result in increased intestinal iron absorption. Thus, HJV/RGMc appears to play a critical role in iron metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Any one {{of several}} {{mutations}} in <b>hepcidin</b> result in juvenile hemochromatosis. The majority of juvenile hemochromatosis cases are due to mutations in hemojuvelin. Mutations in TMPRSS6 can cause anemia through dysregulation of <b>Hepcidin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vitamin D {{has been}} shown to {{decrease}} <b>hepcidin,</b> in cell models looking at transcription and when given in big doses to human volunteers. Optimal function of <b>hepcidin</b> may be predicated upon the adequate presence of vitamin D in the blood.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{diseases}} where failure to adequately absorb iron contributes to iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia. The treatment {{will depend on}} the <b>hepcidin</b> levels that are present, as oral treatment will be unlikely to be effective if <b>hepcidin</b> is blocking enteral absorption, in which cases parenteral iron treatment would be appropriate. Studies have found that measuring <b>hepcidin</b> would be of benefit to establish optimal treatment, although as this is not widely available, C-reactive protein (CRP) is used as a surrogate marker.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hepcidin,</b> a {{peptide hormone}} that regulates iron homeostasis.|$|E
5000|$|HAMP: <b>Hepcidin</b> {{antimicrobial}} peptide. Gene map locus 19q13.12 ...|$|E
50|$|Recent {{studies have}} also shown that the peptide hormone <b>hepcidin</b> {{may play a role}} in the {{regulation}} of hemoglobin production, and thus affect erythropoiesis. The liver produces <b>hepcidin.</b> <b>Hepcidin</b> controls iron absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and iron release from reticuloendothelial tissue. Iron must be released from macrophages in the bone marrow to be incorporated into the heme group of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. There are colony forming units that the cells follow during their formation. These cells are referred to as the committed cells including the granulocyte monocyte colony forming units.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hepcidin</b> is {{a tightly}} folded {{polypeptide}} with 32% beta sheet character and a hairpin structure stabilized by 4 disulfide bonds. The structure of <b>hepcidin</b> {{has been determined}} through solution NMR. [...] NMR studies showed a new model for hepcidin: at ambient temperatures, the protein interconverts between two conformations, which could be individually resolved by temperature variation. The solution structure of <b>hepcidin</b> was determined at 325 K and 253 K in supercooled water. X-ray analysis of a co-crystal with Fab revealed a structure similar to the high-temperature NMR structure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hepcidin</b> {{synthesis}} and secretion by {{the liver}} {{is controlled by}} iron stores within macrophages, inflammation, hypoxia, and erythropoiesis. Macrophages communicate with the hepatocyte to regulate <b>hepcidin</b> release into the circulation via eight different proteins: hemojuvelin, heriditrary hemochromatosis protein, transferrin receptor 2, bone morphogenic protein 6 (BMP6), matriptase-2, neogenin, BMP receptors, and transferrin.|$|E
50|$|Ferroportin is {{inhibited}} by <b>hepcidin,</b> which binds to ferroportin and internalizes {{it within}} the cell. This results in the retention of iron within enterocytes, hepatocytes, and macrophages with a consequent reduction in iron levels within the blood serum. This is especially significant with enterocytes which, when shed {{at the end of}} their lifespan, results in significant iron loss. This is part of the mechanism that causes anaemia of chronic disease; <b>hepcidin</b> is released from the liver in response to inflammatory cytokines, namely interleukin-6, which results in an increased <b>hepcidin</b> concentration and a consequent decrease in plasma iron levels.|$|E
50|$|Anaemia is {{commonly}} present in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Due to raised levels of inflammatory cytokines {{which lead to}} the increased expression of <b>hepcidin,</b> parenteral iron is the preferred treatment option as it bypasses the gastrointestinal system, has lower incidence of adverse events and enables quicker treatment. <b>Hepcidin</b> itself is also an anti-inflammatory agent. In the murine model very low levels of iron restrict <b>hepcidin</b> synthesis, worsening the inflammation that is present. Enteral nutrition {{has been found to}} be efficient to improve hemoglobin level in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, especially combined with erythropoietin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hepcidin</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in human urine and serum in 2000.|$|E
50|$|A soluble form of HJV {{may be a}} {{molecule}} that suppresses <b>hepcidin</b> expression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hepcidin</b> is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the HAMP gene.|$|E
50|$|Taken together, these discoveries {{suggested}} that <b>hepcidin</b> regulates {{the absorption of}} iron into the body.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to inflammatory cytokines, increasingly IL-6, the liver produces increased amounts of <b>hepcidin.</b> <b>Hepcidin</b> in turn causes increased internalisation of ferroportin molecules on cell membranes which prevents release from iron stores. Inflammatory cytokines {{also appear to}} affect other important elements of iron metabolism, including decreasing ferroportin expression, and probably directly blunting erythropoiesis by decreasing {{the ability of the}} bone marrow to respond to erythropoietin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expression}} of <b>hepcidin,</b> which only occurs in certain cell types such as hepatocytes, is tightly controlled {{at the transcriptional level}} and {{it represents the}} link between cellular and systemic iron homeostasis due to hepcidin's role as [...] "gatekeeper" [...] of iron release from enterocytes into the rest of the body.
