Open-ended interviews were utilized where necessary to clarify information that needed clarifications by the respondents; physical examination of the some affected animals and it surroundings were carried out during the surveillance. The following diseases were established in the study area: Peste des peptits ruminants, Foot rot, helminthosis, mite/lice/flea infestation, tick infestation, bloat, Orf (Contagious ecthyma), poison, mange, Newcastle disease, fowl pox, coccidiosis, infectious bursal <b>disease</b> (<b>Gumboro),</b> chronic respiratory <b>disease,</b> African Swine Fever (ASF), abortion, Dystocia, sudden death, foot and mouth disease, Fascioliasis, trypanosomosis, black quarter disease, babesiosis, and wounds.

40|$|Infectious bursal disease (IBD) or {{known as}} <b>Gumboro,</b> is a <b>disease</b> that attacks chicken older than 3 weeks, caused by famili Birnaviridae virus. Gumboro in Indonesia was firstly {{reported}} in 1983 and until now is commonly found. Very virulent IBD virus causes high {{morbidity and mortality}} that can even reach 100 %. Clinical symptoms are exhibited as sluggish chicken, dropped wings and cloacal pasting. At gross examination, the bursa was found swollen, with yellowish fluid or hemorrhagic 3 days after infection. The bursa will get atrophy from 7 days post-infection. Meanwhile, the non virulent IBD virus causes subclinical symptoms. Chicken that survived, became stunted or dwarfed. On gross and histopathological findings, the bursa Fabricius has mild lesion and will recover at 14 days post-infection. Diagnosis of IBD can be determined based on pathological observation, supported by immunohistochemical examination and laboratory confirmation of disease by agar gel immunodiffusion, polymerase chain reaction techniques, antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and isolation. Detection of antibodies {{can be made by}} serum neutralization technique or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

In previous studies, intravenously administered PAMP had variable effects on specific primary and secondary immune responses of poultry to systemically administered antigens. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of intratracheal (i. t.) challenge with the PAMP lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and Zymosan-A (containing 1, 3 ß-glucan) on primary and secondary (total) antibody (Ab) responses and (isotype) IgM, IgG, and IgA responses to systemically administered human serum albumin (HuSA), and Ab titers to infectious bursal <b>disease</b> (<b>Gumboro</b> virus) and infectious bronchitis vaccines in layer hens at 9 and 22 wk of age. Birds were challenged via the trachea with PAMP for 5 consecutive days prior to primary and secondary immunization with HuSA. Intratracheally administered LTA and, to a minor extent, lipopolysaccharide significantly enhanced secondary total and IgG Ab responses to HuSA. 1, 3 ß-Glucan did not significantly affect Ab responses to HuSA. All birds challenged with PAMP showed a decreased BW. Higher total Ab titers to infectious bursal disease and infectious bronchitis were found in birds challenged with LTA. The present results indicate that i. t. administered PAMP affect the humoral immune responsiveness of poultry, which may lead to an enhanced status of immune reactivity.

5000|$|Infectious bursal disease, IBD (also {{known as}} <b>Gumboro</b> <b>disease,</b> {{infectious}} bursitis and infectious avian nephrosis) {{is a highly}} contagious disease of young chickens caused by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), [...] characterized by immunosuppression and mortality generally at 3 to 6 weeks of age. The disease was first discovered in Gumboro, Delaware in 1962. It is economically important to the poultry industry worldwide due to increased susceptibility to other diseases and negative interference with effective vaccination. In recent years, very virulent strains of IBDV (vvIBDV), causing severe mortality in chicken, have emerged in Europe, Latin America, South-East Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Infection is via the oro-fecal route, with affected bird excreting high levels of the virus for approximately 2 weeks after infection.|$|E
5000|$|Risk {{factors that}} have been {{identified}} as increasing vent pecking include dim lights placed in nest boxes to encourage hens to use the boxes, the diet being changed more than three times during the egg laying period, the use of bell drinkers, and the hens beginning to lay earlier than 20 weeks of age. [...] Vent pecking is associated with indicators of stress, e.g. fluctuating asymmetry, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, and tonic immobility duration. [...] Vent pecking can be related to disease or immune challenge as it sometimes becomes prevalent in cases of <b>Gumboro</b> <b>disease</b> (Infectious Bursal Disease) and is increased by challenges with the protein antigen, human serum albumin (HuSA). [...] Housing design can influence vent pecking. Mortality caused by cannibalism was reduced when hens had sufficient room to perch all facing the feed trough, thus giving their perch-mates little opportunity to peck at the vent region [...] and increased pecking activity and cannibalistic behaviour can occur due to inadequate height of the perches. [...] Larger group sizes lead to increases in vent pecking suggesting that social learning plays a role.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gumboro</b> <b>disease</b> is {{an acute}} {{infectious}} disease which causes primary lesions in the Bursa Fabricii. The disease is most commonly seen in broilers between {{the third and}} sixth week of growth, and in egglaying hens up to the 18 th week. In susceptible flocks the disease emerges abruptly, with high morbidity (up to 100 %) and with an average mortality of 20 - 30 %. The disease causes large economic losses in intensive poultry production. In this investigation we used the epidemiological data on Gamboro disease spreading {{and the extent of}} economic losses in broilers and egg-laying hens on a single epizootiologic region during a six-year period. Closer analysis of economic losses was performed on experimental farms. A higher prevalence of the diseases in egg-laying hens than in broilers was observed (p< 0. 05), while the incidence was in both groups higher during the summer period (in June and July) than {{during the rest of the}} year (p< 0. 05). The extent of economic losses during observed period was 11, 654, 336 dinars. Broilers participated in total losses with 14. 76 %, and egg-laying hens with 85. 24 %. The proposed program of <b>Gumboro</b> <b>disease</b> control in the observed epizootiological region showed economic justification (NPV = 56. 277. 056, 84 dinars; RBC = 2. 418, and RTI = 4. 71 years) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{infectious}} bursal {{disease or}} <b>Gumboro</b> <b>disease</b> is an immunosuppressive pathology of birds, which has great importance in the poultry industry due to large economic losses that it produces {{not only for its}} direct effect, but because of the susceptibility to secondary infections, interference with commercial vaccines, reducing the effective use of them.

The pathology has three types of clinical presentation: a subclinical form, a mild or moderate clinical form and a severe clinical form. However, the type of manifestation is determined mainly by three factors: the age of birds at the time of infection, the type of strain or acting or genetic variability of it, and the immunity degree.

Histopathological analysis of the bursa revealed necrosis, presence of depleted follicles, some infiltration of heterophils, edema and formation of cystic cavities that are compatible with lesions observed in GD. Inoculation of embryonated eggs of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens with macerated bursa suspension resulted in embryo mortality and lesions which were also compatible with those caused by IBDV. A sample of bursa was submitted to a nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedure to amplify the hypervariable region of the VP 2 gene. The amplicon that was obtained from this sample (BR-GO) was digested with the restriction enzymes TaqI, StyI and SspI, but not with SacI, a pattern similar to that observed with very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) strains. Furthermore, nucleotide sequence analysis revealed alanine, isoleucine, and isoleucine at amino acid positions 222, 256, and 294, respectively, which are also found in vvIBDV strains.
