5|$|T Aurigae (Nova Aurigae 1891) was a nova {{discovered}} at magnitude 5.0 on January 23, 1892, by Thomas David Anderson. It became {{visible to the}} naked eye by December 10, 1891, as shown on photographic plates examined after the nova's discovery. It then brightened by a factor of 2.5 from December 11 to December 20, when it reached a maximum magnitude of 4.4. T Aurigae faded slowly in January and February 1892, then faded quickly during March and April, reaching a magnitude of 15 in late April. However, its brightness began to increase in August, reaching magnitude 9.5, where it stayed until 1895. Over the subsequent two years, its brightness decreased to 11.5, and by 1903, it was approximately 14th magnitude. By 1925, it had reached its current magnitude of 15.5. When the nova was discovered, its spectrum showed material moving at a high speed towards Earth. However, when the spectrum was examined again in August 1892, it appeared to be a planetary nebula. Observations at the Lick Observatory by Edward Emerson Barnard showed it to be disc-shaped, with clear nebulosity in a diameter of 3 arcseconds. The shell had a diameter of 12 arcseconds in 1943. T Aurigae is classified as a slow nova, similar to DQ Herculis. Like DQ Herculis, WZ Sagittae, Nova Persei 1901 and Nova Aquilae 1918, it is a very close binary with a very short period. T Aurigae's period of 4.905 hours, comparable to DQ Herculis's period of 4.65 hours, and has a partial <b>eclipse</b> <b>period</b> of 40 minutes.|$|E

Already al-Biruni (Qanun VII.2.II) and Copernicus (de revolutionibus IV.4) noted that the period of 4,267 moons is actually about 5 minutes longer than the value for the <b>eclipse</b> <b>period</b> that Ptolemy attributes to Hipparchus.

[...] Modern scholars agree that Hipparchus rounded the <b>eclipse</b> <b>period</b> to the nearest hour, {{and used it to}} confirm the validity of the traditional values, rather than try to derive an improved value from his own observations. From modern ephemerides and taking account of the change in the length of the day (see ΔT) we estimate that the error in the assumed length of the synodic month was less than 0.2 seconds in the 4th century and less than 0.1 seconds in Hipparchus's time.|$|E
2500|$|Hipparchus {{also studied}} {{the motion of}} the Moon and {{confirmed}} the accurate values for two periods of its motion that Chaldean astronomers are widely presumed to have possessed before him, whatever their ultimate origin. The traditional value (from Babylonian System B) for the mean synodic month is 29days;31,50,8,20 (sexagesimal) = 29.5305941... days. Expressed as 29days + 12hours + 793/1080hours this value has been used later in the Hebrew calendar. The Chaldeans also knew that 251 synodic months ≈ 269 anomalistic months. [...] Hipparchus used the multiple of this period by a factor of 17, because that interval is also an <b>eclipse</b> <b>period,</b> and is also close to an integer number of years (4267 moons : 4573 anomalistic periods : 4630.53 nodal periods : 4611.98 lunar orbits : 344.996 years : 344.982 solar orbits : 126,007.003 days : 126,351.985 rotations). What was so exceptional and useful about the cycle was that all 345-year-interval eclipse pairs occur slightly over 126,007 days apart within a tight range of only about ±1/2 hour, guaranteeing (after division by 4267) an estimate of the synodic month correct to one part in order of magnitude 10 million. The 345 year periodicity is why the ancients could conceive of a mean month and quantify it so accurately that it is even today correct to {{a fraction of a second}} of time.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of BeiDou satellite orbits during <b>eclipse</b> <b>periods</b> {{is an important}} part of the performance analysis of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). Accuracy evaluation of satellite orbits in ephemeris of BDS during <b>eclipse</b> <b>periods</b> can provide support for the service performance assessment. It also helps to find possible deficiencies in the orbit modeling during <b>eclipse</b> <b>periods,</b> which may further contribute to the improvements of functional models for precise orbit determination. The effects of <b>eclipse</b> <b>periods</b> on the orbits of the three types of satellites of BDS are analyzed with the satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations ranging from January 2014 to July 2015. At the same time, the orbit radial accuracy of BDS broadcast and precise ephemeris are validated. The results show that, obvious orbit accuracy decrease can be observed in both broadcast and precise ephemeris for IGSO/MEO satellites during <b>eclipse</b> <b>periods</b> (especially the yaw-maneuver periods). And orbit radial errors of IGSO/MEO satellites in broadcast ephemeris reach 1. 5 ~ 2. 0 m, and exceed 10. 0 cm for that in precise ephemeris. Performance decrease of the GEO satellite orbit during eclipse arcs can hardly be revealed by the orbit radial residual series. During non-eclipse periods, radial accuracy of IGSO/MEO and GEO satellite orbits in broadcast ephemeris are better than 0. 5 m and 0. 9 m respectively. The radial accuracy of IGSO/MEO satellite orbits in precise ephemeris are better than 10. 0 cm and that of the GEO satellite is about 50. 0 cm with a systematic bias of 40. 0 cm around...|$|R

2500|$|The {{concept of}} eclipse {{suggests}} that Darwinian research paused, implying in turn {{that there had}} been a preceding period of vigorously Darwinian activity among biologists. However, historians of science such as Mark Largent have argued that while biologists broadly accepted the extensive evidence for evolution presented in The Origin of Species, there was less enthusiasm for natural selection as a mechanism. Biologists instead looked for alternative explanations more in keeping with their worldviews, which included the beliefs that evolution must be directed and that it constituted a form of progress. Further, the idea of a dark <b>eclipse</b> <b>period</b> was convenient to scientists such as Julian Huxley, who wished to paint the modern synthesis as a bright new achievement, and accordingly to depict the preceding period as dark and confused. Huxley's 1942 book [...] therefore, argued Largent, suggested that the so-called modern synthesis began after a long period of eclipse lasting until the 1930s, in which Mendelians, neo-Lamarckians, mutationists, and Weismannians, not to mention experimental embryologists and Haeckelian recapitulationists fought running battles with each other. The idea of an eclipse also allowed Huxley to step aside from what was to him the inconvenient association of evolution with aspects such as social Darwinism, eugenics, imperialism, and militarism. Accounts such as Michael Ruse's very large book Monad to Man ignored, claimed Largent, almost all the early 20th century American evolutionary biologists. Largent has suggested as an alternative to eclipse a biological metaphor, the interphase of Darwinism, interphase being an apparently quiet period in the cycle of cell division and growth.|$|E

This paper presents a model enabling the attitude to be correctly computed for both eclipsing as well as non-eclipsing satellites.

In addition, {{the next generation of}} INTELSAT VI satellites, and probably INTELSAT VII and VIII, will use Ni-H 2 batteries. This means that international telecommunications satellites will use Ni-H 2 batteries through the 1990 's. It is projected that the lifetime of these batteries will be greater than 10 years at deep depth-of-discharge (DOD), and that the battery subsystem will no longer limit satellite lifetime or communications capability during <b>eclipse</b> <b>periods.</b> This paper discusses the advantages of the Ni-H 2 battery, as compared with the Ni-Cd battery, for telecommunications satellites...|$|R
40|$|The Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) Explorer {{spacecraft}} is {{to study}} the physical processes that produce the aurora borealis and aurora australis. It is a unique plasma physics experiment that will take fundamental measurements of the magnetic and electrical fields. This investigation will add significantly {{to our understanding of}} the near-earth space environments and its effect. The FAST has a 1 year requirement and 3 -year goal for its mission life in low earth orbit. The FAST power power system topology is a Direct Energy Transfer (DET) system based on the SAMPEX design. The FAST flight battery supplies power to the satellite during pre-launch operations, the launch phase, the <b>eclipse</b> <b>periods</b> for all mission phases, and when the load is about 50 watts...|$|R
40|$|The ATS 5 and ATS 6 {{data for}} {{spacecraft}} charging during eclipse conditions is analyzed. The ATS 5 and ATS 6 charged to voltages greater than 100 volts for about 55 {{percent of the}} <b>eclipse</b> <b>periods</b> examined. The mean spacecraft potential during eclipse was 2 keV for ATS 5, and the highest potential measured was 10 kilovolts. For ATS 6, the mean potential during eclipse was 4 keV, the highest potential measured 20 keV. The average measured spacecraft potentials for both ATS 5 and 6 depend approximately linearly upon Kp. This relationship is due mainly to the dependence of electron current density on Kp near midnight. Spacecraft potentials at geosynchronous orbit may, to a rough approximation, thus be inferred from ground-based measurements of Kp, the planetary 3 -hour index...|$|R
