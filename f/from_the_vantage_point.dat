[...] (17) Others, such as Denise Chavez (Face of an Angel,1994) support Olmos' position.

[...] In general, Amy Barrias' analyses of representative coming-of-age Chicano and American Indian texts, including Bless Me, Ultima allows her to conclude that because American Indian and Chicano(a) writers find very little in dominant culture on which to build an identity, they have turned inward to create their own texts of rediscovery.

40|$|Viewed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> <b>points</b> {{provided}} by political {{economy and a}} range of allied critical theories, a spatiality of circulation is a defining feature of capitalist money and finance. For financial markets in particular, it is the capacity to commodify credit–debt relations, and thereby render them transferable and exchangeable, which is crucial to the opportunities they afford for speculation. The chapter theorizes and analyses how speculative circulations are also the object of an array of spatial imaginaries, constitutive representations of financial flows that position them as vital to wealth, well-being and security in contemporary Anglo-American, neoliberal life. It focuses on three particular spatial imaginaries of speculative circulations that loomed large in the governance of the global financial crisis; namely, the ‘liquidity’ of money markets, the ‘toxicity’ of capital markets and the ‘casino’ practices of banking...|$|R
