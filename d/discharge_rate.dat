They based the Glacial Lake Missoula <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> on the rate predicted for the Spokane Valley–Rathdrum Prairie immediately downstream of Glacial Lake Missoula, for which a number of previous estimates had placed the maximum discharge of 17 × 106m3/s and total amount of water discharged equal to the maximum estimated volume of Lake Missoula (2184nbsp&km3). Neglecting erosion effects, their simulated water flow was based on modern-day topography. Their major findings were that the calculated depth of water in each flooded location except for the Spokane Valley–Rathdrum Prairie was shallower than the field evidence showed. For example, their calculated water depth at the Pasco Basin–Wallula Gap transition zone is about 190 m, significantly less than the 280–300 m flood depth indicated by high-water marks. They concluded that a flood of ~106m3/s could not have made the observed high-water marks.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} {{begins as}} tidal flats gain elevation relative to sea level by sediment accretion, and subsequently the rate {{and duration of}} tidal flooding decreases so that vegetation can colonize on the exposed surface. The arrival of propagules of pioneer species such as seeds or rhizome portions are combined {{with the development of}} suitable conditions for their germination and establishment in the process of colonisation. When rivers and streams arrive at the low gradient of the tidal flats, the <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> reduces and suspended sediment settles onto the tidal flat surface, helped by the backwater effect of the rising tide. Mats of filamentous blue-green algae can fix silt and clay sized sediment particles to their sticky sheaths on contact which can also increase the erosion resistance of the sediments. This assists the process of sediment accretion to allow colonising species (e.g.,Salicornia spp.) to grow. These species retain sediment washed in from the rising tide around their stems and leaves and form low muddy mounds which eventually coalesce to form depositional terraces, whose upward growth is aided by a sub-surface root network which binds the sediment. Once vegetation is established on depositional terraces further sediment trapping and accretion can allow rapid upward growth of the marsh surface such that there is an associated rapid decrease in the depth and duration of tidal flooding. As a result, competitive species that prefer higher elevations relative to sea level can inhabit the area and often a succession of plant communities develops.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{relationship}} between <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> of locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons {{and rates of}} norepinephrine release was examined in the anesthetized rat. Neuronal <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> of locus coeruleus neurons were altered and quantified using a combined recording-infusion probe. Peri-locus coeruleus infusions of either the cholinergic agonist, bethanechol, or the a 2 -agonist, clonidine, were used to enhance or suppress neuronal discharge activity, respectively. Alterations in concentrations of extracellular norepinephrine within the prefrontal cortex were determined using in vivo microdialysis and high-pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. A linear {{relationship between}} locus coeruleus activity and norepinephrine dialysate concentration was observed between complete suppression of locus coeruleus discharge activity and approximately 300 – 400 % of basal discharge levels (1. 58 ^ 0. 29 Hz). Above these levels, increases in locus coeruleus <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> were not accompanied by similar increases in dialysate norepinephrine concentrations. In general, neither activation nor suppression of locus coeruleus neuronal <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> appeared to alter the relationship between discharge activity and norepinephrine efflux during subsequent epochs.

Moreover, the coefficients of variation (CoV) for the force and for the FCC signal were correlated in all subjects (R 2 range = 0. 14 – 0. 56; P < 0. 05) whereas the CoV for force was correlated to the interspike interval variability in only one subject (R 2 = 0. 12; P < 0. 05). Similar results were further obtained from measures on the tibialis anterior muscle of an additional eight subjects during contractions at forces up to 20 % of the maximal force (e. g. FCC explained 59. 8 ± 11. 0 % of variability of the smoothed <b>discharge</b> <b>rates).</b> In conclusion, one signal captures most of the underlying variability of the low-frequency components of motor unit <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> and explains large part of the fluctuations in the motor output during isometric contractions...|$|R
