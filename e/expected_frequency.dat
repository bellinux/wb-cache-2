2500|$|High CpG {{methylation}} in mammalian genomes has {{an evolutionary}} cost because {{it increases the}} frequency of spontaneous mutations. Loss of amino-groups occurs with a high frequency for cytosines, with different consequences depending on their methylation. Methylated C residues spontaneously deaminate to form T residues over time; hence CpG dinucleotides steadily deaminate to TpG dinucleotides, which {{is evidenced by the}} under-representation of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome (they occur at only 21% of the <b>expected</b> <b>frequency).</b> (On the other hand, spontaneous deamination of unmethylated C residues gives rise to U residues, a change that is quickly recognized and repaired by the cell.) ...|$|E

50|$|Resonant but {{somewhat}} 'lossy' {{materials are}} applied to the reflecting surfaces of the target. The thickness of the material corresponds to one-quarter wavelength of the expected illuminating radar-wave (a Salisbury screen).

Deviation from the <b>expected</b> <b>frequency</b> will cause losses in radar absorption, so this type of RAM is only useful against radar with a single, common, and unchanging frequency.|$|E
