40|$|Abstract—Focus on the <b>hill-start</b> auto control {{technology}} of the medium and heavy duty vehicles, structure of the spring brake cylinder and principle of the pneumatic auto parking brake system were analyzed. The force analysis of the vehicles {{which is on the}} hill was researched. The relationships between the driving force, the braking force and the grade resistance in the process of hill start were analyzed. The release time of the driving force was the key of <b>hill-start</b> control, and it influenced the process of hill start. The ideal control curve of the <b>hill-start</b> auto control was raised, and the release time of the parking brake was the time that the braking force could overcome the grade resistance. The control strategies of the pneumatic auto parking brake system were designed for the hill start, and the control software was written. The test vehicle was refitted, and the control strategy and software were written. The feasibility of the control strategy and software was proved on the test vehicle.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel speed estimation scheme for induction motors (IMs) based on back electromotive-force model reference adaptive system (back-EMF MRAS). The scheme is employed {{for the purpose}} of sensorless fault-Tolerant torque-controlled drives used in a limp-home mode operation in electric vehicle (EV) applications. The proposed scheme was experimentally tested on a laboratory dynamometer using a 19 -kW IM and a 29 -kW controller, which are both currently used in the automotive industry for EV applications. The scheme was also implemented on an electric golf buggy which was equipped with a 5 -kW IM. A performance comparison was carried out between the proposed and conventional back-EMF MRAS schemes for starting from standstill, sensitivity to parameter variations and constant speed operation with load variations. Utilizing the golf buggy, the behaviors of the new scheme was separately investigated for vehicle starting from standstill, wide speed range including field weakening region, and <b>hill-starting</b> operations. The proposed scheme is computationally easy to implement, robust against sensitivity to parameters variations, inverter nonlinearity and errors due to digitization in the field weakening region. This scheme is not only consistent for vehicle starting from standstill, it also provides a reliable vehicle-drive in the field weakening region and during vehicle <b>hill-starting.</b> The dynamometer and vehicle test-drive results show the suitability of the proposed scheme {{for the purpose of}} EV fault-Tolerant limp-home mode operation...|$|E
