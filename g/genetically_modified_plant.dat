Tobacco BY-2 cells, derived from N. tabacum {{cultivar}} 'Bright Yellow-2', are among the most important research tools in plant cytology.

Scientists modified bacteria to produce chymosin, which was also able to clot milk, resulting in cheese curds.|$|E

50|$|For {{functional}} genomics, metabolomics can be {{an excellent}} tool for determining the phenotype caused by a genetic manipulation, such as gene deletion or insertion. Sometimes {{this can be a}} sufficient goal in itself—for instance, to detect any phenotypic changes in a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>plant</b> intended for human or animal consumption. More exciting is the prospect of predicting the function of unknown genes by comparison with the metabolic perturbations caused by deletion/insertion of known genes. Such advances are most likely to come from model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. The Cravatt laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute has recently applied this technology to mammalian systems, identifying the N-acyltaurines as previously uncharacterized endogenous substrates for the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and the monoalkylglycerol ethers (MAGEs) as endogenous substrates for the uncharacterized hydrolase KIAA1363.|$|E
50|$|Two years later, in Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser, {{an equally}} narrow {{majority}} of the Supreme Court found that a farmer, by knowingly growing a crop containing genetically modified genes and cells that was not purchased, had infringed Monsanto’s patent. Schmeiser, the farmer, argued that, per Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), higher life forms, such as plants, do not constitute patentable subject matter in Canada, even though Monsanto’s patent was only directed to the modified gene and the cells containing the gene. This argument was rejected by a {{majority of the}} Court, which found that “whether or not patent protection for the gene and the cell extends to activities involving the plant is not relevant to the patent’s validity”, and since Monsanto did not claim a patent for a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>plant</b> per se, its claim of the gene and the cell was considered patentable subject matter.|$|E

By a 5-4 majority, the court ruled that it did. [...] The case drew worldwide attention and is widely misunderstood to concern what happens when farmers' fields are accidentally contaminated with patented seed. However, by the time the case went to trial, all claims had been dropped that related to patented seed in the field that was contaminated in 1997; the court only considered the GM canola in Schmeiser's 1998 fields, which Schmeiser had intentionally concentrated and planted from his 1997 harvest. Regarding his 1998 crop, Schmeiser did not put forward any defence of accidental contamination.|$|E

40|$|The {{beta-glucuronidase}} (GUS) gene is to {{date the}} most frequently used reporter gene in plants. Marketing of crops containing this gene requires prior evaluation of their biosafety. To aid such evaluations of the GUS gene, irrespective of the plant into which the gene has been introduced, the ecological and toxicological aspects of the gene and gene product have been examined. GUS activity is found in many bacterial species, is common in all tissues of vertebrates and is also present in organisms of various invertebrate taxa. The transgenic GUS originates from the enterobacterial species Escherichia coli that is widespread in the vertebrate intestine, and in soil and water ecosystems. Any GUS activity added to the ecosystem through <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>plants</b> will be of no or minor influence. Selective advantages to <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>plants</b> that posses and express the E. coli GUS transgene are unlikely.
