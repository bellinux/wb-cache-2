A set E of all {{symmetric}} Banach function spaces defined on [0, 1] is equipped with the partial order by the relation ⊂ c of continuous inclusion. Properties of symmetric spaces, which does not depend of their position in the ordered structure are studied. With the help of the J.

In his essay under the title “Speculation in colors.

This article attempts to show that the division between East and West, to the image of which we are so accustomed to, is neither ecclesial nor Christian, and that, on the contrary, naturally church vision of that separation is quite diﬀerent. The author aims to identify in the theopolitical context, what exactly is the vision of a church split...|$|R

5000|$|According to the credits, Master P isn't {{involved}} {{in the selection of}} these tracks, but the compiling was obviously done by some real No Limit soldiers who reach well past the big names: Master P, Snoop Dogg, Silkk the Shocker, C-Murder, and Mystikal. Hearing the forgotten Fiend's excellent, over-the-top [...] "Mr. Whomp Whomp" [...] is evidence that No Limit predicted the crunk craze of 2004-2005, and while ridiculous moments like [...] "Where the Little Souljas At?" [...] from pre-teen gangstas Lil Soldiers or the syrupy [...] "Picture U & Me Are" [...] from Mo B. Dick are embarrassing enough that P wouldn't have picked them, they are fun reminders of what a wacky and scrappy empire No Limit was. There's also some real heat pulled off long-lost compilations and soundtracks, and the big five's output for the label is whittled down to the most necessary tracks, although Snoop's time at the label was short and there's an argument to be made that C-Murder is underrepresented. For fans of true gutter music, there are still some early albums to acquire, but the clichéd [...] "the only No Limit you'll ever need" [...] does apply for the casual hip-hop fan. Better liner notes and some photographs -- there <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> none <b>included</b> -- would have been nice, but otherwise this is a great snapshot of the label that taught everyone else how to exploit the underground and released some great gangsta music along the way.|$|R
