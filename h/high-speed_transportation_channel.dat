40|$|DE 102007007533 B 3 UPAB: 20080711 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} producing <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> on a {{gas diffusion}} layer (GDL) by laser irradiation. Diameter of the <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> and {{distance of the}} <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> are controlled together based on fluid e. g. water, to be transported. The <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> exhibit tortuosity of 1, and have the diameter within a range of 10 to 500 micrometer. The <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> are spaced apart from each other such that the gas diffusion layer has 1 to 400 <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> per centimeter square. USE - Method for producing a gas diffusion layer of a fuel cell (all claimed) i. e. direct methanol fuel cell for transporting fluid i. e. water. Can {{also be used for}} transporting methanol, carbon dioxide, air and oxygen. ADVANTAGE - The <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> are produced on the gas diffusion layer by laser irradiation, and the diameter and distance of the <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> are controlled together based on the fluid to be transported, thus eliminating micro structuring of the gas diffusion layer, and enabling good transport of the gases and/or liquids...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} offer {{reference}} {{for the energy}} <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> in future, we evaluated the existing system with the information entropy theory. By calculating the base value for the scale of construction and the equilibrium degree with the data of annual investment in the fixed assets from 1986 to 2010, we measured the scale and its rationality, and analyzed the relation between <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> and the information entropy combined with the maximum entropy methods. Empirical {{results show that the}} partial information entropy Si still have certain rising space. We can improve the rationality of the energy <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> by improving the partial information entropy Si. And we should not let the rail <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> have excessive investment growth, and then secondly transfer some of the highway investment to the <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> of waterway or pipeline while finally advance the construction step of the pipeline <b>transportation</b> <b>channels.</b> This conclusion provides a quantitative basis for measuring the rationality of the construction scale of the energy <b>transportation</b> <b>channels.</b> The quantitative evaluation of the construction scale of energy <b>transportation</b> <b>channels</b> is a important supplement to the traditional research and provide evidence for further development.

30|$|Considering the {{complicated}} physical {{conditions such as}} road cracks in the <b>transportation</b> <b>channel</b> and ground lamps, it is often impossible to accurately detect foreign objects based on a single two-dimensional image processing method [10].

Secondly, based on the binocular stereo vision model, this study uses polar line constraints and epipolar correction to quickly match the common field of view of the binocular camera and calculate the depth information progressively. At the same time, the depth information obtained by comparative analysis can effectively exclude the influence of complex conditions on the channel on the detection results, so as to achieve accurate positioning of foreign objects in the <b>transportation</b> <b>channel</b> [11].|$|R
50|$|The main {{shortcomings}} of the ML-20 were its weight and limited mobility.

But when the ML-20 was developed, muzzle brakes were already a common design element in artillery pieces of that class.|$|R
