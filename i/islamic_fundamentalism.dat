On the other hand, a growing number Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) members were dissatisfied with the status of their party: the rise of <b>Islamic</b> <b>Fundamentalism,</b> the fall of the Soviet Union, and the failure of the LCP to assume a more democratic socialist platform ushered in an era of political decline for the party. This, coupled with perceived Syrian domination of its leadership, led to increasing frustration among rank-and-file communists against the upper echelons of the party.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of FN electoral success, the {{immigration}} debate, growing concerns over <b>Islamic</b> <b>fundamentalism,</b> and the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini, the 1989 affaire du foulard {{was the first major}} test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam. Following the event, surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam. In a 1989 legislative by-election in Dreux, FN candidate Marie-France Stirbois, campaigning on an anti-Islamism platform, returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly. By the early 1990s, some mainstream politicians began employing anti-immigration rhetoric. In {{the first round of the}} 1993 legislative elections the FN soared to 12.7% of the overall vote, but did not win a single seat due to the nature of the electoral system (if the election had used proportional representation, it would have won 64 seats).

40|$|Abstract The {{terrorist}} {{attacks against the}} United States on September 11, 2001, fueled widespread concern and speculation about mounting Islamophobic sentiment among Americans {{in response to the}} events. To monitor developments in opinions about Muslims and Arabs (both liv-ing in the United States and abroad) and attitudes toward the Islamic faith, survey organizations began to assess more regularly Americans’ attitudes on these topics. I analyze developments in public sentiment about Arab and Muslim Americans and Islam {{in the age of the}} war on terror using available public opinion data. The data analyses in this study suggest that Americans possess lingering resentment and reserva-tions about Arab and Muslim Americans. The evidence also reveals low levels of awareness about basic elements of Islam but growing anxiety about Islam’s (especially <b>Islamic</b> <b>fundamentalism’s)</b> compatibility with Western values of tolerance, acceptance, and civility.

The aim is to see why Maghrebian feminists as different as Mernissi and Djebar—a liberal democratic sociologist and a postmodern writer—have begun to move into Arab-Islamic cultural-political spaces which, until recently, have been occupied mainly by various Islamic fundamentalist factions and other right-wing groups such as conservative nationalists in the Maghreb.

40|$|Drawing upon a career's {{worth of}} both {{theoretical}} and empirical research, according to the Italian school of political science, the author provides a holistic assessment of contemporary world politics in this volume. The book commences by defining some concepts like "world order", namely a governance process with fixed values: during the post- 1989 era those of market, democracy and peace. Foreign policies are then classified into four models of political cultures: the "interests-intensive" conservative, the "ideologies-intensive" liberal, leftist constructivist and leftist Manichaean. The author shows how multipolar and bipolar systems have been relatively stable, with each main power defending its own interests yet ultimately not promoting ideas and order. Change periods are unstable. Between 1915 and 1945, Nazi-fascist and communist ideologies emerged, but after Yalta the West did not effectively export market, democracy and peace to the Third World. After 1989, the ideas of liberalism (in economic globalization and EU enlargement), neo-conservatism (in the Iraq war), and multi-cultural leftism (in pluri-national conflict resolution processes) began {{to be applied to}} achieve a "near" world order. Since 2001, <b>Islamic</b> <b>fundamentalism’s</b> threat has prevented both stability (with the failure of the concert of powers of the 1990 s) and order (with minimal improvements in democracy and peace). Following the Arab Spring, Obama also abandoned the “interests-intensive” conservative diplomacy. He no longer supported "lesser evils" (military or personalist regimes) against "absolute evils" (e. g., the Islamic State), and waged only "low intensity" wars in Iraq, Syria and Libya...|$|R

40|$|While Sayyid Qutb is an {{acclaimed}} Islamist {{and leader}} of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, that he has not been fully understood is confirmed by the persistent view that he laid the foundation for the prevailing 'Islamic terror and Islamist fundamentalism' all over the globe.

Did his childhood upbringing, education, works and Islamic revivalism give insight into the so-called phenomenon of 'Islamic terrorism still begging for answers.

40|$|One of the {{modernization}} conflicts of Kyrgyz and Kazak society {{is discussed in}} this article. It is the conflict between traditional religious activities, post-Soviet <b>Islamic</b> revival and <b>fundamentalism.</b> The Islamization process in Central Asia started during the Mongol Era (13 th – 16 th centuries).

After the democratic changes and the declaration of religious freedom, some elements of this 1000 -year-old tradition have been revived or revitalized. But the so-called official Islam, sponsored by Arabic states, has turned against the popular version of Islam by using the Soviet label of shamanic tradition. In reality, people practicing these traditions are devoted Muslims, they consider them to be pure Islamic traditions. But nationalist or ethnic religious movements, as well as urban esoteric practices, also incorporate elements of this tradition to legitimize their activities.

40|$|This article elaborates the {{phenomenon}} of fundamentalism {{and the future of}} Islamic political ideology. Islamic ideology represents religious views, ideas and movements which aspire to bring Islam into practice in state and societal affairs. One variant of <b>Islamic</b> ideologies is <b>fundamentalism</b> which endeavors to return religious practices back to the pristine Islam based on the Qur’ân and al-Hadîth. Fundamentalism rejects all modes of understand-ding which are not based on the Qur’ân and al-Hadîth, and refuses secular methodology in interpreting the Qur’ân. This type of Islamic ideology found its momentum when Saudi Arabia regime officially adopted Wahhabism, and when Egyptian intellectuals were united to fight against modernity. Both Saudi Arabia and Egypt became seeding ground for fundamentalism. Some young muslim scholars who studied there became agents for the dissemination dan transmission of the fundamentalist ideology throughout the world. In Indonesia, this ideology have developed since independence and the drafting of the constitution. In the Indonesian context, resistence from traditionalist and nationalit groups were so strong that enable to dam up the spread of fundamentalis ideas. However, fundamentalist ideology remains an important challenge for the future of Indonesian Islam...|$|R
40|$|ONE OF THE GREATEST {{dangers of}} our time, some claim, {{is the threat}} of a clash of civilizations in an {{impending}} and inevitable confrontation between Islam and the West. However, scholars such as John Esposito believe that such visions of the future rest generally on an exaggerated and distorted understanding of Islam and a misunderstanding of the nature of diversity and the complexity of social change (Esposito 1992, 4 - 5). The long cultural interchange between Islamic and Western societies over many centuries has been too diverse, mutually enriching and, at times, too promising to be so easily abandoned now (Shboul 1995, 37). A real, though less immediately evident, danger is the distortion of two great religious traditions due to the ideologically driven objectives of a few—a threat that impinges dangerously not only on relations between the Muslim world and the West but on the well-being of the religious traditions and of the world itself. Some clarifications are necessary before beginning any discussion on <b>Islamic</b> or Christian <b>fundamentalism.</b> There are many movements in Islam which, like Christianity and other world religions, is not a single monolithic entity.
