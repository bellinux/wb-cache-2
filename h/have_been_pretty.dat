25|$|Leicestershire Foxes {{took the}} win at Trent Bridge in a low-scoring match. Nottinghamshire Outlaws {{had won the}} toss and bowled first, and ought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> pleased with restricting the Foxes to 150 for 4, even though they conceded 15 extras. The opening {{partnership}} of HD Ackerman and Darren Maddy for 67 runs had promised more for Leicestershire. However, West Indian Ottis Gibson dug out two early wickets in Graeme Swann and Stephen Fleming - Darren Maddy and David Masters then took wickets at leisure, and Nottinghamshire were 96 for 7. Despite a rescue mission from Gareth Clough who hit 30 off 16 balls, there was no hitting power from the other players, and Nottinghamshire finished on 129 for 8.|$|E
500|$|Nigel Kneale {{himself was}} largely dismissive of the serial {{in the years}} {{following}} its broadcast; [...] "God knows it wasn't a very important sort of thing," [...] he told his biographer.

500|$|Writer and co-executive {{producer}} William Schmidt described Sofie's {{last seen}} action as [...] "raising her {{father at the}} end, bringing him back to life." [...] This was [...] "to indicate that she was truly evil", although [...] "she is the Omega so there's good in her too." [...] The third season [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> much centered on Sofie and the internal struggle of her good versus evil." [...] The nature of the Omega would have taken two seasons to unfold.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the couple}} had known and admired one another for many years, their mutual {{attraction}} deepened into love; marriage to Francesco allegedly caused Isabella to [...] "bloom".

2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's I think being gay must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but I think {{it was such a}} time when you didn't talk about issues that were personal, and I think that made him much more secretive and reclusive, and I think that was {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|E
2500|$|Later ecclesiastical synods {{require that}} letters under the bishop's seal {{should be given}} to priests when for some reason they {{lawfully}} quit their own proper diocese. Such a ruling was enacted at Chalon-sur-Saône in 813. Pope Nicholas I in the same century complained that the bishops of Dôle and Reims had, [...] "contra morem" [...] (contrary to custom), sent their letters to him unsealed. The custom of bishops possessing seals may from this date be assumed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> general.|$|E

2500|$|Macquarie Group economists {{estimated}} {{the energy crisis}} could reduce gross domestic product growth by 0.25 percentage points in the third quarter, as gas prices increased {{and the percentage of}} gas production allocated to export reduced. Natural gas sales were worth $5.2billion in the 2006/2007 financial year, and its five-year trend growth rate is 16.8%. Chief Macquarie economist Richard Gibbs said, [...] "WA supplies the lion's share of the gas exports. The effect on exports is that as {{there is a shortage of}} gas in the system, the capability to export will be diminished because the gas that there is will be directed towards domestic use... The gas exports <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> healthy. In the next couple of quarters that will be moderated dramatically if not stalled altogether. I think this will have an impact on the broader commodities side and the trade gap could widen".|$|E

He is scheduled to spend August 17 to the 20th in that state attending picnics and spaghetti dinners, and meeting with local pastors.

He told reporters that [...] "it was a great day for us and the results <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>pretty</b> dramatic. We had over 1,000 first-time contributors from Saturday night to Tuesday morning online and the phones have not stopped ringing." [...] In all, Huckabee experienced more media exposure in one week than he had in the past 6 months.
