5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as <b>global</b> warming and <b>global</b> dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of <b>global</b> warming and <b>global</b> dimming can occur at the same time. <b>Global</b> dimming interacts with <b>global</b> warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, <b>global</b> dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E

The <b>Global</b> Financial Markets Association facilitates discussion of <b>global</b> financial issues among members of various professional associations around the world.

40|$|This study explores how {{different}} kinds of knowledge of founders and managers at Born <b>Globals</b> {{are related to the}} firms' discovery and exploitation of foreign market opportunities. Based on data from eight biotech Born <b>Globals,</b> we dichotomized Born <b>Globals</b> into two subsets: Born Industrials and Born Academics. The study shows that the founders' and managers' different combinations of technological and international knowledge impact the firms' proactive or reactive behavior in discovering foreign market opportunities. The results indicate that {{different kinds of}} Born <b>Globals</b> follow different internationalization processes and that Born <b>Globals,</b> therefore, should not be analyzed as a homogenous group, which has been the common perspective in previous research.

40|$|Problem The {{internationalisation}} {{process of}} Born <b>Globals</b> {{is different than}} the internationalisation process of traditional firms and therefore Born <b>Globals</b> cannot {{be explained by the}} existing internationalisation theories. No model exists which can explain why Born <b>Globals</b> emerge even if different researchers have found many explanatory factors. Purpose The main purpose with our dissertation is to investigate and clarify the underlying factors of the emergence of Born <b>Globals.</b> Further, the purpose is to develop our own explanatory model to why Born <b>Globals</b> emerge. Methodology To test our model we conducted a survey using an on-line questionnaire. Our sample constituted firms connected to Ideon in Lund. Conclusions The research showed that the model we developed partly could explain why Born <b>Globals</b> emerge. When analysing why Born <b>Globals</b> emerge focus should be on the managers, the products, the market and the network...|$|R

40|$|Research {{pertaining}} {{to the role of}} active online internationalization (AOI) in the context of Born <b>Globals</b> {{has been shown to be}} an under-researched area of study. This compelled us to explore the possible benefits and challenges that may come from pursuing AOI for Swedish Born <b>Globals.</b> Our theoretical framework combined literature concerning Born <b>Globals</b> and their rapid internationalization with the notion of learning advantages of newness and literature regarding AOI into a theoretical model. Our theoretical investigation displayed a lack of research dealing with the potential challenges of AOI; with the virtuality trap of Yamin and Sinkovics (2006) being the exception. Through abductively analyzing qualitative data collected from four Swedish Born <b>Globals</b> with our theoretical model, we arrived at a number of empirically testable propositions that highlight the effects of using AOI for Swedish Born <b>Globals.</b> Our analysis leads to the conclusion that there are more challenges for Swedish Born <b>Globals</b> pursuing AOI than previously identified by present literature...|$|R

5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of <b>global</b> finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting <b>global</b> financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and <b>global</b> savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} <b>global</b> financial crisis {{to the extent that the}} United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future <b>global</b> financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of <b>global</b> finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E
