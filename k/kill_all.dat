5|$|As {{reported}} in the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, Thor once engages in a duel with Hrungnir, there described as the strongest of the jötnar. Prior to this, Hrungnir had been drunkenly boasting of his desire to, amongst other things, <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> of the gods except Freyja and Sif, whom {{he wanted to take}} home with him. However, at the duel, Hrungnir is quickly killed by the enraged Thor.|$|E
5|$|Captives {{taken by}} American Indians during the American Revolution might be ransomed by the British in Detroit, adopted into the tribe, enslaved, or simply killed. However, after the Gnadenhütten massacre, the Ohio Indians had {{resolved}} to <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> American prisoners who fell into their hands. The number of Americans executed after the Sandusky expedition is unknown, since their fate was usually recorded only {{if one of}} the prisoners survived to tell.|$|E

5000|$|These wars of {{extermination}} {{have been}} characterized as [...] "genocide" [...] by several authorities, because the Torah {{states that the}} Israelites annihilated entire ethnic groups or tribes: the Israelites <b>killed</b> <b>all</b> Amalekites, including men, women, and children (1 Samuel 15:1-20); the Israelites <b>killed</b> <b>all</b> men, women, {{and children in the}} battle of Jericho(Joshua 6:15-21), and the Israelites <b>killed</b> <b>all</b> men, women and children of several Canaanite tribes (Joshua 10:28-42). However, some scholars believe that these accounts in the Torah are exaggerated or metaphorical.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the large}} amount of effort focused at {{controlling}} insects, human attempts to kill pests with insecticides can backfire. If used carelessly, the poison can <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> kinds of organisms in the area, including insects' natural predators, such as birds, mice and other insectivores. The effects of DDT's use exemplifies how some insecticides can threaten wildlife beyond intended populations of pest insects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} series, Mark Schwartz, {{the head of}} Planet B, announces that the {{original}} Planet B is to shut down and replaced by a new service, Planet B Platinum.

5|$|At {{the reunification}} summit, the {{president}} personally requested Hyun-jun {{to be at}} his side. Concurrently, NSS agents realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall crisis was actually the hostages. The true IRIS agents escaped and infiltrated the summit to <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> delegates. IRIS agents killed and replaced various security agents for a massacre. Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. She pretended to be an IRIS agent and used the confusion to stop them. This created mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E
5|$|Back in South Park, Chef rallies {{the townspeople}} (in {{a parody of}} Braveheart) to fight the genetically {{engineered}} turkeys; humorously, one of the turkeys also rallies the other turkeys to fight the townspeople. A massive battle ensues in which Kenny is killed (his eye is poked and gouged out), but eventually the South Park residents <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> the turkeys and claim victory. The FBI returns Cartman to South Park and takes Marvin home, but not before he brings {{the bodies of the}} dead turkeys back to Ethiopia for everyone to eat. Marvin is then hailed as a hero by his people while they pass Struthers being bound and gagged over a fire.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel initiates {{a second}} {{broadcast}} by showing a simulated {{explosion of the}} U.S. Capitol building, causing a public panic. Farrell guesses that his next target is likely the power grid, and the two drive to a utility superstation in West Virginia. They find {{a team led by}} Mai taking over the station. McClane manages to <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> of them, including Mai. He obtains video footage of Gabriel which he relays to the FBI. Enraged over Mai's death, Gabriel seizes control of the natural gas distribution system and redirects all of the gas into the station. McClane and Farrell escape before the station explodes, leaving much of the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada without power.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} branch, Zero manages to <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> {{of her sisters}} and absorb their powers, {{managing}} to take down One with help from Accord. After absorbing all their powers, she and Mikhail are transported to another world and Mikhail destroys the monster Zero transforms into. With this, the flower's magic is sealed away, although Accord speculates that Zero might have survived and would reappear in some form. In the novel Drag-On Dragoon 3 Story Side, a novel detailing the events leading directly into Drakengard, a combination of events from other branches occurs. During the final confrontation with One, Mikhail is poisoned and Zero forms a pact with Mikhail to save him. After killing One, One's clone kills Zero.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can play}} a more {{aggressive}} run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E
5|$|The Genocide run {{requires}} the player to <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> monsters and maximize their LOVE. As Frisk reaches Asgore's castle, Sans attempts to stop them, but Frisk kills him along with Asgore and Flowey. Chara materializes after Flowey is killed and explains {{that they were}} resurrected by the player's LOVE. The player is then asked to join them {{in the destruction of}} the universe, which occurs regardless of the player's choice. In order to enable further replays of the game, Frisk must first give their soul to Chara in exchange for restoring the universe. In doing so, the ending of every subsequent Pacifist route is marred by Chara's malevolent presence.|$|E

5|$|The {{release of}} the Flood prompts Halo's AI monitor, 343 Guilty Spark, to recruit Master Chief in {{retrieving}} the Index, a device that will activate Halo and prevent the Flood from spreading beyond the facility. After Master Chief retrieves and prepares to use the Index, Cortana re-appears and warns him against the activation. She has discovered that Halo's defense system is a weapon designed to <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> sentient life in the galaxy, which will deny the host bodies the Flood requires to spread, a revelation which Guilty Spark confirms.|$|E
5|$|This game's {{challenge}} mode {{is called}} the Challenge of the Titans (seven trials), and requires players to complete a series of specific tasks (e.g., <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> enemies without being attacked). The player may unlock bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and concept art of the characters and environments, as rewards, as well as usage of the abilities found in the urns during the first playthrough. Completion of each difficulty level unlocks additional rewards, as does collecting twenty eyes from defeated cyclopes. A new mode, called Arena of the Fates, allows players to set difficulty levels and choose their own opponents to improve their skills.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long period}} of {{repression}} by the Dutch colonial government, ethnic Chinese in Batavia (modern day Jakarta) revolted on 7 October 1740, killing fifty Dutch troops in Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara) and Tanah Abang. This revolt was quashed by Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier, who sent 1,800 troops, together with schutterij (militia) and eleven battalions of conscripts, to the two areas; they imposed a curfew on all Chinese inside the city walls to prevent them from plotting against the Dutch. When a group of 10,000 ethnic Chinese from nearby Tangerang and Bekasi was stopped at the gates the following day, Valckenier called an emergency meeting of the council for 9 October. The day of the meeting, the Dutch and other ethnic groups in Batavia began to <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> ethnic Chinese in the city, resulting in an estimated 10,000 deaths over two weeks.|$|E

5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would {{have a negative impact on}} the economy and the food supply. The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established to make use of the Jews as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E
5|$|Brought by JC's {{agents to}} Liberty Island, Alex learns that the island holds an old {{part of the}} pre-Collapse {{worldwide}} communication network {{which can be used}} by each faction. No matter what choices Alex has made up to now, they can choose to side with any faction, or <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> the leaders on Liberty Island. If Alex follows JC's plan, the biomods are distributed worldwide, giving Helios the ability to access all human thought, allowing it to govern humanity. If Alex sides with the Illuminati, they use the network to help create a global surveillance state where communication and the economy are controlled. If Alex joins the Templars, they help unite humanity under a theocracy where biomod use and those considered impure are ruthlessly suppressed. Killing all other factions on Liberty Island leads to global chaos, turning Earth into a wasteland dominated by the Omar.|$|E
5|$|In Krishna charitas, Krishna is born to Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva of the Chandravanshi clan. Devaki's {{brother is}} a tyrant named Kamsa. At Devaki's wedding, {{according}} to Puranic legends, Kamsa is told by fortune tellers {{that a child}} of Devaki would kill him. Kamsa arranges to <b>kill</b> <b>all</b> of Devaki's children. When Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna and exchanges him. When Kamsa tries to kill the newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess Durga, warning him that his death has arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with Nanda and his wife Yasoda near modern-day Mathura. Two of Krishna's siblings also survive, namely Balarama and Subhadra, according to these legends. The day of birth of Krishna is celebrated as Krishna Janmashtami.|$|E
