25|$|Two years {{previous}} to {{the present}} day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price.

It was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star. In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, [...] "I honestly don't know.

500|$|Her thirteenth album, Reba, {{was issued}} in 1988 {{and was not}} well {{received}} by critics, who claimed she was moving farther away from her [...] "traditional country" [...] sound. Stereo Review disliked the album's contemporary style, stating, [...] "After years of insisting that she'd stick to hard-core country 'because I have tried the contemporary-type songs, and it's not Reba McEntire—it's just not honest,' McEntirehas gone whole-hog pop. The album peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart and remained there for six consecutive weeks. Okay, so maybe that's not so terrible." [...] Although it was reviewed poorly, the album itself was certified platinum in sales and produced two number-one singles: [...] "I <b>Know</b> <b>How</b> <b>He</b> Feels" [...] and [...] "New Fool at an Old Game". In addition, the release's cover version of Jo Stafford's [...] "A Sunday Kind of Love" [...] became a Top 5 hit on the Billboard country music chart. Also in 1988, McEntire founded Starstruck Entertainment, which controlled her management, booking, publishing, promotion, publicity, accounting, ticket sales, and fan club administration. The company would eventually expand into managing a horse farm, jet charter service, trucking, construction, and book publishing.|$|E

500|$|After a {{physical}} before the 1991–92 NBA season, Johnson {{discovered that he}} had tested positive for HIV. In a press conference held on November7, 1991, Johnson made a public announcement that he would retire immediately. He stated that his wife Cookie and their unborn child did not have HIV, {{and that he would}} dedicate his life to [...] "battle this deadly disease". Johnson initially said that he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> contracted the disease, but later acknowledged that it was through having multiple sexual partners during his playing career. At the time, {{only a small percentage of}} HIV-positive American men had contracted it from heterosexual sex, and it was initially rumored that Johnson was gay or bisexual, although he denied both. Johnson later accused Isiah Thomas of spreading the rumors, a claim Thomas denied. Johnson's HIV announcement became a major news story in the United States, and in 2004 was named as ESPN's seventh-most memorable moment of the past 25 years. Many articles praised Johnson as a hero, and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush said, [...] "For me, Magic is a hero, a hero for anyone who loves sports." ...|$|E
500|$|Cannon {{was traded}} to the Oakland Raiders before the 1964 season. Raiders head coach Al Davis liked Cannon's {{abilities}} but did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> wanted to use him. At first Davis moved Cannon to fullback, where he was an asset in catching passes, an attribute not all fullbacks then possessed. After a slow start, he finished the season with 37 receptions for 454 yards and eight touchdowns. He also rushed for three more touchdowns. Next season Davis moved him to tight end, to the chagrin of Cannon; he expected to be made into a wide receiver, but the Raiders had both Art Powell and rookie Fred Biletnikoff to cover that position. He eventually accepted his [...] new role and adapted quickly to it. However, the tight end was seldom used in the Raiders' offense. He caught only seven passes that season with no touchdowns. Before the 1966 season, John Rauch took over as head coach as Al Davis became AFL commissioner and the Raiders' general manager. Cannon established himself as a deep threat in Rauch's offense and caught fourteen passes for 436 yards—an average of 31.4 yards per reception.|$|E

500|$|Film writer Paul Simpson notes {{how closely}} Steiger {{prepared}} for his roles, {{and how he}} [...] "effortlessly" [...] recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a [...] "compelling take on an enigmatic figure". Judith Crist of New York Magazine, reviewing Duck, You Sucker!, commented that Steiger was [...] "totally without mannerisms, always with manner", and noted that his [...] "silences are stunningly effective". Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, [...] "When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> does it. It's {{almost as if he}} gets inside the skin of the guy he's playing and starts being that person for a while". Steiger said: [...] "I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I'd try to do it a little different." [...] His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including Robert De Niro, who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in The Untouchables (1987). Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger's [...] "powerful and wrenching performance" [...] in The Pawnbroker.|$|E
500|$|From the {{available}} fragments of music, both Virtanen and Andrew Mellor of Gramophone detect hints of Tapiola, {{particularly in the}} first of the three extracts. Kilpeläinen points to some of Sibelius's late minor works, in particular the [...] "Five Esquisses" [...] for piano Op. 114 (1929), as providing evidence that in his final compositional years Sibelius was [...] "progressing towards a more abstract idiom: clear, ethereal images little touched by the human passions". Further originality, Kilpeläinen says, is found in the [...] "Surusoitto" [...] music for organ, composed in 1931 for the funeral of Sibelius's friend Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a work that Aino Sibelius admitted might have been based on Eighth Symphony material: [...] "Did the new symphony", asks Kilpeläinen, [...] "thus also represent a modern sound unlike that of his previous style, with bleak, open tones and unresolved dissonances?" [...] After the recording of the fragments, Storgårds could recognise the composer's late style, adding that [...] "the harmonies are so wild and the music so exciting that I'd really love to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> went on with this." [...] Sibelius's only preserved comment on the music itself, as distinct from his occasional progress reports, is a remark to Schnéevoigt in December 1932: [...] "You have no idea how clever it is".|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Hammond Organ Company hired American {{musician}} and engineer Don Lewis {{to demonstrate its}} products, including an electronic organ with a built-in drum machine designed by the Japanese company Ace Tone. At the time, drum machines were most often used to accompany home organs; users could not program their own rhythms and had to use preset patterns such as bossa nova. Lewis was known for performances using electronic instruments he had modified himself, decades before the popularization of instrument [...] "hacking" [...] via circuit bending. He made extensive modifications to the Ace Tone drum machine, creating his own rhythms and wiring the device through his organ's expression pedal to accent the percussion.Lewis was approached by Ace Tone president and founder Ikutaro Kakehashi, who wanted to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had achieved the sounds from the machine Kakehashi had designed. In 1972, Kakehashi formed the Roland Corporation, and hired Lewis to help design drum machines. By the late 1970s, microprocessors were appearing in instruments such as the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer sequencer, and Kakehashi realized they {{could be used to}} program drum machine rhythms. In 1978, Roland released the CompuRhythm CR-78, the first drum machine with which users could write, save, and replay their own patterns.|$|E
500|$|The 1950 playoffs were {{overshadowed by}} an on-ice mishap {{in the opening}} game between Toronto and Detroit, in which the Red Wings' young star player, Gordie Howe, was seriously injured. Late in the game with Toronto leading 4–0, Kennedy stole the puck from Detroit defenseman Jack Stewart and was {{carrying}} it down the left wing about six feet from the boards into the Detroit end of the rink. Stewart was pursuing him from behind and Howe was coming in fast from the side to try to cut him off. Kennedy saw Howe coming at the last moment, {{and was able to}} dodge Howe's check while passing the puck to Sid Smith, but Howe could not stop and crashed head-first into the boards, with Stewart falling on top of him. Howe sustained a concussion, facial fractures, and a lacerated right eyeball, and doctors had to perform emergency procedures on him at the hospital to save his life. Detroit coach Tommy Ivan and general manager Jack Adams accused Kennedy of deliberately butt-ending Howe. Kennedy had not been assessed a penalty on the play. After the game Kennedy said, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> got it. I avoided his check along the boards and didn't feel anything hit me, although he may have struck my stick." ...|$|E
