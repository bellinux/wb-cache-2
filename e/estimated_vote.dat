25|$|The serious {{divisions}} between {{the western and}} eastern sections of Virginia had been simmering for decades, related to class and social differences. The western areas were growing and were based on subsistence farms by yeomen; its residents held few slaves. The planters of the eastern section were wealthy slaveholders who dominated state government. By December 1860 secession was being publicly debated throughout Virginia. Leading eastern spokesmen called for secession, while westerners warned {{they would not be}} legislated into treason. A statewide convention first met on February 13; after the attack on Fort Sumter and Lincoln's call to arms, it voted for secession on April 17, 1861. The decision was dependent on ratification by a statewide referendum. Western leaders held mass rallies and prepared to separate, so that this area could remain in the Union. Unionists met at the Wheeling Convention with four hundred delegates from twenty-seven counties. The statewide vote in favor of secession was 132,201 to 37,451. An <b>estimated</b> <b>vote</b> on Virginia's ordinance of secession for the 50 counties that became West Virginia is 34,677 to 19,121 against secession, with 24 of the 50 counties favoring secession and 26 favoring the Union.|$|E

We also make estimates for the second-round vote of French presidential elections (without the 2002 French presidential election or with an <b>estimated</b> <b>vote</b> for this election).

5000|$|Ecological {{regression}} is {{a statistical}} technique used especially {{in political science}} and history to <b>estimate</b> group <b>voting</b> behavior from aggregate data. For example, if counties have a known Democratic vote (in percentage) D, and a known percentage of Catholics, C, then run the linear regression of dependent variable D against independent variable C. This gives D = a + bC. When C = 1 (100% Catholic) this gives the <b>estimated</b> Democratic <b>vote</b> as a+b. When C = 0 (0% Catholic), this gives the <b>estimated</b> non-Catholic <b>vote</b> as a. For example, if the regression gives D = [...]22 + [...]45C, then the <b>estimated</b> Catholic <b>vote</b> is 67% Democratic and the non-Catholic vote is 22% Democratic. The technique has been often used in litigation brought under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to see how blacks and whites voted.|$|R

Using a dataset of <b>estimated</b> <b>vote</b> percentages for each party over fifteen elections for a constant set of 641 ‘pseudo-constituencies’ (based on those used for the 1997 and 2001 general elections) this paper uses a recently developed inductive procedure for identifying spatially varying temporal trends to identify variations in party support since 1950, enabling hypotheses regarding their nature to be formally tested. Whereas varying trends in Conservative support were predominantly regional—supporting the concept of a north – south divide—there was greater variation by functional type than geographical region in the patterning of support trends for the other two parties. ...|$|E
40|$|When in {{geography}} one reconstructs individual behavior starting from aggregated data through ecological inference, a crucial aspect is the spatial variation of individual behavior. Basic ecological inference methods treat areas {{as if they}} were all exchangeable, which in geographical applications is questionable due to the existence of contextual effects that relate to area location and induce spatial dependence. Here that assumption is avoided by basing ecological inference on a model that simultaneously does a cluster analysis, grouping together areas with similar individual behavior, and an ecological inference analysis in each cluster, estimating the individual behavior in the areas of each group. That allows one to capture most of the spatial dependence and summarize the individual behavior at a local level through the behavior estimated for each cluster. This approach is used to investigate vote switching in Catalonia, where voters split across a national allegiance divide on top of the ideological divide. That leads to Catalans having a lot of options to choose from, and to them voting differently depending on whether the election is for the Catalan parliament or for the Spanish parliament. To investigate that, the results in the two most recent pairs of such elections are analyzed by simultaneously clustering areas based on the similarity of their vote and vote switch patterns, and estimating one vote switch pattern for each cluster. As a result, Catalonia is partitioned into four clusters that have a strong spatial structure, with all the areas in the same cluster having similar demographic composition. The <b>estimated</b> <b>vote</b> switch patterns are quite different across clusters but very similar across pairs of elections, and they help assess how the differential voter turnout and the strategic dual vote effects vary in spacePeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} known that pre-electoral polls often suffer from non-sampling errors, mainly due to {{imperfect}} frames, non-responses, {{other forms of}} selection bias. These non-sampling errors might also be more relevant than sampling errors. In order to correct for biases due to non-sampling errors, the pollsters implement diverse ad hoc adjustments, including expert opinions in final estimates, thus leading to the well-known house effects. We consider data on pre-election polls for Italian political elections in 2006, 2008 and 2013 carried out by various pollsters and made available on a free-access governmental website. The response variables are the <b>estimated</b> <b>vote</b> shares of the principal Italian parties (those which are included in all available polls). Since various pollsters carry {{out a number of}} pre-electoral polls in the observed time frame, the data have a hierarchical structure in which groups are defined to be the pollsters. We propose a model to assess the relevance of the variability induced by the house effects with respect to the total variability. In particular we consider a hierarchical Bayesian model in which each party share of votes is separately analyzed. The model involves two-stages, in which the first stage allows for the within-pollster variability and also includes a non linear time trend, whereas the second stage describes the between-pollsters variability, by means of a random effect vector. A Gaussian distribution is employed both for observations and for random effects. Such Gaussian distributions are parametrized so to allow for the different variability due to the various sample sizes and underlying probability. In general, results confirm a large house effect in Italian pre-election polls. The effect is quite heterogeneous between parties and between pollsters. Such conclusion appear to be quite stable across the considered years...|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of vote splitting in mixed-member electoral systems {{is a common}} problem in electoral studies, where the goal of researchers is to estimate individual voter transitions between parties on two different ballots cast simultaneously. Because the ballots are cast separately and secretly, however, voter choice on the two ballots must be recreated from separately tabulated aggregate data. The problem is therefore of one of making ecological inferences. Because of the multiparty contexts normally found where mixed-member electoral rules are used, furthermore, the problem involves large-table (R × C) ecological inference. In this chapter we show how vote-splitting problems in multiparty systems can be formulated as ecological inference problems and adapted for use with King’s (1997) ecological inference procedure. We demonstrate this process by <b>estimating</b> <b>vote</b> splitting in the 1996 Italian legislative elections between voters casting party-based list ballots in proportional representation districts and candidate-based plurality ballots in single-member districts. Our example illustrates the pitfalls and payoffs of <b>estimating</b> <b>vote</b> splitting in multiparty contexts, and points to {{directions for future research}} in multiparty voting contexts using R × C ecological inference...|$|R
