30|$|The {{digestate}} (2450  mL) and {{the mixed}} substrate (50  mL) are introduced into an Erlenmeyer flask of 3 L (1). The digestate is thus either untreated digestate (no ammonium removal) or treated digestate (ammonium removal from supernatant[*]+[*]recombination with freshly obtained thick fraction after centrifugation). This flask {{is placed in}} an incubator (Memmert, Germany) with an operating temperature of 323.15  K or 50  °C (digestate was taken from a thermophilic digestion with the same operating temperature). The flask is connected with a recipient filled with 0.01  M H 2 SO 4 (2) {{by means of a}} gas-tight tubing. A sulphuric acid solution is used to prevent the growth of algae. The volume of biogas formed is measured by the pressure-driven displacement of the sulphuric acid solution from recipient 2 to the <b>graduated</b> <b>recipient</b> 3. In this way, the biogas production can be accurately monitored to investigate the possible inhibitory effect of ammonium. The experiments are stopped when the pressure-driven displacement of sulphuric acid solution towards the <b>graduated</b> <b>recipient</b> more or less stagnated and the process thus is completed.|$|E
