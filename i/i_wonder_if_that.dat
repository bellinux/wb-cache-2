6000|$|... "Uh--Will, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> {{young man}} in the white flannel trousers, at church this morning, was this Valborg person that they're all talking about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is {{thinking}} of that husband of hers," [...] he said to himself. [...] "Ah, the silly goose! she had no business to marry him. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> letter is really his?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are half}} a dozen tents and a board cabin!" [...] added Earl, {{pointing}} still further on. [...] "I guess you're right, Randy. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> is the Klondike River over yonder. It looks mighty small." ...|$|E
5000|$|On The Wonder Years track [...] "Solo & Chewy: Holdin' It Down" [...] off {{of their}} 2008 EP titled Won't Be Pathetic Forever, they make {{reference}} to both the album Clarity and specifically the song [...] "Goodbye Sky Harbor" [...] with the line [...] "Arizona's airport is called Sky Harbor. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that's</b> what the last song on Clarity's about".|$|R
60|$|Every now {{and then}} we would pass a very big house, which looked as if it was empty, but I knew that there was a {{caretaker}} inside, because of Fred's father. These big houses belong to very rich people, but they don't want to live in them till the summer, so they put in caretakers, and the caretakers have a dog to keep off burglars. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> was what <b>I</b> had been brought here for.|$|R
60|$|He {{was pretty}} mad, and <b>I</b> don't <b>wonder,</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> {{was the way}} he {{understood}} Rectus, for he was just as much a white man as either of us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} lonely!" [...] exclaimed Whitefoot. [...] "That {{is all that}} has been the trouble with me. I have been lonely and didn't know it. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> other Wood Mouse has felt the same way." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carroll had not {{intended}} to spare her, but now he felt almost compassionate, and he had one grain of comfort to offer. [...] "I must tell him that his shares in the Clermont have been sacrificed. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> is all you meant?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> {{man was a}} scoundrel. He {{has gone}} wrong on earth, no doubt, has failed and degenerated, but what was it sent him wrong? Was his failure inherent, or did some net of cross {{purposes}} tangle about his feet? Suppose {{he is not a}} failure in Utopia!...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{just like}} a burnt-down bone-boiling factory," [...] said Miss Elsie critically; [...] "and <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> really was old McHulish's business. They couldn't have it on the {{mainland}} for its being a nuisance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Grant {{you that}} it is rather absurd to go hunting a lynx. And what big paws it has--disproportionately big! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that's</b> an {{adaptation}} to snow. Tremendous paws they are.... But the real thing, I was saying, the real thing is to get knowledge, and express it. All things lead up to that. Civilization, social order, just for that. Except for that, all the life of man, all his affairs, his laws and police, his morals and manners--nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Lynx hunts! Just ways of getting themselves mauled and clawed perhaps--into a state of understanding. Who knows?..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Mr. Sewell, as you {{are quite}} aware, plays it {{exceptionally}} well. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> he realizes <b>that</b> the major is not fond of losing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take him {{something}} to eat," [...] Miss Schuyler said impatiently. [...] "Any way, {{it should not}} be hard to fool him--I have seen him looking at you. Now, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> grey dress of mine would fit you--I have scarcely had it on, but it's a little too tight for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes,' said Anita; 'but I think I shall {{do better}} after I {{have had more}} practice. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> man really can wash dishes.' On being questioned, Isaac {{declared}} that in the humble cot {{in which he was}} born he had been obliged to wash dishes; there were no daughters, and his mother was infirm.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is his purity I want. My {{own mind}} is hereditarily lawless. I want {{something}} not immoral, yet efficacious. There was that parson, whom {{you say the}} woman's cat nearly devoured. Like Paul with beasts he fought the cat. Now, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> injured man is not meditating some priestly revenge that would do our turn {{and get rid of}} Miss Blowser?' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{raised an}} eyebrow. [...] "Are you sure? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> it isn't <b>that</b> you don't {{want him to}} come out while you're {{standing}} so close." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I say, Townshend,' said one, 'there's Grobbleton; {{he was a}} bully. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that's</b> his wife? Who's this? The Duke of Agincourt. He wasn't an Eton fellow? Yes, he was. He {{was called}} Poictiers then. Oh! ah! his name is in the upper school, very large, under Charles Fox. I say, Townshend, did you see Saville's turban? What was it made of? He says his mother brought it from Grand Cairo. Didn't he just look like the Saracen's Head? Here are some Dons. That's Hallam! We'll give him a cheer. I say, Townshend, look at this fellow. He doesn't think small beer of himself. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> who he is? The Duke of Wellington's valet come to say his master is engaged. Oh! by Jove, he heard you! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the Duke will come? Won't we give him a cheer!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Ian didn't {{really want}} to play guitar, {{but for some reason}} we wanted him to play it. I can't {{remember}} the reason now ... I think Ian used to play only on [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart" ... no I'm wrong, there was another track too. Maybe [...] "Heart and Soul"? I do remember Ian used to play just one chord, which was D. We showed him how to play D and we wrote a song. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that's</b> why we wrote [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", you could drone a D through it. I think he played it live because I was playing keyboards. On the record I played guitar, a twelve string Eko guitar, an Italian guitar that actually sounded pretty good.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] she said, [...] "you {{seem to me}} entirely vapid and brainless; {{at other}} times you say or do things which {{suggest that there are}} {{possibilities}} in you; that, properly stimulated and encouraged, you might overcome the handicap of large private means and do something worthwhile. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> is simply my imagination?" [...] She watched me very closely as she spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where in thunder is she?" [...] growled Tom, {{walking off}} in high dudgeon. The quick tap of feet behind him made him turn {{in time to}} see a fresh-faced little girl running down the long station, and looking as if she rather liked it. As she smiled, and waved her bag at him, he stopped and waited for her, saying to himself, [...] "Hullo! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> 's Polly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{beautiful}} place!" [...] he reflected to himself with enthusiasm, [...] "and how grandly those old towers stand {{out against the}} sky. The Squire has restored them very well, too, {{there is no doubt}} about it; I could not have done it better myself. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> place will ever be mine. Things look black now, but they may come round, and I think I am beginning to see my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|March did not answer. [...] "What a noble thing life is, anyway! Here I am, {{well on the}} way to fifty, after {{twenty-five years}} of hard work, looking forward to the {{potential}} poor-house as confidently as I did in youth. We might have saved a little more than we have saved; but the little more wouldn't avail if I were turned out of my place now; and we should have lived sordidly to no purpose. Some one always has you by the throat, unless you have some one else in your grip. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that's</b> the attitude the Almighty intended His respectable creatures to take toward one another! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> He meant our civilization, the battle we fight in, the game we trick in! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> He considers it final, and if the kingdom of heaven on earth, which we pray for--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not yet," [...] {{answered}} Twitter; [...] "we cannot bear {{to publish}} it. But {{we have set}} several detectives on his track. In fact we expect one of them this very evening; and <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> was him," [...] he added, as a loud knock was heard at the door.|$|R
6000|$|Hanscom's {{tone was}} still defiant as he replied: [...] "It is, but <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you know <b>that</b> {{they were being}} chased {{out of the country}} at the time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Folks {{that live}} like this must be mighty rich," [...] Seth thought, as he plunged his face into a basin of clear water. [...] "It ain't likely Snip an' me will strike it so soft again, an' I expect he'll be terrible sorry to leave. I reckon it'll be all right to hang 'round an hour or so, an' then we must get out lively. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> {{little bit of a}} woman expects I'll pay for breakfast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This won't do at all," [...] Joe said. [...] "It ain't {{right for}} you to stay out in the night, and I don't know what's to be done, unless you could stand it for a spell in Plums's shanty. Say, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> wouldn't go down? Will you be willin' to hang 'round with us till mornin', if I buy a slat of good things? When it comes {{daylight}} I can find your folks without much trouble, 'cause of course they'll be right here huntin', don't you see? Is it a go?" ...|$|E
60|$|Harry (Alone; {{picks up}} shawl absently, and, {{looking at it}} spread out in his hands, pronounces slowly). A--dam'--silly--scrape. (Pause. Throws shawl on arm. Strolls up and down. Mutters.) No money to get back. (Louder.) Silly little Ginger'll think I've got hold of the pieces and given an old shipmate the go by. One good shove--(Makes motion of {{bursting}} in door with his shoulders)--would burst that door in--I bet. (Looks about.) I wonder where the nearest bobby is! No. They would want to bundle me neck and crop into chokey. (Shudders.) Perhaps. It makes me dog sick to think of being locked up. Haven't got the nerve. Not for prison. (Leans against lamp-post.) And not a cent for my fare. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> girl now...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jacinta, [...] "we {{will talk}} of {{somebody}} else. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you know <b>that</b> Jefferson {{has been left}} a fortune, or, at least, part of one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The cañon!" [...] {{repeated}} Violet reproachfully. [...] "It {{is always}} the cañon. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you remember <b>that</b> {{it is at least}} a month since you have written a line to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. H. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{you mean}} <b>that!</b> Oh, {{what is the}} good of squabbling and pretending to {{misunderstand}} when you are only up for so short a time? Pip, don't be a stupid! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hoot, man! {{never mind}} the putch, Tonal'. What there iss will do fery well, an' the boat that comes with {{supplies}} for the new post will be sure to hev plenty. By the way, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> fine man Nazinred will hev come back {{when we get to}} the Ukon River. It wass a strange notion of his the last comers told us about, to go off to seek his daughter all by himself. I hev my doubts if he'll ever come back. Poor man! it wass naitural too that he should make a desperate attempt to get back his only bairn, but it wass not naitural that a wise man like him should go off all his lone. I'm afraid he wass a little off his head. Did they tell you what supplies he wass supposed to have taken?" ...|$|E
60|$|It has low tastes, {{and is not}} kind. When I {{went there}} {{yesterday}} evening in the gloaming it had crept down {{and was trying to}} catch the little speckled fishes that play in the pool, and I had to clod it to make it go up the tree again and let them alone. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>THAT</b> is what it is for? Hasn't it any heart? Hasn't it any compassion for those little creature? Can it be that it was designed and manufactured for such ungentle work? It has the look of it. One of the clods took it back of the ear, and it used language. It gave me a thrill, for {{it was the first time}} I had ever heard speech, except my own. I did not understand the words, but they seemed expressive.|$|E
6000|$|That sojourn of Mark and {{his wife}} at Springfield House was a bright spot in that summer. If it had been only that Annaple's {{presence}} gave the free entree to such an island of old Micklethwayte, {{it would have been}} a great pleasure to her; but there was besides the happiness of confidence and unrestraint in their society, a restful enjoyment only to be appreciated by living the guarded life of constraint that was hers. She was so seldom thrown among people whom she could admire and look up to. Annaple told her husband of Nuttie's vehement repudiation of any intention of marriage. 'I am sure she meant it,' she observed, 'it was only a little too strong. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> poor youth who came to her first ball, and helped to pick us out of the hole in Bluepost Bridge, had anything to do with it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. COADE (with melancholy perspicacity). <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> what {{it means}} is that you don't {{especially}} need even me. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> it means <b>that</b> you are just the sort of amiable creature that would be happy anywhere, and anyhow? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's summat up more nor usual {{between her}} an' the master, {{that you may}} depend on,' said Kitty. 'I know those clothes as was lying i' the drawing-room yesterday, when the company was come, meant summat. <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>that</b> was what they've had a fresh row about. She's p'raps gone away, an's {{made up her mind}} not to come back again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the thing}} may happen, but that hardly {{concerns}} {{us in the}} meanwhile, and our work here is done. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you remember <b>that</b> you haven't read the letters Father Tiebout brought up, Ormsgill?" ...|$|R
