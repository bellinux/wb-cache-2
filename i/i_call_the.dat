Lucy Cobb recognized that many of its alumnae would seek employment, and by teaching students marketable, and at the same time, respectable, skills, as well as genteel decorum and dress, Lucy Cobb created a new image of elite white single womanhood that combined aspects of the new woman and the southern belle, what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> [...] "new belle."

500|$|After the Magical Mystery Tour recordings, Evans flew to Nice with McCartney {{to shoot}} [...] "The Fool on the Hill" [...] promotional film, {{although}} McCartney set off without luggage or a passport. McCartney got past customs by saying [...] "You know who I am", {{but he and}} Evans were not allowed into a hotel restaurant in Nice because they [...] "didn't look the part", and had to eat dinner in Evans' room. Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built up quite a bar bill, when {{the manager of the}} club arrived demanding that we pay immediately.

500|$|The Smashing Pumpkins {{have been}} praised as [...] "responsible {{for some of}} the most {{striking}} and memorable video clips" [...] and for having [...] "approached videos from a completely artistic standpoint rather than mere commercials to sell albums". |author=Greg Prato |work=Allmusic |accessdate=March 4, 2012}} MTV's 2001 anniversary special Testimony: 20Years of Rock on MTV credited the Pumpkins, along with Nine Inch Nails, with treating music videos as an art form during the 1990s. Corgan has said, [...] "We generally resisted the idea of what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> classic MTV rock video, which is like lots of people jumping around and stuff." [...] The band worked with video directors including Kevin Kerslake ("Cherub Rock"), Samuel Bayer ("Bullet with Butterfly Wings"), and, most frequently, the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris ("Rocket", [...] "1979", [...] "Tonight, Tonight", [...] "The End Is the Beginning Is the End", and [...] "Perfect"). Corgan, who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos, said of Dayton and Faris, [...] "I know my [...] versions are always darker, and they're always talking me into something a little kinder and gentler." [...] Videos like [...] "Today", [...] "Rocket", and [...] "1979" [...] dealt with images taken from middle American culture, albeit exaggerated. The group's videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for [...] "Thirty-Three", with images closely related to the words of the song, was created as an intentional stylistic departure.|$|E

500|$|His {{early years}} in Philadelphia though were {{dominated}} by writing. Initially Evans intended to write a pamphlet to assist millers {{in the construction of}} milling machinery, as well as promoting his own automated designs. However, Evans became so engrossed in the project that he ultimately devoted several years to writing a comprehensive book on milling technology that included long chapters on the basic principles of physics, hydraulics and mechanics; at times neglecting his family's financial security in order to complete it. The Young Mill-wright and Miller's Guide when it appeared consisted of five parts: 'Principles of Mechanics and Hydraulics', 'Of the different Kinds of Mills', 'Description of the Author's Improvements', 'On the Manufacturing of Grain into Flour', 'Ellicott's Plans for Building Mills', and a lengthy appendix in which Evans detailed various ideas for other inventions, such as a hot-air system of central heating. Thomas Ellicott, whose family were early adopters of Evans's designs in Baltimore, contributed a section on mill construction. Much of the theoretical work of the book was based on earlier scientific work on mechanical principles, yet Evans insisted that theoretical sections align with observations in the practical sections, and hence often revised standing theories to comport with experiments he conducted and observations he made. For example, he found what was written on the theoretical mechanical principles of waterwheels did not match what he could replicate in practice, so he revised them based on observation to form a [...] "true theory" [...] and concluded that [...] "neither the old or new theories agree with practice, therefore we must suspect that they are founded on error. But if, what <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> true theory, should continue to agree with practice, the practitioner need not care on what it is founded." ...|$|E
