5|$|Albatrosses {{are popular}} birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular {{destinations}} for ecotourists. Regular birdwatching trips are {{taken out of}} many coastal towns and cities, like Monterey, Dunedin, Kaikoura, Wollongong, Sydney, Port Fairy, Hobart and Cape Town, to see pelagic seabirds. Albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies can be very popular: the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 visitors a year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>oils</b> are {{becoming}} important {{due to their}} nutritional implementations. Development of rancidity in <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> is very fast and leads to reduction of the qualities of <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> as well as fish. Prevention of development of rancidity in <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> by the fruit of Indian Gooseberry (Phynanthus emblica) extracts was studied in detail. The ethanolic, methanolic and water extracts of Indian gooseberry were applied to <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> and {{the activity of the}} different extracts was determined by measuring peroxide value (PV), free fatty acid value (FFA) and fatty acid composition (FAC) on eight occasions over forty four days of storage at room temperature (30 °C). In the second experiment, active components of the ethanol extract were separated by hexane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water, and the activity of these fractions were also measured by applying to <b>fish</b> <b>oils.</b> In the first experiment, the ethanolic extract treatment recorded the highest activity in prevention of formation of peroxides, free fatty acids, and the conversion of fatty acids than the methanolic and water extracts. The amount of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids increased whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased during the storage. The water extract treatment showed the lowest while the methanolic extract was intermediate. Results from the second experiment showed that the antioxidant activity of ethyl acetate fraction was higher than the other solvent fractions used in the study and this indicated that the active compounds might have a medium polarity. The study suggests the possibility of using Indian gooseberry to prevent rancidity of <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> in industrial uses...|$|R

5|$|Currently the harbour {{is being}} {{enlarged}} {{in order to}} accommodate larger vessels, especially cruise ships. From 2015 the enlarged harbour is expected to attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to about a dozen smaller ships at present. The new harbour should provide new jobs increasing the workforce in the harbour from 2,000 today to some 2,600 on completion. Karstens Skibsværft, Danish Yacht, and the herring processing firm, Skagerrak Pelgic, are reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town is also home to FF Skagen, the world's top producer of fish meal and <b>fish</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
5|$|For generations, Skagen's {{economy has}} been based on its fishing {{industry}} which continues to prosper today, facilitated by its fishing harbour, the largest in Denmark. Skagen also has the country's main herring processing facility and the world's largest <b>fish</b> <b>oil</b> factory. The town's evolving fishing industry led to considerable growth in the local population which reached some 11,500 in the 1960s. A fish auction is held at dawn in the harbour, and between May and October the harbour also attracts yachting enthusiasts.|$|E
40|$|Each {{year more}} than 80 {{millions}} of tons of fish are caught in seas and oceans all over the world. 1 / 3 of the fish are used for the manufacturing of <b>fish</b> <b>oils.</b> Omega- 3 from marine sources knows a great success on different markets (food, cosmetics, OTC…) but the natural resources of fish are going to decrease: that would restrict the supplying sources in the future. We need to find other sources: research has been intensified these last years to evaluate consequences of the partial or total replacement of <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> by vegetable oils. But the problem is the fatty acids content which is not the same. The replacement of <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> by vegetable oils induces a diminution of omega- 3 fatty acids content, which is the characteristic of <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> (EPA & DHA).

40|$|Cancer {{represents}} the largest cause of mortality {{in the world}} as the millions of humans and animals die every year. Chemotherapy being a major treatment modality used for the control of advanced stages of malignancies and as a prophylactic against possible metastasis, exhibits severe toxicity on normal tissues. Medicinal plants, including vegetables are known to have good immunomodulatory antioxidant activities, leading to anticancer effect. They act by stimulating both non-specific and specific immunity, and may promote the host resistance against infection by re-stabilizing body equilibrium and conditioning the body tissues. However, the interest in the potential benefits of the <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> has been greatly emerged. The cardiovascular diseases and cancer incidence rates have been found low due to the <b>fish</b> <b>oils.</b> Who eat a diet high in fish fat and low in carbohydrates (instead of the consumption of a high fat diet from animal and vegetable oils) have low incidence of cancer. The animal fats contain saturated fatty acids, and vegetable oils (e. g., corn oil and safflower oil) contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of omega- 6 type. Beneficial effects of the <b>fish</b> <b>oils</b> come from their unique composition of high levels of the omega- 3 PUFAs, viz., eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In addition, these omega- 3 PUFAs can increase the HDL (so-called good cholesterol) levels. <b>Fish</b> <b>oils</b> also provide antiinflammatory and antiaggregatory effects...|$|R
