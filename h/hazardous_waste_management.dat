40|$|With the Basel ban, {{imposing}} {{restrictions on}} Trans-boundary movement of <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes,</b> {{coming into force}} with effect from 1. 1. 1998, the concept of treatment and safe disposal of <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> (HWs) assumes paramount significance. The annual HW generation in India is estimated at 0. 3 - 0. 5 million tonnes. As per the ideal industrial siting criteria in India, the industry should have enough land available within its premises for the treatment and disposal and or reuse/recycling of the wastes generated from it. However, very few industries in India, mostly in large scale and very few in medium scale, own proper treatment and disposal facilities. A common waste treatment and disposal facility such as treatment, storage and disposal facility (TSDF) for <b>management</b> of <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> generated from industries, {{is one of the}} useful options under such conditions. Few Guidelines issued by Ministry of Environment and Forests under <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Wastes</b> (<b>Management</b> & Handling) Rules, 1989 promulgated under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 are available in India for selection of best site for TSDF.

However, Generation of recyclable HW {{is the highest}} in the country. Recyclable waste attributes to the dominant HW treatment option 49. 55 % followed by land disposable (43. 78 %) and incineration (6. 67 %) respectively. Under the <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Wastes</b> (<b>Management,</b> Handling & Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008 the processes generating HW were finalized, yet the differentiation of quantum of HW generation based on types of HW i. e used/waste oil, lead waste, zinc waste etc. has been highlighted first of its kind as an inventory in the present study. There are about 257 Spent oil (Used/Waste Oil) registered recycling facilities distributed across 124 districts spread over 19 states in India with the total spent oil recycling capacity as 1. 39 MMT. Thus India has a huge recycling potential with a greater yield while considering the generation of used oil and waste oil from automotive sector and manufacturing industries.
