40|$|Background: Health {{inequity}} is {{an important}} issue all around the world. The Chinese basic medical security system comprises three major <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes,</b> namely the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI), and the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS). Little research has been conducted to look into the disparity in payments among the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in China. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the disparity in reimbursements for tuberculosis (TB) care among the abovementioned <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> Methods: This study uses a World Health Organization (WHO) framework to analyze the disparities and equity relating to the three dimensions of health insurance: population coverage, the range of services covered, {{and the extent to which}} costs are covered. Each of the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme’s</b> policies were categorized and analyzed. An analysis of the claims database of all hospitalizations reimbursed from 2010 to 2012 in three counties of Yichang city (YC), which included 1506 discharges, was conducted to identify the differences in reimbursement rates and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses among the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> Results: Tuberculosis patients had various inpatient expenses depending on which scheme they were covered by (TB patients covered by the NCMS have less inpatient expenses than those who were covered by the URBMI, who have less inpatient expenses than those covered by the UEBMI). We found a significant horizontal inequity of healthcare utilization among the lower socioeconomic groups. In terms of financial inequity, TB patients who earned less paid more. The NCMS provides modest financial protection, based on income. Overall, TB patients from lower socioeconomic groups were the most vulnerable. Conclusion: There are large disparities in reimbursement for TB care among the three <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> and this, in turn, hampers TB control. Reducing the gap in health outcomes between the three <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in China should be a focus of TB care and control.

Upon becoming president, former president Kufuor pushed through his idea of getting rid of “cash and carry” and replacing it with an equitable insurance scheme that ensured that treatment was provided first before payment. In 2003, the scheme was passed into law. Under the law, there was the establishment of National Health Insurance Authority which licenses, monitors and regulates the operation of health insurance schemes in Ghana. Like many countries in the world, Ghana's health insurance was fashioned out to meet specific needs of its citizens. Since its inception, the country's health facilities have seen constant rise in patient numbers and a considerable reduction in deaths.|$|E
25|$|While the Liberal {{reforms were}} one of Britain's most ambitious welfare reform programmes, there were several {{limitations}} to the reforms they passed. Free school meals were not compulsory. Pensions were refused {{to those who had}} not been in work most of their life and life expectancy at birth at this time was only 55 so relatively few people lived long enough to receive a pension. The labour exchange programme often managed to find people only part-time casual work. The poor had to pay National Insurance Contributions out of their wages and the 7s 6d was not enough to live on. Unemployment and sickness pay also only lasted for a limited time. Free medical care was available to only a wage-earner, not the wife or children or grandparents and other relatives. The new National <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> also did not provide coverage for all forms of medical care. It did not provide cover for special advice while many people could not get acquire dental, ophthalmic or other treatment through NHI. Also, other people were not covered for convalescent homes, while the only specialist services for those in NHI were for TB and VD. The welfare measures introduced by the Liberal government concerning the sick, the elderly, and the children did, however, lead to a reduction in poverty, with the total number of paupers falling from 916,377 in 1910 to 748,019 by 1914.|$|E

In this paper, we report the impact of publicly financed <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> on <b>health</b> service utilization, out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure, financial risk protection and health status. Empirical research studies focussing on the impact or evaluation of publicly financed <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in India were searched on PubMed, Google scholar, Ovid, Scopus, Embase and relevant websites. The studies were selected based on two stage screening PRISMA guidelines in which two researchers independently assessed the suitability and quality of the studies. The studies included in the review were divided into two groups i. e., with and without a comparison group. To assess the impact on utilization, OOP expenditure and health indicators, only the studies with a comparison group were reviewed. Out of 1265 articles screened after initial search, 43 studies were found eligible and reviewed in full text, finally yielding 14 studies which had a comparator group in their evaluation design. All the studies (n- 7) focussing on utilization showed a positive effect in terms of increase in the consumption of health services with introduction of <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> About 70 % studies (n- 5) studies with a strong design and assessing financial risk protection showed no impact in reduction of OOP expenditures, while remaining 30 % of evaluations (n- 2), which particularly evaluated state sponsored <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes,</b> reported a decline in OOP expenditure among the enrolled households. One study which evaluated impact on health outcome showed reduction in mortality among enrolled as compared to non-enrolled households, from conditions covered by the <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme.</b> While utilization of healthcare did improve among those enrolled in the scheme, there is no clear evidence yet to suggest that these have resulted in reduced OOP expenditures or higher financial risk protection...|$|R

40|$|A {{question}} {{of great interest}} to China watchers is whether or not central mandates are successfully implemented, and how. The issues surrounding this question {{are at the heart of}} the analysis in this thesis about China's attempts to institute social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in rural areas from 1949 to 2007. The thesis looks at central government attempts to institute social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> between 1949 and 2007 and tries to explain the significant variation in enrolment in social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> across this experience. The study shows that implementation of social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in rural China, measured in terms of their widespread uptake, succeeded on two occasions. There also have been a number of failures and collapses of social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes</b> in rural China. To explain the variation, the thesis first constructs a framework of how rank and authority of decrees work in the Chinese Communist Party. This framework allows an evaluation of how implementation decrees are transmitted down from the centre to local areas (who implement policy). The thesis argues that the issuing of a central decree holding the local Party secretary to account for high enrolment is the necessary and sufficient condition for the central government to ensure high enrolment in social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes.</b> The issuing of a central decree is shown only to be a necessary condition, but not a sufficient condition. And the holding of the local Party secretary to account must occur through the Party governance system rather than through the health governance system. The thesis shows that the rise, fall, failure to rise, and then unexpected rise of social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> can be explained by the systems of coordination and control used to hold the local Party secretary responsible for ensuring high levels of enrolment in <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> It shows that only the local Party secretary can mobilise the local state sufficiently to meet central decree. And only certain central decrees can motivate the local Party secretary sufficiently to mobilise the local state. The thesis concludes by applying this framework to broader questions of health system reform in modern-day China. It draws tentative conclusions as to how wider health system reform can be understood through the thesis' analytical framework and suggests testing this framework in other policy contexts. </p...|$|R

2500|$|EMS {{services}} in Canada are generally funded, {{at least in}} part, and to varying degrees, by the Ministry of Health or Health Department of the province or territory in which they operate. Paramedics and ambulance services are {{not mentioned in the}} Canada Health Act, and are therefore not an insured service. [...] Provinces may choose to subsidize some of the cost, usually just for patients with valid provincial health cards. Health insurance in Canada is universal and publicly funded, so the cost of emergency ambulance services is covered to some degree. The degree to which individual use of EMS is subsidized by provincial health insurance varies by province, and may be supplemented either by partial fees for service, or by the property tax revenues of municipalities operating such services. In some jurisdictions, funding is at 100 per cent, and occurs without the patient being aware of its existence. Other jurisdictions fund at varying levels, but may require payment up front. In most cases this is later reimbursed. [...] This may be particularly true of out of jurisdiction services, with an individual from one province who requires EMS service in another province being required to pay for that service and then submit the receipt to their own provincial <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> for reimbursement. In some jurisdictions, such as Ontario, a deterrent fee scheme is used to discourage the medically unnecessary use of EMS by the public. In such cases, the provincial <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> pays the majority of the cost of EMS service (around 80 per cent) for medically necessary EMS service, but when a physician decides that the service was not medically necessary, they can cause the patient to pay the full, uninsured amount of the charge, with the patient receiving a bill for the additional deterrent fee at some point after the emergency is over. [...] Within Ontario, for example, such deterrent billing occurs through the receiving hospital, {{despite the fact that the}} hospital neither provides nor oversees EMS in most cases.|$|E
