30|$|Because of the {{influence}} of comprehensive hub construction on network flow, this paper adopts the bi-level programming model (BPM) to solve the problem about the integrated optimization of multi-hub location and network layout. The upper level model is designed to minimize the network operating cost, network transformation cost, and hub construction cost; the lower level is the user equilibrium distribution model at fixed demands. Besides, this paper designs the improved genetic algorithm to solve the bi-level programming model and validates the model validity and algorithm feasibility through the computing example. The model has a high application value for solving the problem of comprehensive optimization of <b>intercity</b> passenger <b>transport</b> hub location and <b>intercity</b> passenger <b>transport</b> network design in the process of urban agglomeration development.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} results {{of research to}} study the intercity bus ridership demand, assess existing services, and form a basis to predict future ridership in the Palestinian territories. This study {{is the first of}} its type in the area. <b>Intercity</b> public <b>transport</b> between six governorates in the northern and central dis tricts of the West Bank was examined. The relationship between public transportation demand and both operating and socioeconomic variables that influence demand was established. An on-board survey of intercity bus riders identified some of the variables that can potentially influence ridership demand. A simple linear regression equation of the ridership demand was developed using five independent variables: population of origin city, population of destination city, bus fare, percent of employees at origin city, and percent of higher education students at origin city. Ridership profiles and trip characteristics were also established. The study results can be used to evaluate existing public transportation and forecast future <b>intercity</b> public <b>transport</b> demand. Decision-makers can use the results to improve <b>intercity</b> public <b>transport</b> services and attract more riders. Future research should be based on this simple model, include the impact of other modes on intercity demand, include all governorates of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and establish a comprehensive nationwide model...|$|R

40|$|Intercity {{transportation}} in Malaysia is {{quite similar to}} other countries, which involve three kinds of modes, namely, bus, rail and air.

However, bus transport service today is starting to face higher competition from rail and air transport due to their attractive factors. The huge challenge faced by <b>intercity</b> bus <b>transport</b> in Malaysia is the management of its services. The <b>intercity</b> bus <b>transport</b> does not fall under one management; unlike rail transport which is managed under Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB), or air transport which is managed under Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB).

5000|$|... "In {{the field}} of <b>intercity</b> <b>transports</b> {{employing}} the propeller turbine, the Vickers Viscount Model 700 appears to be considerably superior to anything else in its class. hasexceptionally fine flying qualities and is a most comfortable vehicle in which to travel." [...] John Watkins, Chief Technical Officer of Trans Australia Airlines. All production Viscounts were powered by the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop engine; from its initial 800 hp, and then 1,000 hp and higher, Rolls-Royce extensively developed the Dart engine, due to its popularity and use on the Viscount and several later aircraft. One key model was the Dart 506 engine, which had far greater fuel efficiency than earlier models; this enabled the airlines to deploy their Viscounts onto longer routes and to carry a greater maximum weight. Coupled with the availability of increasingly powerful engines, Vickers continued to develop and modify the Viscount's design. Later models could carry increasing numbers of passengers and had fewer load limitations.|$|R
