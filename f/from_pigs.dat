5|$|Desiccated thyroid extract is an animal-based {{thyroid gland}} extract, most {{commonly}} <b>from</b> <b>pigs.</b> It {{is a combination}} therapy, containing forms of T4 and T3. It also contains calcitonin (a hormone produced in the thyroid gland involved in the regulation of calcium levels), T1 and T2; these are not present in synthetic hormone medication. This extract was once a mainstream hypothyroidism treatment, but its use today is unsupported by evidence; British Thyroid Association and American professional guidelines discourage its use.|$|E
5|$|Xenotransplantation {{research}} involves transplanting tissues or organs {{from one}} species to another, {{as a way}} to overcome the shortage of human organs for use in organ transplants.

Although transplant rejection remains a problem, recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin-secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people's need for insulin.|$|E

5|$|The helmet {{was found}} {{along with some}} 5,296 Iron Age and Roman coins mostly dating to AD 20/30–50, the largest {{assemblage}} of Iron Age coins ever found in Britain. They had been buried at what {{appears to have been}} a pre-Roman shrine where large-scale animal slaughtering had taken place; nearly 7,000 bone fragments were also found at the site, 97 per cent of which were <b>from</b> <b>pigs.</b> Many appear to have been buried without the meat being eaten, suggesting that they had been used as offerings. The site is located on a hilltop which appears to have been encircled by a boundary ditch and palisade, with a possible processional way leading up to it. In Roman times it would have been located in the territory of the Corieltauvi, who inhabited an area of the East Midlands stretching from Northamptonshire to Lincolnshire.|$|E

25|$|Swine {{influenza}} virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide.

There were 103 pigs tested at the Fair, including the three infected, though all appeared healthy. Scientists said the virus was already spreading widely among people, and, in fact, was more common in humans than in pigs, so humans were more likely to catch it from others than <b>from</b> <b>pigs.</b>|$|E

25|$|Direct {{transmission}} of a swine flu virus <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> to humans is occasionally possible (zoonotic swine flu). In all, 50 cases {{are known to}} have occurred since the first report in medical literature in 1958, which have resulted in a total of six deaths. Of these six people, one was pregnant, one had leukemia, one had Hodgkin's lymphoma and two were known to be previously healthy. Despite these apparently low numbers of infections, the true rate of infection may be higher, since most cases only cause a very mild disease, and will probably never be reported or diagnosed.|$|E
25|$|The H1N1 form {{of swine}} flu {{is one of}} the {{descendants}} of the strain that caused the 1918 flu pandemic. As well as persisting in pigs, the descendants of the 1918 virus have also circulated in humans through the 20th century, contributing to the normal seasonal epidemics of influenza. However, direct transmission <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> to humans is rare, with only 12 recorded cases in the U.S. since 2005. Nevertheless, the retention of influenza strains in pigs after these strains have disappeared from the human population might make pigs a reservoir where influenza viruses could persist, later emerging to reinfect humans once human immunity to these strains has waned.|$|E

In addition, a nearby hillside {{appears to have been a}} sacred grove: numerous settings of crushed stone and fire sites were found all over it, and evenly distributed on, under, and around them, large amounts of burned and crushed bone, burned and crushed clay fragments, and resin drops, and smaller numbers of beads and blades such as knives and arrowheads.

25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of airborne}} transmission among humans {{is believed to be}} due to low levels of the virus in the lungs {{and other parts of the}} respiratory system of primates, insufficient to cause new infections. A number of studies examining airborne transmission broadly concluded that transmission <b>from</b> <b>pigs</b> to primates could happen without direct contact because, unlike humans and primates, pigs with EVD get very high ebolavirus concentrations in their lungs, and not their bloodstream. Therefore, pigs with EVD can spread the disease through droplets in the air or on the ground when they sneeze or cough. By contrast, humans and other primates accumulate the virus throughout their body and specifically in their blood, but not very much in their lungs. It is believed that this is the reason researchers have observed pig to primate transmission without physical contact, but no evidence has been found of primates being infected without actual contact, even in experiments where infected and uninfected primates shared the same air.|$|E
25|$|Swine {{influenza}} {{is caused}} by influenza A subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H2N3, H3N1, and H3N2. In pigs, four influenza A virus subtypes (H1N1, H1N2, H3N2 and H7N9) {{are the most common}} strains worldwide. In the United States, the H1N1 subtype was exclusively prevalent among swine populations before 1998; however, since late August 1998, H3N2 subtypes have been isolated <b>from</b> <b>pigs.</b> As of 2004, H3N2 virus isolates in US swine and turkey stocks were triple reassortants, containing genes from human (HA, NA, and PB1), swine (NS, NP, and M), and avian (PB2 and PA) lineages. In August 2012, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed 145 human cases (113 in Indiana, 30 in Ohio, one in Hawaii and one in Illinois) of H3N2v since July 2012. The death of a 61-year-old Madison County, Ohio woman is the first in the nation associated with a new swine flu strain. She contracted the illness after having contact with hogs at the Ross County Fair.|$|E
500|$|Other, more ancient, viruses {{have been}} less of a threat. Herpes viruses first {{infected}} the ancestors of modern humans over 80 million years ago.
