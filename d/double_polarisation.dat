40|$|International audienceTholins {{are complex}} C,N-containing organic {{compounds}} {{produced in the}} laboratory. They are considered to provide materials that are analogous to {{those responsible for the}} haze observed in Titan's atmosphere. These compounds present an astrobiological interest due to their ability to release amino acids upon hydrolysis. Their chemical structure has been investigated using a large number of techniques. However, to date no detailed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study has been performed on these materials despite the high potential of this technique for investigating the environment of given nuclei. Here 13 C and 15 N solid state NMR spectroscopy was applied to obtain new insights into the chemical structure of tholins produced through plasma discharge in gaseous N 2 -CH 4 mixtures designed to simulate the atmosphere of Titan. Due to the low natural abundance of these isotopes, a 13 C and 15 N-enriched tholin sample was synthesized using isotopically enriched gas precursors. Various pulse sequences including 13 C and 15 N single pulse, 1 H- 13 C and 1 H- 15 N cross polarisation and 1 H- 15 N- 13 C <b>double</b> cross <b>polarisation</b> were used. These techniques allowed complete characterisation of the chemical and structural environments of the carbon and nitrogen atoms.

40|$|The {{composite}} {{structure of the}} nucleon leads to a spectrum of excited states, or resonances, which contain important constraints on the dynamics and interactions of its constituents. A major world programme measuring meson photoproduction from the nucleon is currently under way to improve our knowledge of this fundamental spectrum. These new generation of measurements exploit polarisation degrees of freedom of the incident photon along with spin degrees of freedom in the target and recoiling nucleons. The meson photoproduction process can be described by 16 independent experimental observables. To fully constrain the four underlying complex photoproduction amplitudes requires the measurement of a least 8 of these. Measurements of <b>double</b> <b>polarisation</b> observables, where the photon beam and nucleon target are polarised are crucial to achieve this requirement. This thesis will present the analysis and extraction of the first preliminary measurement of the <b>double</b> <b>polarisation</b> observable. F in the single pion photoproduction reaction γ→ + p →n + π+ was undertaken to measure both F and T. The resulting measurement of polarisation observables from this reaction in conjunction with with those from the Pπ 0 channel will provide stringent constraints on partial wave analyses aiming to extract precision information on {{the properties of the}} low lying nucleon resonances...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of matter, i. e. the binding of nucleons to nuclei {{and the formation}} of quarks to nucleons or other hadrons, is governed by the strong interaction. The underlying Gauge theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is well established and has a characteristic property: the coupling constant is decreasing {{as a function of the}} momentum transfer (energy). In high-energy reactions, quarks and gluons behave as free particles and the coupling constant is small. This regime of QCD, where quarks and gluons interact only weakly, is called asymptotic freedom and pertubative calculations can be used to predict interactions. However, at small energies, the quarks interact strongly and virtual gluons can produce gluon-gluon pairs and confine quarks in colorless hadrons. Due to the large coupling constant, pertubative calculations of QCD are unreliable at low energies and cannot explain the confinement. In this low-energy range, only phenomenological models such as quark models or numerical calculations (lattice QCD) can be used to solve QCD. To verify QCD models at low energies, the excitation spectrum of the nucleon is of particular interest. Comparison of the model predictions and the experimentally observed states have shown a large discrepancy in number and ordering of the levels. Many more states are predicted than have been experimentally observed, which is known as the problem of missing resonances. This mismatch may either originate from the effective degrees of freedom of the models or from experimental bias. In the beginning of hadron spectroscopy, most results have been obtained from pion-nucleon scattering experiments. However, since the intermediate nucleon resonance depends on the production mechanism, only resonances that couple to π N have been observed. In the last decades, these results have been supplemented with data on unpolarised cross sections obtained from meson photoproduction at various acceleration facilities. These results could clarify the situation to some extent. Nevertheless, the problem of missing resonances persists, which is mainly caused by the fact that many resonances are broad and overlapping. Thus, current experiments focus on the measurement of single and <b>double</b> <b>polarisation</b> observables, which may improve the situation since observables are sensitive to interference terms and thus can enhance weak contributions from resonances. In this work, η photoproduction from quasi-free protons and neutrons has been studied. Photoproduction of η mesons is of particular interest since former results of different collaborations have shown an unusual narrow structure in the cross section on the neutron, which is not visible on the proton. Various theoretical models exist that try to explain this effect, but no conclusive solution has been found yet. Thus, to get a final interpretation of this effect, unpolarised cross sections, the <b>double</b> <b>polarisation</b> observable E and the helicity dependent cross sections σ 1 / 2 and σ 3 / 2 have been extracted in this work. Unpolarised total and differential cross sections have been determined for protons and neutrons bound in light nuclei, i. e. deuterium and 3 He. Data have been measured with the CBELSA/TAPS experiment at the Electron Stretcher Accelerator (ELSA) in Bonn (deuterium, December 2008) and with the A 2 experiment at the Mainzer Microtron (MAMI) in Mainz (3 He, November 2008). Both setups used energy-tagged photon beams to produce η mesons from cryogenic liquid targets. The target was surrounded by an almost 4 π covering detector setup. At CBELSA/TAPS the combined setup of Crystal Barrel (CBB) and MiniTAPS was used, at A 2 the main detectors were Crystal Ball (CB), TAPS. Furthermore, experiments aiming at the extraction of the <b>double</b> <b>polarisation</b> observable E, have been run at both acceleration facilities. A circularly polarised photon beam and a longitudinally polarised deuterated butanol (dButanol) target have been used. The results obtained in this work give input to new partial wave analysis and help to straighten out the situation of η photoproduction from the neutron...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of chiral {{perturbation}} theory (I PT), the low-energy effective field theory of QCD, accurate calculations have become possible for hadronic reactions. The extension of the approach to pion production in nucleon-nucleon collisions r equires new high precision experimental information in the near-threshold region. Of especial interest are the processes pp -> {pp}sI (0) and pn -> {pp}sI (-'), {{with the formation of}} a (1) S(0) proton pair (diproton) in the final state. The measurement s of dI /d, Ay and the spin-correlation coefficients Ax,x and Ax,z will permit an amplitude analysis that should provide a non-trivial test of the I PT predictions. A combined study of these processes will lead to the isolation of the strength parameter d of the 4 NI contact operator in I PT. The ANKE spectrometer is particularly well suited for the study of reactions with a final diproton. The use of the polarised COSY beams and the ANKE polarised internal target allows one to conduct single and <b>double</b> <b>polarisation</b> experiments. Preliminary results on the near-threshold measurements at ANKE of Ay in these processes are presented. The future experimental programme, including the double-polarised experiments, is discussed...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{remaining}} challenges within the standard model is to gain {{a good understanding of}} QCD in the non-perturbative regime. A key step towards this aim is baryon spectroscopy, investigating the spectrum and the properties of baryon resonances. To gain access to resonances with small π N partial width, photoproduction experiments provide essential information. Partial wave analyses need to be performed to extract the contributing resonances. Here, a complete experiment is required to unambiguously determine the contributing amplitudes. This involves the measurement of carefully chosen single and <b>double</b> <b>polarisation</b> observables. In a joint endeavour by MAMI, ELSA, and Jefferson Laboratory, a new generation of experiments with polarised beams, polarised proton and neutron targets, and 4 π particle detectors have been performed in recent years. Many results of unprecedented quality were recently published by all three experiments, and included by the various partial wave analysis groups in their analyses, leading to substantial improvements, e. g. a more precise determination of resonance parameters. An overview of recent results is given, with an emphasis on results from the CBELSA/TAPS experiment, and their impact on our understanding of the nucleon excitation spectrum is discussed.

40|$|Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) {{offers a}} new {{computing}} paradigm in nanotechnology and is being considered as the future alternative to state-of-the art CMOS designs. The first introduced logic element, the Majority Voter (MV) led to prohibitively large and complex circuits having both uncomplemented and complemented variables. Subsequently many proposals have been made namely AOI and NNI to overcome these shortcomings. In this work we focus on a novel nanostructure (DPNNI) with <b>double</b> <b>polarisation</b> inputs which uses NAND/NOR gates as the basic building blocks, similar to conventional digital logic circuits. Simulation result shows a minimum of 43 % {{to a maximum of}} 176 % reduction in size of circuits with this structure in comparison to that with the AOI and NNI gates. The widespread acceptance of QCA in logic design demands investigation of defect tolerance of QCA circuit elements. Hence the defect tolerance of the proposed structure with respect to misalignment of the cells in the NAND/NOR structure have also been analyzed. Noise margin is an important figure of merit in digital circuits. The Noise Margin of this proposed structure has also been studied and it is shown to exhibit a high impedance state corresponding to a tristated structure. The fault tolerant properties of the proposed universal gate has been evaluated through simulation with QCA Designer...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe present work {{studies the}} <b>double</b> <b>polarisation</b> {{phenomenon}} observed in vibrating piano strings. From the experimental viewpoint, {{it is known}} that when a string is given an initial displacement in one transverse direction (e. g. hammer excitation in the vertical plane), the second transverse displacement (e. g. in the horizontal plane) is also excited after a few milliseconds and the amplitude can be of similar order to the first transverse displacement. This phenomenon contributes to a characteristic piano sound feature called the "double decay". The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the role of nonlinearities in inducing double polarisations. The nonlinear vibrations of the strings are studied with a two-degrees-of-freedom (dofs) system extracted from the Kirchhoff-Carrier string equations. The method of multiple scales is used to study the free vibrations of two po-larisations having nearly equal eigenfrequencies and thus presenting a 1 : 1 internal resonance. For an imperfect string with slightly different eigenfrequencies between the two polarisa-tions, it is found out that depending on the energy of the excita-tion, an uncoupled transverse mode can develop into a coupled mode where there is energy exchange between the two transverse polarisations. The coupled mode is stable and the string oscillates in an elliptic path. Numerical experiments are also carried out, confirming the findings of the analytical approach...|$|E
40|$|The inner {{structure}} of nucleons {{and thus the}} fundamental interaction between the constituents, the quarks, can be investigated {{by means of the}} hadron spectroscopy. On the basis of the hadron spectroscopy, the different excitation states of the proton, the so-called resonances, can be determined, and thus also the possible degrees of freedom. Since the degrees of freedom determine the number of excited states, conclusions can then be done about the {{structure of}} the nucleons. However, the previously measured excitation spectrum of the proton cannot yet be fully described with the theoretical predictions of the quark models or the lattice gauge theories. Significantly more resonances are predicted at higher energies which so far could not be found in the experiments. This phenomenon is known as the problem of the missing resonances. But so far it is unclear, if these discrepancies are caused by assumed degrees of freedom in the theoretical models which are not realisable in nature or from the experimental bias. Due to their low lifetime, the different resonances of the excitation spectrum overlap and are difficult to identify. Through the polarisation observable measurements, the individual resonance contributions can be identified more easily because they are more sensitive to interference terms and therefore also to the weak resonance contributions. For this purpose the polarisation observable for the double π 0 photoproduction off the free proton were analysed. The double π 0 photoproduction {{is one of the most}} interesting reaction for the measurement of these observables. It allows to search for excited nucleon states which decay preferentially via cascades involving intermediate excited states. Furthermore, the background of non-resonant terms is small since the photon does not couple directly to neutral pions. The measurement of the <b>double</b> <b>polarisation</b> observable F and the single polarisation observable T were performed at the MAMI tagged photon facility in Mainz, Germany, using circularly polarised bremsstrahlung photons with incident energies from 450 up to 1450 MeV and a transversally polarised butanol target. The double π 0 reaction was identified using a combined setup of the Crystal Ball calorimeter and a TAPS forward wall and additionally the PID and the MWPCs for the charged particle tracking, which results in an almost 4 π acceptance. The polarisation observables were extracted from the data sets by the use of two different methods, the carbon subtraction method and the hydrogen normalisation method. It could be shown that the polarisation observable results for both methods are consistent. In order to check possible systematic uncertainties from the measurement with butanol targets also the absolutely normalised unpolarised cross sections were extracted and composed to results from measurements with liquid hydrogen targets. The experimental results were measured for further studies of the partial wave content of the double pion photoproduction in the second and third resonance regions. Therefore, the measured polarisation observables are compared to two different predictions of partial waves analysis, the isobar MAID model and the Bonn-Gatchina partial wave analysis. The measured results show distinct differences to the predictions and deliver new information for partial wave analysis...|$|E
