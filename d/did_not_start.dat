5|$|Sounders coach Schmid made {{adjustments}} to his usual starting lineup. Pappa <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b> {{due to a}} recent return from international duty with Guatemala, while star striker Martins was on the bench as well. Although he won the Golden Boot for most goals scored, Cooper was primarily a bench player throughout the year and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b> the match. Although lacking those playmakers, the Sounders came out attacking, and their first big chance came in the 10th minute when Rose slung a low cross near {{the face of the}} goal to Dempsey, whose resulting shot was off-frame.|$|E

5|$|C.maxima {{originated}} in South America over 4,000 years ago, probably in Argentina and Uruguay. The plants {{are sensitive to}} frost, and they prefer both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. C.maxima <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b> to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus. Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century. Types of C.maxima include triloba, zapallito, zipinka, Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, Marrow (C.maxima Marrow), Show, and Turban.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{has been}} active for over half a million years, with the oldest {{activity}} between 1,000,000 and 750,000 years ago forming lava domes. Older estimates indicate that activity <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b> before 250,000 years ago, while more recent research indicated a start of volcanism over 600,000 years ago. Volcanism at Ciomadul consisted mostly of the extrusion of lava domes, their collapse forming block-and-ash flows and subplinian and Vulcanian eruptions.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} workings by Native Americans. Native copper {{is known to have}} been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b> until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne opened conference play on January 6 in a {{match against}} the Richmond Spiders, a team which the Dukes had not {{defeated}} since the Spiders joined the Atlantic 10in 2001. This game marked {{the return of}} Melquan Bolding, though he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b> and scored only three points in fourteen minutes of playing time. Richmond managed to extend their streak, defeating the Dukes 86–80, while Saunders maintained his nation-leading position and now placed eighth in both blocks and steals. Duquesne then traveled to Dayton, Ohio where they lost to the Dayton Flyers 72–78 in overtime {{in front of a}} crowd of 13,435, the largest crowd the team would see all season. Senior Jason Duty was fouled on a 3-point attempt {{at the end of the}} game when his team was down by one, but made only one of three foul shots, sending the game into overtime. Melquan Bolding scored 13 points in 36 minutes, though he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start,</b> and Saunders came into the game now leading the nation in rebounds.|$|E

5|$|The 1978 season {{started with}} Roberts winning the Daytona 200 in a {{dominating}} fashion. After several near misses {{forced him to}} retire while leading the event, Roberts lapped the entire field en route to his first Daytona victory. He then won a rain-shortened Imola 200 race and was the second highest individual scorer behind Pat Hennen at the 1978 Transatlantic Match races. The 1978 world championship chase <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b> well for Roberts at the season-opening round in Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic {{principle}} of kafa'a discourages the marriages {{of women to}} men of differing religion or of inferior status. Neighbouring Muslim powers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b> to give their daughters in marriage to Ottoman princes until the fifteenth century, when they were seen to have grown in importance. This same principle meant that, while Ottoman men were free to marry Christian women, Muslim princesses were prevented from marrying Christian princes.|$|E

Production <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b> until August of that year, and only 285 were produced {{by the end of}} the war. The M19A1 had an auxiliary engine and generator to operate the 40mm guns when the main engine was shut down, and fixtures for carrying two spare gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in 1989 but production <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b> until 2002 due to Lloyd Webber's divorce and Schumacher's busy career. It was shot entirely at Pinewood Studios, with scenery created with miniatures and computer graphics. Rossum, Wilson, and Driver had singing experience, but Butler had none and so had music lessons. The Phantom of the Opera grossed approximately $154 million worldwide, despite receiving mixed to negative reviews, which praised the visuals and acting but criticized the writing and directing.|$|E
