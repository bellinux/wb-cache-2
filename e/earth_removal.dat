40|$|The {{depressurization}} of {{coal seam}} gas formations causes in situ fluids to migrate through pores and fractures in the <b>earth.</b> The <b>removal</b> or discharge of {{large volumes of}} water from coal measures reduces in situ fluid pressure allowing natural gas {{to be released from}} the coal matrix. This process results in a time-dependent resistivity variation in the subsurface. Increasing the connectivity of in situ fluids may lead to a reduction in resistivity of the targeted lithologies. A correct assessment of such resistivity variations is of significant interest not only for the industry to optimize production and extraction well locations but also for the regulatory bodies, in which a desire for a reliable method for monitoring changes in subsurface fluid distribution allows sound risk assessment of potential environmental hazards. From an industrial field study conducted in Queensland, Australia, we have found that the magnetotelluric (MT) method in the bandwidth of 100 Hz to 100 s could be used to monitor changes in the bulk resistivity of depressurized lithologies.

40|$|The {{objective}} is {{the removal of}} medium sized orbital debris in low Earth orbits. The design incorporates a transfer vehicle and a netting vehicle to capture the medium size debris. The system is based near an operational space station located at 28. 5 degrees inclination and 400 km altitude. The system uses ground based tracking to determine {{the location of a}} satellite breakup or debris cloud. This data is unloaded to the transfer vehicle, and the transfer vehicle proceeds to rendezvous with the debris at a lower altitude parking orbit. Next, the netting vehicle is deployed, tracks the targeted debris, and captures it. After expending the available nets, the netting vehicle returns to the transfer vehicle for a new netting module and continues to capture more debris in the target area. Once all the netting modules are expended, the transfer vehicle returns to the space station's orbit, where it is resupplied with new netting modules from a space shuttle load.

40|$|High-precision W isotopic {{analyses}} by Harper and Jacobsen indicate the W- 182 /W- 183 ratio in the Toluca iron meteorite is shifted by -(3. 0 +/- 0. 9) x 10 (exp - 4) {{relative to a}} terrestrial standard. Possible causes of this shift are neutron-capture reactions on W during Toluca's approximately 600 -Ma exposure to cosmic ray particles or radiogenic growth of W- 182 from 9 -Ma Hf- 182 in the silicate portion of the <b>Earth</b> after <b>removal</b> of W to the Earth's core. Calculations for the rates of neutron-capture reactions on W isotopes were done to study the first possibility. The LAHET Code System (LCS) which consists of the Los Alamos High Energy Transport (LAHET) code and the Monte Carlo N-Particle(MCNP) transport code was used to numerically simulate the irradiation of the Toluca iron meteorite by galactic-cosmic-ray (GCR) particles and to calculate the rates of W(n, gamma) reactions. Toluca was modeled as a 3. 9 -m-radius sphere with the composition of a typical IA iron meteorite. The incident GCR protons and their interactions were modeled with LAHET, which also handled the interactions of neutrons with energies above 20 MeV. The rates for the capture of neutrons by W- 182, W- 183, and W- 186 were calculated using the detailed library of (n, gamma) cross sections in MCNP.

This innovation, the ATMO estimator, provides a simple, 0 - 1 normalized scalar that estimates this distortion (see figure). The metric is defined as the coefficient of determination of a quadratic fit in the region of distorting atmospheric absorption (approx 2 micron). This mimics the behavior of existing CRISM team mineralogical indices to estimate the presence of known, interesting mineral signatures.

40|$|The debris {{problem has}} reached a stage at which the risk to {{satellites}} and spacecraft has become substantial in low Earth orbit (LEO). This research discovered that small particles posed little threat to spacecraft because shielding can effectively prevent these particles from damaging the spacecraft. The research also showed that, even though collision with {{a large piece of}} debris could destroy the spacecraft, the large pieces of debris pose little danger because they can be tracked and the spacecraft can be maneuvered away from these pieces. Additionally, there are many current designs to capture and remove large debris particles from the space environment. From this analysis, it was decided to concentrate on the removal of medium-sized orbital debris, that is, those pieces ranging from 1 cm to 50 cm in size. The current design incorporates a transfer vehicle and a netting vehicle to capture the medium-sized debris.

40|$|The {{excavation}} of foundations, general earthworks and <b>earth</b> <b>removal</b> tasks are activities which involve the machine operator {{in a series}} of repetitive operations, suggesting opportunities for the automation through the introduction of robotic technologies with subsequent improvements in machine utilisation and throughput. The automation of the <b>earth</b> <b>removal</b> process is also likely to provide a number of other benefits such as a reduced dependence on operator skills and a lower operator work load, both of which might be expected to contribute to improvements in quality and, in particular, the removal of the need for a local operator when working in hazardous environments. The Lancaster University Computerised Intelligent Excavator or LUCIE has demonstrated the achievement of automated and robotic excavation through the implementation of an integrated, real-time, artificial intelligence based control system utilising a novel form of motion control strategy for movement of the excavator bucket through ground.

40|$|Aerated {{soils are}} the largest sinks of {{atmospheric}} methane on the <b>Earth’s</b> surface. Methane <b>removal</b> from the atmosphere is performed through oxidation by microorganisms (methaneoxidising bacteria) in the soil. Methanotrophic bacteria utilise methane (single-carbon compound) as their main carbon and energy source, but some groups {{have been found to}} grow on different multi-carbon compounds. This thesis investigated the influence of soil methanotrophs on the kinetics of methane oxidation in Swedish forest soils and the effect of the tree species Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula pendula) on methane consumption rates. Soil samples were collected from the study area Vipängen (Ultuna), which is classified as a Dystrocryept with its O horizon between 0 - 5 cm, A horizon 5 - 20 cm and B horizon 20 - 40 cm. The potential effect of other multi-carbon substrates (acetate, vanillic acid and guaiacol) that could be expected to enhance the oxidation rate of atmospheric methane was also examined. The results showed that the methanotrophs at the study site were high-affinity species with Vmax values ranging between 4. 3 and 11. 0 nmol CH 4 g- 1 d. w. hr- 1 and Km ranging between 7. 4 and 185. 5 nmol g- 1 d. w. Type of tree species which is proposed to have a strong influence on the methane sink, clearly did so in this incubation experiment. Consumption in soil samples from a birch stand displayed the highest consumption rate, followed by spruce and pine for all four different initial concentrations of methane tested (4. 5, 7, 14. 1 and 45. 1 ppmv). Evaluation of the effects of acetate, vanillic acid and guaiacol on methane consumption rates in the Swedish forest soils studied showed that only addition of acetate yielded a substantial effect, demonstrating that methanotrophs are not just limited to single-carbon bonds. Further studies on the effects of different multi-carbon compounds on the growth of some methanotrophic species (increased oxidation) will provide in-depth knowledge of the factors governing methane fluxes between the atmosphere and the soil...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus removal by {{wetlands}} and basins in Lake Tahoe may be improved through designing these systems to filter storm water through media having higher phosphorus removal capabilities than local parent material. Substrates rich in iron, aluminum and calcium oftentimes have enhanced phosphorus removal. These substrates can be naturally occurring, byproducts of industrial or water treatment processes, or engineered. Phosphorus removal fundamentally occurs through chemical adsorption and/or precipitation {{and much of}} the phosphorus can be irreversibly bound. In addition to these standard media, other engineered substrates are available to enhance P removal. One such substrate is locally available in Reno and uses lanthanum coated diatomaceous <b>earth</b> for arsenate <b>removal.</b> This material, which has a high positive surface charge, can also irreversibly remove phosphorus. Physical factors also affect P removal. Specifically, specific surface area and particle shape affect filtration capacity, contact area between water and the surface area, and likelihood of clogging and blinding. A number of substrates have been shown to effectively remove P in case studies. Based upon these studies, promising substrates include WTRs, blast furnace slag, steel furnace slag, OPC, calcite, marble Utelite and other LWAs, zeolite and shale. However, other nonperformance factors such as environmental considerations, application logistics, costs, and potential for cementification narrow the list of possible media for application at Tahoe. Industrial byproducts such as slags risk possible leaching of heavy metals and this potential cannot be easily predicted. Fly ash and other fine particle substrates would be more difficult to apply because they would need to be blended, making them less desirable and more costly to apply than larger diameter media. High transportation costs rule out non-local products. Finally, amorphous calcium products will eventually cementify reducing their effectiveness in filtration systems. Based upon these considerations, bauxite, LWAs and expanded shales/clays, iron-rich sands, activated alumina, marble and dolomite, and natural and lanthanum activated diatomaceous earth are the products most likely to be tested for application at Tahoe. These materials are typically iron, calcium or aluminum based; many have a high specific surface area; and all have low transportation costs. (PDF contains 21 pages...|$|R
40|$|Dust devils {{that leave}} dark- or light-toned tracks are common on Mars {{and they can}} also be found on the Earth’s surface. Dust devil tracks (hereinafter DDTs) are ephemeral surface {{features}} with mostly sub-annual lifetimes. Regarding their size, DDT widths can range between ∼ 1 m and ∼ 1 km, depending on the diameter of dust devil that created the track, and DDT lengths range from a few tens of meters to several kilometers, limited by the duration and horizontal ground speed of dust devils. DDTs can be classified into three main types based on their morphology and albedo in contrast to their surroundings; all are found on both planets: (a) dark continuous DDTs, (b) dark cycloidal DDTs, and (c) bright DDTs. Dark continuous DDTs are the most common type on Mars. They are characterized by their relatively homogenous and continuous low albedo surface tracks. Based on terrestrial and martian in situ studies, these DDTs most likely form when surficial dust layers are removed to expose larger-grained substrate material (coarse sands of ≥ 500 μm in diameter). The exposure of larger-grained materials changes the photometric properties of the surface; hence leading to lower albedo tracks because grain size is photometrically inversely proportional to the surface reflectance. However, although not observed so far, compositional differences (i. e., color differences) might also lead to albedo contrasts when dust is removed to expose substrate materials with mineralogical differences. For dark continuous DDTs, albedo drop measurements are around 2. 5 % in the wavelength range of 550 – 850 nm on Mars and around 0. 5 % in the wavelength range from 300 – 1100 nm on <b>Earth.</b> The <b>removal</b> of an equivalent layer thickness around 1 μm is sufficient for the formation of visible dark continuous DDTs on Mars and Earth. The next type of DDTs, dark cycloidal DDTs, are characterized by their low albedo pattern of overlapping scallops. Terrestrial in situ studies imply that they are formed when sand-sized material that is eroded from the outer vortex area of a dust devil is redeposited in annular patterns in the central vortex region. This type of DDT can also be found in on Mars in orbital image data, and although in situ studies are lacking, terrestrial analog studies, laboratory work, and numerical modeling suggest they have the same formation mechanism as those on Earth. Finally, bright DDTs are characterized by their continuous track pattern and high albedo compared to their undisturbed surroundings. They are found on both planets, but to date they have only been analyzed in situ on Earth. Here, the destruction of aggregates of dust, silt and sand by dust devils leads to smooth surfaces in contrast to the undisturbed rough surfaces surrounding the track. The resulting change in photometric properties occurs because the smoother surfaces have a higher reflectance compared to the surrounding rough surface, leading to bright DDTs. On Mars, the destruction of surficial dust-aggregates may also lead to bright DDTs. However, higher reflective surfaces may be produced by other formation mechanisms, such as dust compaction by passing dust devils, as this may also cause changes in photometric properties. On Mars, DDTs in general are found at all elevations and on a global scale, except on the permanent polar caps. DDT maximum areal densities occur during spring and summer in both hemispheres produced by an increase in dust devil activity caused by maximum insolation. Regionally, dust devil densities vary spatially likely controlled by changes in dust cover thicknesses and substrate materials. This variability makes it difficult to infer dust devil activity from DDT frequencies. Furthermore, only a fraction of dust devils leave tracks. However, DDTs can be used as proxies for dust devil lifetimes and wind directions and speeds, and {{they can also be}} used to predict lander or rover solar panel clearing events. Overall, the high DDT frequency in many areas on Mars leads to drastic albedo changes that affect large-scale weather patterns...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale land {{transformation}} due {{to housing}} {{development in the}} Tokyo Metropoitan Area has been significanty recognized since 1960 when the development was magnified not only on flat lands but also on hills and in low-relief mountains. Because {{of a lack of}} the study of such phenomena, this paper aims to clarify the actual state of land transformation due to post-war housing development in the 50 km sphere of Tokyo, while overviewing the periodical trends which are classified into two major stages, i. e. before and after@ 1960. As a result of this study, it becomes evident that the volume of removed earth in each development site is mainly prescribed by original landform features, especially relief energy, and the recent increase of volume is caused by developments on hills and dissected uplands. The volume of removed earth produced by housing developments of more than 20 ha in this region in 15 years since 1960 is assumed to reach 8. 5 × 108 m 3. This means that, in the whole region including nondevelopment areas, c. a. 13 cm (annually 9 mm) of the earth surface was disturbed, which is roughly 102 times as high as the erosion rate of the humid temperate hills covered with natural forest. On the other hand, in each development site where high <b>earth</b> <b>removal</b> is carried out such as intensive cutting and fill operations of partially more than 20 m in thickness, the earth work completely destroys the original drainage network of the lower order, which is considered to cause abrupt changes in the environment...|$|E

This model assumes the lower mantle closed early, while the upper mantle is open to subduction from the atmosphere and mass transfer from the lower mantle. Constraints are derived that can be incorporated into models for terrestrial volatile acquisition: (1) Calculated lower-mantle Xe-isotopic ratios indicate that the fraction of radiogenic Xe produced by I- 129 and Pu- 244 during the first about 10 (exp 8) yr was lost, a conclusion also drawn for atmospheric Xe. Thus, either the Earth was made from materials that had lost > 99 % of rare gases about (0. 7 - 2) x 10 (exp 8) yr after the solar system formed, or gases were then lost from the fully formed Earth. (2) Concentrations of 3 He and 20 Ne in the lower mantle were established after these losses. (3) Neon-isotopic data indicates that mantle Ne has solar composition. The model allows for solar Ar/Ne and Xe/Ne in the lower mantle if a dominant fraction of upper mantle Ar and Xe are subduction-derived. If Earth formed {{in the presence of the}} solar nebula, it could have been melted by accretional energy and the blanketing effect of a massive, nebula-derived atmosphere. Gases from this atmosphere would have been sequestered within the molten Earth by dissolution at the surface and downward mixing. It was found that too much Ne would be dissolved in the Earth unless the atmosphere began to escape when the Earth was only partially assembled. Here we consider conditions required to initially dissolve sufficient rare gases to account for the present lower mantle concentrations after subsequent losses at 10 (exp 8) yr. It is assumed that equilibration of the atmosphere with a thoroughly molten mantle was rapid, so that initial abundances of gases retained in any mantle layer reflected surface conditions when the layer solidified. For subsequent gas loss of 99. 5 % and typical solubility coefficients, a total pressure of 100 atm was required for an atmosphere of solar composition. Calculations of the pressure at the base of a primordial atmosphere indicate that this value might be exceeded by an order of magnitude or more for an atmosphere supported by accretional energy. Surface temperatures of about 4000 K would have been produced, probably high enough to melt the deep mantle. Initial distributions of retained rare gases would then be determined by the history of surface pressure and temperature during mantle cooling and solidification, i. e., the coupled cooling of Earth and atmosphere. The Earth's thermal state was determined by its surface temperature and the efficiency of convection in the molten mantle, estimated to be sufficient to maintain an adiabatic gradient. Because the melting curve is steeper than the adiabat, solidification of the mantle proceeded outward from the interior. Incorporation of atmospheric gases in the mantle therefore occurred over a range in surface temperature of a few thousand degrees Kelvin. The thermal state of the atmosphere was controlled by total luminosity of the Earth (energy) released by accreting planetesimals and the cooling Earth), nebular temperature and pressure, and atmospheric opacity. The energy released by accretion declined with time as did nebular pressure. Analytical solutions for an idealized (constant opacity radiative atmosphere show that declining energy sources under constant nebular conditions result in slowly diminishing surface temperature but dramatically increasing surface pressure. For such an atmosphere with declining nebular pressure but constant total luminosity, surface pressure decreases gradually with decreasing temperaure. A decline in accretion luminosity might be compensated by energy released as the mantle cools for about 10 (exp 5) year, after which luminosity must decline. The total complement of dissolved rare gases will depend on the particular evolutionary path determined by the declining accretional luminosity, the <b>Earth</b> thermal history, <b>removal</b> of the nebula, and opacity variations of the atmosphere. Models for these coupled evolutionary histories for Earth's acquisition of nebular-derived noble gases are in progress. The later losses required at about 10 (exp 8) yr (depleting the interior concentrations of the sequestered solar gases by a factor of > 100) were presumably related to the major impact in which the Moon formed...|$|R

Most of the farmers are of. the belief that the bed excavation or desilting is the best solution for the need to increase water storage. Though there are some who favour the desilting/bed excavation, some are for the spill level raising. A literature survey identified the need of a comparative study of these options to determine which could facilitate the safe cultivation of more land under the reservoir. The present work carried out a comparative monthly water balance on two already desiited/excavated tanks from the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The study revealed that the advantages of spill raising or bed excavation depends on the rainfall received by each catchment, the topography, location and extent of <b>earth</b> <b>removal</b> from the tank bed,etc. In the studied reservoirs it was felt that the increase If capacity contributed to the irrigation water release was negligible.
