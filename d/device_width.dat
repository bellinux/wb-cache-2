40|$|A {{detailed}} full-wave time-domain {{simulation model}} {{for the analysis of}} electromagnetic effects on the behavior of the submicrometer-gate field-effect transistor (FET's) is presented. The full wave simulation model couples a three-dimensional (3 -D) time-domain solution of Maxwell's equations to the active device model. The active device model is based on the moments of the Boltzmann's transport equation obtained by integration over the momentum space. The coupling between the two models is established by using fields obtained from the solution of Maxwell's equations in the active device model to calculate the current densities inside the device. These current densities are used to update the electric and magnetic fields. Numerical results are generated using the coupled model to investigate the effects of electron-wave interaction on the behavior of microwave FET's. The results show that the voltage gain increases along the <b>device</b> <b>width.</b> While the amplitude of the input-voltage wave decays along the <b>device</b> <b>width,</b> due to the electromagnetic energy loss to the conducting electrons, the amplitude of the output-voltage wave increases as more and more energy is transferred from the electrons to the propagating wave along the <b>device</b> <b>width.</b> The simulation confirms that there is an optimum <b>device</b> <b>width</b> for highest voltage gain for a given device structure.

40|$|Wireless {{and mobile}} {{communication}} systems have become ubiquitous {{in our daily}} life. The need for higher bandwidth and thus higher speed and data rates in wireless communications has prompted the exploration of millimeter-wave frequencies. Some of the applications in this regime include high-speed wireless local area networks and high data rate personal area networks at 60 GHz, automotive collision avoidance radar at 77 GHz and millimeter-wave imaging at 94 GHz. Most of these applications are cost sensitive and require high levels of integration to reduce system size. The tremendous improvement in the frequency response of state-of-the-art deeply scaled CMOS technologies has made them an ideal candidate for millimeter-wave applications. A few research groups have already demonstrated single chip CMOS radios at 60 GHz. However, the design of power amplifiers in CMOS still remains a significant challenge because of the low breakdown voltage of deep submicron CMOS technologies. Power levels from 60 GHz power amplifiers have been limited to around 15 dBm with power-added efficiencies in the 10 - 20 % range, despite {{the use of multiple}} gain stages and power combining techniques. In this work, we have studied the RF power potential of commercial 65 nm and 45 nm CMOS technologies. We have mapped the frequency, power and efficiency limitations of these technologies and identified the physical mechanisms responsible for these limitations. We also present a simple analytical model that allows circuit designers to estimate the maximum power obtainable from their designs for a given efficiency. The model uses only the DC bias point and on-resistance of the device as inputs and contains no adjustable parameters. We have demonstrated a record output power density of 210 mW/mm and power-added efficiency in excess of 75 % at VDs = 1. 1 V and f = 2 GHz on 45 nm CMOS devices. This record power performance was made possible through careful device layout for minimized parasitic resistances and capacitances. Total output power approaching 70 mW was measured on 45 nm CMOS devices by increasing the <b>device</b> <b>width</b> to 640 gm. However, we find that the output power scales non-ideally with <b>device</b> <b>width</b> because of an increase in normalized on-resistance in the wide devices. PAE also decreases with increasing <b>device</b> <b>width</b> because of degradation in f. in the wide devices. Additionally PAE decreases as the measurement frequency increases, though the output power remains constant with increasing frequency. Small-signal equivalent circuit extractions on these devices suggest that the main reason for the degradation in the normalized output power and PAE with increasing <b>device</b> <b>width</b> is the non-ideal scaling of parasitic gate and drain resistances in the wide devices. by Usha Gogineni.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of nanoelectromechanical systems in pressurized fluids. Resonant responses and quality factors are monitored in five different gases and one liquid, in pressures ranging from vacuum to 20 MPa, in order to evaluate theoretical models of device-fluid interactions at the nanoscale. The traditional Newell picture of microresonator damping in different pressure regimes {{is found to be}} inadequate in describing nanoresonators in general. Damping at intermediate pressure ranges is better physically characterized by a Weissenberg number (which compares oscillation frequencies with fluid relaxation rates) than a Knudsen number (which compares mean free paths with <b>device</b> <b>widths)</b> and most adequately described by the Yakhot and Colosqui model. At high-pressure ranges, two models are found to give good agreement with data: the phenomenological model of vibrating spheres and the Sader and Bhiladvala model for the viscous regime. The latter is also successful in explicitly predicting pressure-dependent behavior of the viscous mass load and damping. We observe significant increases in damping due to the squeezed film (SF) of gas between the device and substrate as well as due to undercut (an unavoidable artifact of the standard fabrication technique); correcting the shape of the devices with a focused ion beam allows us to differentiate these two factors. Application of the SF model accounts well for additional damping at high pressures while only qualitatively agreeing at lower pressures. The extensive data collected allow additional insight into fundamental processes underlying fluid damping at the nanoscale, particularly in the intermediate- and high-pressure regimes.
