25|$|In {{his book}} Slaughter at Halbe, Tony Le Tissier accused General Busse {{of failing to}} {{exercise}} effective command {{and control of the}} encircled army, thereby contributing to the failure of successive break-out attempts. Le Tissier writes that Busse's initial movement of his HQ put him <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> he lost the ability to control the formations in the pocket, and in his break-out plan, Ninth Army HQ was to be placed immediately behind the spearhead of the breakout, the 502nd SS Heavy Tank Battalion, which effectively reduced his ability to exercise command to the tactical level. He also accuses Busse of failing to adequately support the first breakout attempt (see below). The spearhead for the Ninth Army break-out plan on April 28 was to be the 502nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion with remaining elements of the Panzergrenadier Division Kurmark. These units were split into two wedges. The northern wedge included the 502nd SS Panzer, Ninth Army HQ, XI SS Panzer Corps HQ, and Panzergrenadier Division Kurmark HQ. Remnants of the 21st Panzer Division were to cover in a north-westerly direction, while remnants of the 32nd SS Division 30. Januar was to cover the east and provide the rearguard.|$|E

60|$|All {{this time}} Captain Sanglier was looking after his own breakfast with the {{resignation}} of a philosopher, the coolness of a veteran, the ingenuity and science of a Frenchman, and the voracity of an ostrich. This person had now been in the colony some thirty years, having left France in some such situation in his own army as Muir filled in the 55th. An iron constitution, perfect obduracy of feeling, a certain address well suited to manage savages, and an indomitable courage, had early pointed him out to the commander-in-chief as a suitable agent to be employed in directing the military operations of his Indian allies. In this capacity, then, he had risen to the titular rank of captain; and with his promotion had acquired {{a portion of the}} habits and opinions of his associates with a facility and an adaptation of self which are thought in America to be peculiar to his countrymen. He had often led parties of the Iroquois in their predatory expeditions; and his conduct on such occasions exhibited the contradictory results of both alleviating the misery produced by this species of warfare, and of augmenting it by the broader views and greater resources of civilization. In other words, he planned enterprises that, in their importance and consequences, much exceeded the usual policy of the Indians, and then stepped in to lessen some of the evils of his own creating. In short, he was an adventurer whom circumstances had thrown <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> the callous qualities of men of his class might readily show themselves for good or for evil; and he was not of a character to baffle fortune by any ill-timed squeamishness on the score of early impressions, or to trifle with her liberality by unnecessarily provoking her frowns through wanton cruelty. Still, as his name was unavoidably connected with many of the excesses committed by his parties, he was generally considered in the American provinces a wretch who delighted in bloodshed, and who found his greatest happiness in tormenting the helpless and the innocent; and the name of Sanglier, which was a sobriquet of his own adopting, or of Flint Heart, as he was usually termed on the borders, had got to be as terrible to the women and children of that part of the country as those of Butler and Brandt became at a later day.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We re-examine vacuity in {{temporal}} logic model checking. We note two disturbing phenomena in recent results in this area. The first indicates {{that not all}} vacuities detected in practical applications are considered a problem by the system verifier. The second shows that vacuity detection for certain logics can be very complex and time consuming. This brings vacuity detection <b>into</b> <b>an</b> undesirable <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> the user of the model checking tool may find herself waiting {{a long time for}} results that are of no interest for her. In this paper we define Temporal Antecedent Failure, an extension of antecedent failure to {{temporal logic}}, which refines the notion of vacuity. According to our experience, this type of vacuity always indicates a problem in the model, environment or formula. On top, detection of this vacuity is extremely easy to achieve. We base our definition and algorithm on regular expressions, that have become the major temporal logic specification in practical applications...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{strategic}} management consequences of technology development. Business policy considerations are predicated on the overall assumption that the multiplication of broadband telecommunication networks, capable of delivering both voice and data bits of information, has led telephone companies <b>into</b> <b>a</b> competitive <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> they are compelled to decrease their interconnection fees. All over the world there is an observable trend towards a cornucopia of networks and a glut of bandwidth. This means that legislation putting a cap on connection fees will only conserve <b>a</b> business <b>situation</b> that is gone long ago. Browsing the classical literature on telecommunication regulation, this study on business policy argues that {{instead of waiting for}} legislation - that is far too late to orient companies what to do policy-wise with the imminent new market situation -, wireless carriers should rather start emphasising the design of new, value-added services. Such a change of emphasis - turning away from the provision of connectivity alone - can help them achieve some added value and remain in business. Otherwise, they may soon follow the path of a slow corporate funeral following their wired brethren...|$|R

The biological parent can be essential to the success of the stepfamily as she or he is the only family member with a direct connection to the other members (stepparent and children), yet little research has been conducted that directly addresses the roles and experiences of the parent. The present study was designed to investigate the subjective meanings and experiences of natural or biological parents who enter <b>into</b> <b>a</b> stepfamiIy <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> adolescents are present.

A model of stress in the stepfamily life cycle is applied to the present results...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{hypothesized}} that activated self-stereotypes {{can influence the}} strategies of task solution by inducing regulatory foci. More specifically, positive self-stereotypes should induce a promotion focus state of eagerness, whereas negative stereotypes should induce a prevention focus state of vigilance. Study 1 showed that a negative ascribed stereotype with regard to task performance leads to better recall for avoidance-related statements whereas a positive stereotype leads to better recall for approach-related statements. In Studies 2 and 3, both an experimental manipulation of group performance expectation and the preexisting stereotype of better verbal skills in women than in men led to faster and less accurate performance in the positive {{as compared with the}} negative stereotype group. Studies 4 and 5 showed that positive in-group stereotypes led to more creative performance whereas negative stereotypes led to better analytical performance. These results point to a possible mechanism for stereotype-threat effects. “Blonds are dumb”; “ women can’t do math”; “White men can’t jump. ” If you bring members of <b>a</b> stereotyped group <b>into</b> <b>an</b> achievement <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> the stereotype could be applied, they often dramatically underperform if they believe their ability in that particular domain is measured. This was first shown by Steele and Aronson (1995) in their seminal work on the effect of stereotype activation on intellectual test performance of Blacks. In a series of studies, Blacks performed considerably poorer on a standardized test when it was presented as diagnostic of their abilities than when the same test was framed as a simple problem-solving task. No such difference emerged for Whites.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to design a generically applicable framework for guiding the development of technological innovation systems in small island developing states (SIDS). Existing theories formed the bases of the framework but important changes were derived from a cross-case study of five island based innovation systems and an in-depth case study of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) technology {{on the island of}} Curaçao. Two key factors were found to make the development of innovation systems in SIDS different. Firstly, only specific technologies should be targeted – high-margin or service sectors, and the ones that utilize strategic locations or specific natural resources of the islands. Secondly, due to the characteristics of SIDS the innovation systems’ integration into the landscape and regimes of the islands is essential – the links between the innovation systems and regimes and landscapes are much stronger in SIDS than in developed states. Therefore strong network of local partners should be established in order to guarantee sufficient support from the islands’ regimes. Also, due to the potential impacts on the islands’ landscapes, projects that are parts of the TIS should be of ‘moderate’ sizes so that they do not make the SIDS overly dependent on {{the success or failure of}} the technology. Furthermore, the innovation systems should be developed gradually in order not to disrupt the fragile economies of the islands. By following this set of rules, close relationships between the sectors and the islands’ regimes and landscapes can be established. This results <b>into</b> <b>a</b> win-win <b>situation</b> <b>where</b> the TIS can develop as it benefits from the island’s support (permits, policies, tax exemptions etc.) and the island itself reaps socio-economic benefits. Without this win-win situation, the TIS will struggle to develop. Management of TechnologyTechnology Dynamics and Sustainable DevelopmentTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R

In order to predict vulnerabilities in intelligence analysis that might arise when traditional strategies for coping with data overload are undermined, we conducted an observational study in a simulated setting. Ten professional intelligence analysts analysed the causes and impacts of the Ariane 501 accident. When study participants performed a time-pressured analysis outside their base of expertise based on sampling reports from a large set, some made inaccurate statements in verbal briefings. Participants that made no inaccurate statements spent more time during the analysis, read more documents, and relied on higher-quality documents than participants who made inaccurate statements. All participants missed potentially available relevant information and had difficulty detecting and resolving data conflicts. Sources of inaccurate statements were: (1) relying upon default assumptions, (2) incorporating inaccurate information and (3) incorporating information that was considered accurate {{at one point in}} time. These findings have design implications and point to evaluation criteria for systems designed to address the data overload problem in intelligence analysis...|$|R
