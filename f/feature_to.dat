5|$|Katzenberg, Schneider, and Roy Disney {{set about}} {{changing}} {{the culture of the}} studio, increasing staffing and production so that a new animated feature would be released every year instead of every two to four. The first of the releases on the accelerated production schedule was Oliver & Company (1988), which featured an all-star cast including Billy Joel and Bette Midler and an emphasis on a modern pop soundtrack. Oliver & Company opened in the theaters on the same day as another Bluth/Amblin/Universal animated film, The Land Before Time; however, Oliver outgrossed Time and {{went on to become the}} most successful animated <b>feature</b> <b>to</b> that date.|$|E

Yellow Dog Linux provides an official distribution that can be downloaded, and other distributions such as Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu have been successfully installed and operated on the console. The use of Linux on the PlayStation 3 allowed users to access 6 of the 7 Synergistic Processing Elements; Sony implemented a hypervisor restricting access to the RSX. The <b>feature</b> <b>to</b> install a second operating system on a PlayStation 3 was removed in a firmware update released in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} met with both {{critical}} and financial success, grossing over $76 million during its initial run.

Our approach uses local <b>features</b> <b>to</b> generalize across tasks and global <b>features</b> <b>to</b> learn from practice. We demonstrate this approach applied to the marble maze task. Our robot uses local <b>features</b> <b>to</b> initially learn primitive selection and subgoal generation policies from observing a teacher maneuver a marble through a maze.

5|$|After {{maintaining}} {{peak strength}} for about 18hours, Kenneth began a sharp weakening trend due to unfavorable north-northeasterly wind shear; this {{was caused by}} the anticyclone over Hurricane Jova, which eroded the eyewall of Hurricane Kenneth. While weakening, the hurricane turned to a southwest drift, due to a weakness in steering currents. By September 20, its deepest convection was confined to the southern half of the hurricane, and later in the day Kenneth weakened to tropical storm status. Reduced moisture in the atmosphere weakened the system further, and by September 21 its circulation was exposed to the east-northeast of the convection. Kenneth began a steady west-northwest track due to a weak ridge to its north. Operationally the storm was predicted to continue weakening and dissipate within four days. However, deep convection re-developed near the center as the outflow became better defined, and Kenneth remained a moderate tropical storm for several days. On September 24, the motion became nearly stationary as steering currents again weakened. Vertical shear sharply declined, allowing the convection to become more symmetrical and for an eye <b>feature</b> <b>to</b> develop. On September 25, Kenneth again attained hurricane status while located about 1085miles (1745km) east-southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Alice in Wonderland, {{released}} in 1951, {{met with a}} lukewarm response {{at the box office}} and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release. Peter Pan, {{released in}} 1953, was, on the other hand, a commercial success and the highest-grossing film of the year. In 1955, Lady and the Tramp was released to higher box office success than any other Disney feature from the studio since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, earning an estimated $7.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955. Lady is significant as Disney's first widescreen animated feature, produced in the CinemaScope process, and was the first Disney animated <b>feature</b> <b>to</b> be released by Disney's own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.|$|E
5|$|Although {{originally}} the whole 20th Infantry Brigade {{had been assigned}} the task of advancing through the Australian centre towards Nongora, in the end only one infantry battalion, the 2/15th, and a platoon from the Papuan Infantry Battalion was committed. Stepping off on 30 November, this force struck north from Nongora towards the Song River. The lead company crossed the river west of a fjord and shortly after completing this manoeuvre, a force of Japanese engaged them with machine gun fire, killing one and wounding three others. Still in contact, the Australian company secured the crossing enabling two other companies from the 2/15th to come across. While the lead company fixed the Japanese position, the other two conducted a passage of lines manoeuvre and bypassed the Japanese machine gun position as they continued the advance towards Nongora. The lead company then also broke contact and followed them, {{and in the early}} afternoon, finding themselves confronted by a high <b>feature</b> <b>to</b> their front which blocked their path east towards Nongora, they established a defensive position short of their objective; meanwhile, the 2/15th's fourth company, following up in reserve, found the Japanese machine gun position abandoned and subsequently occupied it.|$|E
