5|$|During Roman times, Volubilis {{was a major}} {{producer}} of olive oil. The remains of buildings dedicated to olive pressing are still readily visible, as are {{the remains of the}} original presses and olive mills. One such building has been reconstructed with a full-size replica of a Roman olive press. Olive oil was central {{to the life of the}} city, as it was not just a foodstuff but was also used <b>for</b> <b>lamps,</b> bathing and medicines, while the pressed olives were fed to animals or dried out and used as fuel for the bathhouses. For this reason, even some of the grandest mansions had their own olive presses. Fifty-eight oil-pressing complexes have so far been discovered in Volubilis. They housed a standard set of elements: a mill, used to crush the olives, a decantation basin to catch the oil from pressed olives, and a press that comprised a counterweight, a prelum or cross-bar and the wooden supports within which the prelum was fixed. The olives were first crushed into a paste, then put into woven baskets that were subjected to pressing. The olive oil ran out into the decantation basin, to which water was periodically added to make the lighter oil float to the surface. This was then scooped out of the basin and poured into amphorae. There is also substantial evidence of the city being a lively commercial centre. No fewer than 121 shops have been identified so far, many of them bakeries, and judging from the number of bronzes found at the site it may also have been a centre for the production or distribution of bronze artworks.|$|E

25|$|Icons {{are often}} {{illuminated}} by a candle or oil lamp. (Beeswax for candles {{and olive oil}} <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> are preferred because they are natural and burn cleanly.) Besides the practical purpose of making icons visible in an otherwise dark church, both candles and oil lamps symbolise the Light of the World, who is Christ.|$|E
25|$|International UN Regulations {{explicitly}} permit vehicle signal lamps with intensity automatically increased during bright {{daylight hours}} when sunlight reduces {{the effectiveness of}} the stop lamps, and automatically decreased during hours of darkness when glare could be a concern. Both US and UN regulations contain provisions for determining the minimum and maximum acceptable intensity <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> that contain more than a single light source.|$|E
25|$|Baku's largest {{industry}} is petroleum, and its petroleum exports {{make it a}} large contributor to Azerbaijan's balance of payments. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku. By the 15th century, oil <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> was obtained from hand-dug surface wells.|$|E

25|$|The 5-amp {{version of}} BS 546 is {{sometimes}} used <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> {{controlled by a}} central switch or dimmer. They may {{also be used for}} other specialist purposes. It is therefore, not advisable to connect an appliance to such a socket outlet and tourists should not use adaptors to connect to them if they are present in hotel bedrooms. They are exclusively for lighting or specialist purposes.|$|E
25|$|A rapid start ballast applies voltage and heats the cathodes simultaneously. It {{provides}} superior lamp {{life and}} more cycle life, but uses slightly more energy as the electrodes in {{each end of}} the lamp continue to consume heating power as the lamp operates. Again, although popular in 100-120volt countries <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> of 40W and above, rapid start is sometimes used in other countries particularly where the flicker of switch start systems is undesirable.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the power}} that would be lost, {{resistors}} are not used as ballasts <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> of more than about two watts. Instead, a reactance is used. Losses in the ballast due to its resistance and losses in its magnetic core may be significant, {{on the order of}} 5 to 25% of the lamp input electric power. Practical lighting design calculations must allow for ballast loss in estimating the running cost of a lighting installation.|$|E

25|$|To {{deal with}} the problem of having to compare light sources of {{different}} correlated color temperatures (CCT), the CIE settled on using a reference black body with the same color temperature <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> with a CCT of under 5000K, or a phase of CIE standard illuminant D (daylight) otherwise. This presented a continuous range of color temperatures to choose a reference from. Any chromaticity difference between the source and reference illuminants were to be abridged with a von Kries-type chromatic adaptation transform.|$|E
25|$|Objections to {{replacement}} of incandescent lamps for general lighting mainly include the higher purchasing cost of alternative light bulbs. To mitigate {{the effects of}} these concerns, various programs have been put in place ranging from subsidies <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> to improved standards for measurement of performance and for labelling products. Manufacturers develop fluorescent lamps with reduced mercury content compared to original designs, and recycling programs are intended to prevent mercury release. New lamp types offer improved starting characteristics, and dimmable types are available.|$|E
25|$|During {{ordinary}} operation, the tungsten of the filament evaporates; hotter, more-efficient filaments evaporate faster. Because of this, {{the lifetime}} of a filament lamp is a trade-off between efficiency and longevity. The trade-off is typically set to provide a lifetime of several hundred to 2,000 hours <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> used for general illumination. Theatrical, photographic, and projection lamps may have a useful life {{of only a few}} hours, trading life expectancy for high output in a compact form. Long-life general service lamps have lower efficiency but are used where the cost of changing the lamp is high compared to the value of energy used.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{developed}} an extendable open-source Loop-mediated isothermal AMPlification (LAMP) signature design program called LAVA (LAMP Assay Versatile Analysis). LAVA {{was created in}} response to limitations of existing LAMP signature programs. Results LAVA identifies combinations of six primer regions <b>for</b> basic <b>LAMP</b> signatures, or combinations of eight primer regions <b>for</b> <b>LAMP</b> signatures with loop primers, {{which can be used}} as LAMP signatures. The identified primers are conserved among target organism sequences. Primer combinations are optimized based on lengths, melting temperatures, and spacing among primer sites. We compare <b>LAMP</b> signature candidates <b>for</b> Staphylococcus aureus created both by LAVA and by PrimerExplorer. We also include signatures from a sample run targeting all strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Conclusions We have designed and demonstrated new software for identifying signature candidates appropriate <b>for</b> <b>LAMP</b> assays. The software is available for download at [URL]. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{second problem}} {{may be related to}} the {{difficulty}} in the designing of LAMP primers. This problem can be alleviated by using a special software, called Primer Explorer (primerexplorer.jp/e/), which is designed specifically <b>for</b> <b>LAMP</b> primers.|$|R

25|$|An instant start ballast {{does not}} preheat the electrodes, instead using a {{relatively}} high voltage (~600V) to initiate the discharge arc. It is the most energy efficient type, but yields the fewest lamp-start cycles, as material is blasted {{from the surface of}} the cold electrodes each time the lamp is turned on. Instant-start ballasts are best suited to applications with long duty cycles, where the lamps are not frequently turned on and off. Although these were mostly used in countries with 100-120volt mains supplies (<b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> of 40W or above), they were briefly popular in other countries because the lamp started without the flicker of switch start systems. The popularity was short lived because of the short lamp life.|$|E
25|$|Inuit {{seal hunting}} {{accounts}} {{for the majority of}} the seal hunt, but just three percent of the hunt in southern Canada; it is excluded from the European Commission's call in 2006 for a ban on the import, export and sale of all harp and hooded seal products. Ringed seals were once the main staple for food, and have been used for clothing, boots, fuel <b>for</b> <b>lamps,</b> as delicacy, containers, igloo windows, and in harnesses for huskies. Though no longer used to this extent, ringed seals are still an important food and clothing source for the people of Nunavut. Called nayiq by the Central Alaskan Yup'ik people, the ringed seal is also hunted and eaten in Alaska.|$|E
25|$|The {{market economy}} {{was based on}} extracting and {{processing}} natural resource and agricultural products for local consumption, such as mining, gristmills and sawmills, and the export of agricultural products. The most important agricultural exports were raw and processed feed grains (wheat, Indian corn, rice, bread and flour) and tobacco. Tobacco was a major crop in the Chesapeake Bay region and rice a major crop in South Carolina. Dried and salted fish was also a significant export. North Carolina was the leading producer of naval stores, which included turpentine (used <b>for</b> <b>lamps),</b> rosin (candles and soap), tar (rope and wood preservative) and pitch (ships' hulls). Another export was potash, which was derived from hardwood ashes and {{was used as a}} fertilizer and for making soap and glass.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the higher}} {{efficiency}} of the ballast itself and the higher lamp efficacy at higher frequency, electronic ballasts offer higher system efficacy <b>for</b> low pressure <b>lamps</b> like the fluorescent <b>lamp.</b> <b>For</b> HID <b>lamps,</b> there is no improvement of the lamp efficacy in using higher frequency, but <b>for</b> these <b>lamps</b> the ballast losses are lower at higher frequencies and also the light depreciation is lower, meaning the lamp produces more light over its entire lifespan.

50|$|America faced a {{shortage}} of oil - whale oil. Despite a steadily growing fleet of whaling ships, the American whaling industry could not satisfy the demand <b>for</b> <b>lamp</b> oil; the price had risen considerably, and the country imported increasing amounts of whale oil.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} colonial period, Massachusetts {{leveraged}} its strong seafaring tradition, advanced shipbuilding industry, {{and access to the}} oceans to make the U.S. the pre-eminent whaling nation in the world by the 1830s. Whale oil was in demand chiefly <b>for</b> <b>lamps.</b> By the 1750s whaling in Nantucket had become a highly lucrative deep-sea industry, with voyages extending for years at a time and with vessels traveling as far as South Pacific waters. The British Navy captured most of the whalers during the revolution, {{but at the same time}} many whalers refitted out as privateers against the British. Whaling recovered after the war as New Bedford became the center. Whalers took greater economic risks to turn major profits: expanding their hunting grounds and securing foreign and domestic workforces for the Pacific. Investment decisions and financing arrangements were set up so that managers of whaling ventures shared their risks by selling some equity claims but retained a substantial portion due to moral hazard considerations. As a result, they had little incentive to consider the correlation between their own returns and those of others in planning their voyages. This stifled diversity in whaling voyages and increased industry-wide risk. After 1860 kerosene replaced whale oil—concurrent with the devastation of the whaling fleet by Confederate commerce raiders—and the entrepreneurs shifted to manufacturing.|$|E
2500|$|A {{true colour}} {{temperature}} {{is characteristic of}} black-body radiation; a fluorescent lamp may approximate the radiation of a black body at a given temperature, but will not have an identical spectrum. In particular, narrow bands of shorter-wavelength radiation are usually present even <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> of low color temperature ("warm" [...] light).|$|E
2500|$|According to the German clergyman and orient pilgrim Ludolf von Sudheim, {{the keys}} of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre were in {{hands of the}} [...] "ancient Georgians" [...] and the food, alms, candles and oil <b>for</b> <b>lamps</b> were given them by the pilgrims in the south door of the church.|$|E

2500|$|Early road {{vehicles}} used fuelled lamps, before {{the availability of}} electric lighting. The Ford Model T used carbide <b>lamps</b> <b>for</b> headlamps and oil <b>lamps</b> <b>for</b> tail <b>lamps.</b> It did not have all-electric lighting as a standard feature until several years after introduction. Dynamos for automobile headlamps were first fitted around 1908 and became commonplace in 1920s automobiles.|$|R
