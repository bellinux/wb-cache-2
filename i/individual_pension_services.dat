40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the nexus between pension funds'' balance sheet liabilities, {{reflecting}} their age profile and payments obligations, and the investment behavior and costs of these funds. The context of the analysis is the stringent regulatory framework and the highly fragmented and heterogeneous pension fund landscape in Switzerland. Detailed data from the Swiss Pension Statistic are analyzed using multivariate OLS-regressions. The evidence shows that a younger age structure and lower short-term benefits payouts are related to a higher share of equities and lower real estate holdings. Legal form, pension plan type, and size are important for administrative costs. The findings {{support the view that}} aging may lead to increased risk aversion and thus to a lower engagement of institutional investors in equities.

40|$|The {{returns from}} <b>individual</b> {{accounts}} in <b>pension</b> schemes {{are subject to}} fluctuations in capital markets. This increases income uncertainty for the beneficiary and exposes individuals {{to the risk of}} fluctuations in the economy in general, and of the stock market in particular. This fact has recently gotten considerable attention from policymakers. A minimum pension guarantee is a way to avoid this pitfall by providing a minimum annuity regardless of the actual investment performance of individual accounts. In this study, we present a cost analysis of a minimum benefit guarantee mechanism for the <b>Individual</b> <b>Pension</b> System in Turkey, a privately managed defined contribution scheme which was introduced in 2003 as a complement to the traditional pay-as-you-go system. We examine the cost estimates and the probability of guaranteed payoffs under various economic and demographic assumptions.

I confirm a replacement effect of social security on saving {{for all types of}} households and on <b>individual</b> <b>pensions</b> for self-employed households only. This suggests that the social security assets of self-employed households are less than their optimal level of annuitized assets and that they would increase their demand for individual pen-sions if social security benefits were to be reduced. 1...|$|R

40|$|Variations {{among the}} diverse pension {{systems in the}} member states of the European Union (EU) hamper labor market {{mobility}} across national borders and also among firms within {{the countries of the}} EU. From a macroeconomic perspective, and in the light of demographic pressure, this paper argues that allowing <b>individual</b> <b>pension</b> accounts instead of collective pension plans would greatly improve labor market flexibility and would thus enhance the functioning of the monetary union. I argue that working citizens would benefit by having their pension funds accumulating in <b>individual</b> <b>pension</b> savings accounts for three reasons. First, citizens would have a clear picture of the accumulation of their own pension savings throughout their working lives. Second, they would pay minimal extra costs, and third, they would not be subject to the whims of governments or other pension fund managers after they retired. This paper investigates the feasibility of <b>individual</b> <b>pension</b> accumulation plans under various parameter settings by calculating the value of the pension saved during a working life and the amount of the pension dis-saved after retirement. The findings show that there are no reasons why the EU and the individual member states should not allow <b>individual</b> <b>pension</b> savings accounts. This approach, as an alternative to forcing workers to participate in one of the various mandatory collective pension schemes that exist in different countries in the EU, would have macroeconomic benefits and would also provide a solid pension program that can enhance mobility...|$|R

As noted above, only {{individuals}} who voluntarily buy <b>individual</b> <b>pension</b> contracts or who are covered by an occupational pension plan will have roughly the same income replacement that the pre- 2001 system offered. Given the increase in atypical employment and the tendency of low-income and atypical workers to not buy <b>individual</b> <b>pension</b> coverage, the retirement income gap between those in full-time, standard employment and those in atypical employment is likely to increase.
