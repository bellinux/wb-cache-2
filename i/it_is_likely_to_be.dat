5|$|The Fortingall Yew is {{an ancient}} tree in the churchyard of the village of Fortingall in Perthshire. Various {{estimates}} have put its age at between 2,000 and 5,000 years; recent research into yew tree ages suggests that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nearer the lower limit of 2,000 years. This still makes it the oldest tree in Europe, although there is an older Norway Spruce root system in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The white, porous {{hymenium}} has a {{thickness of}} 1–2mm and turns brown when bruised. Per millimeter, {{there are two}} to three square pores. When dried, the hymenium's color becomes pinkish-brown. The hymenium extends slightly down the stipe, and is sharply defined. Dried tissue smells similar to fenugreek. The morphology of the mycorrhiza {{has not yet been}} described; however, as with all other types of Boletopsis <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ectomycorrhizal.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen narcosis more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> longer than for alcohol.|$|E
5|$|The African species' {{breeding}} habitat {{consists of}} forested rivers with islands with sandy shores for breeding. The nesting {{grounds of the}} white-eyed river martin are unknown, but if the breeding habitat resembles that of its relative, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the forested valleys of large rivers, which can provide sandbars and islands for nesting, and woodland over which the birds can catch insect prey. The African river martin uses coastal savannah as its winter habitat. Based on its only known wintering site, the non-breeding habitat of the white-eyed {{is assumed to be}} in the vicinity of open fresh water for feeding, with reed-beds for the night-time roost.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of occupation from the Neolithic period in Cheddar. Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, Cheddar Man, estimated to be 9,000 years old, was found in Cheddar Gorge in 1903. Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era (12,000–13,000 years ago) have been found. There is some evidence of a Bronze Age field system at the Batts Combe quarry site. There is also evidence of Bronze Age barrows at the mound in the Longwood valley, which if man-made <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a field system. The remains of a Roman villa have been excavated in {{the grounds of the}} current vicarage.|$|E

5|$|Following the Norman conquest, William the Conqueror {{granted the}} Earldom of Lancaster to Roger de Poictou {{who in turn}} granted the barony of Widnes to Yorfrid. Yorfrid had no sons and his elder {{daughter}} married William FitzNigel, the second Baron of Halton. On Yorfrid's death the barony of Widnes passed to that of Halton. The current St. Luke's, a Norman church, was built in Farnworth. Its date of origin is uncertain but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> around 1180. In 1500 the South Chapel {{was added to the}} church and in 1507 a grammar school was established in Farnworth; both were endowments from Bishop William Smyth. Until the middle of the 19th century the area consisted of the scattered hamlets of Farnworth, Appleton, Ditton, Upton and Woodend. Nearby were the villages of Cronton and Cuerdley.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} {{what part of the}} tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs {{and symptoms}} are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76–100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood has been found in up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The patient may exhibit dysphonia or have diminished breath sounds, and rapid breathing is common. Coughing may be present, and stridor, an abnormal, high-pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the upper airway can also occur.|$|E

25|$|The {{process can}} break down organic poisons, due to {{breaking}} chemical bonds and destroying the molecular shape {{needed for the}} poison's activity. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly effective at killing pathogens, including prions. It can also safely remove heavy metals from the samples by converting them from their ionized or organometallic forms to their stable oxides which can be safely separated from the other products.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{test results}} {{support the view that}} {{congenital}} amusia is hereditary. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> influenced by several genes that interact to increase an individual's susceptibility to its development. However, the fact that the offspring have a lower risk of developing congenital amusia shows that it can be less prevalent when the musical environment is enriched. This stresses the importance that experience-dependent tuning has in the musical pitch system.|$|E

25|$|Climate {{sensitivity}} {{is defined}} as the amount of global average surface warming following a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the range of 2 to 4.5°C, with a best estimate of about 3°C. This range of values is not a projection of the temperature rise we will see in the 21st century, since the future change in carbon dioxide concentrations is unknown, and factors besides carbon dioxide concentrations affect temperature.|$|E
25|$|The only species <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} {{with is the}} yellow-billed teal, a relatively recent self-introduction first recorded breeding on South Georgia in 1971. The speckled teal also has a yellow bill but differs in being smaller and more compact, with less spotting on the flanks, and having a buff bar {{in front of the}} speculum, a central white stripe on the underwing, and a shorter and less pointed tail.|$|E
25|$|The few {{existing}} photos {{show that}} this species had dark-brown fur and darker wings. Nothing is known about their natural diet; however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> similar to the diet of the closely related lesser short-tailed bat, which eats insects, especially beetles, flies, and moths, as well as flowers, fruit, nectar, and pollen. As a highly endangered member of an ancient evolutionary family, the species is accorded a high ranking on the EDGE list of mammals, sitting fourth.|$|E
