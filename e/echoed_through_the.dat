500|$|In 1990, Boston Globe {{columnist}} Dan Shaughnessy wrote a {{book titled}} The Curse of the Bambino, criticizing the Red Sox {{for the sale of}} Babe Ruth, and publicized the curse. When the Red Sox were at Yankee Stadium during a weekend in September 1990, Yankee fans started to chant [...] "1918!" [...] to taunt the Red Sox, reminding them of the last time they won a World Series. Each time the Red Sox were at Yankee Stadium afterward, demeaning chants of [...] "1918!" [...] <b>echoed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> stadium. Yankee fans also taunted the Red Sox with signs saying [...] "1918!", [...] "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO", pictures of Babe Ruth, and wearing [...] "1918!" [...] T-shirts each time they were at the Stadium.|$|E
2500|$|On Assumption day 15 August 1474, Christians wreaked brutal {{havoc on}} the Jewish dwellers of the Cartellone area of Modica, the {{so-called}} [...] "Strage dell'Assunta" [...] (massacre of the assumption). This episode {{was the first and}} most horrible antisemitic massacre of Sicilian Israelites. During the evening a number of Christians (fomented by fanatic Catholic preachers inspired by the inquisitorial repression) slaughtered about 360 innocents causing a total and fierce devastation in La Giudecca. [...] The incitement that <b>echoed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets was: [...] "Hurrah for Mary! Death to the Jews!" [...] (Viva Maria! Morte ai Giudei!).|$|E
2500|$|Opened in 1957, Tweetsie Railroad {{began as}} an {{excursion}} train ride pulled by steam locomotive #12, the only surviving narrow gauge engine of the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (ET). [...] Built in 1917 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, #12 is a [...] narrow gauge 4-6-0 coal-fired locomotive that was used from 1918 to 1940 to haul passengers and freight over the ET's [...] line running through the Appalachian Mountains from Johnson City to Boone, North Carolina. The name [...] "Tweetsie" [...] {{was given to the}} original East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad by area residents who became accustomed to the shrill [...] "tweet, tweet" [...] of the train whistles that <b>echoed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mountains. [...] The nickname stuck with the railroad and its trains, and became more identifiable than the railroad's original name.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace {{served as}} Secretary of Agriculture until September 1940, after Franklin Roosevelt {{selected}} {{him as his}} running mate on the 1940 presidential ticket. Among party regulars the choice was controversial. The conservative wing of the Democratic Party, many of them Southerners, distrusted Wallace:Wallace was an unreconstructed liberal reformer and New Dealer, qualities that recommended him to Roosevelt. The old guard Democratic Party bosses deeply distrusted Wallace as an apostate Republican and as a doe-eyed mystic who symbolized all that they found objectionable about [...] the hopelessly utopian, market-manipulating, bureaucracy-breeding New Deal. Boos <b>echoed</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> convention hall when Roosevelt's choice of Wallace was announced, and the delegates seemed on the verge of rebellion. It was only after Roosevelt threatened to decline the nomination and Eleanor Roosevelt delivered a conciliatory speech that they grudgingly yielded. Wallace received the support of 626.3 votes (around 59% of the 1100 delegates) when nominated at the convention, compared to 329.6 votes for Speaker of the House William B. Bankhead of Alabama (who incidentally died only months after the 1940 Democratic National Convention).|$|E
