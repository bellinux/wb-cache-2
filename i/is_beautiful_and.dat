5|$|Time {{is viewed}} as unredeemable and problematic, whereas eternity <b>is</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>and</b> true. Living under time's {{influence}} is a problem. Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in between life and death in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget the past and care only about the present and the future. The present is capable of always reminding one of the past. These moments also rely on the idea of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E

A German fan of her work said, [...] "There emanates from her paintings a light-hearted optimism; the world she shows us <b>is</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>and</b> it is good. You feel at home in all these pictures, and you know their meaning. The unrest and the neurotic insecurity of the present day make us inclined to enjoy the simple and affirmative outlook of Grandma Moses." ...|$|E

500|$|The journal, which {{switches}} {{between the}} first-person singular and plural but never identifies its narrators, describes Percy, Mary, and Claire's 1814 six-week tour across the Continent. It is divided by country: France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. After the group arrives in Calais {{and proceeds to}} Paris, they decide on a plan: [...] "After talking over and rejecting many plans, we fixed on one eccentric enough, but which, from its romance, was very pleasing to us. In England {{we could not have}} put it in execution without sustaining continual insult and impertinence: the French are far more tolerant of the vagaries of their neighbours. We resolved to walk through France". Each day they enter a new town; but even while travelling, they spend time writing and reading. The journal comments on the people they meet, the countryside, and the current events that have shaped the environment. Some of what they see <b>is</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>and</b> some is [...] "barren and wretched". Percy sprains his ankle, which becomes an increasing problem—the group is forced to hire a carriage. By the time the trio reaches Lucerne, they are nearly out of money and decide to return home. They return by boat along the Rhine, the cheapest mode of travel. Despite problems with unreliable boats and dangerous waters, they see some beautiful scenery before landing in England.|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} media outlets.

Sam Lansky from Idolator website complimented Aguilera's [...] "charming sense of humor" [...] and deemed [...] "Your Body" [...] as one of Aguilera's best music videos. Writing for Billboard, Jason Lipshut noted the video seemed to be inspired by the unending stream of violence on TV, but felt that Aguilera's clothing style in the video was the standout part. In {{a review of the}} video for Yahoo! Music, Lyndsey Park complimented the cultural references in the video, writing that [...] "it's enough to make even Seth MacFarlane or Dennis Miller's heads spin. And yet, somehow, it's all so very, very Xtina". Marc Hogan of Spin wrote that [...] "It might take us a few more viewings to get the joke, but at least there's enough amazing absurdity going on to make that prospect sound entertaining".

500|$|Critics {{compared}} Korkoro to Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List {{because of}} the sacrifices [...] Rosier made to protect the Romani from the Nazis. A review in Moving Pictures Network called it [...] "Schindler's List minus the happy ending", citing a lack of comic relief, creating an inability {{to connect with the}} audience. The opening scene, a close-up shot of barbed wire fences stretched along wooden posts with internment camp barracks in the background, is an image common to many Holocaust films, wrote Scott Tobias, who also commented on the [...] "Schindlerian" [...] actions of Rosier who gives his home to the Romani—an assessment backed up by Eric Hynes's review in Time Out, New York. Sophie Benamon at L'Express observed that Gatlif dealt with the horrors of the Holocaust by hinting at them through symbolism, such as portraying an abandoned child, suggesting imprisoned parents, and a clock with Hebrew markings seen lying abandoned {{in the middle of the}} railroad tracks, implying the passage of a train taking Jews to a ghetto. Jr Glens Heath, writing forSlant Magazine, remarked that Gatlif's characterisation of the incomplete historic archives with which he was presented made the film a very [...] "personal WWII historiography", where the characters [...] "transcend victimisation" [...] rather than mire themselves in melodrama, regarded as a typical Holocaust movie characteristic. Michael Nordine wrote for Hammer to Nail that this film cannot be compared with Life <b>is</b> <b>Beautiful</b> <b>and</b> other [...] "uplifting tales" [...] with Holocaust themes because of its straightforward portrayal of realistic events.|$|E
