60|$|The {{immediate}} {{business was}} the systematic {{exploitation of the}} fact that Trafford had worked out the problem of synthesizing indiarubber. He had done so with an entire indifference to the commercial possibilities of the case, because he had been irritated by the enormous publicity given to Behrens' assertion that he had achieved this long-sought end. Of course the production of artificial rubbers and rubber-like substances {{had been one of the}} activities of the synthetic chemist for many years, from the appearance of Tilden's <b>isoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> onward, and there was already a formidable list of collaterals, dimethybutadiene, and so forth, by which the coveted goal could be approached. Behrens had boldly added to this list as his own a number of variations upon a theme of Trafford's, originally designed to settle certain curiosities about elasticity. Behrens' products were not only more massively rubber-like than anything that had gone before them, but also extremely cheap to produce, and his bold announcement of success had produced a check in rubber sales and widespread depression in the quiveringly sensitive market of plantation shares. Solomonson had consulted Trafford about this matter at Vevey, and had heard with infinite astonishment that Trafford had already roughly prepared and was proposing to complete and publish, unpatented and absolutely unprotected, first a smashing demonstration of the unsoundness of Behrens' claim and then a lucid exposition of just what had to be done and what could be done to make an indiarubber absolutely indistinguishable from the natural product. The business man could not believe his ears.|$|E
5000|$|Butyl rubber is a {{synthetic}} rubber, a copolymer of isobutylene with isoprene. The abbreviation IIR stands for isobutylene <b>isoprene</b> <b>rubber.</b> Polyisobutylene, {{also known as}} [...] "PIB" [...] or polyisobutene, (C4H8)n, is the homopolymer of isobutylene, or 2-methyl-1-propene, on which butyl rubber is based. Butyl rubber is produced by polymerization of about 98% of isobutylene with about 2% of isoprene. Structurally, polyisobutylene resembles polypropylene, having two methyl groups substituted on every other carbon atom. Polyisobutylene is a colorless to light yellow viscoelastic material. It is generally odorless and tasteless, though it may exhibit a slight characteristic odor.|$|E

Organic–inorganic hybrid materials with a silica content up to 70 phr were obtained with the complete con- version of TEOS to silica for a long enough sol–gel reac- tion time. A very homogeneous dispersion of silica particles was observed in all cases together with a very good adhesion between the filler and matrix. The size of the in situ generated silica was controlled by the appropri- ate addition of octyltriethoxysilane.

This result emphasizes that proteins do not influence the affinity between NR and CNTs, while the linked phospholipids interact with CNT surface through cation- linkage.

The beginning of elution was very similar to SR but, after a certain elution volume, the molar masses of the eluting macromolecules increased with elution volume instead of continuing to decrease, which resulted in an upturn curve profile. Adding tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBABr) to THF (solvent and mobile phase) removed this phenomenon. In addition. using different concentrations of TBABr showed that TBABr had two simultaneous actions. TBABr reduced the abnormal elution profiles and the quantity of aggregates (insoluble part or gel). These results mean that the main phenomenon involved in abnormal elution was delayed entities adsorbing on the column packing.

40|$|Objectives. The {{main idea}} {{of the present study}} was the {{production}} of polymer composites based on synthetic isoprene elastomer and low-density polyethylene containing nanoparticles of carbon black and aluminium in various amounts. Methods. An exponential approach was used throughout the study to better control the region of small additives; this control was impossible to achieve using a linear distribution of nanofillers among the small additives. The composites were filled with nanosized aluminium and DG- 100 carbon black particles with a specific adsorption surface of 100 m 2 /g and having an average particle size of 20 - 30 nm. Electrophysical parameters were measured by conventional techniques of electron microscopy, electron shadow microscopy and hydrostatic weighing. Maxwell-Wagner theory and polarisation model were applied. Results. For a composite containing 80 % of <b>isoprene</b> synthetic <b>rubber</b> (SCI- 3) and 20 % of low-density polyethylene, the dielectric permeability and specific volume resistivity dependences were studied experimentally and their graphs were plotted against the concentration of nanosized particles of aluminium and carbon black fillers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{reinforcement}} of elastomers {{by the addition}} of fillers {{is one of the most}} important aspects in rubber science and technology. In order to optimise the filler – polymer interface, innovative in situ generation of silica within <b>isoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> was carried out by means of a bottom-up approach through a sol – gel process starting from tetraethoxysilane as silica precursor. The main aim was the study of the effect of the silica concentration and of the presence of coupling agent on the morphology and the dynamic mechanical behaviour of the composites. RESULTS: The in situ generated silica particles were homogeneously dispersed in the vulcanised rubber with dimensions from a few nanometres to the submicrometre scale. In the presence of coupling agent a good polymer – filler adhesion was observed. The dynamic mechanical behaviour was nonlinear for silica contents higher than 20 wt%. In this range of compositions silica exerted a marked reinforcement on the low-amplitude storage modulus, which is related to the silica content according to the Huber–Vilgis model. CONCLUSION: <b>Isoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> can be effectively reinforced by the in situ generation of silica for silica contents higher than 20 wt%, and the interaction at the silica – rubber interface can be optimised by using suitable coupling agents...|$|E

The test for each condition lasted for 30 days at 40 °C. The results showed that SBR and NR had poor chemical resistance leading to formation of amides on their surfaces and resulting in high mass change.

The {{aim of the research}} was to elu- cidate the effect of the preparation conditions on the structural and morphological characteristics of silica and the resulting mechanical reinforcement. The structure of the in situ generated silica was analyzed by 29 Si high-reso- lution solid-state NMR spectroscopy, which evidenced a high condensation degree of TEOS that decreased with increasing the sol–gel reaction time. The silica dispersion became less homogeneous as the TEOS content and the reaction time were increased. The incorporation of a cou- pling agent (OTES, octyltriethoxysilane) in the reaction mixture promoted full conversion of TEOS. Lower particle size, better silica dispersion, and higher filler-matrix adhe- sion were noticed if the incorporation of OTES was delayed compared to TEOS. Uniaxial tensile tests evi- denced that the tensile strength typically increased in the first 60 min of reaction and then leveled off. A similar behavior was observed for the high deformation stiffness, whereas at low deformations, the stiffness increased monotonically with the reaction time. In the vulcanizates with silica contents higher than 25 wt %, a drastic stiffness decrement was observed passing from low to high defor- mations.

A chemical analysis (mainly performed with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy technique) is developed in order to measure the aluminum and aluminum oxide content in the quench-collected agglomerates, and to evaluate the combustion efficiency. A X-ray Diffraction technique allows to investigate the CCPs crystalline structure. Under the explored operating conditions, the results confirm that nano-aluminized propellants show larger steady burning rate, without significant change in pressure sensitivity, and lower aggregation / agglomeration phenomena in combustion products. Combustion efficiency is in turn favored by those factors reducing the importance of aggregation / agglomeration phenomena in the combustion process...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{sequence of}} the circular 101, 016 -bp megaplasmid pKB 1 from the cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene-degrading bacterium Gordonia westfalica Kb 1, which represents the first described extrachromosomal DNA {{of a member of}} this genus, was determined. Plasmid pKB 1 harbors 105 open reading frames. The predicted products of 46 of these are significantly related to proteins of known function. Plasmid pKB 1 is organized into three functional regions that are flanked by insertion sequence (IS) elements: (i) a replication and putative partitioning region, (ii) a putative metabolic region, and (iii) a large putative conjugative transfer region, which is interrupted by an additional IS element. Southern hybridization experiments revealed the presence of another copy of this conjugational transfer region on the bacterial chromosome. The origin of replication (oriV) of pKB 1 was identified and used for construction of Escherichia coli-Gordonia shuttle vectors, which was also suitable for several other Gordonia species and related genera. The metabolic region included the heavy-metal resistance gene cadA, encoding a P-type ATPase. Expression of cadA in E. coli mediated resistance to cadmium, but not to zinc, and decreased the cellular content of cadmium in this host. When G. westfalica strain Kb 1 was cured of plasmid pKB 1, the resulting derivative strains exhibited slightly decreased cadmium resistance. Furthermore, they had lost the ability to use <b>isoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> as a sole source of carbon and energy, suggesting that genes essential for rubber degradation are encoded by pKB 1...|$|E
40|$|Rubber-degrading {{activity}} {{was found in}} the extracellular culture medium of Xanthomonas sp. strain 35 Y which was grown on natural rubber latex. Natural rubber in the latex state was degraded by the crude enzyme, and two fractions were separately observed by gel permeation chromatography of the reaction products. One fraction was of higher molecular weight (HMW) with a very wide MW distribution from 103 to 105, and the other fraction was of lower molecular weight (LMW) with a MW of a few hundred. 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the partially purified fractions were those expected of cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene mixtures with the structure OHC-CH 2 -(-CH 2 -C(-CH 3) = CH-CH 2 -) n-CH 2 -C(=O) -CH 3, with average values of n of about 113 and 2 for HMW and LMW fractions, respectively. The LMW fraction consisted mostly of one component in gas-liquid chromatography as well as in gel permeation chromatography, and the main component was identified as 12 -oxo- 4, 8 -dimethyl trideca- 4, 8 -diene- 1 -al (acetonyl diprenyl acetoaldehyde, AlP 2 At) by 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance and gas chromatography-mass spectra. Not only the latices of natural and synthetic <b>isoprene</b> <b>rubber,</b> but also some kinds of low-MW polyisoprene compounds of cis- 1, 4 type, were degraded by the crude enzyme. The rubber-degrading reaction was found to be at least partly oxygenase catalyzed from the incorporation of 18 O into AlP 2 At under an 18 O 2 atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Halogenated {{graphite}} CBr(x) I(y) (I {{less than}} y/x less than 10) {{was made by}} exposing graphite materials to either pure Br 2 or an I 2 /Br 2 /HBr mixture to initiate the reaction, and then to iodine vapor containing {{a small amount of}} Br 2 /HBr/IBr to complete the intercalation reaction. Wetting of the graphite materials by the I 2 /Br 2 /HBr mixture is needed to start the reaction, and a small amount of Br 2 /HBr/IBr is needed to complete the charge transfer between iodine and carbon. The interplanar spacings for the graphite materials need to be in the 3. 35 to 3. 41 A range. The X-ray diffraction data obtained from the halogenated HOPG indicate that the distance between the two carbon layers containing intercalate is 7. 25 A. Electrical resistivity of the fiber product is from 3 to 6. 5 times the pristine value, The presence of a small amount of <b>isoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> in the reaction significantly increased the iodine-to-bromine ratio in the product. In this reaction, rubber is known to generate HBr and to slowly remove bromine from the vapor. The halogenation generally caused a 22 percent to 25 percent weight increase. The halogens were found uniformly distributed in the product interior. However, although the surface contains very little iodine, it has high concentrations of bromine and oxygen. It is believed that the high concentrations of bromine and oxygen in this surface cause the halogenated fiber to be more resistant to structural damage during subsequent fluorination to fabricate graphite fluoride fibers...|$|E
