40|$|Softmax <b>GAN</b> <b>is</b> a novel {{variant of}} Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The key idea of Softmax <b>GAN</b> <b>is</b> {{to replace the}} {{classification}} loss in the original GAN with a softmax cross-entropy loss in the sample space of one single batch. In the adversarial learning of N real training samples and M generated samples, the target of discriminator training is to distribute all the probability mass to the real samples, each with probability 1 /M, and distribute zero probability to generated data. In the generator training phase, the target is to assign equal probability to all data points in the batch, each with probability 1 /M+N. While the original <b>GAN</b> <b>is</b> closely related to Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE), we show that Softmax <b>GAN</b> <b>is</b> the Importance Sampling version of GAN. We futher demonstrate with experiments that this simple change stabilizes GAN training. Comment: NIPS 2017 submissio...|$|R

30|$|Elasto-plastic {{mechanical}} deformation {{behaviors of}} c-plane (0001) and nonpolar <b>GaN</b> single crystals <b>are</b> studied using nanoindentation, cathodoluminescence, and transmission electron microscopy. Nanoindentation tests show that c-plane <b>GaN</b> <b>is</b> {{less susceptible to}} plastic deformation and has higher hardness and Young's modulus than the nonpolar GaN. Cathodoluminescence and transmission electron microscopy characterizations of indent-induced plastic deformation reveal {{that there are two}} primary slip systems for the c-plane <b>GaN,</b> while there <b>is</b> only one most favorable slip system for the nonplane GaN.

40|$|Stability and {{electronic}} properties of atomic layers of <b>GaN</b> <b>are</b> investigated {{in the framework}} of the van der Waals-density functional theory. We find that the ground state of the layered <b>GaN</b> <b>is</b> a planar graphene-like configuration rather than a buckled bulk-like configuration. Application of an external perpendicular electric field to the layered GaN induces distinct stacking-dependent features of the tunability of the band gap; the band gap of the monolayer does not change whereas that of the trilayer <b>GaN</b> <b>is</b> significantly reduced for the applied field of 0. 4 V/ Å. It is suggested that such a stacking-dependent tunability of the band gap in the presence of an applied field may lead to novel applications of the devices based on the layered GaN...|$|R
