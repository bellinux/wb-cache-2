5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked {{nearly all}} the specializations that {{characterized}} later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae {{and a pair of}} tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E

5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> against the sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they always seem to be watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{openings}} {{through the}} head of Bothriolepis: a keyhole opening along the midline on the upper side <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and nostrils and an opening for the mouth on the lower side near the anterior end of the head. A discovery regarding preserved structures {{that appear to be}} nasal capsules confirms the belief that the external nasal openings lay on the dorsal side of the head near the eyes. Additionally, the position of the mouth on the ventral side of the skull is consistent with the typical horizontal resting orientation of Bothriolepis. It had a special feature on its skull, a separate partition of bone below the opening <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and nostrils enclosing the nasal capsules called a preorbital recess.|$|E

The Horsemen of Adal wore protective helmets that covered the entire face except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> and breastplates on their body, while they harnessed their horses in a similar fashion. In siege warfare, ladders were employed to scale buildings and other high positions such as hills and mountains.|$|E
25|$|Spitting is a {{defensive}} reaction only. The snakes tend to aim <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of a perceived threat. A direct hit can cause temporary shock and blindness through severe {{inflammation of the}} cornea and conjunctiva. Although usually there are no serious results if the venom is washed away immediately with plenty of water, blindness can become permanent if left untreated. Brief contact with the skin is not immediately dangerous, but open wounds may be vectors for envenomation.|$|E
25|$|A cricket cap {{is a type}} of soft cap, {{often made}} from felt, that is a {{traditional}} form of headwear for players of the game of cricket, regardless of age or gender. It is usually a tight-fitting skullcap, usually made of six or eight sections, with a small crescent shaped brim that points downwards over the brow to provide shade <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> It is often, but not always, elasticised at the rear to hold it in place upon the wearer's head. Sometimes, rather than tight-fitting, the cricket cap comes in a baggy variety, that is always kept in place by elastic.|$|E

25|$|The gulf-style or full niqab {{completely}} {{covers the}} face.

While a person looking at a woman wearing a niqab with an eyeveil would not be able to see her eyes, the woman wearing the niqab would be able to see out through the thin fabric.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} size and extreme {{immobilization}} some casts, particularly {{those used in}} or before the 1970s, the popular term full body cast {{is something of a}} misnomer. The popular and media-driven conception of a massive cast encasing all four limbs, the trunk, and the head – sometimes leaving only small slits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> nose, and mouth – is a true rarity in recorded medical history, and this type of large scale cast appears more commonly in various Hollywood movies and on television shows. The term body cast (or full body cast) is sometimes casually used by laymen to describe any of a number of body and/or spica casts, from a simple body jacket to a more extensive hip spica.|$|E
25|$|Illustrations of {{theatrical}} masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and a small}} aperture for the mouth, {{as well as an}} integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality. This demonstrates {{the way in which the}} mask was to 'melt' into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role. Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.|$|E

25|$|The {{style in}} which Bouguereau chooses {{to paint the}} {{children}} is articulated and meaningful. Their white flesh is luminous and rosy- a symbol to their purity. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love {{through the use of}} pastels and soft, velvety brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal of a love story. By not using pink and reds, the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. The colors are cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, wispy golden hair, and smoothness of their skin. The painting doesn’t strike the viewer but is a rest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

Slavicek's self-published manual, Yoga <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eyes,</b> was rejected by an ophthalmologist who evaluated it, and evinced no interest from the World Health Organization and St. Erik's Eye Foundation in Sweden as he had not conducted double-blind tests.|$|E

500|$|Batrachotomus had a {{tall and}} narrow skull {{estimated}} at [...] in length. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), two pairs of which were <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> (called orbits) and the nostrils. Behind the orbits were two temporal fenestrae. These holes probably helped to reduce {{the weight of the}} skull and enabled the jaw to open more widely. As a typical archosaur, Batrachotomus had two antorbital fenestrae between the orbits and nostrils, and a fifth pair of small openings at the rear part of the lower jaw.|$|E
