25|$|The Smart Way Reading and Spelling {{program is}} {{presented}} {{in a series of}} twenty-seven individual flip chart lessons. Each flip chart contains a complete lesson that includes both the student and coach materials within one bound booklet. The student sees an image or text {{on one side of the}} flip chart, while the reading coach has his scripted instructions on the other side with a mirror image of what the student sees. The completely scripted nature of the program allows even the most novice coach to work with a student immediately. Extensive training is not necessary. Over time, as the coach becomes more confident, he can add more creativity and interaction in working with students. Rather than stressing individual phonetic rules for the sake of teaching rules, the Smart Way methodology introduces words and word patterns in families, <b>helping</b> <b>students</b> grasp the key phonetic rules through a cognitive learning process. The program was designed as both a complete learning system for youngsters and as an intervention method for older students and adults. Though results will vary, most students will complete each lesson in one to two hours.|$|E

40|$|The Living Consensus {{framework}} includes five key {{teaching and}} learning strategies that are facilitated through student-centred learning. This means that students are involved in activities and discussion during their programme of study. The students are involved in many decisions with the teacher about how we should work together as a class. This way of working with <b>students</b> <b>helps</b> develop personal skills and attitudes that can be transferred to other learning experiences and their future workplaces. These skills include: Independent learning skills that <b>help</b> the <b>students</b> learn to think and act for themselves and show initiative in the workplace. Problem solving skills that <b>help</b> <b>students</b> to think through and solve problems they may see in the work place. Team work will <b>help</b> <b>students</b> to learn to work in teams like they will do in the workplace. Developing an understanding of different cultures and world views will <b>help</b> the <b>students</b> {{to work with people}} from other countries and understand customers from around the world. Developing ethical practice will <b>help</b> <b>students</b> think about and agree on how they should conduct themselves in a global workplace. This will help prepare them for business with people from around the world. Developing self-awareness will <b>help</b> <b>students</b> to notice when they could be doing something better and enable them to self-correct their practice or behaviour when necessary. Self-direction will <b>help</b> <b>students</b> to set and achieve their own goals for learning and the workplace. Employers in New Zealand look for graduates with these skills and attitudes.

They also review and revise techniques to deal with problems of students and in schools to maintain a good, safe setting. They provide consultation and case management by ensuring students’ needs are met; speak out for students {{in and out of the}} school; make sure all people involved with the student are aware of the needs of the student, what resources are available, and how to get the services; aid in the communication between parents, schools, and community services; and modify achievement plans to best meet needs of student. School psychologists seek assistance from community services in mental health, health, and crisis response; educate the public, parents, and schools through trainings on issues facing students and schools. Finally, School Psychologists are experts in research. As noted by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP, 2007) and the American Psychological Association (APA, 2007), school psychologists adhere to the scientist-practitioner framework and make decisions based on empirical research.
