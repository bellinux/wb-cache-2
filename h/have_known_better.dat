5|$|Marie {{noted that}} Dempsey was {{disappointed}} in the lack of tactical flair shown by Brigadier Hinde throughout the battle and that the British should <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>better</b> than to attempt an armoured advance unsupported by infantry in the bocage. The British fought an uncoordinated infantry and tank battle during {{the morning and the}} Germans did much the same throughout the day.|$|E

500|$|Jackson herself would {{comment on}} the album's legacy on her 2015 album Unbreakable. In the song [...] "Shoulda Known Better", she {{reflects}} on her optimistic wish that Rhythm Nation 1814 could have profoundly changed the world, noting that there are many, deeper issues to fix and that broad strokes aren't enough. The chorus includes the line, [...] "Cause I don't want my face to be / That poster child for being naive"; and Rhythm Nations title {{is referred to as}} [...] "an epiphany", with Jackson mentioning that [...] "next time, I'll know better." [...] Album co-producer Jimmy Jam told the BBC: [...] "When you're young, you feel like: 'I can change the world! I'm going to lead the revolution!' And then you look 25 years later and you go: 'OK, I should <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>better.</b> The same problems still exist but there's a different way to go about tackling it. It still involves mobilising people, but I can't do it by myself.' It's just a wiser, more mature look at the reality of trying to make a positive change, a social change." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson and James May {{chose the}} Lexus SC 430 {{as the worst}} car ever built in their film The Worst Car in the History of the World.

2500|$|... "Stars on 45" [...] {{is a song}} {{issued in}} January 1981 by the studio group Stars on 45. In some countries, {{including}} the UK, Ireland and New Zealand, the band was credited as 'Starsound' and the medley itself was named [...] "Stars on 45". Its official title in the US (as on the record and in Billboard) where it was credited to 'Stars on 45' was [...] "Medley: Intro 'Venus' / Sugar Sugar / No Reply / I'll Be Back / Drive My Car / Do You Want to Know a Secret / We Can Work It Out / I Should <b>Have</b> <b>Known</b> <b>Better</b> / Nowhere Man / You're Going to Lose That Girl / Stars on 45". It is (to date) the longest titled song to ever chart in Billboard, and is conveniently shortened to [...] "Stars on 45 Medley", or [...] "'Medley' by Stars on 45". The reason for the long title was copyright requirements {{for the use of}} The Beatles' songs.|$|E
2500|$|Late in {{the evening}} of June 21, Sheriff Thaxton reluctantly agreed {{to go to the}} mine to ensure the truce was carried out and the strikebreakers were given safe passage. Despite being urged to go immediately, he claimed he needed to rest. Thaxton promised to meet Hunter and Major Davis of the Carbondale National Guard company at the sheriff's office at 6 a.m. the {{following}} morning. That evening, Hugh Willis, the local UMWA leader, spoke to union supporters in Herrin. Willis said of the strikebreakers: [...] "God damn them, they ought to <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>better</b> than to come down here; but now that they're here, let them take what's coming to them." [...] Gunfire continued throughout the night, and the mob began destroying equipment to prevent the mine from reopening. They used hammers, shovels, and dynamite to wreck the draglines and bulldozers, while keeping the strikebreakers pinned down inside coal cars and behind barricades.|$|E
60|$|This {{was true}} enough; and Mr. Cranley {{then began to}} give {{a more or less}} fanciful history of Margaret She had been left in his charge by her father, an early acquaintance, a man who <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>better</b> days, but <b>had</b> bequeathed her nothing, save an {{excellent}} schooling and the desire to earn her own livelihood.|$|R
60|$|Adolphe {{had been}} {{hitherto}} contradicted but in few things, {{and thought that}} all difficulty would be prevented by his informing his mother that he wished to marry Marie Clavert. But Marie, with a woman's instinct, <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>better.</b> She <b>had</b> trembled and almost crouched with fear when she confessed her love; and had absolutely hid herself from sight when Adolphe went forth, prepared to ask his mother's consent to his marriage.|$|R

2500|$|Vivian Mercier {{described}} Waiting for Godot as a play which [...] "has {{achieved a}} theoretical impossibility—a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, {{since the second}} act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.". Mercier once questioned Beckett on the language used by the pair: [...] "It seemed to me...he made Didi and Gogo sound {{as if they had}} earned PhDs. 'How do you know they hadn't?' was his reply." [...] They clearly <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>better</b> times, a visit to the Eiffel Tower and grape-harvesting by the Rhône; it is about all either has to say about their pasts, save for Estragon's claim to have been a poet, an explanation Estragon provides to Vladimir for his destitution. In the first stage production, which Beckett oversaw, both are [...] "more shabby-genteel than ragged...Vladimir at least is capable of being scandalised...on a matter of etiquette when Estragon begs for chicken bones or money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tucker {{was born}} in Alexandria, Virginia on June 18, 1913. His father, Samuel A. Tucker, {{a real estate agent}} and NAACP member, and teacher mother saw to his formal and {{informal}} education. Tucker later said: [...] "I got involved {{in the civil rights movement}} on June 18, 1913, in Alexandria. I was born black." [...] Although Alexandria was less segregated that Richmond and Norfolk, it provided no high school for black children, so after graduating from 8th grade, he had to [...] "bootleg" [...] a high school education across the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. at Armstrong High School. Black Virginia children commuted by streetcar. In June 1927, when Tucker was 14, he, 2 brothers and a friend refused to leave their seats after a streetcar crossed the river into Alexandria, despite the request of a white woman who believed one of the seats was designated only for whites. She swore out a warrant charging them with disorderly conduct and abusive language, and the police levied no fine upon the 11 year old Otto Tucker, but fined Samuel Tucker $5 plus court costs and his older brother George $50 plus court costs, claiming that as eldest he should <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>better.</b> However, on appeal, an all-white jury found the young men not guilty.|$|E

6000|$|... "But you'd know, Jonathan," [...] {{continued}} Spriggs, {{turning to}} the other friend of Skulpit's, who {{was sitting on a}} stool by the table, gazing vacantly at the petition. Jonathan Crumple was a meek, mild man, who <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>better</b> days; his means had been wasted by bad children, who had made his life wretched till he had been received into the hospital, of which he had not long been a member. Since that day he <b>had</b> <b>known</b> neither sorrow nor trouble, and this attempt to fill him with new hopes was, indeed, a cruelty.|$|R

5000|$|Shortly {{after his}} arrival in Spain, Lasalle found himself {{involved}} in a duel by sabre. He had been attempting to seduce {{the wife of the}} Captain of Engineering when the captain caught them in flagrante delicto. Lasalle was generous (or cautious) enough not to attack and contented himself with parrying, but he did so with such vigor that it broke the engineer’s wrist. As the engineer was doubled over with fatigue and pain, Lasalle let down a hard blow with the flat edge of his sabre on the man’s back. When it was obvious the engineer could take it no more, Lasalle opted to end the battle by saying, [...] "If you <b>had</b> <b>known</b> me <b>better</b> you would have attached less importance to the fact you have been injured, and if I <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>better,</b> I would <b>have</b> refrained from continuing to fight after you had been injured. Let us finish this fight for it is far too unequal, but because of your actions I now know you are a man of honor." ...|$|R
60|$|The man {{was badly}} frightened. It {{was not so}} much White Fang's ferocity as it was his silence that unnerved the groom. Still {{protecting}} his throat and face with his torn and bleeding arm, he tried to retreat to the barn. And it would have gone hard with him had not Collie appeared on the scene. As she had saved Dick's life, she now saved the groom's. She rushed upon White Fang in frenzied wrath. She had been right. She <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>better</b> than the blundering gods. All her suspicions were justified. Here was the ancient marauder up to his old tricks again.|$|R

60|$|But {{the fact}} that she had refused him carried with it a certain elation. In refusing him she had refused his thirty million dollars. That was going some for a ninety dollar-a-month stenographer who <b>had</b> <b>known</b> <b>better</b> ties. She wasn't after money, that was patent. Every woman he had {{encountered}} had seemed willing to swallow him down for the sake of his money. Why, he had doubled his fortune, made fifteen millions, since the day she first came to work for him, and behold, any willingness to marry him she might have possessed had diminished as his money had increased.|$|R

60|$|However, {{the devil}} is a {{considerable}} personage, who <b>has</b> <b>known</b> <b>better</b> days and <b>has</b> moved {{high up in the}} hierarchy of Celestial Host; but in the hierarchy of mere earthly Dutchmen, Heemskirk, whose early days could not have been very splendid, was merely a naval officer forty years of age, of no particular connections or ability to boast of. He was commanding the Neptun, a little gunboat employed on dreary patrol duty up and down the Archipelago, to look after the traders. Not a very exalted position truly. I tell you, just a common middle-aged lieutenant of some twenty-five years' service and sure to be retired before long--that's all.|$|R

How I managed to gain their confidence and esteem, without alluding to my parentage, it is not worth while to stop to describe.
