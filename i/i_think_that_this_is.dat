2500|$|Translation of Abulafia's poems, as well {{as other}} medieval poems written in Hebrew, {{presents}} some challenges because some words could be interpreted with several meanings. A good example of such challenge is the poem [...] "Figs". Asking a friend for some figs, the poet writes: [...] "end a ripening fig, give a portion for seven of them, even for eight." [...] The next line of the poem was translated as [...] "And in return, here is my flatus." [...] The Hebrew word used in the poem was zemorah that means [...] "vine twig". Howard Tzvi Adelman from Queen's University says that [...] "Zemorah means 'penis' and 'fig,' a reference to 'vagina.' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a sexual and not a scatological reference; both, however, fit the category of the grotesque. The next line—'Henceforth I won't give it to strangers'—could fit either way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2010, Hopkins {{suggested}} that African American fighters who possessed {{what he described}} as a [...] "slick" [...] inner-city style of fighting would be successful against Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao. [...] "Maybe I'm biased because I'm black, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what is said at people's homes and around the dinner table among black boxing fans and fighters. Most of them won't say it [...] because they're not being real and they don't have the balls to say it. But I do think that a fighter like the Ray Leonards or anyone like that would beat a guy [...] if they come with their game. Listen, this ain't a racial thing, but then again, maybe it is. But the style that is embedded in most of us black fighters, that style could be a problem to any other style of fighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje. The president of the republic, Branko Crvenkovski, announced: [...] "If during the ongoing talks we can reach a rational compromise, which from the one side will defend our ethnic identity, and from the other will enable us to receive the NATO invitation, {{while at the same time}} canceling our further EU accession obstacles, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> something that must be supported, and I personally side with the supporters. Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, because we are not in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations. The one who will tell me that the price is high, is obliged to address the public opinion and announce an alternative scenario on how Macedonia will develop in the next ten to fifteen years." ...|$|E
60|$|Should we {{ever see}} them again? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the unspoken {{question}} {{in the hearts of}} the many who were to go by land.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{head and}} a crown will come close together," [...] and she kissed him and named him Rames after her royal forefather, the founder of their line.|$|R
2500|$|Labour MK Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said in May 2013: [...] "whether Assad {{remains in}} power or not, {{is not in}} our hands. We keep hearing {{intelligence}} assessments that {{he is about to}} go down. In my opinion, the current situation is the best one for us. Do the math: the other option is more chaotic, given that those expected to fill the vacuum are al-Qaeda and the Salafist organizations. It is better to face a state, because not having a clear address is much worse for us. There are almost 400 gangs operating in Syria, so with whom do you talk and who do you hold accountable?" [...] Minister for International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said on 10 June 2013 that [...] "I always thought that it might be the case {{that at the end of}} the day Assad, with a very strong Iranian and Hezbollah backing, might gain the upper hand. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> possible and I thought that this is possible already a long time ago. [...] might not just survive but even regain territories." [...] The statement was met with a cool reception by the foreign and defense ministries.|$|E

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{deep down}} {{everyone}} is not having fun right now. People {{are afraid of}} things, the world’s fucked, no one has any money, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> show is a document of friends having fun.--Jordan Kinley ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had only}} just sat down," [...] he told her, as he and Robert held her chair, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the kindest action you ever {{performed}} in your life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Edgar Blagrove!" [...] {{the latter}} exclaimed in astonishment. [...] "Your disguises are endless, sir, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the best of}} them, though why you should have adopted it I do not know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friend Andrew," [...] he said, [...] "you {{have set}} me a puzzle. You have set {{me a good}} many since I used to run errands for you at Eton, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the toughest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For a man working upon such slight data as {{he himself}} confesses," [...] was the quiet comment, [...] "he is damnably accurate. It is as well, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> did not reach Marshal Massena." ...|$|R
2500|$|That's all gonna be deconstructed and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> why <b>this</b> {{regulatory}} {{thing is}} so important." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked hard}} at me: I {{was a new}} face, having just {{replaced}} the chief mate he was accustomed to see; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> novelty inspired him, as things generally did, with deep-seated mistrust.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Tamboosa as he {{surveyed}} the injured and counted the dead, [...] "the curse is quickly at work among us, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> but the beginning of evil. Well, I expected it, no less." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{which ends}} * * <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> all {{that should be}} {{required}} of [...] any Church or member ordinarily to be professed: In general I do [...] believe all that is contained in the sacred canonical Scriptures, and [...] particularly I believe all explicitly contained in the ancient Creed, [...] &c.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir Christopher," [...] she said, [...] "you {{are fast}} wed to the sweetest lady that ever sun or moon shone on, {{and in that}} may hold {{yourself}} a lucky man. Yet such deep joys seldom come without their pain, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> near at hand. There are those who will envy you your fortune, Sir Christopher." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> made an {{impression}} upon Euphemia, for, although she did not speak to me upon the subject (or any other) that night, the next time I heard Pomona reading, the words ran somewhat thus: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You always are," [...] remarked Bickley; [...] "even {{when most}} people's appetites {{might have been}} affected. Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> great plateau was once a landing-place for flying machines, {{and that there is}} the air-shed or garage." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{opinion was}} fully justifiable; but the {{progress}} of investigation has thrown an unexpected light on the question, and has brought us much nearer than could have been anticipated to {{a knowledge of the}} true series of the progenitors of the horse.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{good idea}} if we have time to carry it out, colonel. We have still four or five hours' daylight, and as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> of even greater {{importance}} than the side walls, we will set the tenants to work at once, and it will save time if they take down the sacks, of which, as you say, we have an abundance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way, you cannot cross at Florence, for I {{hear that}} Hood has fallen {{back across the}} river, the forces {{advancing}} against him from this side being too strong to be resisted. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> no disadvantage to you, for {{it would have been}} far more difficult to pass the Federals and get to Florence than to make for some point on the river as far as possible from the contending armies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “There {{are three}} {{separate}} handwritings. Thackeray’s own small upright handwriting; {{that of his}} daughter, now Mrs. Richmond Ritchie, a rather large round handwriting; and that of an amanuensis whose name I do not know. The interest is mainly this, that it shows that Thackeray dictated a considerable part of the book; and, as Mrs. Ritchie tells me, he dictated it without having previously written anything. The copy was sent straight to press as it stands, with, as you will see, remarkably little alteration. As Esmond is {{generally considered to be}} his most perfect work in point of style, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a remarkable fact and adds considerably to the interest of the MS.” ...|$|E
30|$|By {{contrast}} another pathologist wrote: “While I {{would like}} access to toxicology expertise, {{this should be}} through the coroners office and not an MDT setting- ie equivalent to a toxicology consult. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would be rarely required and only deal with the Republic of Ireland jurisdiction”.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did not I {{tell you}} yesterday? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> will happen. <b>I</b> think--but {{who can be}} quite sure of the future, Hafela?--that you and {{the most of your}} army by this hour to-morrow night will be lying fast asleep about this place, with jackals for your bedfellows." ...|$|R
5000|$|This CD also contains, for example, the Osdorp Posse. A {{group that}} raps in Dutch, {{actually}} the Amsterdam dialect. And they also perform the song [...] "Murderer!" [...] Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> does {{not contribute to}} taking hip-hop seriously, {{because it is a}} bit like 'playing ghetto.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now I don't {{of course}} venture {{to say that}} this is {{otherwise}} now; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the best training to make it so. I think that I ought to be gaining strength of purpose, resolution, energy of character, under these circumstances. And observe, what should I be without some such change pressing on me? Just imagine me, such a one as I was at Alfington, alone on an island with twenty-five Melanesian boys, from half as many different islands, to be trained, clothed, brought into orderly habits, &c., the report of our proceedings made in some sort the test of the working of the Mission; and all this to be arranged, ordered, and worked out by me, who found H. B---- and W. P---- a care too great for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{testimony}} of the Duke of Berwick, and of the other honourable and well-known Irish gentlemen, as to the striking likeness between yourself and Mr. James O'Carroll, cannot but carry immense weight {{in the minds of}} all unprejudiced persons. They prove too, conclusively, that James O'Carroll left an infant boy behind him, and the statement of the nurse goes a long way to prove you are that son; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> substantiated by the conduct of John O'Carroll; first in receiving you and undertaking your care; secondly, in the neglect, and I should almost say the dislike, he manifested towards the child he had sheltered; and thirdly, in the extraordinary step that he, a professedly loyal subject of Her Majesty, took in sending you off to enlist in the brigade composed of the devoted adherents of the son of James the Second.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} gladly {{assisted}} your mother before," [...] said Uncle Eugene, [...] "if {{she had asked}} me. I had determined that she must ask me first. I knew that half the money should have been your father's by rights. I was prepared to hand it over to him or his family, if I were asked for it. But I wished to humble his pride, and the Carter pride, {{to the point of}} asking for it. Not a very amiable temper, you will say? I admit it. I am not amiable and I never have been amiable. You must be prepared to find me very unamiable. I see that you are waiting for a chance to say something polite and pleasant on that score, but you may save yourself the trouble. I shall hope and expect to have you visit me often. If your mother and your brothers and sisters see fit to come with you, I shall welcome them also. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> all it is necessary to say just now. Will you stay to tea with me this evening?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} doubt about {{the magnitude of the}} evils which accrue from the steady increase of European armaments; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> regrettable fact is merely the superficial expression of social forces, the operation of which cannot be sensibly affected by agreements between Governments.|$|R
6000|$|... "What did I say;--jolly as a sandboy? There {{is nothing}} wrong in that. What I meant was, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> world {{is a very good}} sort of world, and that a man can get along in it very well, if he minds his p's and q's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Lady Aylmer, {{as soon as}} the {{trotting}} {{horses and}} rolling wheels made noise enough to prevent her words from reaching the servants on the box, [...] "I want {{to say a few words}} to you;--and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> will be a good opportunity." ...|$|R
