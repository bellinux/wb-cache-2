5|$|In many ways, {{life for}} peasants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> during the Song dynasty {{was similar to}} those living in {{previous}} dynasties.

Cases of banditry, which local officials were forced to combat, occurred constantly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside.</b> This, in turn, ensured that literacy was much more widespread than in Western Europe, at least until the twelfth century.

5|$|Unlike most {{livestock}} farming in England at this time, the duck breeders and duck rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were kept on farms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> of the Aylesbury Vale, {{away from the}} polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and meant a higher number of fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countryside</b> or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
