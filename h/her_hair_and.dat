5|$|Sarah's {{relationship}} with her children was strained. Although {{she had a good}} {{relationship with}} her daughter, Anne Spencer, she became estranged from her daughters Henrietta, Elizabeth and Mary. Similarly heartbroken when her favourite daughter Anne died in 1716, Sarah kept her favourite cup, a lock of <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> adopted the Sunderlands' youngest child, Lady Diana, who would later become her favourite granddaughter.|$|E
5|$|The show's co-creators, Fawcett and Graeme Manson, {{along with}} Maslany and <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> makeup artists, {{developed}} {{the character of}} Tony {{over a period of}} six months after deciding that the inclusion of a transgender character would fit well with the show's themes of identity, gender and sexuality. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews: critics praised Maslany's performance but found Tony's character underdeveloped and gimmicky and found the plot disorganised.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell across it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount and type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> on her mantle.|$|E
5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
5|$|Pauline Bonaparte first {{appears on}} the ship of dogs being transported from Cuba to Haiti in Part Two of the novel. She is {{described}} as a beautiful woman who, despite her tender years, is familiar with the male body. She enjoyed tempting the men on board and for that reason would let the wind ruffle <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> breeze through her clothes to reveal the grace of her breasts. She would also sleep out in the open. Pauline has Solimán massage her body and tend to her beauty.

5|$|Suspicion {{continued}} to grow, and Maria's stepmother began talking of dreams that Maria {{had been murdered}} and buried in the Red Barn. On 19 April 1828, she persuaded her husband {{to go to the}} Red Barn and dig in one of the grain storage bins. He quickly uncovered the remains of his daughter buried in a sack. She was badly decomposed but still identifiable. An inquest was carried out at the Cock Inn at Polstead (which still stands today), where Maria was formally identified by her sister Ann from some physical characteristics. <b>Her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> some clothing were recognisable, and she was known to be missing a tooth which was also absent from the jawbone of the corpse. Evidence was uncovered to implicate Corder in the crime: his green handkerchief was discovered around the body's neck.|$|E
5|$|The Duke and Duchess of York (later George V and Queen Mary) visited New Zealand in 1901. At an {{official}} Māori welcome in Rotorua, a guide took a huia tail feather from <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> {{placed it in}} the band of the Duke's hat as a token of respect. Many people in England and New Zealand wanted to emulate this royal fashion and wear huia feathers in their hats. The price of tail feathers was soon pushed to £1, making each bird worth £12, and some feathers sold {{for as much as}} £5. Female huia beaks were also set in gold as jewellery. Shooting season notices ceased listing the huia as a protected species in 1901, and a last-ditch attempt to reinforce government protection failed when the solicitor general ruled that there was no law to protect feathers.|$|E

25|$|For many years, Fallaci was {{a special}} {{correspondent}} for the political magazine L'Europeo, and wrote {{for a number of}} leading newspapers and the magazine Epoca.
