50|$|The {{discovery}} {{of an abandoned}} trunk, noticed by a trader of snails, {{two days after the}} sinister find of the roadmender, pushed the inquiry in Saint-Genis-Laval. The key fitted to the lock, a missing nail was similar with a nail found in Millery and the stench from the chest left no doubt about its objective usage.
