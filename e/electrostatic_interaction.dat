5|$|Ions {{typically}} pack into extremely regular crystalline structures, in {{an arrangement}} that minimizes the lattice energy (maximizing attractions and minimizing repulsions). The lattice energy is the summation of the interaction of all sites with all other sites. For unpolarizable spherical ions only the charges and distances are required to determine the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interaction</b> energy. For any particular ideal crystal structure, all distances are geometrically related to the smallest internuclear distance. So for each possible crystal structure, the total electrostatic energy {{can be related to}} the electrostatic energy of unit charges at the nearest neighbour distance by a multiplicative constant called the Madelung constant that can be efficiently computed using an Ewald sum. When a reasonable form is assumed for the additional repulsive energy, the total lattice energy can be modelled using the Born–Landé equation, the Born–Mayer equation, or in the absence of structural information, the Kapustinskii equation.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> play {{important}} roles in determining the thermodynamic stability of proteins. However, the investigation into the role of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> in mechanical unfolding of proteins has just begun. Here we used single molecule atomic force microscopy techniques to directly evaluate the effect of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> on the mechanical stability of a small protein GB 1. We engineered a bi-histidine motif into the force-bearing region of GB 1. By varying the pH, histidine residues can switch between protonated and deprotonated states, leading to the change of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> between the two histidine residues. We found that the mechanical unfolding force of the engineered protein decreased by ∼ 34 % (from 115 pN to 76 pN) on changing the pH from 8. 5 to 3, due to the increased electrostatic repulsion between the two positively charged histidines at acidic pH. Our results demonstrated that <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> can significantly affect the mechanical stability of elastomeric proteins, and modulating the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> of key charged residues can become a promising method for regulating the mechanical stability of elastomeric proteins...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} grand {{canonical}} Monte Carlo simulations {{were performed to}} study gas separation in three pairs of isoreticular metal-organic frameworks (IRMOFs) with and without catenation at room temperature. Mixture composed of CO 2 and H 2 {{was selected as the}} model system to separate. The results show that CO 2 selectivity in catenated MOFs with multi-porous frameworks is much higher than their non-catenated counterparts. The simula-tions also show that the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> are very important for the selectivity, and the contributions of dif-ferent <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> are different, depending on pore size, pressure and mixture composition. In fact, changing the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> can even qualitatively change the adsorption behavior. A general conclusion is that the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> between adsorbate molecules and the framework atoms play a dominant role at low pressures, and these interactions in catenated MOFs have much more pronounced effects than those in their non-catenated counterparts, while the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> between adsorbate molecules become evident with increasing pressure, and eventually dominant...|$|R

25|$|Meta-Selective Borylation: Meta-Selective C–H borylation is an {{important}} synthetic transformation, which was discovered in 2002 by Smith III from Michigan State University, USA. However, this meta borylation was completely sterically directed and was limitted to only 1,3-disubstituted benzenes. Around 12 years later, Dr. Chattopadhyay and his team from Centre of Biomedical Research, U.P, India discovered an elegant technology for the meta-selective C–H bond activation and borylation. The team had shown that using the same substrate, one can switch the other positional selectivity just changing the ligand. The origin of the meta-selectivity was defined by the two parameter, such as: 1) <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interaction,</b> 2) a secondary B-N interaction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The intermolecular <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> of Cl-containing {{molecules}} (such as HCl and CCl 4) {{are analyzed}} theoretically. It is {{shown that the}} large atomic quadrupoles on the Cl atoms give rise to apparently peculiar <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> of these molecules. In most of the computer simulations of condensed-phase molecular systems carried out at present, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> between molecules are represented by partial charges on atomic sites. In some cases, polarizabilities of atoms are also taken into account. Empirically, this method of representing intermolecular <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions</b> is considered to work well in many cases. The partial charges on atoms constitute the lowest-order term {{as far as we}} choose atoms in molecules as the interaction sites. However, {{there is no guarantee that}} this method works well in all cases, and indeed, it has been recognized that there are some cases where this method does not work well [1]. Examination of the extent of generality of such cases is considered to be important for correct understanding of intermolecular interactions. Specifically in the case of intermolecular <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions,</b> we should analyze (a) the relatively low-order molecular multipole moments that can be observed experimentally, and (b) the phenomena that are especially sensitive to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interactions.</b> The factors that are needed to reproduce them quantitatively should b...|$|R

25|$|In contrast, {{the outer}} part of the {{membranes}} of plants and mammals is mainly composed of lipids without any net charges {{since most of the}} lipids with negatively charged headgroups are principally sequestered into the inner leaflet of the plasma membranes. Thus in the case of mammalian cells, the outer surfaces of the membranes are usually made of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, even though {{a small portion of the}} membrane's outer surfaces contain some negatively charged gangliosides. Therefore, the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic face of amphipathic antimicrobial peptides and the zwitterionic phospholipids on the cell surface of mammalian cell membranes plays a major role in the formation of peptide-cell binding. However, the hydrophobic interaction is relatively weak when compared to the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interaction,</b> thus, the antimicrobial peptides will preferentially interact with bacterial membranes.|$|E

2500|$|All intermolecular/van der Waals {{forces are}} {{anisotropic}} (except those between two noble gas atoms), {{which means that}} they depend on the relative orientation of the molecules. The induction and dispersion interactions are always attractive, irrespective of orientation, but the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>interaction</b> changes sign upon rotation of the molecules. That is, the electrostatic force can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the mutual orientation of the molecules. When molecules are in thermal motion, as they are in the gas and liquid phase, the electrostatic force is averaged out to a large extent, because the molecules thermally rotate and thus probe both repulsive and attractive parts of the electrostatic force. Sometimes this effect is expressed by the statement that [...] "random thermal motion around room temperature can usually overcome or disrupt them" [...] (which refers to the electrostatic component of the van der Waals force). Clearly, the thermal averaging effect is much less pronounced for the attractive induction and dispersion forces.|$|E
