Selective excitation of photosystem I by far-red light for 130 min {{resulted in a}} 40 % inactivation of photosystem I. It is surprising that this treatment also caused up to 90 % damage to photosystem II. This suggests that active oxygen produced at the reducing side of photosystem I is highly damaging to photosystem II. Only a small pool of the D 1 -protein was degraded. However, most of the D 1 -protein was modified to a slightly higher molecular mass, indicative of a damage-induced conformational change. The far-red illumination was also performed using <b>destacked</b> and randomized thylakoids in which {{the distance between the}} photosystems is shorter. Upon 130 min of illumination, photosystem I showed an approximate 40 % inactivation as in stacked thylakoids. In contrast, photosystem II only showed 40 % inactivation in <b>destacked</b> and randomized thylakoids, less than one-half of the inactivation observed using stacked thylakoids. In accordance with this, photosystem II, but not photosystem I is more protected from photoinhibition in <b>destacked</b> thylakoids.

40|$|In the {{aerospace}} industry, burr removal {{is a very}} important part of the manufacturing process. Stacks of material on sections of an aircraft are assembled and drilled by hand. Due to extensive burr formation the sheets must be <b>destacked</b> so that burrs can be removed and then the stacks are reassembled and fastened together. If burrs are minimized in the drilling process, this would reduce the necessity for the sheets to be <b>destacked</b> and deburred. One approach to minimizing burrs is to lower the thrust force in drilling through suitable modification of the drill geometry such as the use of a step drill. Although prior researchers have analyzed different drill geometries such as step drills and their effect on hole exit burr formation in the drilling process through experimentation, no work has been reported on modeling and analysis of step drilling forces and their relationship to burr formation as a function of the step drill geometry parameters. Consequently, this thesis focuses on the modeling of the thrust force and torque for step drills and analyzes their relationship with burr size as a function of the step drill geometry parameters. In the first step, a mechanistic model for thrust and torque in drilling is implemented for a standard twist drill. This mechanistic model is then adapted to predict the thrust and torque for a step drill. Subsequently, experiments are performed to validate the mechanistic model and to evaluate burr formation with standard and step drills. The influence of thrust and torque on hole exit burr formation is analyzed for different step drill geometries and experimental feeds and speeds. The results show that the predicted thrust and torque values for both drill geometries are in good agreement with measured values, although the torque model consistently underpredicts. For standard drill geometry in the calibration tests, the average error in the thrust prediction is 7. 09 % and the average error in the torque prediction is - 18. 05 %. In validation tests, the average error for predicted thrust is 2. 29 % and the average error for predicted torque is - 18. 46 %. For the step drill model the average error in thrust is 0. 72 % while the average error in torque is - 8. 72 %. In addition, a reduction in the predicted thrust force for a step drill relative to the standard twist drill is found to correlate well with a reduction in the measured burr size. However, further reduction in the thrust force by varying the step angle and diameter ratio do not correlate well with the measured burr size. Likely reasons for these results are presented in this thesis. MSCommittee Chair: Shreyes Melkote; Committee Member: Steven Danyluk; Committee Member: Steven Lian...|$|R

The novel design matches the FEKS preconcentration needs of a large sample volume introduction with electrokinetic injection (EKI), as well as long duration of isotachophoresis (ITP) process to enrich low concentration sample. In the curved channel [∼ 45. 6 mm long between port 1 (P 1) and the intersection point of two channels], EKI and ITP were performed while the side port 3 (P 3) was electrically floated. The turn-induced band broadening with or without ITP process was investigated by a computer simulation (using CFD-ACE+ software) when the analytes traveling through the U-shaped geometry.

In ITP/CZE some components migrate in an ITP fashion {{on top of a}} background electrolyte, and the other analytes migrate in a zone electrophoretic manner. For such a system, the leading electrolyte consists of a mixture of an ionic species, L 1, of high mobility (the leading ion of the ITP system), an ionic species, L 2, of low mobility (the coions of the CZE system), and a buffering counterionic species, whereas the terminating solution only contains the ionic species L 2 and the buffering counterions. The zones of the components migrating in the ITP/CZE mode are sharp owing to the self-correcting properties of the zones and the concentrations of the L 1 ions of the system. Mobility windows can be calculated, indicating which ions can migrate in the ITP/CZE mode. In this article mobility windows are calculated by applying both strong and weak acids as L 1 and L 2 ions and it appears that mobility windows can be optimized by chosing different ratios of L 1 and L 2 as well as different pH values. It is possible to construct very narrow mobility windows, and thereby choose which component of a sample solution can be concentrated, and to what concentration, in a very selective way. The big advantage of ITP/CZE compared with applications such as transient ITP and transient stacking is that the stacked sample ionic species migrate in the ITP mode during the whole experiment; furthermore, they do not <b>destack.</b> Experimentally obtained electropherograms validate the calculated mobility windows for the ITP/CZE mode...|$|R

40|$|Sweeping under inhomogeneous {{electric}} field conditions {{has been described}} as a process that includes stacking or <b>destacking</b> of the micelles when entering the sample zone, sweeping of analytes by the stacked or destacked micelles, and <b>destacking</b> or stacking of the swept analyte zone. However, there is ongoing debate that not only the retention factor of the analyte but also the electric conductivity of the sample solution or the concentration of an added salt can have an impact on the enrichment efficiency. Revisiting the equations describing sweeping, a factor θ (phase ratio shift factor) is defined to quantitatively describe the change of the retention factor between the sample and separation zones. The influence of the sample matrix composition on the experimentally obtained sweeping efficiency is studied with SDS as pseudostationary phase taking parabens, benzamide and anilines as model analytes. To this end, a robust and reliable method for the assessment of the sweeping efficiency is developed. The values obtained via this method are very precise and agree well with theoretically predicted ones. The results obtained for varied buffer concentration and varied concentration of NaCl in the sample solution show that under the conditions of our experimental study, the approximation of assuming θ to be equal to the reciprocal value of the field strength enhancement factor γ is valid. Accordingly, the sweeping efficiency for neutral analytes is independent of the electric conductivity of the sample matrix. It is also shown that under specific conditions unexpectedly high enrichment factors are obtained which are ascribed to the focusing of neutral analytes by micellar transient isotachophoresis (mtITP).

In dark-grown plants, {{results in a}} decreased amount of partitions (contact zones) between prothylakoids. In weak red light, the results in plants containing chloroplasts devoid of grana. Assays have been performed to investigate the membrane surface charge density in these membranes, and relate possible differences {{to the absence of}} (pro-) thylakoid overlap after NF teatment. Using the fluorescent probe 9 - amino acridine (9 -AA), the average surface charge density of isolated PTs was - 21. 8 ± 3. 2 mC m- 2 and - 27. 4 ± 2. 6 mC m- 2 in the control and after, respectively. Thylakoid membranes isolated from plants grown in weak red light exhibited slightly more negative values, - 23. 5 ± 2. 9 mC m- 2 and - 29. 0 ± 2. 1 mC m- 2, in control and after, respectively. The surface charge density of <b>destacked</b> thylakoids from greenhouse-grown untreated plants, containing extensive grana stacking, was - 34. 3 ± 2. 5 mC m- 2. Assays using the fluorescent probe of DPH (1, 6 - diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 - hexatriene) showed that this probe exhibits a higher polarisation value when incorporated into thylakoids from NF- treated plants compared to untreated plants grown in weak red light. The highest polarisation value was found in untreated plants grown in the greenhouse. This indicates a lower rotation transition of the probe in the lipid environment of thylakoids after NF treatment, which can be interpreted as more rigid membranes. These results suggest that the surface charge density and the mobility of membrane components may play a major role for the formation of partitions in dark-grown plants and in the formation of grana in plants grown in weak red light. 23 Additional key words: chloroplasts; etioplasts; (pro-) thylakoids; Triticum; stacking; wheat; 9 - amino acridine...|$|R
40|$|Part I: The Use of Deuterated Phospholipids to Elucidate Lipid-Lipid Interactions in Bilayer Vesicles. The {{motional}} {{state of}} lecithin molecules in single walled bilayer vesicles {{has been studied}} by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Inter- and intramolecular relaxation rates have been determined for the hydrocarbon chain methylene protons. The intermolecular contribution is much smaller than previously estimated. The data suggest a model in which hydrocarbon chain motion is described by rapid kink formation and diffusion along the chains in addition to slower C-C trans-gauche rotations. A lateral diffusion coefficient of 2. 5 - 5. 5 x 10 ^(- 8) cm^ 2 sec^(- 1) is estimated. Both linewidths and spin-lattice relaxation rates have been measured for lecithins with different hydrocarbon chain lengths. Above the crystal to liquid crystal phase transition temperature, the linewidths are independent of chain length. This is taken {{to indicate that the}} hydrocarbon chain mobility and order are also independent of chain length. The motional state of cholesterol in bilayer vesicles has been studied. Cholesterol dispersed in bilayers consisting of dipalmitoyl lecithin with perdeuterated hydrocarbon chains has an NMR spectrum with well defined features. Two of the five methyl resonances are sharp and clearly resolved. These are assigned to the isopropyl methyls of the hydrocarbon tail. The other methyl resonances are much broader. This is taken to indicate that the hydrocarbon tail is much more mobile and disordered than the steroid nucleus. These conclusions are in agreement with and provide experimental support for the model proposed by Rothman and Engelman, but contrast with recent NMR studies which conclude that both the steroid nucleus and hydrocarbon tail are highly immobilized. Part II: The Effect of Chain Length on the Secondary Structure of Oligoadenylates. The oligoadenylates (Ap) _(2 _ 4) A have been studied by proton magnetic resonance (pmr) spectroscopy. All the exterior base protons and a number of the interior base proton resonances have been assigned. The results of this work showed that the adenine bases in these oligoadenylates are intramolecularly stacked at 20 °C with their bases oriented preferentially in the anti conformation about their respective glycosidic bonds. The oligomers were found to associate extensively even at concentrations of 0. 02 M, primarily via "end to end" stacking. With increasing temperature the oligomer bases <b>destack,</b> but it is argued that this unfolding process cannot be described in terms of a two-state stacked versus unstacked model. Instead, the temperature dependences of the base proton chemical shifts support a base-oscillation model. The relationship between this model and the "two-state" model is discussed. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} chain-length dependence of the proton chemical shifts of the various adenine bases, it was concluded that subtle variations in the secondary structure of these oligomers exist with increasing chain length. Evidence is presented to show that the effects of distant base shielding are considerably smaller than what was previously estimated. The observed departures from the "extended dimer" model are attributed to differences in the relative orientations of the bases with respect to their neighbors in the oligomer...|$|R
40|$|The binding of {{oxidized}} {{as well as}} reduced coenzyme to some dehydrogenases {{has been}} studied under different concentration ratios and temperatures by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A {{significant difference in the}} spectral behavior between DPN+ and DPNH upon binding is interpreted in terms of fast and slow on-off rates relative to the nuclear magnetic resonance time scale in the binding of these two coenzymes. Significant downfield shifts of DPN+ were observed upon binding, comparable in magnitude to those expected upon opening (<b>destacking)</b> of the coenzymes in the case of chicken-muscle and lobster-tail lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 27) and yeast alchol dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 1.). A preliminary survey of several other dehydrogenases is consistent with these findings. In the case of 3 -phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase, {{there is a possibility that}} the coenzyme exists in the folded form...|$|E
