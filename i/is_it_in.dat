The identification of human reason with Godly inspiration was rejected in favour of views such as Rosenzweig's, who emphasized that the only content of revelation <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> itself, while all derivations of it are subjective, limited human understanding.

He rejected the notion of [...] "progressive revelation" [...] in the meaning of comparing human betterment with divine inspiration, stressing that past experiences were [...] "unique" [...] and of everlasting importance.
