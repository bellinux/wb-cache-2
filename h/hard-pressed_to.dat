That afternoon, British armoured cars and tanks appeared, and Mickl's force was <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> hold its positions barring the British approach to Tobruk from the south and south-east, as little tank support was available. In the face of a superior force, Mickl's kampfgruppe fought hard in what became known as the Battle of Sidi Rezegh, with their commander often forward rallying his troops, and in the thick of counter-attacks launched to regain ground. Mickl and around 800 of his troops were captured by elements of the New Zealand Division on 26 November 1941, the captured troops being mainly from the Afrika Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on the sketch and Belushi's performance in 2013. Lane thought that the sketch was an effective satire of the cancellation of the series and simultaneously served as a death knell for the Star Trek franchise. He felt that viewers watching the sketch in 1976 would be <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> imagine a future, thirty-seven-years later, where Star Trek was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture. Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character. Lane wondered how the Star Trek franchise could ever {{come back from the}} total deconstruction the SNL skit presented.|$|E

5|$|After the {{restoration}} of imperial rule in late 1867, the Boshin War broke out in early 1868, pitting the coalition of southern domains {{against the forces of}} the former Tokugawa shogunate. After the city of Edo fell, remnants of the Tokugawa forces retreated northward, and the fighting followed northward. The Satake clan was a signatory to the pact that formed the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei, the alliance of anti-Satchō northern domains led by the Sendai Domain. The Satake clan's delegation at Shiroishi, the alliance's headquarters, was led by the clan elder (karō) Tomura Yoshiari. However, the Satake had political difficulties with the alliance, which culminated in the murder, in Akita, of a delegation from Sendai on August 21, 1868, and the display of the messengers' gibbeted heads in the Akita castle town. The Sendai delegation, led by Shimo Matazaemon, was dispatched to request the Akita domain to hand over Kujō Michitaka and other officials of the imperial delegation that had been originally sent to the region to gather support for the imperial cause. The Satake then backed out of the alliance and supported the imperial army; eleven days later, on September 1, 1868 the Tsugaru clan of the neighboring Hirosaki domain followed suit. In response, the pro-alliance domains of Morioka and Ichinoseki sent troops to attack Kubota. Kubota forces were <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> defend their territory, with the result that the alliance troops had made serious advances before the war's end; Yokote Castle was burned, and by October 7, Morioka troops took Ōdate, one of the Akita domain's castles. In early 1869, Satake Yoshitaka formally gave up the domain's registers to the imperial government, and was made imperial governor of the Akita domain (han chiji). In mid-1869, the imperial government rewarded the service rendered by the main line of the Satake clan, by raising its income by 20,000 koku. The heads of all the Satake clan's branches were relieved of office as daimyō in 1871, and ordered to relocate to Tokyo.|$|E

25|$|Although some of {{the basic}} design {{elements}} of the aircraft were from an earlier generation, the Hurricane proved to be a match, to an extent, for the Luftwaffes Messerschmitt Bf 109E. In his book, Duel of Eagles, British ace Peter Townsend, who flew Hurricanes with No. 85 Squadron RAF during the Battle of Britain, provides examples demonstrating how the Hurricane's superior turning ability could offset the Bf 109's higher speed. This small turning circle often allowed a well flown Hurricane to get onto the tail of a 109 even more quickly than a Spitfire, assuming a 109 pilot was unwise enough to be lured into a turning match. Against the Hurricane was the aircraft's relatively slow acceleration and a top speed some 10–30mph (16–48km/h) slower, depending on altitude. This meant that the 109 pilot often held the initiative when it came to breaking off or attacking during combat. At higher altitudes especially, the Hurricane was <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> keep up with a well flown 109, or even a Bf 110.|$|E

At the Nimy bridge, Dease took control of his machine gun after the rest of the section had been killed or wounded and fired the weapon despite being shot several times. After a fifth wound he was evacuated to the battalion aid station, where he died.

However, it is unreasonable <b>to</b> expect <b>hard-pressed</b> lecturers <b>to</b> learn an entirely new and foreign research methodology in order to fulfil this expectation.

30|$|Borana women {{understand}} each other’s food shortages and feel {{a responsibility to}} fill the gap, sometimes even before help is requested. However, {{it is also the}} right for a <b>hard-pressed</b> woman <b>to</b> request food from her marro women in both bonding and bridging relations in times of need. Moreover, the culture stresses the obligations of olla 6 to solve the problems of neighbouring households, by mobilizing existing resources to secure survival. This strong sharing culture has kept marro continuing even when resources are limited, which is a good opportunity for future development of the relationship. However, following increases in drought, as indicated in group interviews, the number of people demanding help is increasing while resources to be shared are diminishing. This threatens the potential of marro in ensuring household food security. Moreover, lack of adequate external support combined with increases in livestock prices and the commoditisation of milk is also limiting the risk-pooling capacity of marro. The milk investment in marro has decreased following commoditisation of milk as indicated in all focus group discussions. Similarly, the discussants revealed that following increases in the price of livestock, many prefer to sell the livestock rather than slaughtering, which effectively limits sharing of meat and bone in marro relationships. These actions limit the role marro plays in building household food security that in long run may cause erosion of marro; this could adversely affect women and their households. Therefore, attention must be paid to the marro relationsship in order to expand its risk-pooling capacity {{for the benefit of the}} women and the households they manage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{weight of}} a solid core reactor was {{initially}} thought to be its main drawback. Immediately after World War II, a complete nuclear reactor was so heavy that it was feared that solid core nuclear thermal engines would be <b>hard-pressed</b> [...] <b>to</b> achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1:1, which is needed to overcome {{the gravity of the}} Earth at launch. This problem was quickly overcome, however, and over the next twenty-five years U.S. nuclear thermal rocket designs eventually reached thrust-to-weight ratios of approximately 7:1. This is still a much lower thrust-to-weight ratio than what is achievable with chemical rockets, which have thrust-to-weight ratios on the order of 70:1. That fact, when combined with the large tanks necessary for liquid hydrogen (or other working fluid) storage, means that solid core nuclear thermal engines are best suited for a) use in upper stages, where vehicle velocity is already near orbital, or b) in space [...] "tugs", or intra Solar System transports, which would be used to take payloads and/or people between gravity wells, or c) for launches from a planet smaller than Earth, a planetoid (or [...] "dwarf planet"), an asteroid, or a moon where the required thrust is lower due to lower gravity fields. Currently then, for a solid core nuclear thermal rocket to be more useful than chemical rockets as a first or second stage Earth launch engine, the system would either have to be made much lighter, or provide even higher specific impulse. Until that day, it can be said [...] that the true strength of nuclear rockets currently lies in solar system exploration, outside Earth's gravity well.|$|R
