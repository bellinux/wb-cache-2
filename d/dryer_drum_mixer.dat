5000|$|Industrial sized {{reversing}} <b>drum</b> <b>mixers</b> {{can have}} a capacity of 9 m³ and can produce a mid quality concrete mix {{in as little as}} 40 seconds. Reversing <b>drum</b> <b>mixers</b> provide for efficient mixing and leave very little build up within the mixer. [...] Wear is reduced as the drum rests on rubber or polyurethane wheels and there is no steel on steel contact. There is no direct contact between the stationary charge and discharge chutes and the rotating drum. The flexible tires, absorb vibration and make for low maintenance and a quiet operation. The efficient mixing within the concrete, results in a reduction in wear of the drum liners. The reversing <b>drum</b> <b>mixers</b> are known for the extremely low maintenance and operating costs, yet a good mixing effect relative to other <b>drum</b> <b>mixers.</b>|$|R

In {{the case of}} storage, an heterogeneity issue may occur when several types of materials, with different origins are mixed. At the scale of a storage zone or a stock pile, composition and properties of the reclaimed asphalts will be different, including variations of the final material properties, constraints for the stock manager, and the necessary adaptation of the manufacturing process. The reclaimed asphalt heterogeneity issue and the specific manufacturing process used in <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> asphalt plants {{have to be taken}} into account in ordre to optimize the laboratory mix design study as well as the physical, chemical and environmental criteria set in European legislation. The objective of this research work is to estimate the RAP heterogeneity in a material stockpile, as well as to improve the laboratory mixing procedure in order to better reproduce in laboratory the specific manufacturing process which can be found in <b>drum</b> <b>mixer</b> asphalt plants for these materials.

40|$|This review {{discusses}} {{the performance of}} existing dryers for pistachio drying process, which {{is available in the}} literature. It encompasses sun drying, solar dryer, bin dryer, vertical continuous dryer, funnel cylindrical dryer, vertical cylindrical dryer, continuous mobile and steady tray <b>dryer,</b> <b>drum</b> <b>dryer</b> and continuous belt conveyor dryer. The split nut and shell appearance of pistachio nuts are significantly influenced by the drying methods. The types of dryer used for drying pistachio nuts are critical to the final quality of the product. Although sun drying has a good effect on the final product quality, the negative climatic and environmental conditions must be considered.   A combination of bin dryer and sun drying or combination of bin dryer and solar dryer, are recommended as effective drying techniques to prevent adverse quality effect on pistachio nut. </p...|$|R

As early as 1916, Stephen Stepanian of Columbus, Ohio, developed a self-discharging motorized transit mixer that was the predecessor of the modern ready-mix concrete truck, but the patent that Stepanian filed in 1916 was rejected in 1919.

A two-electrode electrical capacitance method is used to measure the permittivity of mixtures while flowing in a 1 -D set up. An emphasis is placed on the possibility of following homogeneity evolution through permittivity measurement, without the necessity to calculate the volumetric proportions of each component from an effective medium formulation.
