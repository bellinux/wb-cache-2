5|$|Navarro {{stated that}} he filed suit against Chinchay, who first {{represented}} Van der Sloot during his interrogation, charging her with abuse of authority, conspiracy to commit a crime, and misrepresentation {{because he did not}} find her name on the list of public defenders from Peru's Ministry of Justice. Navarro also filed a complaint against Van der Sloot's translator, insisting that he misrepresented himself as an official translator of the Dutch embassy. Chinchay rejected the claims against her, stating that Van der Sloot had selected her as a private attorney after declining another defense attorney appointed by the state. She contradicted his claims that he did not understand what he was signing by stating {{that she was able to}} speak with him in perfect Spanish. She said that Van der Sloot was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> about the Holloway case, thinking that it might get him extradited to Aruba. Chinchay also said that when she told Van der Sloot that she noticed he was signing various documents with very different signatures, he signaled for her to be quiet.|$|E

25|$|Kurchatov's speech made it {{apparent}} that the three countries were all working on the same basic concepts and had all encountered the same sorts of problems. Cockcroft missed Kurchatov's visit because he had left for the US to press for declassification of the fusion work to avoid this duplication of effort. There was a widespread belief {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic that sharing their findings would greatly improve progress. Now that it was known the Soviets were at the same basic development level, and that they were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> about it publicly, the US and UK began considering releasing much of their information as well. This developed into a wider effort to release all fusion research at the second Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in September 1958.|$|E

He {{secretly}} hopes the group will ask him to lead them in a performance of George Michael's [...] "Faith". He becomes increasingly frustrated when the group is not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> about his glory days {{as part of the}} group, and upon learning that old bandmate Broccoli Rob (Stephen Colbert) claimed Andy's nickname of [...] "Boner Champ", Andy complains to both Rob, via video chat, and to Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper). Though Erin sees the situation as trivial, she nonetheless demands that the group sing [...] "Faith" [...] for Andy.|$|E
2500|$|The Reepalu {{controversy}} {{was addressed}} by a signed editorial, [...] "The Hunt for Reepalu", {{that was published}} in the independent social democratic tabloid Aftonbladet. The editorial was written by Kennet Andreasson, who is an editor of Aftonbladet. Andreasson stated that he [...] "had {{no reason to believe that}} Reepalu is a Jew-hater --- ignorant, perhaps, unaware of the historical chains of thought-figures that lead to antisemitism, possibly --- but mostly naive and honest---and stressed." [...] The characterization the reporter at Skånska Dagbladet made, portraying Reepalu as more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> about Israel's aggressive politics then the problems at hand was unfair he continued. [...] "Anyone who listens to the questions and answers get a more nuanced picture. More than anything, Reepalu talks about fighting racism wherever it appears and whomever it is directed at. He emphasizes, more than one time, that international politics should not be drawn into local politics." [...] It could have ended with the Reepalu's op-ed for Sydsvenska Dagbladet on January 30 where Reepalu called it [...] "totally unacceptable" [...] to make Malmö's Jews responsible for what happens in Israel, Andreassson observed. [...] "When this did not happen, Reepalu should put an end to it now by swallowing the condemnations. Then he is entitled to his own condemnation of the Israeli atrocities in Gaza. Those who have stood for the blame, in the main driven by zeal for sanitation of antisemitism, at times self-righteousness have been scent, are likely to agree. For it must be possible to express this criticism without being automatically accused of Jew-hating, something that often occurs. To make a hard criticism against the war effort, against the government-conducted murders, against the wall, against the settlements --- these criticism are very much justifiable --- and legitimate and morally and politically respectable." ...|$|E

60|$|The Empress had graciously {{offered me}} a seat in her berline, {{and all the way}} to the village, entirely forgetful {{apparently}} of the scene through which she passed, she chatted away, asking me a thousand personal questions about myself and my affairs, for a kindly curiosity in the doings of everyone around her was one of her most marked characteristics. Especially was she interested in Eugenie, and as the subject was one upon which I was equally <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> it ended in a rhapsody upon my part, amid little sympathetic ejaculations from the Empress and titterings from Madame de Remusat.|$|E

This term is increasingly used to describe certain kinds of support which learners receive in their interaction with parents, teachers and other 'mentors' as they move towards new skills, concepts or levels of understanding. It is a term which helps to portray the temporary, but essential, nature of the mentor's assistance as the learner advances in knowledge and understanding...|$|R
