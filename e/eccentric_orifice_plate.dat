Consequently, a new type of <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> has been designed. It is termed the "slotted orifice plate". In the slotted <b>orifice</b> <b>plate,</b> the familiar round hole found in the center of standard <b>orifice</b> <b>plates</b> is replaced with a circular array of radially aligned slots. The objective of this project was to compare the performance of the slotted <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> to that of the standard <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> in order to determine the extent, if any, to which the slotted <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> is superior to the standard <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> in flow measurement.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> energy {{dissipater}} is {{an economic}} and highly efficient dissipater. However, {{there is a risk}} of cavitaion around the <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> flow. In order to provide references for engineering practice, we examined the cavitation mechanism around the <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> and its influencing factors by utilizing mathematical analysis methods to analyze the flow conditions around the <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> in view of gas bubble dynamics. Through the research presented in this paper, the following can be observed: The critical radius and the critical pressure of the gas nucleus in <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> flow increase with its initial state parameter τ 0; the development speed of bubbles stabilizes at a certain value after experiencing a peak value and a small valley value; and the <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> cavitation is closely related to the distribution of the gas nucleus in flow. For computing the <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> cavitation number, we ought {{to take into account the}} effects of pressure fluctuation. The development time of the gas nucleus from the initial radius to the critical radius is about 10 − 7 – 10 − 5 s; therefore, the gas nucleus has sufficient time to develop into bubbles in the negative half-cycle of flow fluctuation. The orifice critical cavitation number is closely related to the <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> size, and especially closely related with the ratio of the <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> radius to the tunnel radius.

40|$|Purpose - The {{sensitivity}} of <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> metering to poorly conditioned and swirling flows are subjects of concerns to flow meter users and manufacturers. The distortions caused by pipe fittings and pipe installations upstream of the <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> are {{major sources of}} this type of non-standard flows. These distortions will alter the accuracy of metering up to an unacceptable degree. Design/methodology/approach - The design of <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> meters that are independent of the initial flow conditions of the upstream is a major object of flow metering. Either using a long straight pipe or a flow conditioner upstream of an <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> usually achieves this goal. The effect of cone swirler flow conditioner for both standard and non-standard flow conditions has been carried out in the experimental rig. The measuring of mass flow rate under different conditions and different Reynolds numbers were used to establish a change in discharge coefficient relative to a standard one. Findings - The experimental results using the cone swirler flow conditioner showed that the combination of an <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> and cone swirler flow conditioner is broadly insensitive to upstream disturbances. The results clearly show that this flow conditioner can attenuate the effect of both swirling and asymmetric flows on metering to an acceptable level.

The results of using a combination of a cone swirler and <b>orifice</b> <b>plate</b> for non-standard flow conditions including swirling flow and asymmetric flow show this package can preserve the accuracy of metering up to the level required in the standards, providing that a new discharge coefficient is used for the combined swirler and <b>orifice</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R

Adding a periodic array of <b>orifice</b> <b>plates</b> to a cylindrical pipe is shown to increase the mixing efficiency of the flow in the laminar regime.

The immersed boundary method is also applied to turbulent flow through a ‘fractal-orifices pipe’ at Re = 4300.
