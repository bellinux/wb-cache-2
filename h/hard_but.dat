5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a <b>hard</b> <b>but</b> brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>hard</b> <b>but</b> {{inconclusive}} fight {{during which}} Admiral Brézé was killed, the French fleet withdrew to Toulon leaving {{the sea to}} the Spanish, who decided not to pursue them to relieve Orbetello. The land forces disembarked by Count of Linhares a few days later, however, failed to dislodge the French lines, and the siege could be undertaken until 24 July, when another Spanish army led by the Marquis of Torrecuso and the Duke of Arcos, which {{had come from the}} Kingdom of Naples across the Papal States, defeated the besieging French troops, forcing them to retreat with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Boston Latin School in 1750, Hancock {{enrolled}} in Harvard College and received a bachelor's degree in 1754. Upon graduation, he began to work for his uncle, just as the French and Indian War (1754–1763) had begun. Thomas Hancock had close relations with the royal governors of Massachusetts and secured profitable government contracts during the war. John Hancock learned much about his uncle's business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked <b>hard,</b> <b>but</b> he also enjoyed {{playing the role of}} a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.|$|E

5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be <b>hard</b> <b>but</b> underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
5|$|In {{her efforts}} {{to be the perfect}} wife, she was often given an eye for trying too <b>hard,</b> <b>but</b> at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's {{attention}} and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood the concerns they had, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly <b>hard</b> <b>but</b> brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E

5|$|Booth was {{regarded}} as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball <b>hard</b> <b>but</b> for having an easy and relaxed style. In hockey, a player {{is not allowed to}} lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to impart momentum on the ball without a large swing of the blade. Booth was particularly known for his late cut and his cover drive, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to Mark Waugh. He was known for his quick footwork against spin bowling and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo. Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181cm, weighed 66kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking. He was known for his efficient outfielding, and {{on the second day of}} the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 196465, he ran out Gary Sobers and Basil Butcher with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time leg spinner before converting to off spin.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds are {{extremely}} <b>hard,</b> <b>but</b> also brittle {{and can be}} split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the facets would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of facets would determine {{the weight of the}} final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50%. Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example, the diamond might be intended for display or for wear, in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape. Some of them may be considered as classical, such as round, pear, marquise, oval, hearts and arrows diamonds, etc. Some of them are special, produced by certain companies, for example, Phoenix, Cushion, Sole Mio diamonds, etc.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June, Nymphe was {{cruising}} alone off the Devon coast under Captain Edward Pellew when a sail {{appeared to}} the south east. Closing to investigate, Pellew rapidly identified the ship as Cléopâtre and gave chase, the French frigate initially fleeing but Captain Jean Mullon then turning to fight as Nymphe began to overtake his ship. At 06:15, with both crews cheering loudly, the frigates exchanged broadsides, the action lasting 50 minutes. Both ships fought <b>hard,</b> <b>but</b> at 07:10 the British crew were able to successfully board the French frigate and haul down the tricolour. Mullon was mortally wounded in the engagement, and his crew lost 63 casualties compared to 50 on board Nymphe. Pellew returned to Britain with his prize, the first major French warship captured during the conflict, and was proclaimed a hero.|$|E

5|$|Buemi was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} session; his best lap time of 1.38:586 was half a second off Vettel's pace in the second session. He was {{disappointed}} as he had Barrichello ahead of him driving towards turn 25 on his final timed lap which caused Buemi to reduce his speed and it cost him two tenths of a second. Rosberg took 12th position. Sutil had no grip {{in his car and}} qualified in 13th. His teammate Liuzzi clinched 14th place' he was affected by oversteer and struggled with driving on his car's soft tyres. Schumacher was unable to get his tyres working to his preference and was affected with a right-front brake problem which restricted him to qualifying in 15th. Schumacher's qualifying effort was criticised by the Formula One paddock. Pedro de la Rosa took 16th having struggled with a lack of grip on the super soft compound tyres. Jaime Alguersuari drove <b>hard</b> <b>but</b> experienced a lack of top speed and clinched 17th. Kamui Kobayashi failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session; he flat-spotted his front super soft compound tyres on his first timed lap which caused him to feel vibrations in his car. The two Lotus cars of Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen qualified in 19th and 20th positions, ahead of both Virgin drivers Lucas di Grassi and Timo Glock in 21st and 22nd. Both Hispania drivers lined up {{at the back of the}} field (with Karun Chandhok ahead of Senna).|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the capture of}} Junon, Guadeloupe was the only French colony in the Caribbean not under attack; Martinique fell to the British on 24 February and Spanish forces continued their Siege of Santo Domingo. The French did make further attempts to resupply the islands; a major expedition was defeated off Guadeloupe in April, and elements of this force that reached the island were defeated and captured during June and July. With British forces distracted by the ongoing Reconquista in Santo Domingo, {{the focus of the}} campaign moved north, and it was not until a second major expedition arrived in December that significant British forces returned to the Leeward Islands for the final invasion of Guadeloupe. The influx of British reinforcements was too late for HMS Junon; on 13 December she had been cruising alone to the east of Antigua and been surprised by François Roquebert's squadron of four French frigates. Outnumbered and surrounded, Junon fought <b>hard</b> <b>but</b> was eventually forced to surrender after Captain John Shortland was mortally wounded. Reduced to a sinking condition in the engagement, Junon was set on fire and abandoned by Roquebert, whose ships were intercepted five days later off Guadeloupe and defeated: two were destroyed and two others returned to France without landing their supplies.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden was Team Ninja's first action title. Its initial concept {{had nothing}} in common with the {{original}} Ninja Gaiden series that was released for the NES. However, for retail reasons Tecmo wanted to retain a link with the previous games, which had many adherents in the West, so Itagaki was asked to rethink his ideas to target the foreign market. Analysing the earlier games, he concluded that their violence appealed to players, and included gory content, such as beheadings, in the Xbox game to retain that spirit. He also aimed to make his new game <b>hard</b> <b>but</b> alluring; it would challenge players on their reflexes rather than on their memories of layouts and timings. His team made a point of designing smoothly-flowing gameplay with high-quality animations that reacted quickly to the player's input. Itagaki paid homage to the earlier Ninja Gaiden series by including updated versions of foes and special attacks. Team Ninja based their 3D computer models, from the pistols of the henchman upwards, on real world material. Character models were taken from studies of human anatomy, and the team hired martial artists in order to digitally capture their movement. Rather than import the motion captures directly into the game, however, the animators used them as templates to give a sense of realism to the game characters' exaggerated movements. Itagaki found it more interesting to design nonhuman creatures than human enemies.|$|E
