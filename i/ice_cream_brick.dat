His brain was all sizzling and jolly with the bromo-seltzer, and when he fetched out the <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> <b>bricks</b> and Zena ran to get plates and spoons to eat it with, and Pupkin went with her to help fetch them and they picked out the spoons together, they were so laughing and happy that it was just a marvel.
