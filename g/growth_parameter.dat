5000|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the conductivity comes from free electrons left by oxygen vacancies in the SrTiO3. [...] SrTiO3 {{is known to be}} easily doped by oxygen vacancies, so this was initially considered a promising hypothesis. However, electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements have bounded the density of oxygen vacancies well below the density necessary to supply the measured free electron densities.Another proposed possibility is that oxygen vacancies in the surface of the LaAlO3 are remotely doping the SrTiO3. Under generic growth conditions, multiple mechanisms can coexist. A systematic study [...] across a wide <b>growth</b> <b>parameter</b> space demonstrated different roles played by oxygen vacancy formation and the polar gating at different interfaces. An obvious difference between oxygen vacancies and polar gating in creating the interface conductivity is that the carriers from oxygen vacancies are thermally activated as the donor level of oxygen vacancies is usually separated from the SrTiO3 conduction band, consequently exhibiting the carrier freeze-out effect at low temperatures; in contrast, the carriers originating from the polar gating are transferred into the SrTiO3 conduction band (Ti 3d orbitals) and are therefore degenerate.|$|E

Starting from 2003, he has {{been at the forefront of}} research in this field, collaborating with more than 40 groups in 18 countries (with joint publications). His main area is in kinetically controlled engineering of nanostructures, including morphology, crustal phase, and size distributions. In 2005, he and coauthors proved a diffusion-induced character of gold-assisted vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth of GaAs nanowires by molecular beam epitaxy 1. In 2008-2014, following Frank Glas 2, he developed theoretical approaches for understanding and controlling polytypism of III-V nanowires by the <b>growth</b> <b>parameter</b> tuning 3 and catalyst material 4. This allowed achieving record small GaAs nanowires (down to 5 nm in radius) with pure zincblende structure 5. Independently of Jerry Tersoff 6, in 2013-2015 he predicted a non-linear focusing effect 7,8 that enabled self-organized ensembles of GaAs nanowires with uniform radii 8. The works of 2016 brought up the new size distributions describing length statistics in nanowire ensembles 9,10. In 2015-2016, he developed the first theory for the compositional control of ternary III-V nanowires 11, sharpening their axial heterointerfaces 12 and, more generally, nucleation theory of ternary solids from ternary and quaternary liquid alloys. He contributed into understanding the VLS versus selective area growth of nanowires 13 and self-induced nucleation of GaN nanowires on silicon substrates 14.|$|E

40|$|There are two coupled {{objectives}} {{for this study}} of buoyancy-driven turbulence. The first objective is {{to determine if the}} development of a Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) mixing layer can be manipulated experimentally by altering the initial condition of the experiment. The second objective is to evaluate the performance of the Besnard, Harlow, and Rauenzahn (BHR) turbulent transport model when initialized with experimentally measured initial conditions. An existing statistically steady water channel facility at Texas A&M University and existing experimental diagnostics developed for this facility have been used to measure the turbulent quantities of buoyancy-driven turbulence. A stationary, bi-planar grid with a high solidity ratio, ?, has been placed immediately downstream of the termination of the splitter plate, perpendicular to the flow direction, to generate a turbulent initial condition. The self-similar <b>growth</b> <b>parameter,</b> ?, for the RT mixing layer has been measured using a visualization technique to determine if the initial conditions affect the development of the RT mixing layer. The self-similar <b>growth</b> <b>parameter,</b> ?, decreased from a value of 0. 072 ? 0. 0003 with the fine grid to values of 0. 063 ? 0. 0003 and 0. 060 ? 0. 0003 with the medium and coarse grids, respectively. With the results from the first objective, a unique opportunity arose to evaluate the performance of the variable density, RANS-type, BHR turbulent transport model.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{estimating}} individual {{variability in the}} von Bertalanffy growth parameters of fish species is presented. The method uses a nonlinear random effects model, which explicitly assumes that an individual's growth parameters represent samples from a multivariate population of growth parameters characteristic of a species or population. The method was applied to backcalculated length-at-age data from the tropical emperor, Lethrinus mahsena. Individual <b>growth</b> <b>parameter</b> variability estimates were compared with those derived using the current "standard" method, which characterizes the joint distribution of <b>growth</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates obtained by independently fitting a growth curve to each individual data set. Estimates of mean von Bertalanffy growth parameters from the two methods were similar. However, estimated <b>growth</b> <b>parameter</b> variances were much higher using the standard method. Using the random effects model, the estimated correlation between population mean values of L-infinity and K was - 0. 52 or - 0. 42, depending on the marginal distribution assumed for K. The latter estimate had a 95 % posterior credibility interval of - 0. 62 to - 0. 17. These represent the first reliable estimate of this correlation and confirm the view that these parameters are negatively correlated in fish populations; however, the absolute correlation value is somewhat lower than has been assumed...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of {{time-dependent}} deformation and fracture propagation in rock is essential, {{since the}} knowledge of the long-term integrity of rock is required for many subsurface structures excavated in a rock mass. Time-dependent fracture propagation has been invoked as a potential key mechanism responsible for the increase in seismicity preceding earthquake ruptures and volcanic eruptions. In engineering projects, and in preventing natural hazards, the study of subcritical crack growth and the long-term strength of rock is necessary. Since the long-term strength is affected by the values of the subcritical crack <b>growth</b> <b>parameters,</b> {{it is important to know}} the influence of the surrounding environment on the subcritical crack <b>growth</b> <b>parameters</b> and long-term strength. The influence of the surrounding environment on the subcritical crack <b>growth</b> <b>parameters,</b> however, has not been completely clarified yet. In this study, the subcritical crack <b>growth</b> <b>parameters</b> were estimated under various environmental conditions on igneous rocks (andesite and granite) using the Double-Torsion method. Based on the results of subcritical crack <b>growth</b> <b>parameters</b> estimations, we calculated the long-term strength of rock. It was shown that the subcritical crack <b>growth</b> <b>parameters</b> were affected by the environmental conditions such as the temperature, humidity and existence of water. Especially, it was shown that the subcritical crack growth index in water was smaller than that in air. When the relative humidity of the air was higher, subcritical crack growth index tended to be smaller. The subcritical crack growth index at 90 per cent relative humidity was close to the value in water. By the calculation based on the results of our subcritical crack <b>growth</b> <b>parameters</b> estimation, it was shown that long-term strength decreased under the conditions of higher temperature, humidity in air and in water. It is concluded that the subcritical crack <b>growth</b> <b>parameters</b> and long-term strength are affected by the surrounding environment, that is, by the temperature, relative humidity and water.

40|$|A {{difficulty}} with length-cohort analysis involves choosing the correct input <b>growth</b> <b>parameters.</b> For species {{that can be}} aged, however, length-cohort analysis can be tested by comparing age-composition and length-composition analyses on the same data. This paper uses age and length compositions for North Sea haddock, which vary considerably in length-at-age and age-at-length. A comparison of results leads to the following: for calculating values of F, length-cohort analysis using input <b>growth</b> <b>parameters</b> based on a conventional relationship of mean length-on-age led to values that were significantly smaller than those ob-tained by virtual population analysis (VPA) using age-composition data. Much closer results were obtained using the empirical procedure suggested by Jones (1984) for determining input <b>growth</b> <b>parameters</b> for length-cohort analysis, based on an as-sumed value of L, a little greater than the largest individuals {{and at least one}} known annual growth increment. For North Sea haddock this conclusion does not appear to depend too critically on the precise value of L ^ adopted, provided the K-value used is compatible with L « and the growth increment. Some predictions of long-term changes in yield per recruit were also made, using length-cohort analysis and various sets of input <b>growth</b> <b>parameters.</b> The lowest estimates of long-term gain were obtained with <b>growth</b> <b>parameters</b> based on a conventional relationship of mean length-on-age. Whilst these are not necessarily the best estimates it is suggested that for yield-per-recruit assessments, length-composi-tion analysis could use these <b>growth</b> <b>parameters</b> if they happen to be known. This procedure is less likely to lead to overestimates of any potential long-term benefits and hence over-optimistic management decisions...|$|R
