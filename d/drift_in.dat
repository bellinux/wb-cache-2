5|$|Even {{when this}} inner planet, {{with a mass}} at least 78% times that of Jupiter was {{accounted}} for, the star still showed a <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> its radial velocity. This {{eventually led to the}} discovery of the outer planet 55 Cancri d in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, 55 Cancri c was detected by observing changes in its star's radial velocity. This was achieved by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. At the time of discovery, 55 Cancri A was already known to possess one planet (55 Cancri b); however, {{there was still a}} <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> the radial velocity measurements which was unaccounted for.|$|E

5|$|Such a shell {{would have}} no net {{gravitational}} interaction with its englobed star (see shell theorem), and could <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> relation to the central star. If such movements went uncorrected, they could eventually result in a collision between the sphere and the star—most likely with disastrous results. Such structures would need either some form of propulsion to counteract any drift, or some way to repel {{the surface of the}} sphere away from the star.|$|E
5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> generations to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E

5|$|The American {{biologist}} Sewall Wright, who had {{a background}} in animal breeding experiments, focused on combinations of interacting genes, {{and the effects of}} inbreeding on small, relatively isolated populations that exhibited genetic <b>drift.</b> <b>In</b> 1932, Wright introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape and argued that genetic drift and inbreeding could drive a small, isolated sub-population away from an adaptive peak, allowing natural selection to drive it towards different adaptive peaks. The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright founded the discipline of population genetics. This integrated natural selection with Mendelian genetics, which was the critical first step in developing a unified theory of how evolution worked.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen's initial plans {{had focused}} on the Arctic and the conquest of the North Pole {{by means of an}} {{extended}} <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> an icebound ship. He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when, in 1909, the rival American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert E. Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the South Pole; uncertain {{of the extent to which}} the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.|$|E
5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that he would still {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E

5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{stage of}} a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks; many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding, but some species are known to feed on nectar. The winged insects are nocturnal and provide food for night-flying birds, bats, small mammals, {{amphibians}} and arthropods. The larval stage lasts much longer, often for one or more years, and has a bigger impact on the environment. They form {{an important part of}} the diet of fish such as the trout. The fish acquire them by two means, either plucking them off vegetation or the stream-bed as the larvae move about, or during the daily behavioural drift; this drift happens during the night for many species of aquatic larvae, or around midday for some cased caddisfly species, and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device. The larvae may <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> great numbers either close to the bottom, in mid-water or just below the surface. The fish swallow them whole, case and all.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} founded in 2001, and took over Norges Statsbaner's (NSB) {{passenger}} operation of the Ofoten Line in 2003. The following year it entered the freight market, in particular with timber trains for Norske Skog. It further expanded into other services, such as charter trips. In 2006, the company almost went bankrupt, and {{was taken over by}} Rail Management. In 2007, the automotive distributor Autolink started purchasing the autorack operations from Ofotbanen, {{and at the same time}} bought 40% of the company. 2008 saw a dramatic decline in operations, as both the Norske Skog, Autolink and passenger train services were terminated. In April the company started service with the Unionexpressen between Oslo and Stockholm. The company went bankrupt in October, but was immediately re-established as Ofotbanen <b>Drift.</b> <b>In</b> May 2010, the new company filed for bankruptcy.|$|E

5|$|Vizzini {{initially}} {{supported the}} separatist movement in Sicily. On December 6, 1943, Vizzini participated {{at the first}} clandestine regional convention of the Sicilian separatists movement of the Sicilian Independence Movement (Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano - MIS) in Catania. Other prominent Mafia bosses like Giuseppe Genco Russo, Gaetano Filippone, Michele Navarra and Francesco Paolo Bontade did not hide their sympathies for the separatists either. The separatists benefited from covert support of the OSS. As Italy experienced a leftward <b>drift</b> <b>in</b> 1943-1944, the American military became increasingly concerned about their future prospects in Italy. The island's naval bases and strategic location in the Mediterranean provided a possible future counterbalance to a Communism on the Italian mainland. The Italian Communist Party's membership had doubled and the largely left inspired resistance movement in the north was gathering strength.|$|E
5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic <b>drift.</b> <b>In</b> parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E
