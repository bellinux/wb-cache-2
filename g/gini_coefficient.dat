To compensate, the government says it has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of the subsidy reforms. For example, the income <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficient</b> fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing the Subsidy Reform Plan.|$|E

However, additional complexities involving unbalanced schedules, interdivisional play, and now interleague play must be overcome before winning percentage <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficients</b> can give precise estimates of competitive balance.

40|$|<b>Gini</b> <b>coefficients,</b> which measure gross inequalities {{rather than}} their unfair components, are often used as proxy {{measures}} of absolute or relative distributive injustice inWestern societies. This presupposes that the fair inequalities in these societies are small and stable enough to be ignored. This article presents {{a model for a}} series of ideal, perfectly just societies, where comfortable lives are equally available to everyone, and calculates the <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficients</b> for each. According to this model, inequalities produced by age and other demographic factors, together with reasonable choices under equal opportunity, can raise the <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficients</b> for perfectly just societies to levels at least as high as those of any current Western country, and can as easily account for differences in <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficients</b> between such societies or within one such society over time. If Gini coef-ficients at these levels are possible for ideal societies without distributive injustice, then they should not be used as proxy measures of distributive injustice in real societies...|$|R
25|$|The {{advent of}} deindustrialization {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s saw income {{inequality}} increase dramatically to levels never seen before. But at the same time, most orthodox economists, and most policy makers, pointed {{to the fact that}} consumers could buy so many goods, even with the inflation of the 1970s, as evidence that the general shift away from manufacturing and into services was creating widespread prosperity. In 1968, the U.S. <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficient</b> was 0.386. In 2005, the American <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficient</b> had reached 0.469.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{summarizes}} {{income inequality}} {{in a single}} number {{and is one of}} the most commonly used measures of income inequality. It uses a scale from 0 to 1 – the higher the number the more inequality. Zero represents perfect equality (everyone having exactly the same income), and 1 represents perfect inequality (one person having all income). (Index scores are commonly multiplied by 100 to make them easier to understand.) Gini index ratings can be used to compare inequality within (by race, gender, employment) and between countries, before and after taxes. Different sources will often give different gini values for the same country or population measured. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau's official <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficient</b> for the United States was 47.6 in 2013, up from 45.4 in 1993, the earliest year for comparable data. By contrast, the OECD's <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficient</b> for income inequality in the United States is 37 in 2012 (including wages and other cash transfers), which is still the highest in the developed world, with the lowest being Denmark (24.3), Norway (25.6), and Sweden (25.9).|$|E

25|$|The {{household}} income Gini index for the United States was 0.468 in 2009, {{according to the}} US Census Bureau, though it varied significantly between states. The states of Utah, Alaska and Wyoming have a pre-tax income inequality <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficient</b> that is 10% lower than the average, while Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico 10% higher. After including the effects {{of federal and state}} taxes, the U.S. Federal Reserve estimates 34 states in the USA have a <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficient</b> between 0.30 and 0.35, with the state of Maine the lowest. At the county and municipality levels, the pre-tax Gini index ranged from 0.21 to 0.65 in 2010 across the United States, according to Census Bureau estimates.|$|E
25|$|Income {{inequality}} (as {{measured by}} the <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficient)</b> is not uniform among the states: after-tax income inequality in 2009 was greatest in Texas and lowest in Maine. Income inequality has grown from 2005 to 2012 in more than 2 out of 3 metropolitan areas.|$|E
25|$|Relative poverty views poverty as {{socially}} {{defined and}} dependent on social context, hence relative poverty {{is a measure}} of income inequality.

40|$|Direct {{measurements}} of <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficients</b> by conventional arithmetic calculations are a poor estimator, even if paradoxically, {{they include the}} entire population, as because of super-additivity they cannot lend themselves to comparisons between units of different size, and intertemporal analyses are vitiated by the population changes. The Gini of aggregated units A and B will be {{higher than those of}} A and B computed separately. This effect becomes more acute with fatness of tails. When the sample size is smaller than entire population, the error is extremely high. The conventional literature on <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficients</b> cannot be trusted and comparing countries of different sizes makes no sense; nor does it make sense to make claims of "changes in inequality" based on conventional measures. We compare the standard methodologies to the indirect methods via maximum likelihood estimation of tail exponent. We compare to the tail method which is unbiased, with considerably lower error rate. We also consider measurement errors of the tail exponent and suggest a simple but efficient methodology to calculate <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficients...</b>|$|R
30|$|When {{looking at}} the {{historical}} evolution of the spatial light <b>Gini</b> <b>coefficients,</b> we saw a gradual increase over the time span of our observations, which is the past 17 years.
