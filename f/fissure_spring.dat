30|$|Water infiltrates the {{landslide}} area through superficial sediments {{and deep}} gullies, {{which in some}} places cut up to 20  m into the massif enabling the water to reach deeper layers of the bed rock. The topographic infiltration area of the complex landslide is only about 3 Km 2, but based on our field observations and morphology of the surrounding slopes, {{it may be more}} than twice as large as the topographic infiltration area. Observation of the <b>fissure</b> <b>spring</b> at the NW border of landslide with measured outflow of 0.07  l/s supports this opinion (Klimeš and Vilímek 2011). This water infiltration may occur deeper into the massif.|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{evaluation}} of dependence between the spring discharge fluctuations and water temperature, both during the year and extreme rainfall-runoff events, on spring equipped with a V-notch weir with a continuous monitoring of spring water temperature and water level above the weir. Data were gathered on descending <b>fissure</b> <b>spring</b> of Tocnicky stream, located in the southwestern part of the Planicky ridge natural park in Klatovsko region. More data and stand characteristics (air temperature, soil temperature profile, soil moisture) were measured for better evaluation of the dependence, both at the spring location and in the infiltration area on the western slope of local highest peak Rovná. The formation of runoff on the slope above measured spring {{is likely to be}} subject to a combination of shallow circulation with a component of preferential flow during extreme rainfall-runoff events and deeper circulation, which is not yet well known and understood...|$|E
60|$|From every hill slope {{came the}} trickle of running water, {{the music of}} unseen fountains. All things were thawing, bending, snapping. The Yukon was {{straining}} to break loose the ice that bound it down. It ate away from beneath; the sun ate from above. Air-holes formed, <b>fissures</b> <b>sprang</b> and spread apart, while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into the river. And amid all this bursting, rending, throbbing of awakening life, under the blazing sun and through the soft-sighing breezes, like wayfarers to death, staggered the two men, the woman, and the huskies.|$|R
50|$|Silfra is spring fed by {{groundwater}} originating as meltwater from Langjökull, Iceland's {{second largest}} glacier, about fifty kilometres {{north of the}} Þingvallavatn Lake. In the distant past, this Langjökull meltwater ran through a river directly and unimpeded into the Þingvallavatn Lake. This river was blocked a few thousand years ago by lava flows from the Skjaldbreiður volcano causing the meltwater to pond and seep underground into the porous lava rock to form an aquifer. This water then percolates through the aquifer for thirty to a hundred years before emerging from the <b>fissure</b> <b>springs</b> in the Þingvallavatn Lake fifty kilometres to the south. The emerging, highly filtered groundwater is exceptionally clear and potable.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} an attempt of a {{presentation}} concerning the springs of {{the upper part of}} the Bystrzyca Dusznicka drainage basin against a background of the tectonic structure and geology. All the measurements and mapping of the surface hydrolographical objects were carried out in July 1993. The most important tectonic element of the researched area, which determines the spatial layout and the features of the springs, seems to be the Zieleniec overthrust consisting of the folded Proterozoik mica slates. The lower edge of its overthrust is at a height of 800 m. The rest of the drainage basin is formed of upper Cretaceous sediments dipping in the inner-Sudeten syncline. Later alpine deformations modified the geological structure of this area. The faults formed in such a way as to form 2 systems of crackings: the parallelone and slanted one running NW to SE. The Bystrzyca Dusznicka valley which runs alongside the axis of the drainage basin shows the water-gap character. In the researched area the authors observed either subsurface water in the mantle rocks, or fissure water circulating in the deeper metamorphic rocks. The upper Cretaceous porous sandstones form the most capacious underground water basin. Each water-bearing underground water horizon is separated with marly rocks. From among springs of the researched area three basic types of them were distinguished: fissure, fissure-mantle and mantle <b>springs.</b> Five big <b>fissure</b> <b>springs</b> ranged between 18 and 36 dm 3 • S-l form the source of the Bystrzyca Dusznicka river. In the drainage basin area over 100 outflows were recorded of which more than 20 were classified as spring sappings. The springs with the biggest average yield equal 2, 5 dm 3 • S-I found in the escarpment zone of the mentioned above overthrust; whereas alongside the eastern undercut there are many small springs and spring sappings of the valley and channel character. Value of the correlation coefficient between spring water temperature and its altitude is equal to r =- 0, 62. It testifies to the evident inversely proportional relationship between these factors. In the upper parts of the basin <b>fissure</b> <b>springs</b> dominate whereas in the lower parts - hotter mantle ones do. At the height-interval of 700 - 900 m there are either mantle <b>springs</b> or <b>fissure</b> ones. The conclusions which flow from this article prove the thesis that in the mountainous areas the following factors determine the regime and localization of springs: tectonics, geology and relief of the researched area.

60|$|Andrew {{fell over}} {{a block of}} ice, but he was up in a moment, for the cry came again, and when they had passed a black pool he saw {{what seemed to be}} the head and {{shoulders}} of a man projecting from a <b>fissure.</b> He <b>sprang</b> across a dangerous crack and as he ran he saw Graham's face turned toward him, with a strained, tense look. Carnally was a pace or two in front and had seized Graham's arm when Andrew came up and grasped his collar. They dragged him out of the crevice and set him, gasping breathlessly, on the ice, with the water running from one of his moccasins.|$|R
40|$|The Tatras are {{characterized}} by a high springability degree because of its considerable elevation above the surrounding Paleogene basins, deep cuttings in the massif by big river valleys and abundance of rainfall. The most common outflows are ftltration springs draining porous water of Quaternary deposits. <b>Fissure</b> <b>springs</b> which drain <b>fissure</b> water of crystalline core, lower Triassic quartzitic sandstones and sedimentary series with a smaller proportion of the carbonate rocks, are less numerous. The most productive outflows are springs and karst springs which are connected with the Tatra's carbonate sediments and, to a lesser degree, carbonate Eocene deposits (fig. l). The article includes the characteristics of these springs and karst springs which were monitored. Results of the stationary research, carried out since the 70 s, showed that the dynamics and chemism of water drained by the Tatra's karst springs are decisively influenced by {{the location of the}} alimentation area. As far as the efficiency of outflows is concerned all the karst springs qualified for the III Meinzer's class. However, the karst springs can be divided into karst springs draining areas within orographic catchment basin of lower outputs between 3 Q 0 - [...] 400 l/s (Chochołowskie and Bystre Springs) and those whose underground watersheds exceed orographic basin of the output between 500 - 700 Ifs (Lodowe, Goryczkowe, Olczyskie Springs). Carbonate Eocene is drained by the karst springs and springs of much lower outputs (IV and V Meinzer's class). W artykule przedstawiono charakterystykę źródeł obszaru tatrzańskiego.

40|$|The {{route of}} {{impending}} U. S. 281 from Mulberry Avenue to Tuxedo Avenue in San Antonio traverses {{the valley of}} Olmos Creek. The creek originates in {{the southern edge of}} the Edwards Plateau between Leon Creek and Salado Creek, and flows in a southeasterly direction to its confluence with the San Antonio River. Near that confluence is a series of large <b>fissure</b> <b>springs</b> occurring along the fault zone. The topography of the drainage area varies from rolling to hill, with the area under concern in this report being undeveloped and covered with brush (Corp of Engineers, US Army, 1972). The Olmos Dam is a concrete gravity type, owned and opera-ted by the City of San Antonio for flood protection of the city 2 ̆ 7 s business section. Its construction was prompted by the damage caused by a flood in 1921. Construction was started in 1925 and completed in 1926, An area such as the Olmos Basin with its springs would have been attractive to aboriginal inhabitants. Consequently in compliance with Senate Bill 58 and the Antiquities C ode of Texas, the right-of-way of the North Expressway was surveyed to determine what archaeological sites would be encountered. After a thorough reconnaissance in early September 1974, it seemed that the proposed highway avoided those places which seemed most likely to have seen prehistoric encampments; however, three areas peripheral to or near known Indian sites were regarded worthy of testing. Accordingly, under Antiquities committee Permit No. 67, archaeological testing was conducted from 17 September to 9 October 1974. The following pages constitute the report of that investigation...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the small}} towns {{developed}} by the British during the 'hey days' of the empire, reached by a branch road from the Kalka-Shimla road, has the beautiful hill-station of Kasauli where the Pasteur Institute produces the antirabies vaccine against mad dog-bite and, at the same time, treats victims who have fallen prey to the deadly disease, Hydrophobia. If {{the victim of a}} dog-bite is not treated in time - hydrophobia, or fear of water occurs, resulting in his inability to swallow water. For the dog set, Louis Pasteur performed invaluable service when he perfected his vaccine in the late 19th century. The Central Research institute in Kasauli set up in 1900, is the oldest in India, taking care of police and army dogs as well as their masters. Nearby another institute produces other vaccines: the Central Research Institute works on immunity from Typhoid, smallpox has been eradicated, chlorea and snake-bite. This region has also been a witness to Gurkha expansion at now to ruins of old Gurkha Fort at Subathu. At 3647 mt, the Choordhar or Choor Chandni peak, looms over the sylvan surroundings, and just across the ranges, is Shimla. The upper and lower Malls are the two principal roads that run along the length of Kasauli, a thick cover of pine, oak, rhododendron, where horse chestnut trees embrace the entire area. Traffic is restricted on these roads, which is the reason why Kasauli is the quietest hill station in India. The resort's colonial aura is underlined by gabled houses with picturesque facades, cobbled alleys and rows of neat orchards and elegant gardens. The solan Hills stand on a water - parting between the Sutlej and the Giri, a tributary of the Yamuna. South of solan is the Panchmunda ridge which is crossed by a railway through a tunnel (the longest in the Kalka - Shimla run) at Barog, where a series of <b>fissure</b> to <b>springs</b> occur at its flank. the first ridge above Kalka rises abruptly to pineclad Kasauli at a height of 1927 meters and is joined by a 12 km bridle path. The distance by road, however, from Kalka is 36.5 km.|$|R
