500|$|In August 2006, Carson joined Charlton Athletic on {{loan for}} the 2006–07 season, after Charlton failed {{in a bid}} for Norwich City goalkeeper Robert Green. Carson {{explained}} that [...] "Liverpool {{want me to get}} some experience and then hopefully <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> next season and be challenging Pepe [...] for the number one spot. There were a couple of Championship clubs interested but I need to be playing Premiership football because Robert Green, Ben Foster and Chris Kirkland are going to be playing week in, week out so I need to be performing." [...] He played in 36 of 38 Premier League matches, missing only the two matches against Liverpool due to the terms of his loan deal. Although he was unable to prevent Charlton from being relegated at the end of 2006–07, his outstanding form led him to be named as the Charlton Athletic Player of the Year, the first loan player ever to receive the award.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interview}} {{ended with}} Stewart suggesting, [...] "Maybe we can remove 'In Cramer We Trust' {{and go back}} to the fundamentals and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to making fart noises and funny faces." [...] Cramer responded: [...] "I think we make that deal right here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lane's {{practice}} of tackling opponents about {{the head and}} neck, which was then a legal technique, was sometimes called a [...] "Night Train Necktie". It later became known as a clothesline tackle and prohibited. He later explained the rationale for his {{practice of}} necktie tackling:My object is to stop the guy before he gains another inch[...] [...] [...] f I hit them in the legs they may fall forward for a first down[...] [...] [...] I grab them around the neck so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the bench and sit down.|$|E

6000|$|The emotion she had {{struggled}} with swept Hetty away. [...] "Go home!" [...] she said passionately. [...] "They {{wanted to kill}} you--and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>go</b> <b>back</b> now. If I did, they would know I had warned you--and believe--Can't you understand, Larry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Manuel obeyed {{the urgent}} summons, and Mrs. Redmond, half dressed, with {{streaming}} hair and terror-stricken face, fled into Pauline's arms, crying incoherently, [...] "Save me! Keep me! <b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to him; he said I was a burden and a curse, and wished I {{never had been}} born!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Weld {{resigned}} {{the governorship}} on July 29, 1997, to devote his full attention to campaigning for the ambassadorship, even though few {{thought he would}} be successful; there was speculation that he was really resigning because he had become tired of serving as governor. A bipartisan majority of Senators signed letters demanding that Helms advance his nomination, but Helms refused. After an intensive six-week battle, Weld conceded defeat and withdrew his nomination on September 15, 1997. He commented sarcastically, [...] "I asked President Clinton to withdraw my name from the Senate so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to New England, where no one has to approach the government on bended knee to ask it to do its duty." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 19, 2007, Hovind {{was sentenced}} to ten years in prison with three years {{probation}} and ordered to pay the federal government restitution of over $600,000. During the sentencing phase, a tearful Hovind, hoping to avoid prison, told the court, [...] "If it's just money the IRS wants, {{there are thousands of}} people out there who will help pay the money they want so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> out there and preach." [...] However, Hovind's court room behavior was in stark contrast to phone calls he made while in jail and played by the prosecution. The tapes, posted online by the Pensacola News Journal, included one conversation with Hovind and Eric Hovind, who were planning to hide a motor vehicle title and property deeds to prevent the government from collecting the property to pay for owed debt. At sentencing, he denied being a [...] "tax protester", but the prosecution, an IRS spokesman, and the Pensacola News Journal used the term to describe him.|$|E
2500|$|Following protests {{angry about}} the death of Tara, Whedon and the writing team made a {{decision}} to keep Willow gay. In 2002, he told The Advocate about the possibility of Willow having a relationship with a man, [...] "We do that now, and we will be burned alive. And possibly justifiably. We can't have Willow say, 'Oh, cured now, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to cock!' Willow {{is not going to be}} straddling that particular fence. She will just be gay." [...] Kennedy is markedly different from Tara. She is younger, outspoken, and aggressively pursues Willow, who hesitates to become involved again. When they first kiss in the episode [...] "The Killer in Me", Willow's realization that she let Tara go reacts with a curse put upon her by another witch named Amy Madison (Elizabeth Anne Allen), turning Willow into Warren, Tara's murderer. The spell is broken when Willow acknowledges her guilt and Kennedy kisses her again. Kennedy expresses that she does not understand the value of magic and assumes it involves tricks, not the all-consuming energy that Willow is capable of. When Willow eventually exhibits what power she has, it briefly frightens Kennedy. Willow worries about becoming sexually intimate with Kennedy, unsure of what may transpire if she loses control of herself.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am very glad," [...] the man said; [...] "heartily glad. I shall {{miss you}} sorely. I {{do not know}} what I should have done without you when I first lost poor Jane and the kids. But now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to my old ways again." ...|$|E

[...] "Since 1927 I have carried inside me the material of this book. Do you suppose it's possible that I could have a miscarriage after such a period of gestation? ... But Larry, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>go</b> <b>back</b> on what I've written.

6000|$|Catherine quietly rose. [...] "We won't discuss it," [...] she said, with resignation. [...] "I {{knew you}} would refuse me." [...] She {{approached}} the door.

6000|$|... "It is {{the present}} {{which has become}} such a problem," [...] she went on. [...] "I was driven to leave home and I don't think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> again.

6000|$|It is strange. The Sphinx had spoken, yet {{without much}} enlightenment. [...] "Now look at me," [...] I commanded. [...] "If I went away, you couldn't follow.

6000|$|... "Naturally, after this, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>go</b> <b>back</b> as {{a detective}} to Marvillier's. But, {{on the large}} scale on which I have learned to work since I first had the {{pleasure}} of making your delightful acquaintance, this matters little. To say the truth, I begin to feel detective work a cut or two below me. I am now a gentleman of means and leisure. Besides, the extra knowledge of your movements which I have acquired in your house has helped still further to give me various holds upon you. So the fluke will be true to his own pet lamb.

5000|$|The film's {{depiction}} of the violence and sexuality between Kang-do {{and the woman who}} claims to be his long-lost mother have provoked intense reactions and is debated by critics.

5000|$|Notably, a few {{songs on}} A New Testament {{originated}} from Owen's time in Girls: [...] "Overcoming Me" [...] was first written in January 2008, [...] "Stephen" [...] around 2010, while [...] "Oh My Love" [...] first premiered in July 2010. Owens commented on this, saying, [...] "For me, {{the songs are}} good when they preserve a moment that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> always <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to. They serve as a little porthole to that very strong, real memory I had when I wrote it and I like that." [...] In addition, despite the album's forays into gospel music, the opening number [...] "My Trouble Heart" [...] re-writes Peter, Paul and Mary's 1962 song [...] "Early in the Morning" [...] from a godless perspective.
