In this paper, a new recommender system based on multi-features is introduced. Demographic and psychographic features are used to asses similarities between users. The model is built on a collaborative filtering method and addresses three problems: sparsity, scalability and cold-star. The sparsity problem is tackled by integrating users-documents relevant information within meta-clusters. The scalability and the cold-start problems are considered by using a suitable probability model calculated on meta-cluster information. Moreover, a weight similarity measure is introduced in order to take into account dynamic human being preferences behaviour. A prediction score for generating recommendations is proposed based on the target user previous behaviour and his/her neighbourhood preferences on the target document...|$|R

40|$|HRT-HOOD has methodological {{strengths}} that {{deserve to}} be preserved {{in the face of}} the commercial decline of HOOD technology. The UML (Unified Modeling Language) meta-model, on the other hand, has a level of flexibility that makes it an especially attractive platform to express the specific real-time design minded features of the HRT-HOOD method. The object-oriented connotation of the method that results from mapping HRT-HOOD onto UML raises methodological issues that we <b>deem</b> of <b>interest</b> to the real-time community at large. This paper discusses three such issues in particular: the prevalence of objects over classes in real-time design, with the consequent inversion of the standard object-oriented development paradigm; the need to derive classes "by example", which arises from the demand to allow multiple, yet static, instances of real-time objects initially designed as singleton; the opportunity of reuse-oriented component-based real-time development, which descends from using interfaces instead of classes as the target of associations among objects...|$|R
40|$|In the hypophysectomized-ovariectomized-adrenalectomized hooded Norway rat, {{growth of}} the mammary ducts can be induced with {{oestrone}} + somatotrophin + corticoids; lobule-alveolar development ensues if {{in addition to the}} above combination progesterone + prolactin is also administered. On withdrawing these hormones the local injection of prolactin then causes secretion in the underlying mammary gland, but only when corticoids are administered systemically. It has been demonstrated by Lyons, Li & Johnson [1958] (see also review by Lyons[1958]) that the hormone combination of oestrogen, somatotrophin, deoxycorti¬ costerone acetate and a glucocorticoid will induce mammary duct growth in the triply-operated (hypophysectomized-ovariectomized-adrenalectomized) rat (Long-Evans strain). When, moreover, this hormone combination was supplemented with progesterone and prolactin full lobule-alveolar development occurred. Milk secretion could then be induced by stopping the injections of ovarian steroids and somato¬ trophin, while continuing those of prolactin and corticoids. It was <b>deemed</b> of <b>interest</b> to repeat and extend these studies in another strain of rat; and some observations on hooded Norway rats are reported below...|$|R

But even if the decline in the late 1950s meant an increasing degree of intervention from the government, {{there was no evidence of}} any other political change. Even the Scottish Council's inquiry into the Scottish economy in 1960 was specific: [...] "The proposal for a Scottish Parliament ... implies constitutional changes of a kind that place it beyond our remit although it is fair to say that we do not regard it as a solution".|$|R

It may sensibly operate within the large universe of interventions that do not implicate the subject matter of previous decisions. Moreover, Congress may sensibly operate within the small universe of interventions that do implicate the subject matter of past rulings if the Court in these decisions indicated the permissibility of a Spending Clause substitute or if Congress <b>deems</b> its <b>interest</b> sufficiently important that it is worth taking the modest risk of causing the Court to revisit Dole...|$|R
