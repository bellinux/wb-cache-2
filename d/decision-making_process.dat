40|$|<b>Decision-making</b> <b>processes</b> {{involving}} multiple stakeholders can {{be rather}} cumbersome, turbulent and lengthy. The stance of some stakeholders, upholding their individual interests, can slowdown or even block such processes.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the <b>decision-making</b> <b>process</b> that the public {{authority}} is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent fact category. If the process is complex and much discretion is accorded to the authority by the empowering statute, the court is unlikely to find that a precedent fact is involved. On the other hand, where an administrative decision interferes with an individual's liberty, the matter will be considered within the precedent fact category unless Parliament has explicitly excluded judicial review. If Parliament intends to do so, it must make its meaning crystal clear.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began {{organizing}} {{the administration of}} Northern Dobruja, through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession {{played a part in}} the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes, offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the nationalization of land once owned by the Muhajir Balkan, and the appropriation of uncultivated plots (miriè). Kogălniceanu also advised the local administration to overrepresent existing Romanian communities in the <b>decision-making</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, time {{management}} and decision-making have become well-established topics in modern working life. However, little research {{attention has been given}} to the link between the two. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between time management factors and <b>decision-making</b> <b>processes.</b> This research was specifically focused on identifying which aspects of <b>decision-making</b> <b>processes</b> are related to time management factors. It was predicted that <b>decision-making</b> <b>processes</b> will be more efficient when employees have time management related competencies and work in an environment that supports time management. A research model was built based on previous research in this field and tested using bivariate correlations, t-tests, and multiple-regression analyses. Five organizations in New Zealand and three in Russia participated in the research, contributing a total of 164 employees. Results indicated, as predicted, that the effectiveness of <b>decision-making</b> <b>processes</b> partially depends on time management factors.

5|$|Jadid's {{government}} {{has been referred to}} as Syria's most radical government in history. He initiated rash and radical policies internally and externally, and tried to overturn Syrian society from the top to the bottom. While Assad and Jadid agreed ideologically, they did not agree on how to implement these beliefs in practice. The Military Committee, which had been the officers' key <b>decision-making</b> <b>process</b> during 1963–66, lost its central institutional authority under Jadid because the fight against the Aflaqites was over – the key reason for the committee's existence in the first place. While Jadid never acquired, or took the offices of Prime Minister or President, instead opting to rule through the office of Assistant Secretary of the Regional Command, he was the undisputed ruler of Syria from 1966 to 1970. Before the 1966 coup, Jadid had controlled the Syrian armed forces through his post as Head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, but from 1966 onwards Jadid became absorbed with running the country, and in his place, Assad was given the task of controlling the armed forces. This would later prove to be a mistake, and lead to Jadid's downfall in the 1970 Corrective Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} in Singapore, {{in which the}} President of Singapore is directly elected by popular vote, were introduced through amendments to the Constitution of Singapore in 1991. Potential candidates for office have to fulfil stringent qualifications {{set out in the}} Constitution. Certificates of eligibility are issued by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). In particular, the PEC must assess that they are persons of integrity, good character and reputation; and if they have not previously held certain key government appointments or were the chief executives of profitable companies with shareholders' equity of an average of S$500 million for the most recent three years in that office, they must demonstrate to the PEC that they held a position of comparable seniority and responsibility in the public or private sector that has given them experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs. The general strictness of the required qualifications led to the walkovers in 3 out of 5 of the presidential elections, as presidents S. R. Nathan and Halimah Yacob were the sole candidates to receive a certificate of eligibility from the PEC in their respective years in the 1999, 2005 and 2017 elections. The stringent criteria, the transparency of the PEC's <b>decision-making</b> <b>process</b> and the practice of political parties endorsing candidates have drawn criticism.|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this <b>decision-making</b> <b>process</b> were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E

A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999.

In contrast, stakeholders participating in {{open source software}} development (OSSD) projects often {{do not understand the}} <b>decision-making</b> <b>processes</b> at work, as these are either captured poorly or remain hidden. Using Python as the case study of an OSS project where the processes are well-documented, this work 2 ̆ 7 mined 2 ̆ 7 the <b>decision-making</b> <b>processes</b> used to develop Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), to study whether the extracted process complied with the publicly advertised <b>process</b> for <b>decision-making</b> (i. e., the prescribed process). In doing so we investigate whether the previously observed normative-descriptive dichotomy in {{proprietary software}} development, between the two theories - normative decision theory (i. e., what is expected) and descriptive decision theory (i. e., what is done) applies to the domain of OSSD. We also investigate whether the <b>decision-making</b> <b>processes</b> are provided at the right level of granularity (fine vs. coarse) for different stakeholders. Our findings confirm the lack of process compliance in Python, thus confirming dichotomy. Thus, it validates the relevance of using decision-theory to study <b>decision-making</b> <b>processes</b> in OSSD. Additionally, it confirms the inadequacy of the granularity-level of the available process. We also discuss the implication for <b>decision-making</b> practice and <b>processes</b> in the Python community...|$|R
