5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on the}} presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
5|$|In all versions, Khandoba {{returns to}} Jejuri {{with his new}} wife and faces the wrath of Mhalsa. Many songs tell about the {{confrontations}} of Mhalsa and Banai. In some songs, Mhalsa complains about Khandoba's infatuation with the impure Banai. The cantankerous Mhalsa grumbles how Banai has polluted the house by her uncouth ways and suggests that Banai {{should be returned to}} the wilderness again. The songs sing how the vegetarian, high-caste Mhalsa is forced to catch fish and eat in the same plate as the non-vegetarian low-caste Banai. Mhalsa is portrayed blaming Banai for the problems in the palace and talking about her superiority to Banai. Banai retorts by saying that Khandoba came to her, mesmerized by her beauty and became her servant. A frustrated Khandoba leaves the palace on a hunting trip after Mhalsa and Banai quarrel about who will embroider a shawl for him and marries Rambhai. The songs also narrate how ultimately the wives <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in harmony and aid each other. For example, a song sings how Mhalsa and Banai come together and celebrate the festival of Diwali with Khandoba at Jejuri.|$|E

5|$|On 30 May {{the final}} order was received, {{although}} due to shipping losses {{it was not}} possible to evacuate everyone. In order to maintain fairness, each battalion was allotted a certain number of men who would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> and defend the embarkation beaches to allow the others to get away. The 28th Battalion was allocated 230 men to embark, while six officers and 144 men would have to stay behind. A large number of men volunteered to remain, and at midnight the remainder headed down to the beach and were taken off on a landing ship two hours later. The battalion suffered 243 casualties during the brief defence of the island, including 74 men killed and 102 men wounded. A further 67 were captured, of which 46 were wounded. For his leadership of the battalion during the fighting on Crete, Dittmer received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
5|$|These {{non-human}} antibodies {{are recognized}} as foreign by the human immune system and may be rapidly cleared from the body, provoke an allergic reaction, or both. To avoid this, parts of the antibody can be replaced with human amino acid sequences, or pure human antibodies can be engineered. If the constant region is replaced with the human form, the antibody is termed chimeric and the substem used was -xi-. Part of the variable regions may also be substituted, in which case it is called humanized and -zu- was used; typically, everything is replaced except the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), the three loops of amino acid sequences at the outside of each variable region that bind to the target structure, although some other residues may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> non-human {{in order to achieve}} good binding. Partly chimeric and partly humanized antibodies used -xizu-. These three substems did not indicate the foreign species used for production. Thus, the human/mouse chimeric antibody basiliximab ends in -ximab just as does the human/macaque antibody gomiliximab. Purely human antibodies used -u-.|$|E
5|$|While some {{ships and}} units such as No 49 Squadron {{returned}} to the UK, most personnel had to remain on Christmas Island. The Minister of Supply gave assurances that no personnel would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> on the island {{for more than a}} year unless absolutely necessary, in which case home leave would be given. To maintain morale, units were given periodic briefings on the importance of their work. Junior officers took a keen interest in the welfare of the men and their families at home, since they were not permitted to bring them to the island. An efficient mail system was maintained to allow them to keep in contact. The quality of Army rations was better than at any other British base. The men were given one day a week off work, and sports such as soccer, cricket, tennis, volleyball sailing, fishing and water skiing were organised. Leave was provided that could be taken in Fiji, Hawaii or the Gilbert Islands. To relieve the monotony, some Army personnel ashore exchanged places with some Navy personnel afloat. A Christmas Island Broadcasting Service was established with nightly radio programs.|$|E

One such man was AWOL for two weeks while keeping an eye on some boxes shipped by families of soldiers from Eufaula, but when he was finally able to obtain transportation for himself and his cargo to the regiment, he was absolved of all charges and nothing further was said.|$|E
25|$|The MDS at the Schoonhord {{was again}} {{captured}} by the Germans {{in the early hours}} of the 22 September. The other nine buildings being used by the medics were by now, almost constantly under fire, and unable to be evacuated many of the wounded were killed in their beds. Orders were issued that the wounded would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> at battalion aid posts, as moving them to the MDS was impossible in the circumstances. By now food and water supplies were running out, to solve the water shortage, central heating systems were drained and the Dental Officer shot two sheep with a borrowed sten gun to help feed the wounded.|$|E
25|$|When Emperor Wu {{wanted to}} {{reassign}} Jia Chong {{to guard the}} Guanzhong region, Xun Xu told his colleague Feng Dan (馮紞) that their status in the imperial court depended on Jia Chong's presence so they should {{try to stop the}} emperor from sending Jia Chong out of the imperial capital, Luoyang. Xun Xu thought of persuading Emperor Wu to arrange a marriage between Sima Zhong, the crown prince, and Jia Chong's daughter, Jia Nanfeng. In this way, Jia Chong, as the crown prince's father-in-law, would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in Luoyang. Xun Xu and Feng Dan then sang praises of Jia Chong's daughter in front of Emperor Wu and managed to convince him to arrange the marriage. Many officials were disgusted by Xun Xu's fawning behaviour and called him a sycophant.|$|E

25|$|On many systems, a program's {{virtual address}} may refer to data {{which is not}} {{currently}} in memory. The layer of indirection provided by virtual addressing allows the operating system to use other data stores, like a hard drive, to store what would otherwise <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in main memory (RAM). As a result, operating systems can allow programs to use more memory than the system has physically available. When a program needs data which is not currently in RAM, the CPU signals to the kernel that this has happened, and the kernel responds by writing the contents of an inactive memory block to disk (if necessary) {{and replacing it with}} the data requested by the program. The program can then be resumed from the point where it was stopped. This scheme is generally known as demand paging.|$|E
25|$|Caesar was {{acclaimed}} Imperator in 60 and 45 BC. In the Roman Republic, {{this was}} an honorary title assumed by certain military commanders. After an especially great victory, army {{troops in the field}} would proclaim their commander imperator, an acclamation necessary for a general to apply to the Senate for a triumph. However, he also wanted to stand for consul, the most senior magistracy in the republic. If he were to celebrate a triumph, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> a soldier and stay outside the city until the ceremony, but to stand for election he would need to lay down his command and enter Rome as a private citizen. He could not do both in the time available. He asked the senate for permission to stand in absentia, but Cato blocked the proposal. Faced with the choice between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.|$|E
25|$|Raeder {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} Hitler on 21 December 1939. He informed Hitler that naval reconnaissance operations were impossible. In response Göring allowed X. Fliegerkorps to be seconded to the navy and for the transfer of Dornier Do 17 bombers. Admiral Otto Schniewind compiled a memo on 15 January 1940 entitled Organisation and Expansion of the Naval Air Units of Commander in Chief, Navy. Schniewind noted only 14 Staffeln (Squadrons) were {{at the disposal of}} the navy. Schniewind argued that X. Fliegerkorps be given responsibility for air-sea operations to assist naval–controlled unit. He also asked for an allocation of the new Dornier Do 217 bomber for naval use. Göring was trying to limit naval squadrons to nine multi purpose and six reconnaissance units but did not resist the suggestion X. Fliegerkorps should be engaged in anti-shipping operations, but he refused the navy's use of the Do 217 and insisted the He 115 would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> sufficient on the grounds the type would go to the newly established X. Fliegerkorps. On 4 April 1940 Göring implemented another program to reduce the naval air forces from 12 to nine Junkers Ju 88s in a Staffel and 11 Do 17s per Dornier-staffel and nine in each Blohm & Voss BV 138-equipped Staffel. The proposal was put to the Naval Staff on the eve of Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Denmark and Norway. In the event, the campaign proved what even small air strength could accomplish against shipping and enemy naval forces.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First Balkan War in October 1912, the German High Command decided to create a Mediterranean Division in an attempt to exert influence in the area. The new squadron consisted of Goeben and the light cruiser the two ships left Kiel on 4 November and arrived off Constantinople on 15 November. The ships visited several Mediterranean ports, including Venice, Pola, and Naples. The First Balkan War ended on 30 May 1913, and there was some consideration given to withdrawing the pair to German waters. However, the conflict reignited less than a month later on 29 June, meaning the ships would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in the area.|$|E
500|$|Bart and Milhouse <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> inside The Simpsons {{house when}} an ozone hole moves over Springfield. The two dress up as ladies and {{jump on the}} bed, singing [...] "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves". When Homer comes in abruptly, Bart falls off {{of the bed and}} lands on one of Homer's bowling balls and breaks his coccyx. Dr. Hibbert informs Homer and Marge that Bart will have to use a {{wheelchair}} until the bone has healed. When Bart arrives at Springfield Elementary School the following day, he finds that he cannot enter because the school lacks ramps for the disabled. As Principal Skinner considers a ramp for the school, mafia boss Fat Tony emerges and suggests that his construction company would be a good choice of company to build it. Although the new ramp system almost immediately collapses, Fat Tony informs Skinner that the construction supposedly cost US$200,000 and that the school will still have to pay. In response, Principal Skinner decides to close Springfield Elementary due to lack of funds (having used them to pay off Fat Tony and thus avoid brutal mob reprisals).|$|E
500|$|On 29 October Yavuz bombarded Sevastopol in {{her first}} {{operation}} against Imperial Russia, though the Ottoman Empire was not yet {{at war with the}} Entente; Souchon conducted the operation to force Turkey into the war on the side of Germany. A [...] shell struck the ship in the after funnel, but it failed to detonate and did negligible damage. Two other hits inflicted minor damage. The ship and her escorts passed through an inactive Russian minefield during the bombardment. As she returned to Turkish waters, Yavuz came across the Russian minelayer [...] which scuttled herself with 700 mines on board. During the engagement the escorting Russian destroyer [...] was damaged by two of Yavuzs secondary battery [...] shells. In response to the bombardment, Russia declared war on 1 November, thus forcing the Ottomans into the wider world war. France and Great Britain bombarded the Turkish fortresses guarding the Dardanelles on 3 November and formally declared war two days later. From this engagement, the Russians drew the conclusion that the entire Black Sea Fleet would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> consolidated so it could not be defeated in detail (one ship at a time) by Yavuz.|$|E
