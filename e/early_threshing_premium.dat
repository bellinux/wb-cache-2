50|$|<b>Early</b> <b>threshing</b> {{machines}} were hand-fed and horse-powered. They were small by today's standards and {{were about the}} size of an upright piano. Later {{machines were}} steam-powered, driven by a portable engine or traction engine. Isaiah Jennings, a skilled inventor, created a small thresher that doesn't harm the straw in the process. In 1834, John Avery and Hiram Abial Pitts devised significant improvements to a machine that automatically threshes and separates grain from chaff, freeing farmers from a slow and laborious process. Avery and Pitts were granted United States patent #542 on December 29, 1837.|$|R

5000|$|Wilmont House, in {{the grounds}} of the park, was built in the early 1760s by Scottish farming family the Stewarts, who {{were among the first to}} grow carrots on a large scale in the early 19th century. In 1811 an <b>early</b> <b>threshing</b> machine was erected on the property. The last Stewart {{associated}} with the house was James, who mortgaged the property to the Northern Banking Company in 1844, ending almost a century of family connections. The estate changed hands several times before James Bristow, a director of the [...] Northern Banking Company, was granted a lease to the property in 1858. He commissioned the building of the present Wilmont House (in 1859), designed by one of Belfast's most important Victorian architects, Thomas Jackson. Bristow's initials are inscribed in stone on the north side of the house. The estate was sold to Robert Reade in 1897 following the deaths of the Bristow male heirs. After he died in 1913, his son sold it to Sir Thomas Dixon for £21,500 in 1919. Dixon was a prosperous Ulster businessman who served as High Sheriff of Antrim and was knighted. Lady Dixon became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her work for the armed forces during World War I. Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, was a guest in 1935 and General Collins of the United States Army was billeted at Wilmont House during World War II. Sir Thomas Dixon died in 1950 and in 1959 Wilmont House and the estate was presented to Belfast Corporation “for the greatest good of the citizens of the City of Belfast” by Lady Dixon in memory of her husband. The park opened the same year. From 1963 to 1988 Wilmont House served as a nursing home. Lady Dixon died in 1964, aged 92. The fountain situated in the park was renovated and a new fountain commissioned for the Queen's Golden Jubilee year. The Walled Garden used to provide fruit and vegetables for the house, which has a dummy window, painted on the brickwork to balance the exterior.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{mechanical}} devices used in agriculture was the seed drill invented by Jethro Tull around 1700. The seed drill allowed more uniform spacing of seed and planting depth than hand methods, increasing yields and saving valuable seed. Mechanized agriculture greatly increased {{in the late eighteenth}} and early nineteenth centuries with horse drawn reapers and horse powered threshing machines. [...] By the late nineteenth century steam power was applied to threshing and steam tractors appeared. Internal combustion began being used for tractors in the <b>early</b> twentieth century. <b>Threshing</b> and harvesting was originally done with attachments for tractors, but in the 1930s independently powered combine harvesters were in use.|$|R
5000|$|Me-Åkernes was {{originally}} a single farm, but in 1881 its fields were divided in two halves between two related couples. The house and farm buildings were shared in common, but each couple maintained their own livestock. There {{could be as}} many as 12-14 people living simultaneously at the farm. Each family would support livestock of four cattle and 40 sheep by supplementing fodder in the winter season by use of seaweed. The seaweed was treated in warm water, minced, and barley flour added. Although recently they grew potatoes and barley, a field area named [...] "Rugåkeren" [...] (the Rye Field) indicates that rye was grown there in <b>earlier</b> times. To <b>thresh</b> the grain they used a manual threshing machine.|$|R
5000|$|North Dakota's first {{permanent}} settlers {{arrived in}} 1812 from the Earl of Selkirk’s colony in neighboring Manitoba, Canada. As farmers, {{they were more}} advanced than many of their contemporaries {{in the rest of}} the United States, having adopted sophisticated farming methods and machinery. Many of these implements, including an <b>early</b> McCormick Deering <b>threshing</b> machine, have found their way to the restored Pioneer Village in Rugby.In 1931, the town of Rugby erected a 15 ft tall rock obelisk marking the [...] "Geographical Center of North America". This was moved to a slightly different location in or after 1971. According to a listing by the U.S. Geological Survey, Rugby is actually approximately 15 mi from the geographic center of North America (6 mi west of Balta), and even this designation carries no official status.|$|R

50|$|North of the village, {{just south}} of New Moor Farm and just {{to the west of}} Walworth Road, is the site of a post-medieval lime kiln. The disused {{limestone}} quarry called Quarry Hole, where Newton Lane meets Walworth Road, is post-medieval also, and it once had an associated lime kiln. 0.9 mi north-west of Walworth, between Newton Lane and the A68 road, is the post-medieval Paradise Cottage, once known as Hood's Cottage, with an associated well. There is an overgrown well {{on the west side of}} Walworth Road and level with the castle gate, at the north end of Tomtit Wood. It is made of stone with a trough to collect water. Estimated to be about 0.31 mi west of Walworth village, and halfway between Walworth and Denton, is the site of a medieval mill. The evidence for this is from field names on tithe maps and manuscripts. There is a late 18th- or early 19th-century listed ice house to the east of Quarry End, at Quarry Hole. It is built into a bank, and has a partially-collapsed barrel-vaulted passage connected to a deep, egg-shaped cavity intended for the ice. It is built of coursed rubble and the inside is brick-lined. On the east side of Walworth Grange are a Grade II listed late 18th- or <b>early</b> 19th-century <b>threshing</b> barn and gin gang. They are built of limestone with pantiled roofs, and the gin gang is semi-octagonal with square piers and later infilled walls.|$|R
50|$|As stated, the old castle {{was robbed}} of stone {{to build the}} dam and {{threshing}} mill in the <b>early</b> 19th century. <b>Threshing</b> is {{the separation of the}} grain of a crop from the straw. Originally by hand, the Scot Andrew Meikle of East Linton in 1786 developed a threshing machine, housed in a threshing mill. The corn was fed in at the first floor level and rollers with grid-like brushes on separated the grain from the straw. The grain passed through the grid. The grain was bagged up for the millstones, the straw taken to the straw barn. A gathering or mill pond, leats and sluices were needed. The water supply came from the hill above and remains of the control sluice are still visible, with an overflow running through a pipe to the Montfode Burn and the 'spent' water from the mill leaving via a substantial stone lined outflow that exited below the main farm buildings. A turbine may have been used as no signs of a waterwheel and associated equipment exist.|$|R
40|$|Humans {{have long}} had a fear of sharks. As one of the {{greatest}} marine predators, sharks easily receive a reputation as killing machines; in reality, however, sharks have far more to fear from humans than humans do from sharks. In 2005, there were only sixty-one confirmed cases of unprovoked shark attacks on humans worldwide. Meanwhile, humans kill roughly 100 million sharks for their fins each year. The past three decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in the international shark trade, resulting in an estimated eighty-nine percent decrease in some Atlantic shark species, such as the hammerhead. Given sharks’ place as apex predators in the marine food chain, their disappearance from the world’s oceans poses a major ecological concern. They play a vital part in maintaining ecological balance by weeding out sick and unhealthy members of both predatory and prey species and leaving only healthy members of those species to breed. As apex predators, sharks are not used to mortality threats and thus do not naturally need high rates of population growth to sustain their populations. Their slow growth and maturation, long reproductive cycles, low fecundity, and long life spans prevent sharks from adapting to rising mortality rates resulting from exploitation by global fisheries. Shark populations, increasing at the low rate of one to two percent each year, cannot compete with the significantly larger rate of population decrease caused by overfishing. In the case of the spiny dogfish, which increases naturally {{at an annual rate of}} 2. 3 %, the 75 % decline in reproductive females since 1988 has led to a record low number of pups since 1997, as well as a decline in pup size and survival rate. Taking into account the combination of low reproductive potential and current fishing mortality rates, the Regional Stock Assessment Review Committee (SARC) issued a projection in 2003 forecasting a collapse of spiny dogfish stock. Thresher shark populations face a similar threat. After the expansion of thresher fisheries in the <b>early</b> 1980 s, <b>thresher</b> populations have steadily declined. With females giving birth to only four to six pups annually, the species has not been able to keep up with the mortality rates from overfishing. In response to the disturbing trend of plummeting shark populations, several international organizations have developed guidelines and regulations to help conserve and manage shark populations throughout the world. The three international measures most relevant to shark conservation are IPOA-Sharks developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), CITES, and CMS. Each agreement operates independently from the others, with its own strengths and weaknesses. Although efficient implementation of each agreement would allow all three to act in concert to improve shark conservation, none of the agreements are currently operating efficiently to protect shark populations. The governing bodies must begin to address the weaknesses in these agreements to increase their individual effectiveness and their overall ability to protect sharks from the threats of international trade. IPOA-Sharks is a voluntary measure designed by the FAO to promote the conservation and management of shark populations worldwide, with its ultimate focus on sustainable use. IPOA-Sharks applies to all shark species and provides a framework for shark conservation and management. It emphasizes the need for increased research on the biology and identification of sharks, as well as increased record-keeping and reporting of catch and trade data. IPOA-Sharks calls on countries, in whose waters sharks are caught, to develop, implement, and monitor national plans of action (Shark Plans) consistent with the framework of IPOA-Sharks. Although the language used in IPOA-Sharks urges states to implement its recommended measures, it provides neither rewards for those states that cooperate nor sanctions against those that do not. As a result, few states have bothered to fully implement Shark Plans—by October 2004 only 5 out of 113 nations reporting shark landings to the FAO have developed either shark assessment reports (SARs) or Shark Plans. Moreover, catch and trade data that countries actually reported to the FAO are estimated to be grossly inaccurate due to a combination of under-reporting of legal trade and unreported black market trade. Analyses conducted by both internal and independent researchers have concluded that the total estimated catch is likely twice that of the FAO recorded catch. Finally, successful implementation of IPOA-Sharks suffers from insufficient biological research, training, and enforcement of national Shark Plans due to a shortage of funding. CITES, which restricts international trade that threatens the survival of endangered species, faces some of the same factors hampering implementation of IPOA-Sharks—reliance on national regulations, insufficient funding and training, and black market trade. CITES’ ability to protect sharks is further limited because it extends only to those species involved in international trade and listed on one of its three Appendices. Currently, out of the 197 shark species identified as endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and the CITES Animals Committee, only three shark species are listed on Appendix II: the great white, basking, and whale sharks. CMS, which was formed to protect migratory species from endangerment, faces a similar limitation. Sharks are highly migratory species, and CMS thus has the potential to offer them protection. Yet CMS, like CITES, covers only those species included in one of the two CMS Appendices. Unfortunately, the CMS Appendices currently include only three shark species: the great white shark and basking shark on Appendices I and II, and the whale shark on Appendix II. The general weaknesses of IPOA-Sharks, CITES, and CMS result from limited coverage of shark species, difficulties in obtaining national implementation of conservation measures, insufficient funding for research and training at a national level, and black market trade in shark products. To address these shortcomings, the governing bodies of IPOA-Sharks, CITES, and CMS must find ways to both compel and encourage states to implement shark conservation measures and report shark trade data accurately to the FAO. The governing bodies can address issues of black market trade by tightening enforcement through increasing supervision of fisheries and by relying on RFMOs to help manage shark fishing. The governing bodies can mitigate funding problems by applying to the Global Environment Facility for assistance in financing, training, research, and enforcement programs. Finally, CITES and CMS can increase their coverage of shark species by acquiring more accurate data on shark biology, populations, and trade; mitigating the effect of reservations on conservation efforts; promoting public awareness; and increasing lobbying efforts targeting parties to CITES and CMS. By adopting these proposals, existing shark conservation measures provided by IPOA-Sharks, CITES, and CMS can more effectively afford sharks protection from overexploitation in international trade. Part II of this Comment provides a biological explanation of why sharks are especially susceptible to overfishing. Part III examines the threat of international trade to shark populations—namely, directed catch for their meat and fins, and bycatch in tuna and swordfish longline fisheries. Part IV describes current international measures promoting conservation and management of sharks, focusing on IPOA-Sharks, CITES, and CMS. This section also discusses the shortcomings of these measures. Finally, Part V suggests several steps to more effectively implement existing shark conservation measures. Increasing the efficient implementation of existing international shark trade regulations will allow the international community to better protect threatened shark populations and retain a valuable marine resource for future generations to enjoy...|$|R
