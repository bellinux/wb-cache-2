50|$|The {{global market}} for {{exchange-traded}} {{stock market index}} options is notionally valued by the Bank for International Settlements at $368,900 million in 2005.A stock <b>index</b> <b>option</b> provides the right to trade a specific stock index at a specified price by a specified expiration date. A call option on a stock index gives {{you the right to}} buy the index, and a put option on a stock index gives you the right to sell the index. Options on stock indexes are similar to exchange-traded funds (ETF's), the difference being that ETF's values change throughout the day whereas the value on stock index options change {{at the end of each}} trading day. Therefore, profit/loss on an <b>index</b> <b>option</b> is based on the market's closing price for the day, not on any price during the market's open hours. If an <b>index</b> <b>option</b> is exercised before the close of the market, the buyer of the option will in- or out-of-the-money for an additional amount equal to the difference between the closing price and the exercise price. If the market closes above the intra-day exercise price, then the option will accrue an additional loss, and if the market closes below the intra-day exercise price, the option will accrue an additional gain. For this reason, index options are typically closed out after the market has closed.|$|E

Unlike stock <b>index</b> <b>options</b> such as the S&P 100 <b>index</b> <b>options</b> in the US market, the S&P/ASX 200 <b>index</b> <b>options</b> are traded infrequently and in low volumes, and have a long maturity cycle.

Moreover, implied call volatility is nearly an unbiased forecast of future volatility...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{introduction}} of derivatives on the underlying stock is a debatable topic among the researchers. The issue is quite controversial as contradictory results have been obtained by researchers in various stock markets. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the volatility and the liquidity effect on the underlying stock after the introduction of <b>index</b> <b>options.</b> We have investigated volatility and liquidity effect by collecting sample data from the stock markets of India, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, only markets which are offering <b>index</b> <b>options</b> in Asia.   Applying the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model, we have examined the conditional volatility of intraday (high frequency) returns for each stock market, before and after the introduction of <b>index</b> <b>options.</b> We have also examined the liquidity effect through t-test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. We used t-test to determine the mean differences between the trading volume of pre-index and post-index options periods.     By comparing the estimated parameters and the coefficient of conditional volatility in pre and post period of <b>index</b> <b>options</b> introductions, we have examined that the derivatives trading dramatically increases the persistence of the conditional volatility for all the selected stock markets. We also observed mixed evidence in context to liquidity effect. In the stock exchanges of Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, we found that the respective markets become more liquid in the post <b>index</b> <b>options</b> periods in contrast to pre <b>index</b> <b>options</b> period. In these markets trading volume increased significantly after the introduction of <b>index</b> <b>options.</b>   On the other hand, India, Malaysia and Singapore stock markets show no liquidity effect in the post-index option period.   Finally, the empirical results of our study conclude that the introduction of <b>index</b> <b>options</b> on the selected Asian stock markets have increased in stock return volatility and liquidity on the underlying stocks...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide {{evidence}} that financial option markets for equity indices give rise to non-trivial dependency structures between its constituents. Thus, if the individual constituent distributions of an equity index are inferred from the single-stock option markets and combined via a Gaussian copula, for example, one fails to explain the steepness of the observed volatility skew of the index. Intuitively, <b>index</b> <b>option</b> prices are encoding higher correlations {{in cases where the}} option is particularly sensitive to stress scenarios of the market. As a result, more complex dependency structures emerge than the ones described by Gaussian copulas or (state-independent) linear correlation structures. In this paper we "decode" the <b>index</b> <b>option</b> market and extract this correlation information in order to extend the multi-asset version of Dupire's "local volatility" model by making correlations a dynamic variable of the market. A "local correlation" model (LCM) is introduced for the pricing of multi-asset derivatives. We show how consistency with the index volatility data can be achieved by construction. LCM achieves consistency with both the constituent- and <b>index</b> <b>option</b> markets by construction while preserving the efficiency and easy implementation of Dupire's model. ...|$|E

Furthermore, the …rst principal component has a 92 % correlation with S&P 500 <b>index</b> <b>option</b> volatility, a 64 % correlation with the <b>index</b> <b>option</b> skew, and a 80 % correlation with the <b>index</b> <b>option</b> term structure. We develop an equity option valuation model that captures this factor structure. The model assumes a Heston (1993) style stochastic volatility model for the market return but additionally allows for stochastic idiosyncratic volatility for each …rm. The model predicts that …rms with higher betas have higher implied volatilities, consistent with the empirical …ndings in Duan and Wei (2009). It also predicts that …rms with higher betas have steeper moneyness and term structure slopes. We provide a tractable approach for estimating the model on index and equity option data.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{investor sentiment}} {{about the stock}} market affects prices of the S&P 500 options. The findings reveal that the <b>index</b> <b>option</b> volatility smile is steeper (flatter) and the risk-neutral skewness of monthly index return is more (less) negative when market sentiment becomes more bearish (bullish). These significant relations are robust and become stronger when there are more impediments to arbitrage in index options.

Changes in investor sentiment help explain time variation in the slope of <b>index</b> <b>option</b> smile and risk-neutral skewness beyond factors suggested by the current models. The Author 2007.
