40|$|In {{a utility}} boiler, the most heat loss {{is from the}} exhaust <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> In {{order to reduce the}} exhaust <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> {{temperature}} and further boost the plant efficiency, an improved indirect <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> heat recovery system and an additional economizer system are proposed. The waste heat of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> is used for high-pressure condensate regeneration heating. This reduces high pressure steam extraction from steam turbine and more power is generated. The waste heat recovery of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> decreases coal consumption. Other approaches for heat recovery of <b>flue</b> <b>gas,</b> direct utilization of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> energy and indirect <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> heat recovery system, are also considered in this work. The proposed systems coupled with a reference 330 MWe power plant are simulated using equivalent enthalpy drop method. The results show that the additional economizer scheme has the best performance. When the exhaust <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperature decreases from 153 ℃ to 123 ℃, power output increases by 6. 37 MWe and increment in plant efficiency is about 1. 89 %. For the improved indirect <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> heat recovery system, power output increases by 5. 68 MWe and the increment in plant efficiency is 1. 69 %...|$|R

Furthermore, an industrial <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> stack typically provides little obstruction for the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> along its length and is, in fact, normally optimized to enhance the stack effect to reduce fan energy requirements.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the air {{preheater}} is to recover {{the heat from the}} boiler <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> which increases the thermal efficiency of the boiler by reducing the useful heat lost in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas.</b> As a consequence, the <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> are also conveyed to the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> stack (or chimney) at a lower temperature, allowing simplified design of the conveyance system and the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> stack. It also allows control over the temperature of gases leaving the stack (to meet emissions regulations, for example).|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} humidity of combusted wood biomass on the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> losses. A mathematical relation between <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> losses of the boiler on wood biomass humidity is presented as well as temperature of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> emitted from the boiler into the atmosphere. The limits of model application for the humidity of wood biomass falls into the interval 10 – 60 % whereas the range of temperatures of <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> emitted from the boiler to the atmosphere is 120 – 200 °C. The influence of the humidity of wood biomass has an adverse effect on increasing {{the extent of the}} boiler <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> losses and thus inefficiency of the heat production. The increase of the wood biomass humidity from the value of 10 % to 60 % with the outlet temperature of <b>flue</b> <b>gases</b> from the boiler 120 °C causes an increase in <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> loss of the boiler from the value 8. 37 % to 12. 43 %, similarly the increase of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> loss by 200 °C from 15. 19 % to 22. 55 %, or the increase of the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> loss by 7. 36 %...|$|R

Pilot-scale heat transfer tests were performed to determine the relationship between <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> moisture concentration, heat exchanger design and operating conditions, and water vapor condensation rate. The tests also determined {{the extent to which}} the condensation processes for water and acid vapors in <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> can be made to occur separately in different heat transfer sections.

Measurements made of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> mercury concentrations upstream and downstream of the heat exchangers showed a significant reduction in <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> mercury concentration within the heat exchangers.

The investigated heat transfer system consisted of two consecutively positioned heat exchangers with various construction designs. This study brings more detailed information on heat transfer and fluid flow characteristic of the secondary exchanger and its overall influence on the efficiency of use of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> waste heat. Possible water condensation from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> is analyzed as well. According to the results, the secondary exchanger can be utilized as the preliminary one to the primary exchanger. Consequently, the number of sections of the primary exchanger needed for water heating can be significantly decreased. Water temperature {{in the case of}} connection of both the exchangers reached 370 K. Approximately 33 % of the temperature increase {{can be attributed to the}} secondary exchanger. The mean logarithmic temperature difference of the analyzed secondary exchanger was ∼ 166 K. The favorable geometry of the secondary exchanger resulted in a decrease in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperature, as well as in a decrease of its gradient throughout the cross-section of the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> system. The <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> temperature behind both the exchangers was sufficient to prevent condensation of water from the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> even under “extreme” conditions.

However, most of the mineral carbonation studies have been largely investigated at lab scale. Preliminary and pilot scale studies for accelerated mineral carbonation (AMC) were conducted {{at one of the}} largest coal-fired power plants (2120  MW) in the USA by reacting <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> with fly ash particles in a fluidized bed reactor. In the preliminary experiments, <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> CO 2 and SO 2 concentrations decreased from 13. 0 to 9. 6 % and from 107. 8 to 15. 1  ppmv, respectively during the first 2  min. of reaction. The <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> treatment increased mercury (Hg) concentration in fly ash (0. 1 to 0. 22  mg/kg) suggesting that fly ash particles also mineralized <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> Hg. From these results, we designed and developed pilot scale process skid consisting — a moisture reducing drum (MRD) (0. 9 mΦ× 1. 8 m), a heater/humidifier (0. 9 mΦ× 1. 8 m), and a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) (0. 9 – 1. 2 mΦ× 3. 7 m) to capture and mineralize <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> CO 2. <b>Flue</b> <b>gas</b> was withdrawn from the stack and was fed to the MRD at about 0. 094  m 3 /s. The MRD and the heater/humidifier pretreat <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> before it enters the FBR. The MRD captures droplets of water entrained in the <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> to protect the blower placed between the MRD and the heater/humidifier. The heater/humidifier enables control of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> moisture and temperature. Approximately 100 – 300  kg of fresh fly ash was collected from the electrostatic precipitator through ash hopper and placed in the fluidized-bed reactor. The fly ash particles were fluidized by flow of <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> through a distributor plate in the FBR.

The <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> was continuously monitored to measure <b>flue</b> <b>gas</b> CO 2, SO 2 and NOx concentrations by an industrial grade gas analyzer, while the fresh and spent fly ashes were analyzed for calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), sulfur (S), and mercury (Hg) content.
