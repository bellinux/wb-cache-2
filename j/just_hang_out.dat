500|$|While still {{rooted in}} pop punk, Blink-182 finds the band {{expanding}} their sonic template with darker, restless songs. The compositions {{on the record}} {{have been described as}} musically diverse and [...] "borderline experimental," [...] with sullen moodiness and off-kilter hooks the basis for many tracks. The record pulls from a variety of styles, including electronic rock, jangle pop, and [...] "reflective" [...] alternative rock. Experimentation was constantly present: the band tried different mic techniques and toyed with harmonium organs, Polynesian Gamelan bells, [...] and turntables. The band infused these experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side-projects (Box Car Racer and Transplants.) In a full article about the album in the November 20, 2003 edition of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Ben Wener described the music of the album as [...] "expansive, downcast, and sometimes spectral." [...] The New York Times considered that the album may have been influenced by the growing popularity of emo pop, while AllMusic regarded it a delve into post-punk. [...] "Much of the punk has been dissolved, the buzzsaw guitars faded into the corners, allowing room for staggering dynamics, cathartic guitar bursts and a weightier, more experimental and ambitious sound", wrote Tom Bryant of Kerrang!. The goal for Blink-182 was continuity: each song develops lyrically like chapters in a book, and songs segue into one another to present a cohesive feel instead of a regular collection of tracks. [...] In addition to the side-projects, the music of the album was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the onset of the Iraq War. The mood was unsettling for DeLonge, whose brother is a Navy officer: [...] "It was so weird because we'd all be glued to the TV, watching these bombs explode over another country. So I'd see all this and wonder where he was at, and then we'd have to go into the next room and sing or finish writing lyrics. I think it affected our moods throughout the day." [...] In addition, it was just inspired by socializing: [...] "We would <b>just</b> <b>hang</b> <b>out</b> for hours talking. It was really cool", said DeLonge.|$|E

It is very essential that we go to Europe and say we have a serious problem. … the way we get out of this is either - there are two options - either, we default, or we pull out of the euro.
