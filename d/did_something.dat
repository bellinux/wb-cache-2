A $1 million USD prize was given to the winning team. American Grit premiered on Fox on April 14, 2016. Cena has been retweeting motivational tweets from his followers on Twitter who used the hashtag #ShowYourGrit, {{in a way that the}} fan <b>did</b> <b>something</b> motivational to his/her friends in a real-life scenario. The finale of Season 1 aired on June 9, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Marko was {{associated}} with large, solitary boulders and indentations in rocks; the boulders {{were said to be}} thrown by him from a hill, and the indentations were his footprints (or the hoofprints of his horse). He was also connected with geographic features such as hills, glens, cliffs, caves, rivers, brooks and groves, which he created or at which he <b>did</b> <b>something</b> memorable. They were often named after him, and there are many toponyms—from Istria in the west to Bulgaria in the east—derived from his name. In Bulgarian and Macedonian stories, Marko had an equally strong sister who competed with him in throwing boulders.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, <b>did</b> <b>something</b> he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to bed that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E

Crowfeather denies that he ever has any kits besides Breezepelt, and he states that Leafpool and their kits mean nothing to him. Breezepelt and Nightcloud are both outraged about never being informed. Seeing how {{everyone}} feels she <b>did</b> <b>something</b> wrong, Hollyleaf runs off into the tunnels which collapse.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, {{and again}} in 1986, Dickinson {{appeared}} in two of Perry Como's Christmas specials for the ABC television network, in both of which she <b>did</b> <b>something</b> she was not known to have done before: singing.

25|$|When {{it came to}} {{punishment}} {{there were}} straightforward rules. If you did not aid the community then you were seen as an enemy to the band. The way that they disciplined people was also straight forward. If you <b>did</b> <b>something</b> wrong your punishment would be public shame and ridicule. When the band depends so much on each other, this kind of punishment {{would have been one}} that was hard to deal with.|$|E
25|$|Publishing trade {{organizations}} allowed publishers {{to organize}} business concerns collectively. These arrangements included systems of self-regulation. For example, if one publisher <b>did</b> <b>something</b> to irritate other publishers {{he would be}} controlled by peer pressure. Such systems are known as cartels, and are in most countries now considered to be in restraint of trade. These arrangements helped deal with labour unrest among journeymen, who faced difficult working conditions. Brotherhoods predated unions, without the formal regulations now associated with unions.|$|E
25|$|When {{actuality}} deviates from capability, {{because someone}} <b>did</b> <b>something</b> well or something badly, an algedonic alert {{is sent to}} management. If corrective action, adoption of a good technique or correction of an error, is not taken {{in a timely manner}} the alert is escalated. Because the criteria are applied in an ordered hierarchy the management itself need not be, but the routine response functions must be ordered to reflect best known heuristic practice. These heuristics are constantly monitored for improvement by the organization's System 4s.|$|E

25|$|Club {{work began}} {{wherever}} a public-spirited person <b>did</b> <b>something</b> to give rural children respect {{for themselves and}} their ways of life and {{it is very difficult to}} credit one sole individual. Instances of work with rural boys and girls can be found all throughout the 19th century. In the spring of 1882, Delaware College announced a statewide corn contest for boys, in which each boy was to plant a quarter of an acre, according to instructions sent out from the college, and cash prizes, certificates, and subscriptions to the American Agriculturalist were rewarded.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the battle}} began, Yudhishthira <b>did</b> <b>something</b> unexpected. He {{suddenly}} dropped his weapons, {{took off his}} armour and started walking towards the Kaurava army with folded hands in prayer. The Pandava brothers and the Kauravas looked on in disbelief, thinking Yudhishthira was surrendering before the first arrow was shot. Yudhishthira's purpose became clear, however, when he fell on Bhishma's feet to seek his blessing for success in battle. Bhishma, grandfather to both the Pandavas and Kauravas, blessed Yudhishthira. Yudhishthira returned to his chariot and the battle was ready to commence.|$|E
25|$|Dart was {{launched}} in South America under a different name. She was taken in prize circa 1806. Once under British ownership she then performed one voyage as a South Seas whaler. She then traded as a merchantman before in 1810 receiving a letter of marque. She then <b>did</b> <b>something</b> quite unusual: she made a voyage to Africa where she captured five slave ships. After this Dart returned to normal trading, this time with South America. However, in 1813 as she was returning to London from Buenos Aires she stopped at Pernambuco, where she was condemned as unseaworthy.|$|E

25|$|Historically and traditionally, Tanana {{and other}} all Alaskan Athabaskans are {{practice}} animism and shamanism. The animistic belief system {{common to all}} Alaskan Athabaskan groups might be briefly characterized as follows: All creatures, and some inanimate objects, had spirits which were active and powerful components of those creatures. The spirits enabled an animal to know more than was immediately apparent to him. Thus, if human beings <b>did</b> <b>something</b> which displeased the animal's spirit, the animal itself would remain aloof from the people, and the people might starve. There were very definite rules which people had to follow in dealing with animals based on this belief in animal spirits.|$|E
25|$|With a licence in place, {{from late}} 1955 all Alvis bodies became based on Graber designs however few chassis and few bodies were {{built over the}} next two years. Around 15 or 16 TC108/Gs were built by Willowbrook Limited of Loughborough and Willowbrook was {{subsequently}} taken over by Duple Coachbuilders. Over the same two years Graber built 22 TC 108Gs and complained that if he had received chassis he would have committed himself to buying 20 a year. Only after late 1958 with the launch of the TD 21 <b>did</b> <b>something</b> resembling full-scale production resume as Rolls-Royce subsidiary Park Ward began to build the new bodies now modified in many small ways. These cars, the TD 21 and its later variants, the TE 21 and finally the TF 21 are well built, attractive and fast cars. However it was clear by the mid-1960s that with a price tag of nearly double that of the mass-produced Jaguar, the end could not be far off.|$|E
25|$|Baker {{was born}} on Scotland Road in Liverpool. His parents were working class; his mother, Mary Jane (née Fleming), a cleaner, was a devout Catholic, and his father, John Stewart Baker, was a seaman. Baker {{attended}} Cheswardine Boarding School. At 15 he became a novice monk with the Roman Catholic Brothers of Ploermel in Jersey and later in Shropshire, but left the monastery six years later after losing his faith. As {{he wrote in his}} autobiography he realised he wanted to break each of the Ten Commandments in order and thought he should get out before he <b>did</b> <b>something</b> serious. He did his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957. At the same time, he took up acting, studying at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama, Sidcup in 1956 where he met his first wife. He {{went on to become a}} professional actor in the late 1960s after the marriage broke down.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{negative}} and constructive criticism have their appropriate uses, but {{often it is}} considered a requirement of criticism that they are combined. Thus, it is often considered that those who find fault with something should also offer an option for putting it right. More generally, any rule for behavior of any kind usually implies both [...] "do's" [...] and [...] "don't s". <b>Doing</b> <b>something</b> usually also implies not <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else, and, not <b>doing</b> <b>something,</b> often implies <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else. There is therefore a conscious choice [...] "to do this, or do that", but not {{both at the same}} time.|$|R

In 2010, Nick further volunteered his efforts for <b>Do</b> <b>Something</b> by offering his time as a prize to teens who donated jeans to <b>Do</b> <b>Something</b> and Aeropostale's [...] "Teens for Jeans" [...] campaign. Further, Nick filmed another public service announcement, this one in support of <b>Do</b> <b>Something's</b> [...] "Battle of the Bands" [...] campaign {{for the advancement of}} music education in schools.|$|R

25|$|On {{the death}} of the Conqueror in 1087 Lanfranc secured the {{succession}} for William Rufus, in spite of the discontent of the Anglo-Norman baronage; and in 1088 his exhortations induced the English militia to fight {{on the side of the}} new sovereign against Odo of Bayeux and the other partisans of Duke Robert. He exacted promises of just government from Rufus, and was not afraid to remonstrate when the promises were disregarded. So long as he lived he was a check upon the worst propensities of the king’s administration. But his restraining hand was too soon removed. In 1089 he was stricken with fever and he died on 24 May amidst universal lamentations. Notwithstanding some obvious moral and intellectual defects, he was the most eminent and the most disinterested of those who had co-operated with William I in riveting Norman rule upon the English Church and people. As a statesman he <b>did</b> <b>something</b> to uphold the traditional ideal of his office; as a primate he elevated the standards of clerical discipline and education. Conceived in the spirit of popes such as Pope Leo IX, his reforms led by a natural sequence to strained relations between Church and State; the equilibrium which he established was unstable, and depended too much upon his personal influence with the Conqueror.|$|E
25|$|Extraordinary {{sporting}} successes <b>did</b> <b>something</b> {{to alleviate}} the spirits of Australians during the economic downturn. In a Sheffield Shield cricket match at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1930, Don Bradman, a young New South Welshman of just 21 years of age wrote his name into the record books by smashing the previous highest batting score in first-class cricket with 452 runs not out in just 415 minutes. The rising star's world beating cricketing exploits were to provide Australians with much needed joy through the emerging Great Depression in Australia and post-World War II recovery. Between 1929 and 1931 the racehorse Phar Lap dominated Australia's racing industry, at one stage winning fourteen races in a row. Famous victories included the 1930 Melbourne Cup, following an assassination attempt and carrying 9 stone 12 pounds weight. Phar Lap sailed for the United States in 1931, going on to win North America's richest race, the Agua Caliente Handicap in 1932. Soon after, {{on the cusp of}} US success, Phar Lap developed suspicious symptoms and died. Theories swirled that the champion race horse had been poisoned and a devoted Australian public went into shock. The 1938 British Empire Games were held in Sydney from 5–12 February, timed to coincide with Sydney's sesqui-centenary (150 years since the foundation of British settlement in Australia).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s AMT {{released}} brand new kits with new tooling {{for some of}} their old favorites, such as the 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air, 1966 Ford Fairlane GT, 1958 Edsel Pacer, 1960 Ford Starliner and 1957 Chrysler 300. These kits sold fairly well and can still be found on auction sites such as eBay at reasonable prices. The details in these kits far exceeded any from the 1960s. In the late 1990s AMT <b>did</b> <b>something</b> new in releasing pre-assembled and painted versions of these kits. These assembled models were sold as the Masterpiece Series and were nicely packaged in foam, similar to heavier diecast metal Franklin Mint or Danbury Mint models. Each had a Certificate of Authenticity enclosed. These models were beautifully finished and featured whitewall tires along with very detailed and authentically painted engines, suspensions and interiors, much more detailed than any promotional ever was, although these seem to be oriented to the adult collector and not the possible customer. Selections included a 1957 Chrysler 300C, 1960 Ford Starliner, 1962 Chevrolet Impala SS convertible, 1962 Pontiac Catalina SD421, 1966 Buick Riviera {{and a few others}} (Doty 2002b, p87). These ultra detailed models can still be had for less than $30.00 today on eBay and are one of the best bargains around. As assembled kits they were factory-glued together, but the glue used appears to be of high quality and when cared for properly they can be kept in good condition for years.|$|E
