40|$|In {{conventional}} cellular {{wireless communication}} system, interference modelling {{has focused on}} the six primary co-channel <b>interfering</b> <b>cells</b> (first tier co-channel cells). In the current accepted interference model, co-channel <b>interfering</b> <b>cells</b> beyond the first tier (subsequent tier co-channel cells) are neglected. This currently accepted interference models is suitable for cellular wireless communication systems operating at carrier frequencies, f c = 0. 9 and 1. 8 GHz, cell size radii R > 1 km and basic path loss exponent α ≥ 2. The future and emerging wireless communication systems are expected to be operating at frequencies f c > 2 GHz (3. 35 - 15. 75 GHz), cell size radii R≤ 1 km and basic path loss exponent α ≤ 2. This, makes the current acceptable co-channel interference model unsuitable for information capacity analysis of the future cellular systems. Therefore, a co-channel interference model suitable for future and emerging wireless communication system becomes necessary. In this thesis a new and modified interference model is proposed. The proposed interference model includes the first and subsequent tier co-channel <b>interfering</b> <b>cells.</b> The proposed interference model will be suitable for cellular wireless communication systems operating at carrier frequencies f c > 2 GHz, cell size radii R≤ 1 km and basic path loss exponent α ≤ 2.

In Section III-B, we include the shadowing effect and we consider in the first instance the contribution of one <b>interfering</b> <b>cell.</b> We then generalize to N > 1 interferers.

The obtained results show that the proposed schemes improve the system performance of an adaptive packet-switched mobile radio system while also exhibiting the long-term channel uniform use characteristic of the random allocation mechanism. The higher performance attained with the proposed schemes is due to their short-term channel use pattern that results in an implicit cooperation among co-channel <b>interfering</b> <b>cells</b> during the channel allocation process.

40|$|Nowadays {{wireless}} cellular networks {{can be seen}} as ubiquitous systems used by {{a majority}} of the world's population and their usage continues to grow in the future. Continuously higher data rates and shorter latencies are required due to the introduction of new mobile devices and services. In addition, mobile networks are more and more used as a primary connectivity solution in several places. Thus, new technologies are required to improve the capacity and latency of mobile networks. Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced are technologies standardized by Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) with the potential to fulfill these requirements for future mobile networks. LTE/LTE-Advanced cellular networks are usually interference limited, because neighbouring cells use the same frequency band for data transmission. Because of this, several users may experience high interference levels and thus cannot achieve high data rates without proper counteractions. Consequently, advanced techniques to control, suppress or cancel the interference are of interest to be studied for LTE and LTE-Advanced by 3 GPP. Network Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression (NAICS) techniques are currently been studied by 3 GPP. One of the recent studies on NAICS is so called blind detection of <b>interfering</b> <b>cell</b> parameters in a user equipment for advanced non-linear receivers. Such receivers have the capability to suppress or cancel interference significantly but they require the knowledge of specific parameters of the <b>interfering</b> <b>cell</b> to perform efficiently. These parameters have to be either signaled by the network or blindly detected from the received signal in user equipment. The topic of this thesis is to study the feasibility of blind detection of interfering cell's data channel power level, which is crucial knowledge to non-linear receivers. The study is performed at radio link level by using numerical simulations, in which the transmitter and receiver processing are modeled in detail. In addition, also the effects caused by the radio channel to the transmitted signals are modeled. The performance of one non-linear receiver, namely Symbol Level Interference Cancellation (SLIC) receiver, with blind detection is compared to the performance of SLIC receiver which has the knowledge of all required parameters. While Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error - Interference Rejection Combiner (LMMSE-IRC) receiver operates as the baseline. From the simulation results {{it can be seen that}} the blind detector performs well. Consequently this blind detector can be one noteworthy option to avoid signaling of interfering cell's data channel power level...|$|E
30|$|However, {{for this}} scheme to work, the ABS {{patterns}} {{need to be}} exchanged between different cells, and the average throughput of a receiver over protected and non-protected sub-frames needs to be estimated. Because the current LTE-A system already supports using ABSs, the configuration of ABSs and exchange of ABS patterns between macro sectors will not introduce additional complexities to the current LTE-A system. To apply the scheduling restrictions, based on the discussion in Section 4, each macro sector needs to identify whether a receiver must be protected from one or two interferers or no protection is needed. According to Equation 9 and Equation 12, the receiver needs to feed back its average throughput when it is in both the protected and non-protected sub-frames. This was a major challenge in the 3 GPP Rel- 10 and earlier LTE systems, because only one CSI feedback process was allowed. There were no good mechanisms for a receiver to perform accurate CSI measurement over protected sub-frames, especially when different combinations of muting patterns for neighboring <b>interfering</b> <b>cells</b> needed to be considered. However, in the 3 GPP Rel- 12 LTE-A systems, to {{support the use of}} coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission, a set of zero-power CSI reference symbols (CSI-RS) is standardized. The receiver can use the zero-power CSI-RS to perform accurate CSI measurement when certain neighboring <b>interfering</b> <b>cells</b> are muted. Several CSI feedback processes can be initiated to report different channel qualities when different muting patterns for neighboring <b>interfering</b> <b>cells</b> are applied. Details about the configuration of zero-power CSI-RS and the feedback mechanism can be found in ([62] Ch. 15). Therefore, no new feedback mechanisms need to be standardized to perform the scheduling restriction algorithm considered in this study. We need to emphasize that from Equation 9 and Equation 12, we see that only the average throughput is required to apply the scheduling restrictions. Therefore, a receiver only needs to feed back the CSI measurement or the estimated average throughput for different muting patterns of neighboring <b>interfering</b> <b>cells</b> once per every several sub-frames, e.g., one or several ABS cycles. Therefore, only limited feedback overhead is expected. Hence, the tools offered by the current LTE-A systems can adequately support using ABSs together with the scheduling restrictions considered in our study.|$|R
