5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 24s run, the series {{attracted}} significant criticism for its depictions of torture, {{as well as its}} negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation, with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly {{as a result of these}} discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to tone down the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> to overwhelm the storytelling.|$|E

When Peugeot launched the stylish all-new 205 in 1983, the 104 was withdrawn from most European markets, including Britain. But it continued in France as a budget choice until production finally ceased in May 1988 after 16 years in which time 1,624,992 Peugeot 104s had been built. 345,849 of these were the short wheelbase Coupé versions.|$|E

25|$|Soon, reports {{came in from}} Allied {{aircraft}} that German tanks were approaching and the order was given to clear the ridges to utilise its advantageous terrain for the upcoming tank battle. At 17:30 reports {{came in from the}} forward observers that the defences were withdrawing from Hafid Ridge. This seemed like the ideal time to strike, so the order was given for Squadron B of the 6th Royal Tank Regiment to attack. After clearing the first ridge, it looked as though the reports were accurate, as German trucks and towed guns were seen moving away over the second crest. Pursuit began but upon the British forces clearing the second ridge, the Axis forces sprung their trap and fired on the Crusader tanks at near point-blank range with waiting guns; within minutes, 11 of the Crusaders were destroyed and six more heavily damaged. The Axis infantry and anti-tank guns, bereft of entrenchments, also took significant casualties. Over 30 German tanks from a battalion of the 5th Panzer Regiment, part of the 5th Light Division which had earlier been stationed north at Sidi Azeiz, were seen arriving from the west. As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> to grow dark, neither side closed with the other and the 7th Armoured Brigade slowly withdrew during long range fighting.|$|E

25|$|From the Mayakovskogo and Khmelnitzkogo {{intersection}} the 1st battalion advanced {{towards the}} Dzerzhinskogo square via Dzerzhinskogo street and parallel streets to reduce congestion in the column, lead elements reaching the railway station by 12:30 in the afternoon. This column included the 3rd {{company of the}} 1st battalion with Colonel Perepelkin commanding in person, soon joined by the 4th company from the 2nd battalion, and the 7th tank company. On reaching Dzerzhinskogo square, the 7th tank company was tasked with guarding the bridge from Krasnikh Frontovikov street. This column included about 40 BMPs, 9-12 tanks (including several 'strays') {{and at least one}} anti-aircraft vehicle. From there, the column attempted to reach the Ordzhenikidze square, but came under intense fire, and Colonel Yaroslavtzev commanding the 81st regiment ordered all units to return to the Dzerzhinskogo square as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> to become dark. At this time though all units in the Ordzhenekidze square began to receive fire from all types of weapons from different directions, resulting in several vehicles, including tanks becoming disabled. The regimental and battalion nets were now being jammed, and the two battalion commanders now present in the square were reduced to driving around in order to redeploy their vehicles and coordinate returned fire.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the Episcopy to the Scottish Church in 1662 ownership of the castle passed back to the church, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> to fall into decay. [...] Parliament granted Bishop Murdo MacKenzie £1000 for repairs and this sustained the building up to 1689 when the last occupant, Bishop William Hay was expelled after refusing to take an oath of allegiance to King William and Queen Mary.

[...] Local people plundered the walls for stonework for building works until the early 19th century when the Crown stopped the quarrying and instituted a maintenance policy.|$|E
2500|$|In ancient times, when Wang Liang and Zaofu went driving, [...] they mounted their chariots {{and took}} hold of the reins, the horses set {{themselves}} in order and wanted to work together. They obediently paced in step with one another; [...] pulling hard or easing off, they were as one. Their hearts were in tune and their qi harmonious; their bodies [...] more and more light and coordinated. They were content to work hard and happy to go forward; they galloped away as if they would vanish. They went right and left like [...] a whip; they circled around like a jade bracelet. All people of that era considered [...] to be superlative , but that was because they had not yet seen any [...] worthy ones. Now consider the charioteering of Qian Qie and Da Bing. They considered reins and bits superfluous, got rid of whips and cast aside goads. Before the chariot began to move, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> on its own. Before the horses were given the signal, they were walking on their own. They paced [...] sun and moved [...] moon. They flashed [...] stars and advanced [...] dark. They raced [...] lightning and leaped [...] ghosts. Advancing or withdrawing, gathering strength or stretching out, they did not see the slightest barrier. Thus, with no gesturing or pointing, with no cursing or scolding, they overtook the wild geese flying to Piled Stone Mountain, passed the jungle fowl [...] Guyu Mountain. Their galloping was like flying; their bursts of speed like thread snapping. [...] like riding an arrow or mounting the wind, like following a cyclone and returning in an instant. At dawn they started from Fusang and set with the sun at Luotang. This was taking something unused and obtaining its usefulness: it was not done by examining things through reason or thought or through the exercise of manual skill. Whenever urgent desires took form in the breasts , their quintessential spirits were [...] communicated to the six horses. This was a case of using non-driving to go driving. (6.6, tr.

2500|$|The {{spring of}} 1944 is remembered in France as {{time of the}} mentalité terrible, the period of la guerre franco-française when the Milice and the Maquis fought one another without mercy. The Milice and maquis were caught up in ever-escalating cycle of {{violence}} with Ousby commenting: [...] "1944 had simply become the time for settling scores, any scores, for revenging grudges, any grudges. Agreed on this common imperative, the sides in the conflict blur and become almost indistinguishable from each other. The Milice hit squads pretended to be the Maquis; the Maquis hit squads pretended to be the Milice. Sometimes {{it was impossible to}} tell which was really which, and sometimes it hardly mattered". As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>starting</b> to become more and more clear that the Allies were going to win the war, the Milice become more desperate and vicious as the knowledge that when the Allies won, the miliciens would be tried for treason if they not killed out of hand first, caused the Milice to engage in increasing savage torture and killings of the maquisards, hoping against hope that they could annihilate all of their enemies before the Allies won. For their part, some of the maquisards struck back in kind against the Milice. In the town of Voiron, close to Grenoble, in April 1944, a Maquis assassination squad entered the home of the local Milice chief and killed him, his wife, his infant daughter, his 10-year-old son, and his 82-year-old mother. Outside the village of Saint-Laurent in the Haute-Savoie, a mass grave was discovered in May 1944 of eight gendarmes known for their loyalty to Vichy kidnapped by the Maquis from Bonneville who had been lined up and shot by their captors. The killing of the gendarmes was denounced by the chief collaboratorist propagandist Philippe Henriot on the radio as the [...] "French Katyn", who used the killings as an example of the sort of [...] "Bolshevik terrorism" [...] that he maintained was typical of the resistance. In the south of France, the Maquis had started to form an alternative government to Vichy, which still controlled the French civil service. Georges Guingouin, the Communist maquis leader of the Maquis du Limousin in the Limousin region styled himself a préfet and imposed his own system of rationing on the local farmers that flouted the rationing system imposed by Vichy. In the Auxois region, the Maquis Bernard had created its system of taxation with people being taxed on the basis of their willingness to collaborate with the authorities or support the resistance. When the British philosopher A. J. Ayer arrived in Gascony as a SOE agent in the spring of 1944, he described a power structure established by the maquis that placed power [...] "in the hands of a series of feudal lords whose power and influence were strangely similar to that of their fifteenth-century Gason counterparts".|$|E
