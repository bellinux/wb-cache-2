25|$|In 1963, Saab {{finalized}} the aerodynamic {{design of}} the aircraft; the aerodynamic configuration was radical: it combined an aft-mounted <b>double</b> <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> with a small, high-set canard foreplane, equipped with powered trailing flaps mounted ahead of and slightly above the main wing; this would be judged {{to be the best}} means to satisfy the conflicting demands for STOL performance, supersonic speed, low turbulence sensitivity at low level flight, and efficient lift for subsonic flight. Canard aircraft have since become common in fighter aircraft, notably with the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, Saab JAS 39 Gripen and the IAI Kfir, but principally for the purposes of providing agility during flight rather than for its STOL capabilities. Further aerodynamic refinements during the later stage of development included the addition of dog-tooth patterns upon the main wing to generate vortices, allowing for the elimination of blown flaps from the canard. The use of a thrust reverser enabled the sought short landing performance.|$|E

The vertical stabilizer of the orbiter had a leading edge that was swept back at a 45-degree angle. There were four elevons mounted at the trailing edges of the <b>delta</b> <b>wings,</b> and the combination rudder and speed brake was attached at {{the trailing edge of}} the vertical stabilizer.

Based on results obtained from application of numerical optimisation methods which achieved an {{improvement of the}} aerodynamic, thermal and structural-mechanical properties in hypersonic flight, the initial <b>double</b> <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> of previous versions has been modified and replaced by a single delta wing. Presently, subsystems such as the passenger cabin, the cryogenic tanks, the propellant feed system and the vehicle thermal protection have been preliminarily designed and integrated, and this process documented and detailed in various papers and publications.

5000|$|This {{resulted}} in the only sub-scale test aircraft to be constructed in Sweden, the Saab 210, which was unofficially nicknamed [...] "Lilldraken" [...] (the little kite). The Saab 210, which tested {{the concept of the}} <b>double</b> <b>delta</b> <b>wing,</b> performed its first flight on 21 January 1952. The successful results produced by the test flights of the Saab 210 led to an order being placed for three full-size Draken prototypes. On 25 October 1955, the first of these prototypes, which was not fitted with an afterburner, conducted its maiden flight. According to aircraft publication Flight International, an atypically intensive flight test programme was conducted to define and test the type's exceptional speed range and complicated systems. The second prototype, which was equipped with an afterburner, unintentionally broke the sound barrier during its first flight while climbing.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject has}} been jointly {{investigated}} at NASA Langley Research Center and the Aerodynamisches Institut of the RWTH Aachen over a substantial period. The {{aim of this}} investigation has been to develop numerical integration procedures for the Navier-Stokes equations - particularly for incompressible three-dimensional viscous flows about simple and <b>double</b> <b>delta</b> <b>wings</b> - and to study the low speed flow behavior, with its complex vortex structures on the leeward side of the wing. The low speed flight regime poses unusual problems because high incidence flight conditions may, for example, encounter symmetric and asymmetric vortex breakdown. Because of the many difficulties to be expected in solving the problem, it was divided into two - analysis of the flow without vortex breakdown {{and analysis of the}} breakdown of isolated vortices.

25|$|The Viggen was {{initially}} developed as an intended {{replacement for the}} Saab 32 Lansen in the attack role and later the Saab 35 Draken as a fighter. In 1955, as Saab's prototype Draken, the most aerodynamically advanced fighter {{in the world at}} that point, performed its first flight, the Swedish Air Force was already forming a series of requirements {{for the next generation of}} combat aircraft; due to the challenging nature of these requirements, a lengthy development time was anticipated, with the first flight intended to be no early than the middle of the next decade. Between 1952 and 1957, the first studies towards what would become the Viggen were carried out, involving the Finnish aircraft designer Aarne Lakomaa. Over 100 different concepts were examined in these studies, involving both single- and twin engine configurations, both traditional and <b>double</b> <b>delta</b> <b>wings,</b> and canard wings. Even VTOL designs were considered, with separate lift engines, but were soon identified as being unacceptable.|$|R
5000|$|The Tu-144 {{prototype}} was {{a full-scale}} demonstrator aircraft {{with the very}} different production aircraft being developed in parallel. While both Concorde and the Tu-144 prototype had ogival delta wings, the Tu-144's wing lacked Concorde's conical camber. Production Tu-144s replaced this wing with a <b>double</b> <b>delta</b> <b>wing</b> including spanwise and chordwise camber. They also added two small retractable surfaces called Moustache canard, with fixed double-slotted LE slats and retractable double-slotted flaps. These were fitted just behind the cockpit and increased lift at low speeds.Moving the elevons downward in a delta-wing aircraft increases the lift (force), but also pitches its nose downward. The canards cancel out this nose-downwards moment, thus reducing the landing speed of the production Tu-144s to 315 - 333 km/h, still faster than that of Concorde. The NASA study lists final approach speeds during Tu-144LL test flights as 315 - 335 km/h. An FAA circular lists Tu-144S approach speed as 329 km/h, as opposed to Concorde's approach speed of 300 km/h, based on the characteristics declared by the manufacturers to Western regulatory bodies. It is open to argument how stable the Tu-144S was at the listed airspeed. In any event, when NASA subcontracted Tupolev bureau in the 1990s to convert one of the remaining Tu-144D to a Tu-144LL standard, the procedure set by Tupolev for landing defined the Tu-144LL [...] "final approach speed... {{on the order of}} 360 km/h depending on fuel weight." [...] Brian Calvert, Concorde's technical flight manager and its first commercial pilot in command for several inaugural flights, cites final approach speed of a typical Concorde landing to be 287 - 296 km/h. The lower landing speed compared to Tu-144 is due to Concorde's more refined design of the wing profile that provides higher lift at low speeds without degrading supersonic cruise performance - a feature often mentioned in Western publications on Concorde and acknowledged by Tupolev designers as well.|$|E
