40|$|This project {{aimed to}} refine and {{validate}} an optical remote sensing method {{to predict the}} ultimate pH of slaughter beef animals. An existing commercial method converts muscle glycogen in a known mass of muscle sample into glucose that is determined by a diabetic’s personal meter. The method is expensive in terms of consumables and results are fraught with inadequate operator skill levels. Pilot studies showed {{that it may be}} possible to measure the mass of the muscle sample and the concentration of glucose by colorimetry. Redness was a measure of muscle mass in acetate-buffered slurry, and after addition of <b>Fehlings</b> <b>solution</b> and heating, yellowness was a measure of glucose. This was the starting point for the study. Phase 1 determined the value of individual Hunter colour a*, b* and L* values for predicting mass of meat samples by linear equations. Hunter a* was a useful predictor of meat mass, but only within animals, probably due to the different muscular origins of the meat cuts selected. However, it was proposed that if samples were taken from a single muscular site, as in the existing commercial method, among animal variability might be much reduced. In Phase 1, a digital camera was also used to extract colour data, but it proved much less useful than the Hunter meter. Its use was thus discontinued. Phase 2 showed that different concentrations of glucose did not affect the colour due to meat mass, which was a necessary condition for using colour as a predictor of meat mass. Phase 3 explored the broad relationship between glucose concentration and meat mass on colour change due to the Fehlings reaction induced in a microwave oven. As expected from prior research, the concentration of glucose strongly affected the heat-induced colour, but meat mass also affected colour presumably through the Maillard reaction which would compete with the Fehlings reaction for the available glucose. However, if the mass of meat were known, colour values could be adjusted for this effect. In Phase 4, randomly chosen but defined masses of meat, and similarly randomly chosen, defined concentrations of glucose were used with the Fehlings reaction to test the predictive value of equations relating concentration of glucose/mass of meat to various Hunter colour values. The ratio was well predicted by Hunter b* and L*, unexpectedly implying that information about meat mass and glucose could be simultaneously extracted from the same colour data. This result suggests that there may be no need to measure meat mass, gravimetrically or by colour, to get useful results. In a limited way, Phase 5 extended the Phase 4 work by using the ratio of colour values before heating (no Fehlings added) colour values after heating (Fehlings added) to see if this would improve the predictive values established in Phase 4. It did not. The results are discussed with a focus on future work required to confirm the results in Phase 4, and also describe the steps required in a hypothetical semi-automated application of the technology...|$|E

40|$|Urushi, the latex of the lacquer tree, {{which is}} a unique product in southern-east Asia, and an {{indispensable}} material for "lacquer ware". Urushi consists of phenolic matter, gum, nitrogen containing matter and laccase. All the components above stated {{have been known to}} be necessary for hardening of urushi. Analysis of various kinds of urushi and also measurement of rate of the hardening ware reported by Suzuka. His results lead to a conclusion that the quantity of the gum of urushi {{may be related to the}} rate of hardening. For the gum, however, few studies have been reported. In this investigation, a new polysaccharide, one of the main components of the gum from the latex of the Japanese lacquer tree, was obtained, the chemical structure of the main chain of the polysaccharide was studied and the possible steric configuration was proposed. I. Preparation of the polysaccharide. A electrophoretically and ultracentrafugically homogeneous polysaccharide was obtained from the gum of urushi, {{which is a}} production in Iwate Prefecture, by the fractional precipitation with alcohol and the treatment with <b>Fehling's</b> <b>solution.</b> II. Components of the polysaccharide. Analysis of the hydrolyzate of the polysaccharide was carried out and the following results was obtained; D-galactose: 41. 2 %, D-galacturonic acid: 40 %, D-glucuronic acid: 7 %. III. Identification of 6 - 0 -D-galacturonosyl D-galactose. A main component, Fraction C, of the partial hydrolyzate of the polysaccharide was separated by ion-exchange chromatography and the structure was studied. (A) Reducing activity of the Fraction C was about 1 / 2 of that of galactose, galacturonic acid or glucuronic acid. In the hydrolyzate of Fraction C, galactose and galacturonic acid were identified. Hence, it was assumed that the Fraction C was a disaccharide which consisted of galactose and galacturonic acid. (B) In the hydrolyzate of sodium borohydride reduction product of Fraction C, as neutral component only dulcitol was identified. (C) The ratio of periodate consumption and formic acid formation in periodate oxidation of Fraction C was 6 : 5 and formation of formaldehyde could not observe in this procedure. In the hydrolyzate of periodate oxidation product followed by sodium borohydride reduction of Fraction C, as natural components ethylene glycole and glycole aldehyde were identified. From the above mentioned results, it was proposed that the structure of Fraction C was 6 - 0 -D-galacturonosyl D-galactose. IV. The chemical structure of the polysaccharide. The ratio of periodate consumption and formic acid formation in periodate oxidation of the polysaccharide was 2 : 1. Galactose was found as the neutral hydrolyzate of periodate oxidation product followed by sodium borohydride reduction of the polysaccharide. As a neutal component of partial hydrolyzate of the polysaccharide, galactose was identified. From the above results, it may be considered that the polysaccharide is consisted of 6 - 0 -D-galacturonosyl D-galactose, which is linked to each other by 1 → 3 linkage of the galactose residue. V. Steric configuration of the polysaccharide. Molecular weight of the polysaccharide determined with Archibald's ultracentrifugal method is 6 × 10 ^ 4. Intrinsic viscosity of the polysaccharide determined with Fitz-Simons' dilution type viscometer is 0. 17. On the axial ratio and the length of the polysaccharide molecule, a good agreement was seen between the values deduced from viscometric results and those obtained from molecular structure models. As the final conclusion, it is proposed that the polysaccharide in which 6 - 0 -D-galacturonosyl D-galactose unit is linked to each other by 1 → 3 linkage of the galactose residue, has a helical structure and one turn of which consists of 6 to 7 units of galactose residue...|$|R
