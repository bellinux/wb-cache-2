40|$|Segregation {{involves}} more than one population group, and segregation measures quantify how different population groups are distributed across space. One of the key conceptual and methodological foundations of segregation studies is {{to account for the}} potential of spatial interaction among two or more population groups across areal units. This foundation implies the need for a spatial approach to portray the spatial (and thus social) interaction among neighbors. In general, simple percentages (for example, percent Black) are not a measure of segregation. Because local spatial segregation measures did not emerge until recently, the objectives of this article are threefold: (1) to explain a spatial approach for measuring the level of segregation at the neighborhood (or local) level, (2) to demonstrate the deficiencies of using a percentage of racial/ethnic group as a measure of segregation, and (3) to clarify the appropriateness of two commonly used <b>indexes</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissimilarity</b> and diversity.

Cross-reactivity of anthranilate synthetase-anthranilate- 5 -phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (ASase-PRTase) from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium and ASase from Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas putida was detected with antibodies to ?E. coli trypsin-treated ASase. Cross-reactivity of antigens was also obtained with S. marcescens anti-ASase. <b>Indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissimilarity</b> verified the overall structural similarity of ASase-PRTase from E. coli, K. aerogenes, and S. typhimurium and the divergence from S. marcescens ASase. Further divergence of these enzymes from ASase in B. subtilis and P. putida was apparent. Precipitation of ASase components I and II (ASase CoI and ASase CoII) was obtained using anti-ASase or antiserum fractionated to contain component-specific antibodies. Anti-ASase inhibited enzyme activity to binding to determinants on both subunits. Anti-ASase CoI inhibited the ammonia-dependent reaction and interfered with amide transfer from glutaminyl-ASase CoII. Anti-ASase CoII inhibited the glutamine reaction by blocking amide transfer. Enzyme neutralization experiments indicate more conservation of determinants at the active site region of ASase CoII compared to ASase CoI in the enterobacteria. A particulate form of ASase-PRTase in E. coli, K. aerogenes, and S. typhimurium could be distinguished by quantitative precipitation and immunodiffusion...|$|R

The resultant <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> intergroup <b>dissimilarity</b> suggest that the urban areas are still exceptionally highly segregated, indeed 'hypersegregated'. Furthermore, spatial desegregation is both group and place specific. Whites have desegregated more slowly than other groups, and integration between Africans and whites is extremely limited. Although there are some variations between places, the heritage of country-wide enforcement of urban apartheid has eliminated most regional differences. Nevertheless, segregation levels were usually significantly lower in KwaZulu-Natal than the other provinces. Furthermore, the national and provincial capitals do emerge as significant centres of desegregation. ...|$|R
