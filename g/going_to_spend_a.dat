500|$|After being {{assaulted}} with dodgeballs by Connie D'Amico {{and other}} girls during gym class, Meg talks {{to her friend}} Ruth about how much she hates being at school and wonders if she can tolerate {{the rest of the}} semester. She then learns that Ruth is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> semester in Paris and is invited to join her in the program. Using the money she has saved from part-time jobs, Meg is able to enroll in the program. The family sees her leave as she enters the airport. Once she and Ruth land in Paris, they meet a man who offers to share a cab with them as they go to their apartment. [...] When the two of them arrive at the apartment, a group of men arrive and kidnap Ruth while Meg is talking to Peter on the phone. [...] When she tells Peter what she witnessed, he tells her to hide under the bed. She complies, but the men find and take her anyway. After Peter talks to the kidnappers, one of them tells him [...] "Drakkar Noir" [...] before hanging up. After that, Peter calls [...] "Lois, Meg's dead!" ...|$|E
500|$|Feige {{felt that}} the visuals of the film needed [...] "to be a Ditko/Kubrick/Miyazaki/The Matrix mind-trip", and said that [...] "You don't get into it in Harry Potter, but if a {{scientist}} went to Hogwarts he'd find out how some of that stuff is happening! We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of time on}} that, but there will be some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds." [...] In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like Fantasia and Harry Potter, wanting [...] "to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that." [...] Feige called Doctor Strange the [...] "doorway" [...] into the supernatural side of the MCU, a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the Doctor Strange comics [...] "broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the Marvel multiverse". Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' [...] "Earth-616 and Earth 617", but would instead feature [...] "dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them", like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, NASA granted US$15,000 to James Oberg for a {{commission}} to write a point-by-point rebuttal of the hoax claims. However, NASA canceled the commission later that year, after complaints that the book would dignify the accusations. Oberg said that he meant to finish the book. In November 2002, Peter Jennings said [...] "NASA is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> few thousand dollars trying to prove to some people that the United States did indeed land men on the Moon," [...] and [...] "NASA had been so rattled, [...] hired [...] {{to write a book}} refuting the conspiracy theorists." [...] Oberg says that belief in the hoax theories is not the fault of the conspiracists, but rather that of teachers and people (including NASA) who should provide information to the public.|$|E

2500|$|In 1938, [...] {{with the}} {{permission}} of the mistress of the house, Chandra was taken by Ajan Thongsuk to meet Luang Pu Sodh for the first time. She was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> month at Wat Paknam. [...] Having met Luang Pu Sodh, he addressed her with the words: [...] "You are too late!" [...] as though they had known each other previously. He allowed her to join an experienced group of meditation practitioners in Wat Paknam without having to pass any probation or tests. This was highly unusual. This privilege was not taken for granted by others at the temple, however, and she was looked down on at first. Despite these obstacles, she was able to develop her meditation and, still within the first month, was given a special meditation seat (...) used for training mindfulness, considered a sign of inner progress. Before her period of leave was finished, Chandra decided to ordain as a mae ji and stay at Wat Paknam. She and Ajan Thongsuk ordained at the same day. In the literature of Wat Phra Dhammakaya, it is described that Mae Ji Chandra quickly became one of Luang Lu Sodh's best students and was praised by him as [...] "first among many, second to none". At that time, she became well-known because people believed she had the ability to share merit with people who had died, analyze people's karma, and other forms of abhiñña (mental powers) coming from her meditation practice. Mae Ji Chandra is believed by some practitioners to have prevented several bombs from hitting Bangkok during World War II. However, other temples have contested Mae Ji Chandra's significance as the number one student in Dhammakaya meditation, claiming that an illiterate person {{would not be able to}} meditate at the highest levels.|$|E

The target seems to be a restart of the full league in 2005 but with a series of exhibition games this year, which will still involve the foreign players." ...|$|R

Edie learns that Carlos's blindness is permanent, when {{she thought it was}} only temporary. Later Edie tells Gabrielle that the way she is treating Carlos is sick and that there are other women out there who would treat Carlos better. When Bree and Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan) are having troubles, Edie lets Orson stay with her. Edie later shares a brief drunken kiss with Orson which is seen by Bree, who is looking for Toby the cat. Bree confronts Edie about the kiss. When Edie says it meant nothing, Bree slaps her and a full-scale war erupts between them. Bree sabotages Edie's business by hounding off potential house buyers. Edie visits Orson, who is now living at a hotel, to complain about Bree. When she enters the room, she discovers a piece of paper revealing that Bree's baby is really Austin and Danielle's. Edie threatens to tell everyone about it unless Bree does exactly what she wants. Bree tells her friends about her faked pregnancy and about Edie's threats. The housewives confront Edie, and tell her that from now on they won't be friends with her anymore and will ignore her whenever she talks to them. Afterward, Edie calls Travers, and tells him she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> lot more time with him from now on.|$|R

40|$|Original title: Eropuit! The {{amount of}} free time that the Dutch have at their {{disposal}} is shrinking: they had {{more than three hours}} less leisure time per week in 2005 than in 1975. Despite this, the number of hours that people spend outside the home for recreational purposes has remained unchanged over the last 30 years. This report describes {{the way in which the}} Dutch spend their leisure time outside the home. It covers a diversity of leisure activities, such as museum visits, shopping, enjoying a drink in a pavement cafe, taking part in sport, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the sauna, <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> day at the zoo or engaging in open-air recreation. The report explores the variation between different groups in Dutch society in the frequency with which they leave the home for leisure activities. It describes how people's leisure repertoires differ depending on their phase of life. It also provides an insight into the number and type of people with whom the Dutch spend their leisure time outside the home. Finally, it looks at leisure mobility, including the distances that people travel for leisure activities and the mode of transport they use. Desirée Verbeek studied Leisure Studies at Tilburg University. She obtained a doctorate in 2009 with a research project on the sustainable development of tourism mobility. She currently works in the Time, Media and Culture research group at the Netherlands Institute for Social Research/SCP. Jos de Haan is head of the Time, Media and Culture research group at SCP.

She would have insisted upon taking the first train up to London, if March had not represented that this would not expedite the sailing of the Cupania, and that she might as well stay the forenoon at the convenient railway hotel, and rest. It was not quite his ideal of repose that the first people they saw in the coffee-room when they went to breakfast should be Kenby and Rose Adding, who were having their tea and toast and eggs together in the greatest apparent good-fellowship. He saw his wife shrink back involuntarily from the encounter, but this was only to gather force for it; and the next moment she was upon them in all the joy of the surprise. Then March allowed himself to be as glad as the others both seemed, and he shook hands with Kenby while his wife kissed Rose; and they all talked at once. In the confusion of tongues it was presently intelligible that Mrs. Kenby was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be down in a few minutes; and Kenby took March into his confidence with a smile which was, almost a wink in explaining that he knew how it was with the ladies. He said that Rose and he usually got down to breakfast first, and when he had listened inattentively to Mrs. March's apology for being on her way home, he told her that she was lucky not to have gone to Schevleningen, where she and March would have frozen to death.
