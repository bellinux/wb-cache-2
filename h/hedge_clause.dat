40|$|This {{study is}} carried out to find out types and {{functions}} of hedges in Hillary Clinton?s interview entitled Expanding the U. S. - Indonesian Dialogue. Hillary Clinton {{is one of the}} inspiring women nowadays. Considering her existence to inspire people especially women, this pragmatics study attempts to find the types, functions, and type in relation to each function in Clinton?s utterances. The theory that is applied to find type of hedges is the taxonomy of hedges by Salager-Meyer (1997), while the theory of multiple functions by Jennifer Coates (1996) is applied to find functions of hedges. It is found that Clinton?s utterances contain a lot of hedges, classified into seven types and four functions of hedges. The most frequent type is Introductory Phrases. The second most frequent is approximators of degree, quantity, frequency and time. The following are modal auxiliary, adjectival, adverbial, excluding nominal phrases, compound <b>hedges,</b> "if" <b>clauses,</b> and modal lexical verbs. In addition, noun as one of types of hedges that could not be found. Furthermore, functions of hedges that appear the most is expressing doubt, which is followed by searching for the right word, avoiding playing the expert, sensitivity to other?s feeling, and expressing confidence. In addition, it is found that one type can have more than one function depending on the context. Besides, the findings reveal certain types of hedges are used in relation to each function. Although, the result reveals that Hillary uses hedges to express doubt the most frequently, it can not be concluded that she is lack of confidence. This might due to her role as the representative of United of States that she has to be careful in giving statements...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{us think}} that as a nation, the United States is {{and always has been}} very {{conscious}} of property. The most legendary of our revolutionary slogans was 2 ̆ 2 no taxation without representation, 2 ̆ 2 which is fundamentally about taking property without consent. Almost from its inception, our Constitution has included a clause protecting property against takings for public purposes without compensation, whereas some other countries 2 ̆ 7 constitutions <b>hedge</b> their property <b>clauses</b> with flexible language {{to take into account the}} 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 public interest, 2 ̆ 2 or—as in the case of our Canadian neighbors—dispense with constitutional property protection altogether. We have received a particularly large dose of the constitutional takings clause in the last few years, as conservative public interest groups have used the property clause to attack many environmental and land use regulations as unconstitutional takings of property. Indeed, property-rights proponents now seem poised to use takings doctrine to demand compensation for all kinds of regulatory change, since almost any regulatory change has some impact on someone 2 ̆ 7 s property values. This question of regulatory takings is the main subject of this article, but my plan is to frame the regulatory takings issue in a larger context of expropriations in American law...|$|R
40|$|Extended Abstract: This {{linguistic}} {{study investigated}} information exchange in a smoking cessation forum {{in view of}} persuasion based on a small corpus of ten threads. Fellow quitters share information about how to best deal with the quit smoking journey, they encourage each other to persevere in quitting and give each other advice on medication or coping with withdrawal symptoms. According to interpersonal pragmatics, these interactions always feature both, informational and relational aspects. It is thus of interest how participants share information in online settings, e. g. what kind of speech acts participants use to convey information and how participants deal with the rhetorical challenges of showing their authenticity or expertise through language. The content structure of messages was determined by categorizing entire messages of threads into discursive moves, i. e. what a passage contributes to ongoing interaction (Locher & Limberg, 2012). Results illustrate that sharing information happens in a certain order on threads, {{in which there are}} clear communicative expectations of contributors. Thread initiators assume the role of help-seekers since they provide more information on their own background, request advice and thank participants for advice received. Contributors who respond to a first post become advice-givers: they share personalised information in the form of advice, assessment and of their own experience. However, responding contributors do not directly dive into the more informational exchange of their message, but often engage in tending to the relational side of interaction. For instance, they greet initiators in {{more than half of all}} posts and welcome them to the community if initiators are entirely new to the group. Assessment and advice were the most frequent discursive moves used by advice-givers or responding contributors. My analysis showed that these discursive moves usually appeared in a preferred sequence. Assessments tend to be initial moves in respondents’ post, often pre- sequencing advice. In contrast, advice was more often found to be the last move before farewell. Qualitative close readings showed that there are three overall discursive functions of assessments: First, participants normalize concerns through the use of will-future and of adjectives such as common and normal. Secondly, they reassure help-seekers by using the present continuous do + adjective to evaluate initiator’s situation, which has an encouraging effect. Thirdly, assessments are used to praise help-seekers’ efforts, which has an entirely interpersonal function. The qualitative close readings of the discursive move advice showed that there are four different thematic kinds within this particular online support group. Firstly, respondents gave advice to continue posting to the forum, which was characterized use of the verb by post or keep posting in terms of linguistic patterns. This kind of advice can be seen as discursive community work as it is geared towards strengthening the ties between the initial contributor and the overall group. Secondly, responding contributors gave advice to persevere in quitting, which featured imperatives of verbs with a time component stick to, keep, hang in there, etc. Advice to persevere has a clear motivational function since respondents explicitly encourage help-seekers to continue quitting. Both of these first two advice types have a clearly interpersonal function, geared towards building rapport with the initial contributor. Thirdly, responding contributors give advice to take one day at time, which is the most commonly suggested coping strategy in the group. At the same time, it often co-occurs with displays of empathy as advice-givers reassure help-seekers that it is normal to struggle. Finally, responding contributors also give concrete pieces of advice on how initial contributors should alter their action environment. In these cases hedging and mitigation was more common. For example, advice-givers use if-or when-clauses to index the optionality of their advice. Moreover, imperatives do rarely occur on their own without <b>hedging</b> or sub- <b>clauses.</b> Further, the discursive move ‘own experience’ appeared to be multi-functional as also discussed by previous researchers. It was used to bond with initiators while also constructing responding contributors as experienced, thus serving as a legitimizing strategy. Moreover, own experience could be constructed as indirect advice in some cases. As the other side of the medal, background information was used by initial posters to show their authenticity as help-seekers. They share relapses, or inform about their progress, describe withdrawal symptoms and discuss health problems, which confirmed findings from earlier studies. These findings highlight that sharing information and giving support were inextricably linked since the declared persuasive purpose of wanting to affect each other’s quitting journey meant that, ultimately, any information or advice aimed at reinforcing help- seekers’ determination...|$|R
