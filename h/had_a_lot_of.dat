5|$|In a 1988 TV special, series creator Gene Roddenberry said that, as {{with the}} first pilot, this one still <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> science-fiction {{elements}} in it, {{but at least it}} ended with Kirk in a bare-knuckle fistfight with Mitchell and that's what sold NBC on Star Trek.|$|E

Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, {{three young}} boys {{turned up at}} a senior {{athletics}} meet in Geelong, Victoria.

A few months later, Billingham held a coaching camp for secondary school students. His camp <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> primary school students in attendance.|$|E

5|$|On April 4, {{he started}} against the Lotte Giants. He pitched 7 innings, while {{allowing}} 3 earned runs, but no run support and poor defence {{caused him to}} take the loss. During the rest of April, Hacker <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trouble in dealing with runners on base, because his pitching motion was vulnerable to stolen bases. So, by the end of April, Hacker was forced to make changes his pitching delivery.|$|E
5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time {{thinking}} about {{the design of the}} blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough {{that it is impossible to}} read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E

5|$|I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{theories}} I {{was working}} with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't {{want to have a}} scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E
5|$|In interviews, Garcia, Dae Kim, and Holloway {{commented that}} they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun {{shooting}} their scenes, {{as they had}} not worked together for a while. The episode marked the first appearance of recurring guest actor Cheech Marin. It first aired on February 28, 2007, in the United States on ABC, with an estimated 12.78 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews, with many praising its humor but still noting that little was learned concerning the show's overall mythology.|$|E
5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{all major}} sports {{publications}} had the Sooners {{in the preseason}} Top 10. Some had the Sooners as the preseason No. 1 pick including Athlon, Phil Steele and Gold Sheet. The team <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> young talent this year. The high school scouting website Rivals.com ranked Oklahoma's 2005 recruiting class {{number one in the}} nation and the 2006 recruiting class number nine. Most of the 2006 signees redshirted and did not play in 2006. When combined with statements from the Oklahoma coaching staff, the Sooners expected to be back in contention for the national title this year. On July 24, 2006, the Sooners were a 51 favorite to win the National Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} founded by the Reverend Joseph Farrall Wright, Perpetual curate of Christ Church Bolton and Thomas Ogden, the {{schoolmaster}} at the adjacent church school in 1874 as Christ Church F.C. It was initially run from {{the church of the}} same name on Deane Road, Bolton, on the site where the Innovation factory of the University of Bolton now stands. The club left the location following a dispute with the vicar, and changed its name to Bolton Wanderers in 1877. The name was chosen as the club initially <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> difficulty finding a permanent ground to play on, having used three venues in its first four years of existence.|$|E

She is saved by a homeless man with exceptional martial-arts skills named Chance Boudreaux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a former Marine Force Recon. Chance is initially hesitant to involve himself with her mission, but as his merchant seaman union dues are in arrears he reluctantly allows Natasha to hire him as her guide and bodyguard during her search. Meanwhile, Chance's homeless friend Elijah Roper (Willie C. Carpenter) is the next to participate in Fouchon's hunt, and is also killed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, the River Aire was navigable to Knottingley, and boats {{carrying}} up to 30tons {{traded on the}} river, which was tidal up to this point. The traders of Leeds were keen to have a navigable link to the town, to make easier the export of woollen cloth, but bills presented to Parliament in 1621 and 1625 had failed. William Pickering, who was mayor of Leeds, had made further attempts to obtain an act of Parliament for improvements to the river in 1679, again without success. As the 1600s drew to a close, a number of bills were passed for other rivers, and there was general support for river navigations. A bill was drawn up in 1698, with support from wool traders in Leeds and general merchants in Wakefield. John Hadley surveyed the Aire, and Samuel Shelton surveyed the Calder. Although the bill <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> support, it was opposed by the City of York, who feared that the River Ouse would be damaged by the scheme.|$|E
5|$|Mother 3 is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console in 2006. The {{music for the}} game was composed exclusively by Shogo Sakai, who he had previously composed music for games such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Kirby Air Ride. Series developer Shigesato Itoi stated that Sakai was given the position because he understood Mother 3 the most, given {{that he could not}} use Keiichi Suzuki or Hirokazu Tanaka, the composers for the first two games, as they were both busy with other projects. Itoi also said that given the massive amount of songs in the game, over 250, he needed someone who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time to dedicate to the project and who could focus exclusively on it.|$|E

He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The now {{recurring}} character Professor Frink {{makes his}} first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that was {{before he became a}} writer for the show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows was perfect for the role because she was very sweet, and the staff <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fun during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the closing credits actually states which characters each actor voices. This was done because the staff often received questions from fans regarding what characters each voice actor provided the voice for.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
