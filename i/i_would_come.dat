25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
25|$|Wilson’s diary {{records that}} on 24 March he (5pm) telephoned Lloyd George {{to ask him}} to come to London, {{received}} a telephone call from Foch (“asking what I thought of situation & we are of one mind that someone must catch a hold or we shall be beaten. I said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> over and see him”), then had a meeting with Lloyd George at Downing Street where they discussed “the entirely inadequate measures taken by Haig and Petain” before receiving an evening message from Haig asking him to come over. There is no evidence to confirm Haig's later claim that, on returning from a midnight meeting with Petain at 3am on 25 March, he telegraphed to Wilson and Milner to come over to France and ensure the appointment of “Foch or some other determined general who would fight” as Allied Generalissimo. Wilson reached GHQ at Montreuil at 11.30am on 25 March, having left London by special train at 6.50am then crossed to France on a destroyer. He chided Haig for having, together with Petain, blocked the plan for an Allied reserve, although in fact Petain sent a dozen divisions and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster. Travers argued that the true reason for Wilson’s visit to France was to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, but this view is not accepted by other scholars.|$|E
500|$|The 2012 Summer Games marked Sherab Zam's Olympic debut. She was {{the flag}} bearer {{at both the}} opening and closing ceremonies. She {{qualified}} for the individual archery competition after receiving a wildcard from the Tripartite Commission. In an interview with Reuters before the games Zam said that [...] "Participation {{is more important than}} winning a medal." [...] Zam spent time in South Korea and India preparing for the games. The archery events at the 2012 games were held at the Lord's Cricket Ground. Zam competed on 27 July in the ranking round, finishing 61st out of 64 competitors with 589 points. She scored 82 points less than the leading competitor, Ki Bo-bae of South Korea. Zam competed against American Khatuna Lorig, the fourth ranking athlete in the ranking round, in the round of 64. Lorig beat Zam three sets to none in about six minutes. This meant Zam was eliminated from the competition. After the games Zam said: [...] "I am not that good at archery but I love it. It was so good to meet world ranking archers who are famous and to watch how they do it. I have learnt a lot from them," [...] and that, [...] "When I grew up I never dreamt <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to London, let alone compete in an Olympics. This just shows that anything is possible. The Olympics is great for that." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's earlier {{sessions}} {{produced a}} little material {{that has made}} the final cut. West had brought a majority of his usual production crew onto the project, the same crew that had assisted in the creation of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. One of the main exceptions was producer No I.D., who felt that the two artists weren't pushing forward enough with the music. In an interview with Complex, No I.D. commented about the project that [...] "you're going to sell, because you're already big. But you guys are important to push this forward. Push intelligence and decadence and all of the above forward in a creative manner." [...] While his advice was acknowledged to a degree, he ultimately had very little part in the finished project. In January 2011, they regrouped and rented a block of rooms at the Mercer Hotel in New York City and invited a select group of producers and recording artists. Chauncey [...] "Hit-Boy" [...] Hollis, who produced the track [...] "Niggas in Paris", said of recording at the hotel, [...] "There was music going on in every room. I had a room where I was cranking out beats, and then I'd go into the main room with Jay and [...] and play beats for them. Kanye is really hands-on. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> in with a beat and he'd be like, 'Take this out, slow it down.' It would make it sound 100 times better. Jay would then mumble different flows to the beat".|$|E
500|$|Maggie Roswell left The Simpsons {{in spring}} 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs The Simpsons. The dispute was not {{revealed}} to the press at first; Fox originally reported that she decided to quit only because {{she was tired of}} flying between Denver and Los Angeles for the recording sessions. It was then announced by Roswell that she had asked for a raise, not only because she was tired of the traveling, but because of the increasing cost of flight tickets. Roswell was paid $1,500 to $2,000 per episode during the three seasons before she left, and she asked Fox for a raise to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not even cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit. Maggie Roswell told The Denver Post that [...] "they offered me a $150 raise. I mean, that's lint in Fox's pocket. But Fox wanted to prove a point, I guess. I was flying myself back and forth from Denver to L.A. It was exhausting. I loved doing the show and they thought that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> back. But now I'm busy doing other things." [...] She further added that [...] "I was part of the backbone of The Simpsons and I don't think the money I asked for was exorbitant. I wasn't asking for what other cast members make. I was just trying to recoup all the costs I had in travel. If they'd flown me in, I'd still be working." [...] At that point, the six main cast members of the show were paid [...] $125,000 per episode. As a result of Maggie Roswell's departure, the Maude Flanders character was killed off in the episode [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily". Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Maggie Roswell's other characters.|$|E
2500|$|Discussing the {{influences}} behind the album and performances, Perri listed [...] "love" [...] as the album's major inspiration. She added that {{she tried not}} to listen to any other music other her current projects to stay inspired and not get distracted. She continued, [...] "Because I write with piano or guitar, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> in with vocals and one instrument and we'd start from the ground up and add things." [...] Additional influences of the album include Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, James Taylor, Elton John, and The Beatles. Perri [...] "mushed it all together in my brain and made Lovestrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1952, I {{was flying}} down south {{with my wife}} Hope, and we left a bit later than usual {{and by the time}} we got over the Hamersley Ranges, the clouds had formed and the ceiling got lower and lower. I got into the Turner River, knowing full well if I {{followed}} it through, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> out into the Ashburton.

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Rice {{reportedly}} said, [...] "If we use the word 'genocide' and are seen as doing nothing, what will be the effect on the November election?" [...] She subsequently acknowledged the mistakes made at the time and felt that a debt needed repaying. The inability or failure of the Clinton administration to do anything about the genocide would form her later views on possible military interventions. She said of the experience: [...] "I swore to myself that if I ever faced such a crisis again, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> {{down on the side of}} dramatic action, going down in flames if that was required." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 29, 2011 Walker {{announced}} that he was considering a return to the NFL.

[...] "I want to be the George Foreman of football, come back and do that one more time... The two teams <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> back to play for are Minnesota or Atlanta. It would probably be Atlanta because that's home for me." [...] According to Walker, his mixed martial arts training made him, [...] "a much better-conditioned athlete now than when I was playing football. I'm 48 and in better shape now than I was when I was in my early 20s, playing football." ...|$|E

2500|$|As of , {{at least}} four demonstrations have been held {{around the country in}} {{response}} to DuBose's death.

2500|$|Rostam Batmanglij was a prior fan of Jepsen's {{work when}} {{he reached out to}} her in the summer of 2014, after {{learning}} that she was in Los Angeles writing with various people. Jepsen was [...] "over the moon" [...] and the pair developed [...] "Warm Blood" [...] until March 2015, the first verse recorded as Jepsen sat on the carpet of Batmanglij's home studio. Batmanglij announced the track's existence via Twitter on April 29, 2015. The song has been noted for its experimental vocal effects, with Batmanglij scattering distorted vocal cuts throughout, a [...] "creepy" [...] quality that the pair immediately liked. Elsewhere, sections of [...] "Warm Blood" [...] were sung in a lower pitch: [...] "I had shown up one day, and my voice was a little shot. The idea was that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> back and sing it 'properly' once I’d recovered, but we ended up getting married to how it sounded since my voice was kind of smokier, so we kept it." [...] Brad Nelson of the Guardian compared Jepsen's performance to that of Ezra Koenig's [...] "machine-produced flexibility" [...] on the Vampire Weekend song, [...] "Diane Young".|$|E
2500|$|Javed Akhtar narrates: [...] "Kamal sahab {{gave me a}} job {{and helped}} me. My salary was Rs.50 {{and even in the}} 60s, you could not rent a house with that amount of money. I used to sleep {{in a corner of the}} studio. I started living in the costume room of the studio. I didn't have enough money to even go out to have a meal. In the evenings I would just potter around in the drawers. There were many {{cupboards}} filled with costumes of Pakeezah; sherwanis, dresses, shoes. One day I opened a drawer and found amid the clutter, three Filmfare trophies. I dusted them and realized they were Meena Kumari's Filmfare trophies. I had never held a trophy and a Filmfare trophy was akin to the Oscar in India. There were big mirrors in the room. In the evenings <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> back and lock myself in the costume room and hold the trophies in front of the mirror, acting how I would accept it if I were to receive it. The first trophy I held in my hand was that of Meena Kumari! I was an eighteen-year-old boy who had no home, no money, no food, but these trophies encouraged me to achieve my dreams, and for this, I will be always thankful to Meena-ji." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 2, 1981, Stern {{began his}} third morning job at WWDC, a rock station in Washington, D.C. He was {{determined}} to become a success, and noticed the importance of news segments for satire. He wished for a news person to riff {{with him in the}} studio. Management paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a news anchor and consumer reporter from WFBR in Baltimore, who agreed to meet Stern after hearing him interview a prostitute on the air. Quivers at first [...] "thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> in and do the news...but it wasn't that way...he wanted someone to play off of...he wanted a real live person there with him". The show began to break format, and Stern held a lesbian edition of [...] "Dial-a-Date" [...] in May 1981. He formed the Think Tank, a cohesive trio of male listeners who conversed with Stern and played along with quizzes and routines, which helped the show sound more natural. By January 1982, Stern had the second highest-rated morning program in the city. On January 14, one day after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, Stern made believe he asked Air Florida the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge, the location of the disaster. [...] "Is that going to be a permanent stop?" [...] asked Stern. On June 29, 1982, Stern's contract at WWDC was terminated. He writes that the Air Florida segment was not the reason for his departure, nor did anyone complain about it. He had signed a contract with WNBC in March, and began to berate management and other DJ's on the air. Quivers, who left the show early on June 17, worked at WCBM in Baltimore until rejoining with Stern on October 18, 1982. Stern presented a farewell show two weeks later on competing station WAVA-FM. He had more than tripled the station's ratings during his stay.|$|E
