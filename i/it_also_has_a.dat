5|$|At {{least in}} North America, Calostoma cinnabarinum is {{distinctive}} and easily recognizable. Two {{other species of}} Calostoma also occur in the eastern United States. C.lutescens has a thinner gelatinous layer and a predominately yellow middle layer, or mesoperidium, with the red color confined to the peristome. It also possesses a well-defined collar {{at the base of}} the spore case, a longer stipe, and globose, pitted spores. C.ravenelii is not gelatinous, but instead has warts adorning the spore case, and is smaller than C.cinnabarinum. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> reddish peristome but is otherwise clay-colored. Unlike C.lutescens, the spores of C.ravenelii cannot be distinguished from those of C.cinnabarinum except through the use of atomic force microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust bathing and water bathing. Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E

5|$|Benthic in nature, {{the plain}} maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, {{and to a}} lesser extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females {{producing}} litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> limited distribution and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Bird Library is {{also home}} to the largest {{collection}} of national archives of Kenya and Tanzania. In July 2008, Syracuse University became the owner of the second largest collection of 78rpm records in the United States after the Library of Congress after a donation of more than 200,000 records. The donation is valued at $1million and more than doubles the university's collection of 78rpm records to about 400,000. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> special The Harriet Tubman Research Collection, and Environmental Justice and Gender collection housed in the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library. The MLK library holds over 15,000 acquisitions in African, African-American, Afro-Lationo, and Caribbean studies.|$|E
5|$|British Airways' {{main base}} is at London Heathrow Airport, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> major {{presence}} at Gatwick Airport. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> base at London City Airport (LCY), where its subsidiary BA CityFlyer {{is the largest}} operator. BA had previously operated a significant hub at Manchester Airport. Manchester to New York (JFK) services were withdrawn; later all international services outside London ceased when the subsidiary BA Connect was sold. Passengers wishing to travel internationally with BA either to or from regional UK destinations must now transfer in London. Heathrow Airport is dominated by British Airways, which owns 40% of the slots available at the airport. The majority of BA services operate from Terminal 5, {{with the exception of}} some short-haul and mid-haul flights at Terminal 1 arising from the purchase of BMI and some short-haul flights at Terminal 3, owing to a lack of capacity at Terminal 5. With the imminent opening of the brand-new Terminal 2 in 2014, Star Alliance airlines will progressively be moving all their services into the new terminal and Terminal 1 will be closed for demolition in due course. British Airways' services will then be concentrated in Terminals 3 and 5.|$|E

5|$|Caversham's 2006 {{population}} was 5,058.

Caversham also has nearly twice the average Otago proportion of one-parent families (26.5%). Ownership of and access to home telecommunications (such as the internet) and to private motor vehicles is considerably lower than the Otago average.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine's first {{ionization}} energy is third-highest among all elements, behind helium and neon, which complicates {{the removal of}} electrons from neutral fluorine atoms. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> high electron affinity, second only to chlorine, and tends to capture an electron to become isoelectronic with the noble gas neon; it has the highest electronegativity of any element. Fluorine atoms have a small covalent radius of around 60picometers, {{similar to those of}} its period neighbors oxygen and neon.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow {{than those that}} pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E
