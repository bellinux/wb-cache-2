40|$|Until recently, the {{economics}} and financial literature placed little {{attention on the}} role that financial intermediation can play in accelerating the rate of economic development in less Developed Countries (LDCs). This has been changed now, however, where some instrumental role has been emphasised for financial intermediation {{in the process of}} economic development and growth. It is argued that an expansion of the financial system, size and intermediation in LDCs tends to increase the level of savings, thus increasing the funds available for productive investment which induces higher economic growth and development. This research attempts to measure the relationship between financial intermediation and economic growth in Jordan for the years 1964 - 1988. A model of this relationship is built and tested. It is concluded that some role is played by the <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> <b>ratio</b> FIR on Saving, Investment and Economic growth...|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} financial development and economic growth in a small open economy of United Arab Emirates (UAE). Using time series data from 1974 to 2008, the study employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to co-integration. The analysis is carried out using two indicators to measure the level of financial development. The first indicator is the financial depth or size of the financial intermediaries sector {{as measured by the}} monetization ratio (M 2 /GDP). The second indicator is the ratio of the credit provided to private sector by commercial banks {{as a percentage of the}} GDP (<b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> <b>ratio).</b> The results show a negative and statistically significant relationship between financial development, as measured by M 2 /GDP, and economic growth.

40|$|Over 40 years ago, Raymond Goldsmith (1969) {{developed}} the <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> <b>ratio</b> {{to illustrate the}} steady increase in the ratio of financial assets to money income as a country becomes richer. He anticipated that financial assets would level off at somewhere less than double national income. In recent years, financial assets to GDP have reached as high as eight to ten times GDP, and finance now accounts for over 10 per cent of global economic output. This has led {{an increasing number of}} observers of all political stripes to ask again what finance is for. WHAT IS INTERNATIONAL FINANCE? One way to answer this question, admittedly banal and descriptive, is that international finance is that set of institutions, instruments and rules that are concerned with financial flows between countries (see Table 24. 1). There are at least two obvious shortcomings to this approach. First is that all of these elements are variously evolving, merging, vanishing and/or proliferating...|$|E

These two opposing trends would not have appeared if we had used traditional indicators computed as a fraction on GDP, or that build on a narrow definition of intermediation or use market value data.

40|$|The authors {{developed}} {{a framework for}} analyzing the relationship between domestic financial markets {{and the effects of}} trade liberalization and applied it to Sri Lanka's experience between 1977 and 1987. They found that the domestic financial market significantly affects the outcome of trade liberalization. Because Sri Lanka deregulated its interest rates when it undertook the trade liberalization, this allowed those earning more from trade liberalization to hold financial assets rather than nontradables. The availability of savings and time deposits at attractive interest rates prevented the premature appreciation of the exchange rate, thus helping to maintain the competitiveness stimulated by trade liberalization. By reforming interest rates, removing credit ceilings, and increasing competition among banks, Sri Lanka helped increase private sector savings - which could be reallocated to the tradable sector. Unlike earlier studies on financial reform in Sri Lanka, this one finds that financial reforms have increased private savings in financial institutions, raised economywide financial intermediation ratios, and expanded credit to the private sector. More important, the authors find a statistically significant relationship between the <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> <b>ratio</b> and the real exchange rate.

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} assess <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> {{efficiency}} in Germany, France, the UK, and Europe more broadly, {{over the past}} 60 years. I rely on Philippon's (2012) methodology, which calculates the unit cost of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> through the <b>ratio</b> of 'financial consumption' | measured by financial income | to 'financial output' | approximated by the sum of outstanding assets intermediated. The contribution {{of this paper is}} threefold. First, because financial industry VA ignores banks' capital income (capital gains, dividends and interest on securities) it is an imperfect measure of the consumption of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation.</b> So long as capital income generates wages and profits to financial intermediaries, it is akin to an implicit consumption of financial services. Using banking income instead of banking VA to measure the consumption of banking services, I show that the GDP share of finance has increased continuously in Germany, France, the UK and Europe as a whole. Second, the unit cost of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> increased over the past 40 years, except in France where, overall, it stagnated. In addition, the European unit cost matches the US unit cost calculated by Philippon (2012). Finally, because financial intermediaries deal with nominal stocks and ows, and because the unit cost increases during periods of monetary troubles, I focus here on nominal rates of interest to explain the evolution of unit cost. I show that a rise in nominal rates of interest increases the spread of bank interest, so that 1970 s and 1980 s high unit costs are statistically explained by increases in short-term interest rates. On the other hand, post- 1990 s high unit cost seems to coincide with the development of new market-based activities...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. This study {{assessed}} the developments in <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> {{services provided by}} Namibia’s commercial banking sector during 1995 to 2008. The study used two measurements of financial deepening in order to ascertain whether {{the role of the}} banking sector has become more important in the economy or not. These methods are the credit extension to non-finance private sector and the <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> to GDP <b>ratio.</b> Unlike previous studies, which found that <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> has not deepened before or after independence (Shiimi & Kadhikwa, 1999; Kavari, 2003), this study found some evidence of financial deepening in Namibia as indicated by the increasing credit extension and <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> as shares of GDP. However, the banking sector did not perform well in terms of improving efficiency as banks continued to operate with high interest margins and became more dependent on fee income as opposed to deriving more of their income from intermediation activities. The largest chunk of bank credit was in the form of mortgage funding, allowing individuals, real estate and the business sector to be the major recipients of bank credit during the review period. The study took cognisance of recent measures aimed at enhancing the sector’s relevance and contribution to the economy. These include amendments to the statutes to allow entry of unincorporated bank branches in order to increase competition as well as requiring banks to reduce interest margins, amongst other measures. The study therefore recommends a vigorous implementation of these measures and that the regulator should extend its monitoring oversight to cover actual lending and deposit rates of interest in addition to base rates such as the prime rate and the mortgage base rate that it currently monitors. This is necessary due to weak linkages between the base rates and actual interest rates. The study further recommends a concerted national effort that seeks to ensure availability and affordability of credit on one hand, and to prepare bank clients, particularly the SME sector to be ready to take up finance on business terms on the other hand. This requires incentivising SMEs to become formal businesses and providing them with necessary training and mentoring services in order to improve their risk profiles...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that Muslim society {{inherited}} an interest based <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> system from others instead of {{developing their own}} banking system. However, Muslim Economists and scholars around the world made efforts to have and develop their own <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> {{since there was no}} initial working model to act upon, except the belief that interest-based <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> might be replaced by an Islamic one on the basis of profit-and loss sharing.

40|$|In {{existing}} economic {{literature on}} finance and economy, {{it is argued}} and generally accepted that <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> contributes to economic growth though the contending argument is that financial development is simply a result of economic growth. However, studies on the contribution of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> of nonbanks (as opposed to banks) to economic growth are relatively scant and too general to clarify the mechanism through which nonbank <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> might help economy to expand and develop. The focus {{of this study is}} on whether nonbank <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> contributed to economic growth in the case of Korea where the share of nonbank <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> increased from around 20 % in 1970 to more than 60 % in the early 1990 's. This study is particularly interesting {{in light of the fact}} that rapid economic growth in Korea was accompanied by a concomitant increase in the share of nonbank <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation.</b> As a precursor to the empirical analysis, this study shows theoretically that <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> of nonbanks subject to lesser liquidity control is complementary to, rather substitutional for, that of banks. Further, it is shown by optimizing a two-period dynamic model that under certain conditions nonbank intermediation increases an economy's savings mobilization and contributes to the economic growth. For empirical analysis, we used the annual data from 1972 to 1994 which can be considered as a financially repressed period. The empirical results are all consistent with the theoretically expected: nonbanks are complementary to banks in <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation,</b> increased the savings mobilization, and in the end contributed to the economic growth of the Korean economy during the sample period. Further, the estimated allocative efficiencies of nonbanks are almost in phase with business cycles, which may well be interpreted as consistent with the proposition that nonbanks <b>financial</b> <b>intermediation</b> made a significant contribution to Korea's economic growth...|$|R
