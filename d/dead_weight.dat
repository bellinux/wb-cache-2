I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E

25|$|Mushroom anchors are {{the most}} common anchors and work best for softer seabeds such as mud, sand, or silt. They are shaped like an {{upside-down}} mushroom which can be easily buried in mud or silt. The advantage is that it has up to ten times the holding-power-to-weight ratio compared to a <b>dead</b> <b>weight</b> mooring; disadvantages include high cost, limited success on rocky or pebbly substrates, and the long time it takes to reach full holding capacity.|$|E
25|$|Dead weights are the {{simplest}} type of anchor. They are generally {{made as a}} large concrete block with a rode attached which resists movement with sheer weight; and, to a small degree, by settling into the substrate. In New Zealand old railway wheels are sometimes used. The advantages are that they are simple and cheap. A <b>dead</b> <b>weight</b> mooring that drags in a storm still holds well in its new position. Such moorings are better suited to rocky bottoms where other mooring systems do not hold well. The disadvantages are that they are heavy, bulky, and awkward.|$|E
25|$|A {{luxury tax}} applied to goods and {{services}} for conspicuous consumption {{is a type of}} progressive sales tax that at least partially corrects the negative externality associated with the conspicuous consumption of positional goods. In Utility from Accumulation (2009), Louis Kaplow said that assets exercise an objective social-utility function, i.e. the rich man and the rich woman hoard material assets, because the hoard, itself, functions as status goods that establish his and her socio-economic position within society. When utility is derived directly from accumulation of assets, this lowers the <b>dead</b> <b>weight</b> loss associated with inheritance taxes and raises the optimal rate of inheritance taxation.|$|E
50|$|A {{curtain wall}} system is an outer {{covering}} {{of a building}} in which the outer walls are non-structural, but merely keep the weather out and the occupants in. As the curtain wall is non-structural {{it can be made}} of a lightweight material, reducing construction costs. When glass is used as the curtain wall, a great advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall façade does not carry any <b>dead</b> load <b>weight</b> from the building other than its own <b>dead</b> load <b>weight.</b> The wall transfers horizontal wind loads that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain wall is designed to resist air and water infiltration, sway induced by wind and seismic forces acting on the building, and its own <b>dead</b> load <b>weight</b> forces.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of these early {{locomotives}} there was not yet a way of forging an adequate steel spring to carry {{the weight of a}} locomotive. High quality steel had been available since Huntsman's crucible process, but it was still so expensive as to be regarded as 'a semi-precious metal'. It would be another forty years before Bessemer's converter made cheap bulk steel available. A similar problem affected safety valves, causing them to rely on <b>dead</b> <b>weights</b> or Hackworth's bulky stack of leaf springs, rather than the ubiquitous steel coil spring that would appear later.|$|R

The boat is secured to the cradle, possibly by raising slings under the hull using hydraulics, and the cradle is hauled {{out of the water}} and up the hill with a cable. At the top of the slope, the cradle is lowered into the upper waterway, and the boat released. As the boat is not floating, Archimedes' principle does not apply, so the weight lifted or lowered by the device varies – making counterbalancing (by <b>dead</b> <b>weights</b> or a second boat carriage) more difficult.|$|R
25|$|Ennore Port was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} satellite port to the Chennai Port, primarily to handle thermal coal to meet the requirement of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) and was endowed with large chunks of land (about 2,000 acres). The scope was expanded taking into account subsequent developments such as the plan of Government of Tamil Nadu {{to set up a}} 1,880mW LNG power project in association with a private consortium, a large petrochemical park and a naphtha cracker plant. Ennore Port was commissioned by the then Prime Minister of India Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee on 1 February 2001. The port was set up under the Companies Act, keeping it outside the scope of the Tariff Authority for Major Ports, the tariff regulator for 11 of the 12 ports owned by the Indian government. The port was declared as a major port under the Indian Ports Act, 1908 in March 1999 and incorporated as the Ennore Port Limited under the Companies Act, 1956 in October 1999. Commercial operations commenced with Handymax geared vessels for unloading of thermal coal on 22 June 2001. With the deployment of self-unloading and gearless vessels of 65,000/77,000 <b>dead</b> <b>weight</b> tonnage (DWT), full-fledged operations were started in December 2002.|$|E

500|$|Left Hand {{has been}} a focus of {{literary}} critique of Le Guin's work, along with her Earthsea fiction and utopian fiction. The novel {{was at the center}} of a feminist debate when it was published in 1969. Alexei Panshin objected to the use of masculine [...] "he/him/his" [...] gender pronouns to describe its androgynous characters, and called the novel a [...] "flat failure". Other feminists maintained that the novel did not go far enough in its exploration of gender. Criticism was also directed at the portrayal of androgynous characters in the [...] "masculine" [...] roles of politicians and statesmen but not in family roles. Sarah LeFanu, for example, wrote that Le Guin turned her back on an opportunity for experimentation. She stated that [...] "these male heroes with their crises of identity, caught in the stranglehold of liberal individualism, act as a <b>dead</b> <b>weight</b> at the center of the novel". Le Guin, who identifies as a feminist, responded to these criticisms in her essay [...] "Is Gender Necessary?" [...] as well as by switching masculine pronouns for feminine ones in a later reprinting of [...] "Winter's King", an unconnected short story set on Gethen. In her responses, Le Guin admitted to failing to depict androgynes in stereotypically feminine roles, but said that she considered and decided against inventing gender-neutral pronouns, because they would mangle the language of the novel.|$|E
