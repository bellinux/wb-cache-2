In response, members of Congress have begun to include language {{to do away with the}} President's exclusivity in making the determinations or <b>flat-out</b> remove the waiver provision completely from the Embassy Act altogether.|$|E
25|$|The new {{regulations}} introduced during the Monaco weekend to modify amongst other things the airboxes {{of the cars}} were now in effect and were visibly shown as teams had to cut holes in the engine covers. Another temporary chicane was installed prior to the <b>flat-out</b> left-right kink leading to the start-finish straight to slow the cars down. Benetton introduced a revised rear wing assembly and Ferrari had new side pods for their cars. Andrea de Cesaris was back in action, now with Sauber, and celebrated his 200th Grand Prix start.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the deaths}} of Senna and fellow Grand Prix driver Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994, many Grand Prix {{circuits}} were modified {{in order to reduce}} speed and increase driver safety. As a consequence of this the entry from Hangar Straight into Stowe Corner was modified in 1995 so as to make its entry less dangerous. In addition, the <b>flat-out</b> Abbey kink was modified to a chicane in just 19 days before the 1994 GP. Parts of the circuit, such as the starting grid, are 17 metres wide, complying with the latest safety guidelines.|$|E

He defended himself from attacks made by Bandić earlier in the week {{that he was one of}} those responsible for writing criminal indictments against Croatia's generals during the war, denouncing the claims as <b>flat-out</b> lies, saying that he offered legal aid to captured Croatian soldiers during the war.|$|E
25|$|After {{the tragedies}} of Imola in 1994, a chicane was {{installed}} at the <b>flat-out</b> Abbey corner 6 weeks before the event was due to take place and Stowe corner was slowed considerably. Hill won the event, something his double world champion father Graham never did. 1995 saw another British driver, Johnny Herbert, take victory in his Benetton. 1996 saw further changes to the circuit, where Stowe {{was more or less}} restored to its 1991 design, and the 1999 event saw double world champion Michael Schumacher crash heavily at Stowe; he broke his leg, missed many races and this put him out of championship contention. There were attempts to bring the British GP back to Brands Hatch for 2002, but this never materialised.|$|E
25|$|After a new pit building, the Silverstone Wing, was {{completed}} {{in time for the}} 2011 race, the start of the track was relocated to between Club Corner and Abbey Corner. Almost flat out, the right-hander of Abbey leads immediately into the left-hander of Farm before cars brake heavily into the second gear, right-handed turn three; Village Corner. The even slower left-hander of the Loop comes immediately after, and leads into the <b>flat-out</b> left-hander of Aintree, before cars head down the DRS zone of the Wellington Straight; designed in 2010 to promote overtaking at the track. Turn 6, the left hander of Brooklands, is taken by drivers in second gear and leads immediately into Luffield, another second gear curve; a right-hand hairpin. The right-handed kink of Woodcote leads cars down the old pit straight, before the difficult sixth-gear right-hander of Copse, with a minimum speed of 175mph in the dry for Formula One cars. Then, the challenging complex of Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel - a left-right-left-right-left complex with a minimum speed of 130mph- lead cars down the 770-metre Hangar Straight with the fifth-gear right-hander of Stowe at the end. The fifteenth turn of the track, Stowe, has a minimum speed of 125mph and precedes a short straight, named Vale, which leads cars downhill towards the Club complex. Heavy braking is required for the left-hander of turn 16, and understeer can be an issue for the next right-handers of turns 17 and 18, as cars tentatively accelerate round to the start-finish straight.|$|E

500|$|The {{four members}} of the Fab Five who participated in the film have had a tense {{relationship}} with Chris Webber, the one player who was not in the film. There was speculation that Chris Webber did not participate to avoid questions about the timeout call in the 1993 NCAA tournament title game. Webber said he initially agreed to be in the documentary but backed out after being told shooting would wrap up in a week, giving him insufficient time to prepare. Jimmy King called that assertion “a <b>flat-out</b> lie.” ...|$|E

A staff member from Filter Magazine claimed that [...] "surely your 80's obsessed best friend will love it". Bergstrom from PopMatters criticized [...] "Fascinated", which he called an [...] "undistinguished, <b>flat-out</b> boring song". He continued by questioning the refrain's simpleness and the production, which he found [...] "annoying".|$|E

500|$|Jolie starred {{opposite}} Johnny Depp in the thriller The Tourist (2010). The {{film was}} a critical failure, though Roger Ebert defended Jolie's performance, stating that she [...] "does her darndest" [...] and [...] "plays her femme fatale with <b>flat-out,</b> drop-dead sexuality." [...] Despite the poor critical reception and a slow start at the North American box office, the film went on to gross a respectable $278.3 million worldwide, cementing Jolie's appeal to international audiences. She received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance, which gave rise to speculation {{that it had been}} given merely to ensure her high-profile presence at the awards ceremony.|$|E

Sexy and luminous in the heat of her valor. Putting out fire – and setting it. It becomes an anthem of noirish dread and excitement, a sign that Laurent, as Shosanna, has found her destiny." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{breakthrough}} role in Bosworth's career {{came in the}} 2002 surfing movie Blue Crush, {{which she}} prepared for by working out with two separate trainers seven {{hours a day for}} months in order to add fifteen pounds of muscle to her frame. In his review of the film, Rolling Stones Peter Travers wrote: [...] "Bosworth is a star in the making, but even she can't outshine the surfing footage, which is <b>flat-out</b> spectacular." [...] The film received positive reviews and grossed $40million at the United States box office. Following the success of Blue Crush, Bosworth took on the lead role in low-budget Wonderland (2003) opposite Val Kilmer. Bosworth played the teenage girlfriend of porn star John Holmes.|$|E

500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{consider}} Moonraker {{one of the}} lesser films in the series, {{largely due to the}} extent of the plot which takes James Bond into space, some of the ploys used in the film for comedic effect, and its extended dialogue. In November 2006, Entertainment Weekly ranked Moonraker fourteenth among the Bond films, describing it as [...] "by far the campiest of all 007 movies" [...] with [...] "one of the worst theme songs"; while IGN listed it as eleventh, calling it outlandish and saying that despite the actors [...] "trying what they can to ground the film in reality, the laser gun/space station finale pretty much undercuts their efforts"; and Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the fourth worst film of the series, considering that the film [...] "just <b>flat-out</b> sucks".|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} establishing Ellie's physical appearance was [...] "critical". They {{felt that she}} needed to appear young enough to make her relationship with Joel—who is in his 40s—believable, but old enough to be credible as a resourceful teenager capable of surviving. A redesign of Ellie's physical appearance was publicized in May 2012; Druckmann stated that the change was to make her look more like Johnson. Prior to the redesign, comparisons were made between Ellie and actress Ellen Page; in June 2013, Page accused Naughty Dog of [...] "ripping off [...] likeness". The team felt that Ellie was important for the game's marketing; Druckmann said that, when asked to move the image of Ellie {{from the front of the}} game's packaging to the back, [...] "everyone at Naughty Dog just <b>flat-out</b> refused".|$|E
500|$|Many songs {{performed}} by Welch and Rawlings contain dark themes about social outcasts struggling against such elements as poverty, drug addiction, death, a disconnection from their family, and an unresponsive God. Despite Welch being the lead singer, {{several of these}} characters are male. [...] Welch has commented, [...] "To be commercial, everybody wants happy love songs. People would <b>flat-out</b> ask me, 'Don't you have any happy love songs?' Well, {{as a matter of}} fact, I don't. I've got songs about orphans and morphine addicts." [...] To reflect these themes, Welch and Rawlings often employ a slow pace to their songs. [...] Their tempo is compared to a [...] "slow heartbeat", and Cowperthwait of Rolling Stone observed that their songs [...] "can lull you into near-hypnosis and then make your jaw drop with one final revelation".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of Good Girl Gone Bad, Norman Mayers from Prefix Magazine wrote that the songs which were written by Ne-Yo [...] "don't {{necessarily}} gel with the more club-oriented material on the album." [...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine called the single a [...] "folky, midtempo R'n'B mush-fest", and said that, [...] "The whole affair is smoother than Lulu's forehead in the new Morrisons [...] ad, but it's almost criminal that Rihanna's releasing this when 'Breakin' Dishes' and 'Don't Stop The Music', a couple of <b>flat-out</b> floorfillers, are still stuck on her album." [...] The song received two nominations at the 50th Grammy Awards held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, including for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best R Song.

The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 and since its release has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA, making Dirt the band's highest selling album to date. The album {{was a critical}} success, with Steve Huey of Allmusic praising the album as a [...] "major artistic statement, and the closest they ever came to recording a <b>flat-out</b> masterpiece". Chris Gill of Guitar World called Dirt [...] "huge and foreboding, yet eerie and intimate", and [...] "sublimely dark and brutally honest". Dirt spawned five top 30 singles, [...] "Would?", [...] "Rooster", [...] "Them Bones", [...] "Angry Chair", and [...] "Down in a Hole", and remained on the charts for nearly two years.

500|$|A four-issue {{comic book}} miniseries, titled , was {{published}} by Dark Horse Comics.

All four issues were republished as a single package on October 30. The game's cover art was unveiled on December 9, 2012, featuring Ellie and Joel; the team fought to feature Ellie on the front cover, despite attempts from external influences to move the image to the back.

500|$|Balzac's novel {{has been}} adapted several {{times for the}} screen. The first was in 1927, when French filmmaker Max DeRieux {{directed}} Alice Tissot in the title role. Margaret Tyzack {{played the role of}} Bette in the five part serial Cousin Bette made in 1971 by the BBC, which also starred Helen Mirren as Valérie Marneffe. The film Cousin Bette was released in 1998, directed by Des McAnuff. Jessica Lange starred in the title role, joined by Bob Hoskins as Crevel, and Elisabeth Shue as the singer Jenny Cadine. Screenwriters Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr changed the story significantly, and eliminated Valérie. The 1998 film was panned by critics for its generally poor acting and awkward dialogue. Stephen Holden of the New York Times commented that the movie [...] "treats the novel as a thoroughly modern social comedy peopled with raging narcissists, opportunists and <b>flat-out</b> fools". The 1998 film changed the novel quite drastically, retaining the basic idea of Bette avenging herself on her enemies, and not only eliminating Valerie, but letting Bette survive at the end.|$|E
500|$|Besides Big Sugar, Douglas {{spoke about}} the damage the Army Corps of Engineers was doing to the Everglades by {{diverting}} the natural flow of water. The Corps was responsible for constructing more than [...] of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the Central & South Florida Project (C), run by {{former members of the}} Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much-needed water to the shrinking Everglades. However, in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers' irrigation needs, and <b>flat-out</b> refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable. [...] "What a liar I turned out to be!"

500|$|Reviews were positive, {{though most}} critics {{found that the}} {{character}} of Eko was killed too soon in the show. Writing for Zap2it, Rick Porter said that while [...] "The Cost of Living" [...] was the best episode of season 3 thus far with [...] "an illuminating flashback, some heavy island juju and a nice mix of the campers and the Others", the death of Eko removed from Lost [...] "one of its most compelling characters and best actors, which just <b>flat-out</b> sucks." [...] Kristin dos Santos of E! Online called Mr. Eko [...] "the best character of the show", and was therefore very disappointed with his death. Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated that she would miss Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and found Juliet's message {{to be the best}} part of the episode, that like the rest of season three [...] "answered a few questions (whose tumor?), raised a few questions (who's the eye-patch guy?), and ignored many long-standing questions (how did Yemi and Eko crash on the same island?)." ...|$|E
500|$|Fignon {{had won the}} Tour twice before, in 1983 and 1984, and was a {{very capable}} time trialist. It seemed {{improbable}} that LeMond could take 50 seconds off Fignon over the short course. This would require LeMond to gain two seconds per kilometer {{against one of the}} fastest chrono-specialists in the world. LeMond had done wind tunnel testing in the off season and perfected his riding position. He rode the time trial with a [...] rear disc wheel, a cut-down Giro aero helmet and the same Scott clip-on aero bars which had helped him to the Stage 5 time trial win. Holding his time trialing position LeMond was able to generate less aerodynamic drag than Fignon, who used a pair of disc wheels but chose to go helmetless and did not use the aero bars that are now commonplace in time trials. Instructing his support car not to give him his split times, LeMond rode <b>flat-out</b> and finished at a record pace to beat Fignon by 8 seconds and claim his second Tour de France victory. As LeMond embraced his wife and rejoiced on the Champs-Élysées, Fignon collapsed onto the tarmac, then sat in shock and wept.|$|E
500|$|The {{group was}} unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit visa because customs {{believed}} that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts. As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, [...] "The craziness was this: {{they were not the}} regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner...when you're doing what we do with them—that makes a world of difference". During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he [...] "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided Patriot missile, right towards the disco ball high above the crowd...The bottle nailed the disco ball, and... came falling down... on top of some English kid's head.... We must've knocked fifteen or twenty people <b>flat-out</b> cold on that tour...Shaggy and I both had black eyes and several injuries and bruises ourselves from them things hittin' us".|$|E

[...] The Hollywood Reporter summarized the film as being [...] "a <b>flat-out</b> mess, by golly, with massive narrative sinkholes, leading to moments of outstanding disbelief in the muddled writing and shockingly chaotic mise en scène that's accompanied by ear-pummeling sound and bombastic music." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{love song}} [...] "I've Been Loving You Too Long" [...] was co-written by Redding and The Impressions' lead singer Jerry Butler {{in a hotel}} near the Atlanta airport. Redding's {{rendition}} of Cooke's [...] "Shake" [...] is again more funky. The song is about the club dancing in the so-called discothèques, which debuted in the early 1960s. The song was described as [...] "a hard-swinging, full-throated 2:40 of precision ferocity with a force that would <b>flat-out</b> explode during his live sets." [...] The last five songs are all covers by popular artists: The Temptations' [...] "My Girl", written by Smokey Robinson and Ronald White; Cooke's [...] "Wonderful World"; B.B. King's [...] "Rock Me Baby"; The Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction", on which Redding sings [...] "fashion" [...] instead of [...] "faction"; and William Bell's [...] "You Don't Miss Your Water", which was characterized as [...] "sorrowful country blues", and has [...] "one of the most devastating pleading-man lead vocals in the entire Stax catalog." [...] "Satisfaction" [...] sounded so plausible that a journalist even accused the Stones of stealing the song from Redding, and that they performed it after Redding. Music writer Robert Christgau describes it as an [...] "anarchic reading" [...] of the Stones' original.|$|E
500|$|The {{next month}} in New York City, a January 15–21, 1898 double-elimination, five-man {{invitational}} 18.2 balkline tournament was arranged, again in Chicago. It was a handicapped event, featuring the five top players from the previous event – Schaefer and Ives, as World Champions, had to reach 600 points to Spinks's, William Catton's and George Butler Sutton's 260. Without having {{to rely on the}} 600-point handicap, Spinks beat Schaefer <b>flat-out,</b> 260–139 (with a high [...] of 48 vs. Schaefer's 38) in his January 18 second game.

[...] By January 20, Spinks seemed to be running out of steam, as Sutton took him 260–118, (high runs 73 vs. 30), and he lost again 154–400 (with another high run of 44) to Ives a day later. (In Spinks's defense, he not only did better against Ives than Catton had, but Ives also had a very impressive high run of 136, making it virtually impossible to catch up.)

500|$|These {{views are}} disputed by {{traditional}} and conservative biblical scholars who consider Samson to be a literal historical figure and thus reject any connections to mythological heroes. The concept of Samson as a [...] "solar hero" [...] {{has been described}} as [...] "an artificial ingenuity". Joan Comay, co-author of Who's Who in the Bible: The Old Testament and the Apocrypha, The New Testament, believes that the biblical story of Samson is so specific concerning time and place that Samson was undoubtedly a real person who pitted his great strength against the oppressors of Israel. In contrast, James King West considers that the hostilities between the Philistines and Hebrews appear to be of a [...] "purely personal and local sort". He also considers that Samson stories have, in contrast to much of Judges, an [...] "almost total lack of a religious or moral tone". Conversely, Elon Gilad of Haaretz writes [...] "some biblical stories are <b>flat-out</b> cautions against marrying foreign women, none more than the story of Samson". Gilad notes how Samson's parents disapprove of his desire to marry a Philistine woman and how Samson's relationship with Delilah leads to his demise. He contrasts this with what he sees as a more positive portrayal of intermarriage in the Book of Ruth.|$|E

A retrospective review by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was extremely positive. He noted that the album caused [...] "a hoopla that {{was a bit of}} a red herring since the band had been layering in synths since their third album, Women and Children First". He further stated that [...] "Jump"'s [...] "synths played a circular riff that wouldn't have sounded as overpowering on guitar", but that [...] "the band didn't dispense with their signature monolithic, pulsating rock." [...] He also stated that [...] "where [...] albums placed an emphasis on the band's attack, this places an emphasis on the songs, and they're uniformly terrific, the best set of original tunes Van Halen ever had." [...] He concluded that [...] "it's the best showcase of Van Halen's instrumental prowess as a band, the best showcase for Diamond Dave's glorious shtick, the best showcase for their songwriting, just their <b>flat-out</b> best album overall. [...] here's no way Van Halen could have bettered this album with Dave around (and they didn't better it once Sammy [...] joined, either)." ...|$|E
500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said it was [...] "an amazing episode, in which Homer {{actually}} has an argument with someone, rather than backing down. As he and his father drift further apart, so the family are at a loss at what to do. You can't help but feel sorry for Grampa as a piece of Simpson family history goes up in flames". Nate Meyers for Digitally Obsessed praised Dan Castellaneta's role in the episode and said: [...] "Dan Castellaneta's work as both Homer and Grampa Simpson in [...] is full of emotion and brilliant comic timing. Watch the closing scene carefully as Homer returns to his childhood home, because Castellaneta gracefully dances between a tender father-son relationship and <b>flat-out</b> comedy". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said he [...] "didn’t remember this as a very good episode, but it actually turns out to be quite strong. The initial plot in which Homer and Marge can’t get it together offers plenty of funny moments, and the scenes in which Homer battles with his dad offer depth and much humor. It’s also hard to beat the children's fears of the reverse vampires".|$|E
500|$|As {{was common}} with Pixar features, the {{production}} became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, Toy Story 2, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying. While {{hard work and}} long hours were common to the team by that point (especially so to Lasseter), running <b>flat-out</b> on Toy Story 2 for month after month began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators, and repetitive strain injuries for others. Catmull would later disclose that [...] "a full third of the staff" [...] ended up with some form of RSI {{by the time the}} film was finished. Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. Employees' self-imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints, and were especially common to younger employees. In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare one morning and, in a mental haze, forgot the baby {{in the back seat of}} his car in the parking lot. [...] "Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard," [...] wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch.|$|E
