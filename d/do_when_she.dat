500|$|Martha Kent, Clark's adopted mother, {{is portrayed}} by Annette O'Toole. Martha, {{along with her}} husband Jonathan, gives Clark sage advice about how to cope with his growing abilities. In season two, Martha becomes {{pregnant}} with her first child—in the season two episode [...] "Fever", Clark's spaceship heals her body and allows her to have children, something she physically could not <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> adopted Clark—but in season two's finale she suffers a miscarriage after an automobile accident. In order to help the family financially, Martha takes a job as Lionel Luthor's assistant in season two, but quits her job the same season in the episode [...] "Suspect" [...] for undisclosed reasons. She eventually takes over management duties at the local coffee shop, the Talon, in season four. She continues to manage the Talon into season five until Jonathan dies from a heart attack, which ultimately leads to her taking his state senate seat {{at the request of the}} Kansas Governor in season five's [...] "Tomb". This eventually paves the way to a job in Washington, D.C. in season six's [...] "Prototype", and the character's exit from the show. Martha would return in the season nine episode [...] "Hostage", where it is revealed that she has been going under the code name [...] "Red Queen" [...] while she attempts to keep Clark off of the government agency Checkmate's radar. She ultimately leaves Clark with a means to send the season's threat, cloned Kryptonians, to another plane of existence. In the season nine finale, it is revealed that before Martha traveled back to Washington, D.C. that she left Clark a new costume to wear while he defends Earth.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the plot}} progresses, Hilaret is set upon by Ramble, which provokes her {{to cry out}} [...] "rape". During this time, Constant, {{in an attempt to}} help a woman, is also accused of rape. They are taken before Justice Squeezum, who reveals his abuses of the {{judicial}} system. Hilaret comically forms a plot to catch the corrupt Justice Squeezum; he is able to overcome it because Fielding promotes dealing with corruption only through legal means, which Hilaret fails to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> resorts to relying on falsified evidence. Although Justice Squeezum and his corrupt nature almost overcomes the other characters, the manner in which this happens is done in a farcical way to provoke laughter.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{exploring}} indigenous issues, Praed {{documents in}} her novels [...] "a female {{perspective on the}} Australian bush", demonstrating her conviction that women could not achieve [...] "a decent life" [...] As she wrote in The Luck of the Leura, [...] "The woman always pays ... In spite of her husband's protestations, and to his genuine distress, {{she had to do}} all those things which he had declared should never be required of her". Spender argues that the similarities between the Brenda of this book and Praed's mother are [...] "impossible to ignore". However, she says that Praed does not endlessly copy her mother, creating instead [...] "realistic characters" [...] through which she generalised about the experience of women in the bush. Many of her heroines, too, confronted the question of whether to marry. In The Bond of Wedlock (1887) she explores violent marriage, and in Nadine: The Study of a Woman (1882) she looks at what a woman can <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> has a child and no husband.|$|E

2500|$|Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay {{analyzed}} [...] "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?" [...] {{in their}} book The Simpsons in the Classroom, in which they demonstrate how episode of the series {{can be used in}} teaching. They wrote: [...] "Although the show's characters do not often model expository writing, we can still find ways to use The Simpsons to illustrate the importance of style. Young writers, for example, may find that their writing resembles Homer's when he attempts to write restaurant reviews in 'Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner.' Homer's diction is poor, his piece rambles off, and he attempts to make the word count by repeating 'Screw Flanders' several times. We can thus illustrate that students need to reduce wordiness , while developing their arguments through pertinent content or parallelism. We can also stress revision by showing what Lisa is able to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> helps her father brainstorm. For example, when they need two more words to end the review, Lisa replaces 'Screw Flanders' with 'Bon appétit'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Newman's deepest {{relationships}} were with men, {{he had many}} affectionate friendships with women. One {{of the most important}} was with Maria Giberne, who knew him in his youth and followed him into the Catholic Church. She was a noted beauty, who even at fifty was described by one admirer as [...] "the handsomest woman I ever saw in my life". A gifted amateur artist, she painted many portraits of Newman at various periods, as well as several of the pictures hanging in the Birmingham Oratory. Newman had a photographic portrait of her in his room and was still corresponding with her into their eighties. Emily Bowles, who first met Newman at Littlemore, was the recipient of some of his most outspoken letters on what he felt to be the mistaken course of the extreme infallibilists and his reasons for not [...] "speaking out" [...] as many begged him to <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> visited Newman at the Birmingham Oratory in 1861, she was welcomed by him [...] "as only he can welcome"; she would never forget [...] "the brightness that lit up his worn face as he received me at the door, carrying in several packages himself".|$|E
2500|$|A {{high school}} girl who played {{softball}} and {{was devoted to}} manga in middle school. She {{is known to be}} a very dense person, a personality similar to Yoh's friend Fumi. Shortly after entering high school, she becomes determined to find a boyfriend under the influence of all the shōjo manga she reads. She accidentally meets Yoh after a failed attempt at being [...] "picked up" [...] by guys. Shortly after that, she finds out Yoh goes to the same high school as Haruna and asks him to coach her on how to be attractive. After being rejected, she meets Asami, Yoh's sister and they become friends. Soon, Yoh reluctantly accepts to be Haruna's coach with one condition — she is not {{to fall in love with}} him. Yoh helps her daily with clothes and such, and gives her advice on what to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> falls in love with one of Yoh's friends. Haruna can be described as simple-minded and doesn't seem to pay much attention to her surroundings, though she is very kind hearted and cannot refuse anyone who needs help. Her friend once stated that she is [...] "pure-hearted to the point of being scary". She eventually ends up liking Yoh and they go out.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear me, {{what shall}} I do for him?" [...] thought Nelly. [...] "He acts as baby <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was so ill, and mamma {{put her in}} a warm bath. I haven't got my little tub here, or any hot water, and I'm afraid the beetle would not like it if I had.
