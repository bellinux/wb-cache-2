5|$|Following the <b>Hong</b> Kong {{handover}} ceremony, {{when the}} Union Jack and the <b>Hong</b> Kong blue ensign were lowered to symbolise {{the end of}} British rule in <b>Hong</b> Kong, the blue ensign lost its official status {{and was replaced by}} the current flag of <b>Hong</b> Kong. In the 2010s, the former flag of <b>Hong</b> Kong was used by protesters to represent the cultural differences between <b>Hong</b> Kong and China; the flag was also used to protest Chinese interference in <b>Hong</b> Kong, as well as perceived Chinese breaches of <b>Hong</b> Kong's universal suffrage (granted by the Sino-British Joint Declaration). The first high-profile use of the old flag in protests came in 2011 during pro-democracy protests. Protesters often stated that they did not use the blue ensign to endorse <b>Hong</b> Kong independence or the return of <b>Hong</b> Kong to British control, but rather because they felt that <b>Hong</b> Kong had greater freedom under British rule. The protesters also said that they used the flag to express the contrasting values of China and <b>Hong</b> Kong. Advocates of the <b>Hong</b> Kong Independence Movement and the <b>Hong</b> Kong Autonomy Movement use a derivative of the blue ensign, without the Union Jack and with the Chinese characters for <b>Hong</b> Kong (香港) in the centre of the arms. The right to display the old flag is protected under the <b>Hong</b> Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and the <b>Hong</b> Kong Basic Law as an expression of free speech. Despite this, when the old flag began appearing in protests, pro-Beijing newspapers called for it to be banned. The pro-Beijing camp views the flag as a symbol of colonialism and a reminder of China's losses during the era of New Imperialism.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{observed}} from Table 3 <b>Hong’s</b> learning-based method [18] achieves an average AEI accuracy around 94 %; whereas the proposed scheme achieves perfect AEI accuracy, i.e., 100 %, for the same dataset. This comparison indicates that the proposed scheme performs relatively better than the selected <b>Hong’s</b> method. It is important {{to mention that the}} AEI results shown in Table 4 are obtained using manually selected decaying tails from speech recordings, whereas <b>Hong’s</b> method does not require any user input for AEI. We have also observed that when decaying tails are automatically selected using automatic tail selection method discussed in [42], AEI performance of the proposed method deteriorated around < 3 %, which is still better than the <b>Hong’s</b> method.|$|R

5|$|Sports in <b>Hong</b> Kong are a {{significant}} part of its culture. Due mainly to British influence going {{as far back as the}} late 19th century, <b>Hong</b> Kong had an earlier introduction to Western athletics compared to other Asia regions. Football, cricket, basketball, swimming, badminton, table tennis, cycling and running have the most participants and spectators. In 2009, <b>Hong</b> Kong successfully organised the V East Asian Games. Other major international sporting events including the Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics, <b>Hong</b> Kong Sevens, <b>Hong</b> Kong Marathon, AFC Asian Cup, EAFF East Asian Cup, <b>Hong</b> Kong Tennis Classic, Premier League Asia Trophy, and Lunar New Year Cup are also held in the territory. , there were 32 <b>Hong</b> Kong athletes from seven sports ranking in world's Top 20, 29 athletes in six sports in Asia top 10 ranking.

5|$|The Flag of <b>Hong</b> Kong between 1959 and 1997 was a Blue Ensign {{with the}} {{coat of arms}} of <b>Hong</b> Kong on a white disk. In <b>Hong</b> Kong, it is also nicknamed the <b>Hong</b> Kong flag (Chinese: 香港旗) or the Dragon and Lion flag (Chinese: 龍獅旗). In 1959, {{following}} {{a grant from the}} College of Arms and with the consent of Queen Elizabeth II, it was adopted as the flag of British <b>Hong</b> Kong. While the flag lost its official status following 1 July 1997 transfer of sovereignty over <b>Hong</b> Kong, it resurfaced in the 2010s as a symbol of protest against Chinese intervention in <b>Hong</b> Kong.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Hong</b> Kong {{government}} generally {{respects the}} human rights of its citizens, and members of the Legislative Council of <b>Hong</b> Kong and the District Council of <b>Hong</b> Kong are elected into office by <b>Hong</b> Kong citizens. However, there are 27 ex officio members of the district council (the Rural Committee Chairmen in the New Territories) as of the fifth District Council Assembly, and roughly half of the legislative council seats are elected by 3% of the people in <b>Hong</b> Kong through the functional constituency. The imbalance of voting power in the LegCo has led to widespread criticism of its inability to represent Hongkongers' socio-economic needs. In addition, the Chief Executive of <b>Hong</b> Kong is elected by 1,200 members based on their contributions to four different sectors of <b>Hong</b> Kong's society. This policy has received criticism from various political figures in <b>Hong</b> Kong, and led to the Umbrella Revolution. Plans to expand the voting population had begun to appear in the 2000s, and political figures liaised with the government to provide universal suffrage.|$|E
