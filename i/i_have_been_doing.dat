They've just changed {{something}} important in their lives forever." [...] When asked if O'Malley was becoming more assertive, Knight said: [...] Knight also commented that the character does not appreciate himself and his positive traits. On the topic of O'Malley performing open heart surgery in an elevator, Knight said: [...] "It's a slow change but he's starting to realize, 'The way <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> things is not working.' The big thing about the open-heart surgery in the elevator was he was forced into it. He needs to be kind of kicked in the (butt) to do these things." ...|$|E

Band member Siobhán Donaghy stated that {{around the time of}} the video's filming, her and the other group members were not performing as a group frequently: [...] "It's been fairly quiet recently, but it usually is between singles. The other two have been doing their exams, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> some interviews for newspapers and magazines abroad. Apart from the video for 'Soul Sound' we have not been doing too much together." [...] During the video, the group's members are featured in an apartment and are seated on couches and chairs. The plot involves their inner souls being released by the music, while outside in the neighbourhood the music takes control of other people's lives and causes their souls to be lifted too. The video was included on the CD release of [...] "Soul Sound".|$|E

There’s a couple things on there that I’ve never tried before, but for the most part it’s a return to the way <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> it all along — just the acoustic, organic feel.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On 12 March, Sullivan responded, [...] "I {{have lost}} the liking for writing comic opera, and {{entertain}} very grave doubts as to my power of doing it.... You say that in a serious opera, you must more or less sacrifice yourself.

[...] She further explains that [...] "the attitude, poise and voice are very distinct from mine and clash with the roles of young innocent girl that I am used to performing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wright later {{claimed that}} his {{decision}} to join the YCV had {{been influenced by the}} Kingsmill massacre of January 1976, when ten local Protestant civilians were killed by republicans. Wright's cousin Jim Wright, future father-in-law Billy Corrigan, and brother-in-law Leslie Corrigan, were also killed by republicans in this period. Wright later said of the Kingsmill massacre, [...] "I was 15 when those workmen were pulled out of that bus and shot dead. I was a Protestant and I realised that they had been killed simply because they were Protestants. I left Mountnorris, came back to Portadown and immediately joined the youth wing of the UVF. I felt it was my duty to help my people and that is what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> ever since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{easiest way}} to answer would be {{to tell you what}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not <b>been</b> <b>doing.</b> You left us in the winter, and I held on, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> before, till the next Derby Day; but I dropped so much upon that, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to make myself scarce for a bit. Then I came back again, and set to work to earn my living, and very hard work I found it." ...|$|R

[...] When you’ve been doing what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> for 5 decades plus, yes you’re gonna get critics. [...] People said, [...] "He’s going to fade away."

2500|$|The Romanian {{writer was}} by then an outspoken admirer of the Renaissance thinker, and his various records mention Machiavelli with words of high praise. According to {{literary}} historian Constantin Trandafir, {{the only other}} person for whom [...] "Caragiale reserved as many superlatives" [...] is Mihai Eminescu, Romania's national poet and his personal friend. Like with several other of his Schițe noi, Caragiale mentioned and credited his predecessor, first in his correspondence about the unfinished text, and ultimately within the footnotes of the published version. In one of his messages to Zarifopol, he invited his younger friend to review both texts and see [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> [...] justice with the story of my Kir Ianulea."

60|$|Mrs. Staveley {{declined}} {{to tell me}} whether she had offered a bright example of gratitude {{to the rest of}} the sex. When I asked why, she declared that it was my turn now to tell her what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I {{want to be}} arrested," [...] said Ralph, dubiously, [...] "for father and mother would think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> {{something}} terrible; but I would be perfectly willing to stand it if it would do you any good." ...|$|R

60|$|We shook hands. I felt so shy that I {{could think}} of nothing to say, but Mrs. Strickland came to my rescue.

For decades, Johnson received no credit. Willard and Johnson traveled about Florida, Maine, Los Angeles and Mexico, drawing the strip while living in hotels, apartments and farmhouses. At its peak of popularity during the 1940s and 1950s, the strip ran in 350 newspapers. According to Johnson, he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> the strip solo {{for at least a}} decade before Willard's death in 1958: [...] "They put my name on it then. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> it about 10 years before that because Willard had heart attacks and strokes and all that stuff. The minute my name went on that thing and his name went off, 25 papers dropped the strip. That shows you that, although <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> it ten years, the name means a lot." ...|$|R
