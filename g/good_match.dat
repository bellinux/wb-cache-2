5|$|A <b>good</b> <b>match</b> between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a <b>good</b> <b>match</b> and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E

Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a <b>good</b> <b>match</b> and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, {{and that she had}} effectively been a slave.|$|E

Mohamad describes her as being fatalistic and notes that she downplays her past by saying that any of a thousand girls in Tanjung Priok could tell the same story; he found her touching without being melodramatic, and notes that Yah was the first prostitute featured portrayed sympathetically in an Indonesian work.|$|E

After Bigg's sister Mary came to London, Charles {{eventually}} persuaded her to marry him in 1718. This was not seen as a <b>good</b> <b>match</b> for her, but the couple lived happily and had four sons, three of whom lived into adulthood. Charles (born August 1719) and Henry (May 1722), both became fellows of New College, Oxford and took holy orders. Their last son, William, was born on 10 July 1723, five months after Charles' death in February.|$|E

A parametric study is done for {{the distance between the}} patch array and the plasma wall in order to find what distance gives a <b>good</b> <b>matching</b> at the operating frequency for all the configurations. The performance of the reconfigurable system is observed in terms of S 11, maximum realized gain, radiation patterns by simulation and measurement.

However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing {{not to mention the}} marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time in}} casual settings and get to know each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Allen's cricket {{remained}} {{limited in}} 1931.

When Larwood withdrew with an ankle injury, Allen {{was added to the}} team; according to Anthony Meredith, writing in The Cricketer in 2002, Pelham Warner made this decision himself without consulting his fellow selectors, to their considerable annoyance. Allen did not have a particularly <b>good</b> <b>match</b> as a bowler, but was successful with the bat. When he started his innings {{at the beginning of the}} second day, England had scored 190 for seven wickets in reply to New Zealand's 224. He scored 98 in the 150-minute first session, and went on to score 122; with Les Ames, he added 246 for the eighth wicket. This was a record partnership in Test matches for the eighth wicket until 1996, and an England record for that wicket until 2010. England scored 454, but New Zealand replied with 469 and the match was drawn on the third and final day. This was Allen's only innings of the series.|$|E
5|$|By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his {{composite}} filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections {{at the ends}} of his {{composite filter}}s to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty {{that he was trying to}} overcome was that the image impedance techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a <b>good</b> <b>match</b> to resistive terminations in the pass-band.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} periodic <b>good</b> <b>matching</b> bands (which {{are centered}} at the O-lines) as the characteristic {{feature of the}} structures in irrational singular interfaces in the primary preferred state. This feature is shared by various structures described by different models for irrational singular interfaces, {{and it can be}} used to consolidate different descriptions. We have made a quantitative analysis on the distribution of <b>good</b> <b>matching</b> zones (GMZs) in a relationship with plane matching geometry. This analysis emphasizes that matching of one set of principal planes does not represent <b>good</b> lattice <b>matching.</b> <b>Good</b> lattice <b>matching</b> is possible only at the locations of 0 -d intersections, where three sets of non-linearly related Moire planes intersect. Matching of one or more sets of principal planes in an interface usually implies the possible presence of periodic GMZs in the interface. The analysis also explains why and in what condition a dislocation configuration can be described by the traces of Moire planes. The distribution of exact 0 -d intersections can be determined based on the O-lattice theory. The approximate 0 -d intersections can be used for determining it possible interfacial structure when periodic O-elements do not exist...|$|R
