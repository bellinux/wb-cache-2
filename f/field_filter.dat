40|$|In the {{application}} of the Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), some fingerprint images are noisy and corrupted. In such situation, an effectively enhancement algorithm to improve the clarity of the ridge structure is necessary. The available enhancement algorithms are based on either the local orientation <b>field</b> <b>filtering</b> scheme in space domain or the Gabor filtering scheme in the frequency domain. The local orientation could not be correctly estimated for fingerprint images of poor quality, which greatly restricts the applicability of these filtering techniques. The Gabor filters could obtain the reliable orientation estimate even for corrupted images, but it is time consuming. It is unsuitable for an on-line fingerprint recognition system such as AFIS.

The functional transformation from high-dimensional stimulus {{space to the}} binary space of spike and non-spike responses is commonly described with linear-nonlinear models, whose linear filter component describes the neuron’s receptive field. From a machine learning perspective, this corresponds to the binary classification problem of discriminating spike-eliciting from non-spike-eliciting stimulus examples. The classification-based receptive field (CbRF) estimation method proposed here adapts a linear large-margin classifier to optimally predict experimental stimulus-response data and subsequently interprets learned classifier weights as the neuron’s receptive <b>field</b> <b>filter.</b> Computational learning theory provides a theoretical framework for learning from data and guarantees optimality {{in the sense that}} the risk of erroneously assigning a spike-eliciting stimulus example to the non-spike class (and vice versa) is minimized.

40|$|A {{combined}} field, {{laboratory and}} modelling {{approach to the}} study of vegetated filter strips (VFSs) was carried out in order to provide guidance on optimum design and placement for trapping sediment from overland flow. Monitoring of fifteen established filter strips in the Parrett Catchment, England, informed on the complexity of intercepting flow pathways to optimise filter strip performance. Results suggest that a 6 m VFS will trap an average of 1. 74 t year - 1 of material from a field of 1 ha, but this is highly variable depending on design, placement and management factors. In most cases the majority of coarse sediment is trapped at the upslope edge of the VFS and is typically > 85 % sand. A revised Morgan-Morgan-Finney model was tested against a range of field and laboratory datasets and an efficiency coefficient of 0. 7 was achieved. When testing the model against the field results from the Parrett Catchment, an active filter strip area was used. This took into account only the area of the filter strip effective in trapping sediment due to the convergence and bypassing of flow pathways.

40|$|Sensory neurons {{are often}} {{described}} in terms of a receptive field, that is, a linear kernel through which stimuli are filtered before they are further processed. If information transmission is assumed to proceed in a feedforward cascade, the receptive field may be interpreted as the external stimulus' profile maximizing neuronal output. The nervous system, however, contains many feedback loops, and sensory neurons filter more currents than the ones representing the transduced external stimulus. Some of the additional currents are generated by the output activity of the neuron itself, and therefore constitute feedback signals. By means of a time-frequency analysis of the input/output transformation, here we show how feedback modifies the receptive field. The model is applicable to various types of feedback processes, from spike triggered intrinsic conductances to inhibitory synaptic inputs from nearby neurons. We distinguish between the intrinsic receptive <b>field</b> (<b>filtering</b> all input currents) and the effective receptive <b>field</b> (<b>filtering</b> only external stimuli). Whereas the intrinsic receptive field summarizes the biophysical properties of the neuron associated to subthreshold integration and spike generation, only the effective receptive field can be interpreted as the external stimulus' profile maximizing neuronal output. We demonstrate that spike-triggered feedback shifts low-pass filtering towards band-pass processing, transforming integrator neurons into resonators. For strong feedback, a sharp resonance in the spectral neuronal selectivity may appear. Our results provide a unified framework to interpret a collection of previous experimental studies where specific feedback mechanisms were shown to modify the filtering properties of neurons.

40|$|Abstract—Action {{recognition}} with cluttered {{and moving}} background is a challenging problem. One main difficulty {{lies in the}} fact that the motion field in an action region is contaminated by the background motions. We propose a Hierarchical Filtered Motion (HFM) method to recognize actions in crowded videos by using Motion History Image (MHI) as basic representations of motion due to its robustness and efficiency. First, we detect interest points as the 2 D Harris corners with recent motion, e. g. locations with high intensities in MHI. Then a global spatial motion smoothing filter is applied to the gradients of MHI to eliminate isolated unreliable or noisy motions. At each interest point, a local motion <b>field</b> <b>filter</b> is applied to the smoothed gradients of MHI by computing a structure proximity between any pixel in the local region and the interest point. Thus the motion at a pixel is enhanced or weakened based on its structure proximity with the interest point. To validate its effectiveness, we characterize the spatial and temporal features by Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) in the intensity image and MHI respectively and use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based classifier for action recognition. The performance of the proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art results on KTH dataset which has clean background. More importantly, we perform cross dataset action classification and detection experiments where KTH dataset is used for training while MSR Action Dataset II, which consists of crowded videos with people moving in the background, is used for testing. Our experiments show that the proposed hierarchical filtered motion method significantly outperforms existing techniques. Index Terms—Action classification, action detection, crowde...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of acid/water jetting {{treatments}} currently applied {{in the field is}} to clean up the filter cake formed during the drilling process and perhaps further stimulate the wellbore by creating wormholes if acid jetting is used in carbonate formation. This purpose can be achieved for the reason that the filter cake on the borehole can be mechanically broken by the high speed jetting action, and additionally, if acid is used, some materials in the filter cake can be dissolved, which can facilitate the mechanical breaking action. The knowledge of jetting effectiveness under various conditions is crucial for the purpose of optimizing the treatment design. In order to investigate quantitatively the effectiveness of acid/water jetting for filter cake cleanup and wellbore productivity enhancement, laboratory experiments were carried out under conditions similar to those in the <b>field.</b> <b>Filter</b> cake was deposited on the face of a 4 inch diameter core and then water or 15 % HCl were used for jetting treatment. The original permeability, the permeability right after the drill-in fluid damage, and the permeability after the jetting treatment were measured and compared. The effect of overbalance pressure during the jetting treatment was investigated. CT scan was carried out for those cores that may have wormholes after the acid jetting treatment. An analysis of the mechanism for filter cake removal and wormhole creating during acid jetting treatment was proposed. It is discovered that acid jetting can effectively remove the filter cake by penetrating and lifting it from beneath, and efficient wormhole creation can only happen when the overbalance pressure during the acid jetting treatment is above a certain value. Based on this study, several suggestions for field applications were made...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} and primary {{motivation for the}} work described in this thesis is depth of field post-processing. Previous methods for simulating depth of field were either too slow, or of low quality. Depth of field post-processing is {{a critical component of}} high quality rendering. Without depth of field, everything is in perfectly sharp focus, lending an unnatural, overly crisp look. In fact, lack of depth of field is an important tip-off that an image is computer generated. Depth of field is challenging to achieve when both high quality and high speed are desired simultaneously. This is because high quality methods are traditionally based on brute force, and fast methods make too many approximations. Intuitively, it seems odd that depth of field is so computationally expensive. Depth of field is a type of blur, and blur inherently removes information from an image, producing an output lacking high frequencies. Producing a simpler image should not be so expensive, and this thesis shows that, indeed, high quality depth of field blurring can be achieved in real time. Central to this thesis are the concepts of gathering and spreading. Gathering is the process of forming an output pixel by taking a linear combination of input pixels. Spreading is the process of expanding each input pixel into a point spread function (PSF) of some kind, and accumulating those PSFs into the output image. Image filtering is traditionally thought of as gathering, but a central idea of this thesis is that depth of field (and a variety of other applications) is much better suited to spreading. In the course of developing the mathematical theory of filter spreading, we happened upon a new type of image filter that is equally well-described as gathering and spreading. This new method, which we refer to as the tensor filter, is conceptually simple and can leverage the benefits of any combination of gathering and spreading algorithms. We have developed a variety of new fast, high quality image filtering algorithms. Except for the tensor method, all of these are spreading methods. The reason why we have a variety of techniques is because {{there are a variety of}} PSFs that one may wish to use. Our methods achieve speed by exploiting structure in the PSFs. As such, truly arbitrary PSFs are problematic, but high quality results can be achieved with both polynomial and Gaussian PSFs, as well as PSFs that have an arbitrary outline but a constant-intensity interior. While the original motivation for this work was depth of <b>field,</b> <b>filter</b> spreading actually has a variety of other applications. We have developed proof-of-concept applications for motion blur, implicit curves, and image warping. Filter spreading may also be useful for radial basis function evaluation and volume rendering...|$|E
