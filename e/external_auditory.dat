25|$|The beluga {{has a very}} {{specialized}} {{sense of}} hearing and its auditory cortex is highly developed. It can hear sounds {{within the range of}} 1.2 to 120kHz, with the greatest sensitivity between 10 and 75kHz, where the average hearing range for humans is 0.02 to 20kHz. The majority of sounds are most probably received by the lower jaw and transmitted towards the middle ear. In the toothed whales, the lower jawbone is broad with a cavity at its base, which projects towards the place where it joins the cranium. A fatty deposit inside this small cavity connects to the middle ear. Toothed whales also possess a small <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> hole a few centimetres behind their eyes; each hole communicates with an <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> conduit and an eardrum. It is not known if these organs are functional or simply vestigial.|$|E
25|$|Markers of {{occupational}} stress, which include morphological {{changes to the}} skeleton and dentition as well as joint changes at specific locations have also been widely used to infer specific (rather than general) activities. Such markers are often based on single cases described in clinical literature {{in the late nineteenth}} century. One such marker {{has been found to be}} a reliable indicator of lifestyle: the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> exostosis also called surfer's ear, which is a small bony protuberance in the ear canal which occurs in those working in proximity to cold water.|$|E
25|$|MEG is {{also being}} used to better {{localize}} responses in the brain. The openness of the MEG setup allows <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> and visual stimuli to be easily introduced. Some movement by the subject is also possible {{as long as it}} does not jar the subject's head. The responses in the brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG. Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, a number of studies have been done comparing the MEG responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices. MEG {{is also being}} used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a review}} of the results {{reported}} by studies on the impact of the Tibetan Plateau uplift on the body size, <b>external</b> organs, <b>auditory</b> organ and sexual dimorphism of animals. In high-altitude areas, strong selection pressures, such as low temperature, oxygen deficit, high frequency of strong winds, long periods of animal inactivity, and food shortages, have led to reduction in animal size, variations in the sizes of external organs, atrophy or degradation of auditory organs and increased sexual dimorphism. These evolutionary morphological changes along a gradient in the altitude are determined by differential energy distribution in the organisms...|$|R

2500|$|Barotrauma {{can affect}} the external, middle, or inner ear. [...] Middle ear {{barotrauma}} (MEBT) {{is the most common}} being experienced by between 10% and 30% of divers and is due to insufficient equilibration of the middle ear. [...] External ear barotrauma may occur on ascent if high pressure air is trapped in the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal either by tight fitting diving equipment or ear wax. [...] Inner ear barotrauma (IEBT), though much less common than MEBT, shares a similar mechanism. [...] Mechanical trauma to the inner ear can lead to varying degrees of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss as well as vertigo. It is also common for conditions affecting the inner ear to result in auditory hypersensitivity.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{fractured}} mandible {{can involve}} one condyle (unilateral) or both (bilateral). Unilateral condylar fracture may cause restricted and painful jaw movement. There may be swelling over the temporomandibular joint region and {{bleeding from the}} ear because of lacerations to the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> meatus. [...] The hematoma may spread downwards and backwards behind the ear, which may be confused with Battle's sign (a sign of a base of skull fracture), although this is an uncommon finding so if present, intra-cranial injury must be ruled out. If the bones fracture and overlie each other there may be shortening of {{the height of the}} ramus. This results in gagging of the teeth on the fractured side (the teeth meet too soon on the fractured side, and not on the non fractured side, i.e. [...] "open bite" [...] that becomes progressively worse to the unaffected side). [...] When the mouth is opened, there may be deviation of the mandible towards the fractured side. [...] Bilateral condylar fractures may cause the above signs and symptoms, but on both sides. Malocclusion and restricted jaw movement are usually more severe. Bilateral body or parasymphysis fractures are sometimes termed [...] "flail mandible", and can cause involuntary posterior movement of the tongue with subsequent obstruction of the upper airway. Displacement of the condyle through the roof of glenoid fossa and into the middle cranial fossa is rare. Bilateral condylar fractures combined with a symphyseal fracture is sometimes termed a guardsman's fracture. The name comes from this injury occurring in soldiers who faint on parade grounds and strike the floor with their chin.|$|E
6000|$|Section 116. The eighth nerve {{runs from}} the brain case (Cr.), into the periotic bone, and is {{distributed}} to the several portions of this labyrinth. In an ordinary fish this internal ear is the sole auditory organ we should find; the sound-waves would travel through the water to the elastic cranium and so reach and affect the nerves. But in all air-frequenting animals this original plan of an ear has to be added to, to fit it to the much fainter sound vibrations of the compressible and far less elastic air. A [...] "receiving apparatus" [...] is needed, and is supplied by the ear-drum, middle ear, or tympanic cavity (T.). In the mammal {{there is also a}} collecting ear trumpet (the ear commonly so-called), the external ear, and <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> meatus (e.a.m.). A tightly stretched membrane, the tympanic membrane, separates this from the drum. A chain of small bones, the malleus (m.), the incus (i.), the os orbiculare (o.or.), a very small bone, and a stirrup-shaped stapes, swing across the tympanum, from the tympanic membrane to the internal ear. At two points the bony investment of this last is incomplete-- at the fenestra rotunda (f.r.), and at the fenestra ovalis, (f.o.), into which latter the end of the stapes fits, and so communicates the sound vibrations of the tympanic membrane to the endolymph. A passage, the Eustachian tube, communicates between the tympanic cavity and the pharynx (Ph.), and serves to equalize the pressure {{on either side of the}} drum-head. A comparative study of the ears of the vertebrata brings to light the fact that, as we descend in the animal scale, the four ear ossicles are replaced by large bones and cartilages connected with the jaw, and the drum and Eustachian tube by a gill slit. We have, in fact, in the ear, as the student will perceive in the sequel, an essentially aquatic auditory organ, added to and patched up to fit the new needs of a life out of water.|$|E

30|$|The {{benefits}} {{found for}} {{music in the}} context of PA and exercise include a positive influence on intensity of PA and level of perceived exertion, alongside extension of workouts, but these have been studied mainly for therapeutic purposes and among athletes (Karageorghis and Priest 2012 a, b). Motivational elements of music may improve adherence to exercise plans by increasing users’ motivation for PA (Clark et al. 2015; Inzitari et al. 2009; Karageorghis and Priest 2012 a, b). In addition, audiovisual interventions such as viewing video material have a potential effect of shifting attention from internal stimuli (physical sensations) to <b>external</b> cues (<b>auditory</b> and visual stimuli from the music and video content) (Barwood et al. 2009; Hutchinson et al. 2014). Regrettably, the ergogenic effect of combined motivational music and video interventions has seldom been examined. The few studies carried out in this connection point to motivational music combined with video content as an element strengthening the positive effects of audiovisual interventions (Barwood et al. 2009; Hutchinson et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Objective: Children with {{developmental}} language disorders {{have been shown}} to be impaired not only in language processing (including syntax), but also in rhythm and meter perception. Our study tested the influence of <b>external</b> rhythmic <b>auditory</b> stimulation (i. e., musical rhythm) on syntax processing in children with specific language impairment (SLI; Experiment 1 A) and dyslexia (Experiment 1 B). Method: Children listened to either regular or irregular musical prime sequences followed by blocks of grammatically correct and incorrect sentences. They were required to perform grammaticality judgments for each auditorily presented sentence. Results: Performance of all children (SLI, dyslexia, and controls) in the grammaticality judgments was better after regular prime sequences than after irregular prime sequences, as shown by d = data. The benefit of the regular prime was stronger for SLI children (partial 2. 34) than for dyslexic children (partial 2. 14), who reached higher performance levels. Conclusion: Together with previous findings on deficits in temporal processing and sequencing, as well as with the recent proposition of a temporal sampling (oscillatory) framework for developmental language disorders (U. A. Goswami, 2011, Temporal sampling framework for developmental dyslexia, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Vol. 15, pp. 3 – 10), our results point to potential avenues in using rhythmic structures (even in nonverbal materials) to boost linguistic structure processing...|$|R

Immersion was defined as selective attention to <b>external</b> (non-game related) <b>auditory</b> stimuli and measured implicitly as event-related potentials (ERPs) to an auditory oddball task. The Immersive Experience Questionnaire (IEQ) was used to capture subjective indicators of immersion. The type of display had no significant influence on ERPs or responses to the IEQ.

The amplitude of late component ERPs to oddball stimuli were significantly reduced when demand increased from easy to hard/impossible levels. We conclude that ERPs to irrelevant stimuli represent a valid method of operationalising immersion...|$|R
40|$|The key to {{effective}} {{perception is that}} sensory information is interpreted as qualities that belong to the object itself. Cross-modal sensory integration is frequently inferred from the influence of one modality on responses to another. This chapter describes three types of centrally based interaction.

The frameless MRI stereotaxic technique was evaluated in 8 rhesus macaque monkeys using 3 D fast gradient echo MRI images with 0. 7 mm isotropic resolution. 1) Difference in stereotaxic coordinates of fiducial markers was compared between a traditional stereotaxic frame and the frameless MRI technique (n= 2). 2) Differences in stereotaxic coordinates for cerebral regions were compared between the frameless MRI technique and MRI obtained with the animal positioned in a MRI-compatible stereotaxic frame (n= 4). 3) The frameless MRI technique was further refined to prescribe electrode penetrations within a dural recording chamber in stereotaxic coordinates relative to the electrode microdrive. Differences in MRI coordinates were compared with the electrode microdrive (n= 3).

50|$|Ceruminous glands are {{specialized}} sudoriferous glands (sweat glands) located subcutaneously in the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal, in {{the outer}} 1/3. Ceruminous glands are simple, coiled, tubular glands made up of an inner secretory layer of cells and an outer myoepithelial layer of cells. They are classed as apocrine glands. The glands drain into larger ducts, which then drain into the guard hairs that reside in the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal. Here they produce cerumen, or earwax, by mixing their secretion with sebum and dead epidermal cells. Cerumen keeps the eardrum pliable, lubricates and cleans the <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal, waterproofs the canal, kills bacteria, {{and serves as a}} barrier to trap foreign particles (dust, fungal spores, etc.) by coating the guard hairs of the ear, making them sticky.|$|E

Animals obtain self-movement information from vestibular receptors, and possibly muscle and joint receptors, and efference copy of commands that generate movement. An animal may also use the flows of visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli caused by its movements. Using a piloting strategy an animal can use geometrical calculations to determine directions and distances to places in its environment, whereas using an dead reckoning strategy it can integrate cues generated by its previous movements to return to a just left location.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} a previously undiscovered aspect of primary auditory cortex function. Investigators now believe {{that in addition to}} coding for the location of sound sources in the <b>external</b> environment, <b>auditory</b> cortex may also encode information relevant to sound source motion. In this study, responses of single neurons in the left primary auditory cortex of rats were studied while simultaneously presenting binaural sounds which simulated sound source motion. The stimuli simulated a pure-tone source moving in several radial and circular dimensions in the front contralateral field of space. The results indicated that many neurons in the primary auditory cortex responded in a preferential manner to different directions of sound motion. Moreover, it appeared that cells with similar directional selectivity were organized in columns perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} cortex. There was also evidence that the speed of sound motion affected the responses of the cells. Additional stimuli were presented in an effort to identify which aspects of the motion stimulus were most critical for the neural response to sound motion. Among the cells most responsive to motion, radial movement was more likely to elicit an excitatory response than circular motion. There was also evidence that binaural responses in the cortex were more complex than those seen in the superior olivary complex, suggesting that the responses in the cortex are the result of integrated processing of time and intensity information from the olive, or, alternatively, that the responses at the cortex may arise from processing pathways independent of the superior olivary complex. ...|$|R
