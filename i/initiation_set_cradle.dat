While hierarchy and partial observability are usually tackled separately (for instance by combining recurrent neural networks and options), we show that addressing both problems simultaneously is simpler and more efficient in many cases. More specifically, we make the <b>initiation</b> <b>set</b> of options conditional on the previously-executed option, and show that options with such Option-Observation <b>Initiation</b> <b>Sets</b> (OOIs) {{are at least as}} expressive as Finite State Controllers (FSCs), a state-of-the-art approach for learning in POMDPs. OOIs are easy to design based on an intuitive description of the task, lead to explainable policies and keep the top-level and option policies memoryless. Our experiments show that OOIs allow agents to learn optimal policies in challenging POMDPs, while being much more sample-efficient than a recurrent neural network over options...|$|R

50|$|Further, {{time was}} {{recorded}} through the initiation by circumcision. Each initiation group was given special name. According to Professor Godfrey Mũriũki, the individual <b>initiation</b> <b>sets</b> are then grouped into a regiment every nine calendar years. Before a regiment or army was set, {{there was a}} period in which no initiation of boys took place. This period lasted a total of four and a half calendar years (nine seasons in Gĩkũyũ land, each season referred to as imera) and is referred to as mũhingo, with initiation taking place {{at the start of the}} fifth year and going on annually for the next nine calendar years. This was the system adopted in Metumi Murang'a. The regiment or army sets also get special names, some of which seem to have ended up as popular male names. In Gaki Nyeri the system was inversed with initiation taking place annually for four calendar years, which would be followed by a period of nine calendar years in which no initiation of boys took place (mũhingo). Girls on the other hand were initiated every year. Several regiments then make up a ruling generation. It was estimated that Ruling generations lasted an average of 35 years. The names of the <b>initiation</b> and regiment <b>sets</b> vary within Gĩkũyũ land. The ruling generations are however uniform and provide very important chronological data. On top of that, the <b>initiation</b> <b>sets</b> were a way of documenting events within the Gĩkũyũ nation, so, for example, were the occurrence of smallpox and syphilis recorded. Girls’ <b>initiation</b> <b>sets</b> were also accorded special names, although there has been little research in this area. Mũriũki only unearths three sets, whose names are, Rũharo 1894, Kibiri/Ndũrĩrĩ 1895, Kagica 1896, Ndutu/Nuthi 1897. All these names are taken from Metumi (Mũrang’a) and Kabete Kĩambu. It is strange that professor Mũriũki didn’t do more research in this area because he states that the girls’ initiation took place annually.|$|R

The consideration of the third invariant of the stress deviator on plasticity and ductile failure is a key factor for the model’ high accuracy, but due to its phenomenological character its applicability for materials design is currently not given.

The ophiolite comprises a mantle sequence including lherzolite, harzburgite, diabasic dikes, and cumulate to mylonitic gabbro lenses, and a crustal sequence comprising a sheeted dike complex and pillow lavas associated with pelagic limestone and radiolarite. Mantle harzburgites contain less CaO and Al 2 O 3, are depleted in rare earth elements, and contain spinels that are more Cr-rich than lherzolites. Mineral compositions of peridotites are similar to those of both abyssal and SSZ- peridotites. Neyriz gabbroic rocks show boninitic (SSZ-related) affinities, while crustal rocks are similar to early arc tholeiites. Mineral compositions of gabbroic rocks resemble those of SSZ-related cumulates such as high forsterite olivine, anorthite-rich plagioclase, and high- Mg# clinopyroxene. Initial εNd(t) values range from + 7. 9 to + 9. 3 for the Neyriz magmatic rocks. Samples with radiogenic Nd overlap with least radiogenic mid-ocean ridge basalts and with Semail and other Late Cretaceous Tethyan ophiolitic rocks. Initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ranges from 0. 7033 to 0. 7044, suggesting modification due to seafloor alteration. Most Neyriz magmatic rocks are characterized by less radiogenic 207 Pb/ 204 Pb (near the northern hemisphere reference line), suggesting less involvement of sediments in their mantle source.

40|$|The {{dentition}} of osteichthyans {{presents an}} astonishing diversity {{with regard to}} the distribution of teeth in the oral cavity, tooth numbers, arrangements, shapes, and sizes. Taking examples from three unrelated teleosts—the most speciose group of osteichthyans—and from the literature, this study explores how the initial tooth pattern is set up, and how this relates to the establishment and maintenance (or modification) of the tooth replacement pattern. In teleosts, first-generation teeth (the very first teeth in ontogeny to develop at a particular locus) are commonly initiated in adjacent or in alternate (odd and even) positions. The mechanisms responsible for these divergent developmental patterns remain to be elucidated, in particular, whether they reflect a field or local type of control. However, patterns of adjacent or alternate tooth <b>initiation,</b> <b>set</b> up by the first-generation teeth, can easily turn into replacement patterns where new teeth are initiated simultaneously every second, or even every third position, by synchronizing the formation of new first-generation teeth to the formation of replacement teeth at older loci. Our observations suggest that, once established, the replacement pattern appears to be maintained, as a kind of “default” state. Variations and modifications in this pattern are nevertheless common and suggest that tooth replacement is under local control, exerted {{at the level of the}} initiation of replacement teeth. Further studies are needed to test the hypothesis that regular replacement patterns are more frequent in association with the plesiomorphic condition of extramedullary replacement (replacement on the surface of the dentigerous bone) and more rare in the derived condition of intramedullary replacement (replacement within the medullary cavity of the dentigerous bone...|$|R

To estimate the cancer initiating roles of nearby roads and railways and to measure effective ranges. Design: Birth and death addresses of all children born between 1955 and 1980 in Great Britain, and dying from leukaemia or other cancer during those years, were linked to locations of railway stations, bus stations, ferry terminals, railways, roads, canals, and rivers. Nearest distances to births and deaths were measured, and migration data relating to children who had moved house were analysed. Excesses of close to hazard birth addresses, compared with close to hazard death addresses, indicate a high prenatal or early postnatal risk of cancer <b>initiation.</b> <b>Setting</b> and subjects: Child cancer birth and death addresses and their map references were extracted from an earlier inquiry. Map references of putative hazards were downloaded from the Ordnance Survey national digital map of Great Britain.

Main results: Significant birth excesses were found within short distances of bus stations, railway stations, ferries, railways, and A,B class roads, with a relative risk of 2. 1 within 100 m, tapering to neutral after 3. 0 km. About 24 % of child cancers were attributable to these joint birth proximities. Roads exerted the major effect.

Intervention Combination antiretroviral treatment. Main outcome measures Time to first TB diagnosis, adjusted for CD 4 cell count, weight, age, sex, previous TB, district and year, with ART, CD 4 and weight as time varying covariates and with death as a competing risk. Results: 3858 first TB episodes occurred during 78, 202 person-years at risk with ART and 5669 episodes occurred during 62, 801 person-years without ART (incidence rates 4. 9 and 9. 0 per 100 person years, crude incidence rate ratio 0. 55 (95 % confidence interval 0. 52 - 0. 57)). The adjusted sub-hazard ratio (SHR) of time to first TB episode after starting ART, compared to follow-up without ART, was 0. 67 (0. 64 - 0. 70).

40|$|The Late Cretaceous Gogher-Baft {{ophiolite}} {{is one of}} {{the best}} preserved remnants of Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithospheric within the inner Zagros ophiolite belt. The ophiolite comprises from bottom to top, harzburgites, pegmatite and isotropic gabbroic lenses within the mantle sequence, pillowed to massive basalts to dacites and pyroclastic rocks associated with blocks of pelagic limestone and radiolarite. Basaltic to dacitic sills crosscut the pyroclastic rocks. The ophiolite sequence is overlain by Turonian-Maastrichtian pelagic limestones (93. 5 - 65. 5 Ma). Mineral compositions of harzburgites are similar to those of fore-arc peridotites and overlap with abyssal peridotites. Most Gogher-Baft ophiolite magmatic rocks show supra-subduction zone affinities, except for some E-MORB type lavas. The geochemical characteristics suggest that Gogher-Baft ophiolite magmatic rocks were generated during subduction initiation. These show progressive source depletion leading to the formation of MORB to boninitic magmas. Early E-MORB-type pillow lavas may have originated by melting mantle that was not affected by subduction components as the Tethyan oceanic plate began to sink beneath Eurasia as subduction began in the Late Cretaceous. Initial εNd (t) values range from + 2. 6 to + 9 for Gogher-Baft magmatic rocks. Samples with radiogenic Nd overlap with least radiogenic MORBs and with Oman and other Late Cretaceous Tethyan ophiolitic rocks. The initial ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios range from 0. 7048 to 0. 7057, indicating modification due to seafloor alteration. Radiogenic ²⁰⁷Pb/²⁰⁴Pb isotopic compositions (systematically above the NHRL) and less radiogenic Nd isotopic compositions suggest the involvement of sediments in the mantle source in some magmatic rocks.

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of the current study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of minimally intrusive prompting procedures and preferred stimuli on protodeclarative joint attention initiations in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Two boys and one girl diagnosed with ASD participated. The experimenter provided attention and social interaction following protodeclarative initiations throughout all phases of the study. During intervention, a model prompt was delivered every 30 s if the participant failed to initiate a bid for joint attention. Results for the first participant show that a model prompt was sufficient to increase the rate of protodeclarative <b>initiations</b> across stimulus <b>sets.</b> Generalization was seen across sets, but not across environments. Subsequently, the model prompt was sufficient to increase the rate of protodeclarative <b>initiations</b> across <b>sets</b> in a second setting (classroom).

When pictorial stimuli depicting highinterest items and activities were introduced, the rate of protodeclarative initiations increased over time. We then returned to original baseline condition and saw an initial decrease, followed by a steady increase in the rate of protodeclarative initiations. The third participant withdrew prematurely due to medical reasons. The findings of the current study show that minimally intrusive prompts and natural consequences may be sufficient to establish protodeclarative initiations in children.

PIK 3 CA and P 53 (also known as TP 53) {{are the two most}} frequently mutated genes and are associated with different types of human breast cancers. The cellular origin and the mechanisms leading to PIK 3 CA-induced tumour heterogeneity remain unknown. Here we used a genetic approach in mice to define the cellular origin of Pik 3 ca-derived tumours and the impact of mutations in this gene on tumour heterogeneity. Surprisingly, oncogenic Pik 3 ca(H 1047 R) mutant expression at physiological levels in basal cells using keratin (K) 5 -CreER(T 2) mice induced the formation of luminal oestrogen receptor (ER) -positive/progesterone receptor (PR) -positive tumours, while its expression in luminal cells using K 8 -CReER(T 2) mice gave rise to luminal ER(+) PR(+) tumours or basal-like ER(-) PR(-) tumours. Concomitant deletion of p 53 and expression of Pik 3 ca(H 1047 R) accelerated tumour development and induced more aggressive mammary tumours. Interestingly, expression of Pik 3 ca(H 1047 R) in unipotent basal cells gave rise to luminal-like cells, while its expression in unipotent luminal cells gave rise to basal-like cells before progressing into invasive tumours. Transcriptional profiling of cells that underwent cell fate transition upon Pik 3 ca(H 1047 R) expression in unipotent progenitors demonstrated a profound oncogene-induced reprogramming of these newly formed cells and identified gene signatures characteristic of the different cell fate switches that occur upon Pik 3 ca(H 1047 R) expression in basal and luminal cells, which correlated with the cell of origin, tumour type and different clinical outcomes.

According to {{laboratory}} {{accelerated test}} data, {{stress corrosion cracking}} (SCC) in structural metal materials occurs by initiation and coalescence of micro cracks, subcritical crack growth, multiple large crack formation and final failure under the combination of materials, stress and corrosive environment. In this paper, a computer simulation model for the process of SCC has been proposed. The procedure is as follows: The possible number of crack <b>initiations</b> is <b>set</b> for a given space and the initiation times for all cracks are assigned by random numbers based on exponential distribution. The sites and length of the cracks are assigned by uniform random numbers and normal random numbers, respectively. The coalescence of cracks and the subcritical crack growth are determined based on the fracture mechanics. The simulation is terminated when the maximum crack length reaches a critical value {{or all of the}} possible number of cracks is initiated.

In the light, 50 % of the total 14 C label was found in the neutral fraction (sugars), 22 % in the basic fraction (amino acids), and 26 % in the acid- 1 fraction (organic acids). In the dark, about 95 % of the 14 C label was incorporated into the basic and acid- 1 fractions. Activities of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (expressed in micromoles CO 2 per milligram protein per hour) averaged 1. 95 and 8. 87 for the flower buds, and 28. 5 and 3. 6 for the leaves, respectively. The ability of orange flower buds to fix ambient CO 2 into different compounds suggests that this CO 2 assimilation may have some regulatory role during the early reproductive stages in determining citrus fruit <b>initiation</b> and <b>setting...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two {{patches of}} the {{tropical}} weed Triumfetta semitrilóba Jacq. (Tiliaceae) were studied in Viyosa, Southeastem Brazil, in the 1994 flowering season (March to May). Ten plants per patch, and five flowers per plant were randomly chosen for the following pollination tests: self-pollination; control; bee control; high load of crosspollen and high load of self-pollen. Fruits were collected to study seeds. Results for role of pollinators and pollen linútation in seed production were different between patches, probably because of differences in patch "quality" (nutrient availability, nÍlmber of flowers per plant and per patch, pollinator abundance). Seeds initiation. was independent of pollinators, but seed <b>initiation</b> and seed <b>set</b> were increased by pollinators. Seed production was Unútedby pollen, as seed <b>initiation</b> and seed <b>set</b> were jn¡:reased by high load of cross-pollen, only in one patch. Nevertheless, nutrients may also be limiting seed production, because ahigh load of cross-pollen did not maximize seed production, in either patch. Fruit abortion was higher in se 1 f-pollination and high load of se 1 f-pollen treatments, possibly because of selective abortion of self-progeny and fruits with less seeds. As expected for a weed species, T. semitrilobil has a breeding system where seed production is guaranteed by self-pollination, but the presence of bee pollinators increases seed set, and probably improves seed quality by cross-pollination. Differences between. patches showed that this species may experience spatial differences in reproductive success, with patches where seed production is limited by nutrients, patches limited by pollen, and patches where seed production is limited by both.

40|$|Objectives The {{lifting of}} baby car seats {{could be a}} {{contributing}} factor in persistent back pain experienced by many postnatal women. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the activity of the erector spinae muscles of postnatal women and a control group during three methods of lifting a baby car seat. Design A repeated measures design was used to compare three methods of lifting a baby car seat: symmetrical, asymmetrical and <b>cradling.</b> <b>Setting</b> Ante-natal clinic, Victoria Mansionhouse Unit, Glasgow. Participants Convenience sample of nine postnatal mothers and nine matched controls. Main outcome measure Surface electromyography was used to record erector spinae muscle activity. Results Independent two-sample t-tests revealed no statistically significant difference in resting erector spinae activity between the two groups. Analysis of covariance suggested a significant difference between the two groups for both sides and between the different lifting methods. For example, for symmetrical lifting, activity in the right erector spinae was 353 mV [95...|$|R
