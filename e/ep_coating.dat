40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of curing agent molecular structure on the tribological and corrosion behaviors of epoxy resin (EP) coatings, EP coatings were cured by three kinds of curing agents with different molecular structures including diethylenetriamine (DETA), isophorone diamine (IPDA) and m-phenylenediamine (m-PDA). The curing degree of EP coatings was identified by flourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The element composition and chemical bond structure of the as-prepared coatings were tested by X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The tribological properties of the as-prepared coatings were assessed by UMT- 3 multi-functional tribology test equipment and surface profiler. The anti-corrosion behaviors of the coatings were evaluated by an electrochemistry workstation in 3. 5 wt% NaCl. The internal structure and wear trace morphologies of the coatings were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Using of curing agents with different molecular structures resulted in different tribological and anti-corrosion properties for <b>EP</b> <b>coating.</b> While the coefficient of friction (COF) of <b>EP</b> <b>coating</b> cured by m-PDA was the highest, the one cured by DETA was the lowest, which {{may be due to}} the linear and flexible chain offered less resistance during the sliding process and hence it displayed the lowest COF. Besides, the anti-corrosion performance of <b>EP</b> <b>coating</b> cured by IPDA was the best and the one cured by m-PDA was the poorest, which may be attributed to molecular structure and molecular weight which can influence the crosslink network and interface structure of EP coatings significantly. At last, the tribological and anti-corrosion mechanisms of EP coatings with different molecular structures were discussed in detail. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cathodic plasma {{electrolysis}} (CPE) is {{an emerging}} surface engineering {{technology in the}} recent years. In present work CPE was successfully used for deposition Ni-P coatings on carbon steel. The deposition experimental results show that CPE possesses high coating deposition rate, faster than 4 µm/min. SEM observations unveil the bonding between Ni-P coating and substrate is metallurgical. XRD diagram analysis indicates that the phases of as-deposited Ni-P coating are Ni and Ni 3 P, transformed from amorphous to crystallized state. The corrosion resistances of CPE and electroless plating (<b>EP)</b> <b>coating</b> have also been discussed by polarization curves in 3. 5 % NaCl solution at room temperature. Scratch tester was applied to study film-substrate adhesion of CPE Ni-P coating comparing with EP Ni-P coating...|$|E
40|$|We {{proposed}} {{a strategy to}} enhance the conductivity of polycarbonate by using three-phase hybrid metallic/non-metallic fillers. Ethylene diamine (EDA) functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-EDA) are first decorated with silver nanoparticles. These Ag/ MWCNT-EDA fillers are then coated with a conductive layer of ethylene glycol treated PEDOT: PSS (poly [3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene]: poly [styrenesulfonate]) (EP). In such an approach, the MWCNT backbone is covered by a highly conductive coating made of Ag nanoparticles surrounded by EP. To understand how Ag and EP form a highly conductive coating, the effect of different wt% of Ag nanoparticles on EP was studied. Ag nanoparticles around the size of 128 ± 28 nmeffectively lowered the volume resistivity of bulk EP, resulting in a highly conducting Ag/EP blend. We found that in the final Ag/MWCNT-EDA/EP assembly, the <b>EP</b> <b>coating</b> enhances the electrical conductivity in two ways: (1) it is an efficient dispersing agent that helps in achieving a uniform dispersion of the Ag/MWCNT-EDA and (2) it acts as a conductive bridge between particles (Ag and MWCNT-EDA), reducing the particle to particle resistivity. When inserted into polycarbonate, this three-phase blend successfully reduced the volume resistivity of the polymer by two orders of magnitude compared with previous approaches...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{corrosion}} resistance of an electroplated (<b>EP)</b> Zn <b>coating</b> whose surface was chemically etched to produce surface defects (pores) is investigated in this work. Impedance and DC polarisation measururements {{were employed to}} study the behaviour of such coating in various corrosive media (NaCl, NaOH and rain water). Four different faradaic relaxation processes were clearly revealed in different NaCl concentrations (from 0. 1 M to 1 M). In the most concentrated solutions at least three relaxation processes at low frequencies (LF) appeared and were related to zinc deposition and dissolution. At lower concentrations and depending on the pH, only one process was observed. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corrosion current (Icorr) were practically stable in the pH range 5 to 10. In deaerated NaCl 0. 1 M, the EIS diagrams showed two time-constants at very close frequencies. From the EIS diagrams the porous nature of the coating was highlighted and showed that the dissolution mechanisms occurred {{at the base of}} the pores...|$|R

40|$|Graphene (G) and {{graphene}} oxide (GO) {{were added}} into epoxy resin (EP) respectively via chemical modification and physical ultrasound technology {{to improve the}} tribological behaviour of <b>EP</b> <b>coating.</b> The topographies of G and GO were detected by scanning probe microscopy. The chemical structures of the fillers before and after modification were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The across-section topographies of the coatings were detected by scanning electron microscopy. The tribological behaviour of the coatings was evaluated by UMT- 3 tribology tester, surface profiler and scanning electron microscopy. The results revealed that the coefficient of friction of the coatings decreased, and the wear resistance of the coatings improved {{with the addition of}} the G and GO. GO could improve the tribological performance of EP further compared to G. When containing 0. 5 wt% G and 0. 75 wt% GO, the coatings had the lowest coefficient of friction and best wear resistance. When the contents of G reached 0. 75 wt%, and GO reached 1 wt%, the tribological performance of the composite coatings decreased {{as a result of the}} agglomeration of the fillers. Finally, the anti-friction and anti-wear mechanisms of G-EP and GO-EP composite coatings were discussed in detail based on the results obtained in the preceding texts.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 8 th Dec 2018. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd Ice {{accretion}} and accumulation pose serious challenges {{for maintaining the}} operation and performance of outdoor facilities in cold climate. Epoxy resin, {{with a wide range}} of formulation possibilities, is widely used as protective coatings for outdoor facilities. However, bisphenol A (BPA), a key ingredient of conventional epoxy, is known to interfere with human's natural hormones and cause various disorders in the body system. Reduction or complete elimination of the usage of BPA is therefore high in the agenda of the coatings industries. In this study, a transparent, anti-icing, bio-based <b>ep</b> oxy <b>coating</b> was developed for room-temperature processing. As a result of hydrophobic treatment with addition of silanes, the glass-transition temperature and anti-icing performance of bio-based epoxy resin increased significantly. The optimum coating exhibited good water repellency and ice-adhesion strength as low as 50 kPa at − 20 °, which was half of the widely accepted threshold value of 100 kPa for icephobic coatings. The icing delay time was much delayed compared with that of an uncoated glass substrate. To further demonstrate the anti-icing performance of the optimized coating, supercooled-water dripping on coated wooden outdoor floors and wooded boards was conducted at − 15 °C, superior anti-icing performance was observed on the coated substrates...|$|R

40|$|Many optics in {{both the}} OMEGA and OMEGA <b>EP</b> lasers are <b>coated</b> with {{anti-reflective}} (AR) silane sol-gel to maximize their transmittance. Although these coatings are highly resistant to both airborne contaminants and laser damage, they are susceptible to mechanical damage by abrasion, and thus require extra care during the handling, installation and alignment of sol-gel optics. Previous “hardened ” sol-gel AR formulations achieved physical robustness through exposure to ammonia, but were highly susceptible to degradation by atmospheric contaminants. In this work, alternate cross-linking agents for improving both mechanical robustness and contamination resistance were studied. The effectiveness of acryloyl chloride and glyoxal as “hardening ” agents was evaluated through both solution and vapor-phase exposure. A drag-wipe testing protocol was developed for these chemically modified sol-gel AR coatings to determine their abrasion resistance {{as a function of}} hardening agent and exposure time. Results showed that glyoxal modification of AR coatings is effective in improving abrasion resistance, while contamination resistance and laser damage resistance need to be explored further...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} {{responsible}} of the dopaminergic neuronal death at nigro-striatal level, as in Parkinson's Disease. Reactive oxygen species are responsible of the non enzymatic oxidation of dopamine (DA, so called auto-oxidation). Both, the non-enzymatic dopamine auto-oxidation and the enzymatic one, determine {{the formation of}} the corresponding ortho-quinone with the production of anion superoxide (O 2 -) and hydrogen peroxide (HP). In this study we have developed a novel electrochemical device able to monitor the auto-oxidation of DA, induced by HP, exploiting the different catalytic properties of the materials used as electrochemical transducers. The electrochemical cell consists in a buffer solution at pH 7. 4, reproducing the cerebral extracellular environment, an Ag/AgCl pseudoreference electrode, an auxiliary electrode and two working electrodes, one made with epoxycarbon (Ep) and the other one with platinum (Pt). <b>Ep</b> sensors were <b>coated</b> with a poly-dopamine (pDA) permselective polymer, while Pt sensors were coated with poly-orthofenilendiamine (pPD). The developed system is able to record the redox interactions between DA and HP in a homogeneous phase and in the presence of interfering molecule such as ascorbic acid. This relative selectivity of the electrochemical transducers and polymers allowed us to discriminate between HP (at Pt/pPD surface) and DA (at Ep/pDA surface) and record their changes...|$|R
40|$|Eps 15 {{has been}} {{identified}} as a substrate of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. In this report, we show that activation of the EGF receptor by either EGF or TGF-α results in phosphorylation of Eps 15. Stimulation of cells with PDGF or insulin did not lead to Eps 15 phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of Eps 15 is a receptor-specific process. We demonstrate that Eps 15 is constitutively associated with both α-adaptin and clathrin. Upon EGF stimulation, Eps 15 and α-adaptin are recruited to the EGF receptor. Using a truncated EGF receptor mutant, we demonstrate that the regulatory domain of the cytoplasmic tail of the EGF receptor is essential for the binding of Eps 15. Fractionation studies reveal that Eps 15 is present in cell fractions enriched for plasma membrane and endosomal membranes. Immunofluorescence studies show that Eps 15 colocalizes with adaptor protein- 2 (AP- 2) and partially with clathrin. No colocalization of Eps 15 was observed with the early endosomal markers rab 4 and rab 5. These observations indicate that Eps 15 is present in coated pits and coated vesicles of the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway, but not in early endosomes. Neither AP- 2 nor clathrin are required for the binding of <b>Eps</b> 15 to <b>coated</b> pits or coated vesicles, since in membranes lacking AP- 2 and clathrin, Eps 15 still shows the same staining pattern. These findings suggest that Eps 15 may {{play a critical role in}} the recruitment of active EGF receptors into coated pit regions before endocytosis of ligand-occupied EGF receptors...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of producing angle-dependent colour-changing textiles with thickened polyurethane (PU) -based aqueous dispersion containing multi-layered mica pigments using a direct coating method. Colour changing textile coatings with the latest generation of layered mica pigment (EP) have a promising future for functional purposes such as authentication and aesthetic eye-catching applications. The surface structure and colour of the substrate {{as well as the}} coating formulation combined with different coating parameters will strongly influence the colour-changing effects of textile coatings containing EPs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the substrate surface roughness increased when constructed of multifilament yarns with high thread count, spun staple-fibre yarns with higher and spun staple-fibre yarns with lower thread counts. Multi-angle spectrophotometer measurements of EP-coated samples showed that the colour differences in form of CIE L*a*b*-coordinates varied to a great extent, depending on detection angles, surface roughness and colour of the substrates. Increased surface roughness generated less plane-parallel orientated EP-platelets and consequently a less pronounced colour-changing effect on coated textiles. The lightness, L*-values, for white substrates were much higher than the corresponding values obtained with black substrates. Thus white substrates greatly affect the colour-changing effects, which become less intense and much more difficult for the human eye to distinguish. Different types of rheology modifiers (RMs), dispersion in oil of sodium polyacrylates (LDPSAPs), hydrophobically modified alkali-swellable acrylic emulsions (HASEs) and hydrophobically modified ethoxylated polyurethanes (HEURs) provided EP-formulations with similar viscosity profiles. However, {{it was found that the}} choice of RM as well as variations in gap heights and coating speed could increase the solids deposit, corresponding to more and better dispersed <b>EPs</b> within the <b>coated</b> layer as well as more plane-parallel oriented platelets as confirmed by SEM. Multi-angle spectrophotometer measurements with six detection angles showed that the variations of the absolute values of L* and a* were more pronounced between detection angles of - 15 ° and 15 °, corresponding to the angles where the strongest colour changes can be visually observed. Slow-coated samples with a higher deposit were measured to be lighter and of higher chroma compared to samples coated at a higher speed. The colour-changing effects were found to be governed by the choice of RM and coating parameters in terms of variations of the amount of coating deposited onto the samples...|$|R
