500|$|Vertebrate fossil finds, {{especially}} of marine reptiles, made Anning's reputation, {{but she made}} numerous other contributions to early palaeontology. In 1826 she discovered {{what appeared to be}} a chamber containing <b>dried</b> <b>ink</b> inside a belemnite fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revivify the ink and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils. Soon other local artists were doing the same, as more such fossilised ink chambers were discovered. Anning noted how closely the fossilised chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern squid and cuttlefish, which she had dissected to understand the anatomy of fossil cephalopods, and this led William Buckland to publish the conclusion that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do. It was also Anning who noticed that the oddly shaped fossils then known as [...] "bezoar stones" [...] were sometimes found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons. She noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilised fish bones and scales, and sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. Anning suspected the stones were fossilised faeces and suggested so to Buckland in 1824. After further investigation and comparison with similar fossils found in other places, Buckland published that conclusion in 1829 and named them coprolites. In contrast to the finding of the plesiosaur skeletons a few years earlier, for which she was not credited, when Buckland presented his findings on coprolites to the Geological Society, he mentioned Anning by name and praised her skill and industry in helping to solve the mystery.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the career}} of the most un{{literary}} of writers, {{in the sense that}} literary ambition had never entered the world of his imagination, the coming into existence of the first book is quite an inexplicable event. In my own case I cannot trace it back to any mental or psychological cause which one could point out and hold to. The greatest of my gifts being a consummate capacity for doing nothing, I cannot even point to boredom as a rational stimulus for taking up a pen. The pen at any rate was there, and there is nothing wonderful in that. Everybody keeps a pen (the cold steel of our days) in his rooms in this enlightened age of penny stamps and halfpenny postcards. In fact, this was the epoch when by means of postcard and pen Mr. Gladstone had made the reputation of a novel or two. And I too had a pen rolling about somewhere--the seldom-used, the reluctantly-taken-up pen of a sailor ashore, the pen rugged with the <b>dried</b> <b>ink</b> of abandoned attempts, of answers delayed longer than decency permitted, of letters begun with infinite reluctance and put off suddenly till next day--tell next week as likely as not! The neglected, uncared-for pen, flung away at the slightest provocation, and under the stress of dire necessity hunted for without enthusiasm, in a perfunctory, grumpy worry, in the [...] "Where the devil is the beastly thing gone to?" [...] ungracious spirit. Where indeed! It might have been reposing behind the sofa for a day or so. My landlady's anaemic daughter (as Ollendorff would have expressed it), though commendably neat, had a lordly, careless manner of approaching her domestic duties. Or it might even be resting delicately poised on its point {{by the side of the}} table-leg, and when picked up show a gaping, inefficient beak which would have discouraged any man of literary instincts. But not me! [...] "Never mind. This will do." ...|$|E
60|$|When Lingard {{ordered him}} to receive Joanna into his house, he had a truckle bed put into the office--the only room he could spare. The big office desk was pushed on one side, and Joanna came with her little shabby trunk and with her child and took {{possession}} in her dreamy, slack, half-asleep way; took possession of the dust, dirt, and squalor, where she appeared naturally at home, where she dragged a melancholy and dull existence; an existence made up of sad remorse and frightened hope, amongst the hopeless disorder--the senseless and vain decay of all these emblems of civilized commerce. Bits of white stuff; rags yellow, pink, blue: rags limp, brilliant and soiled, trailed on the floor, lay on the desk amongst the sombre covers of books soiled, grimy, but stiff-backed, in virtue, perhaps, of their European origin. The biggest set of bookshelves was partly hidden by a petticoat, the waistband of which was caught upon {{the back of a}} slender book pulled a little out of the row so as to make an improvised clothespeg. The folding canvas bedstead stood nearly {{in the middle of the}} room, stood anyhow, parallel to no wall, as if it had been, in the process of transportation to some remote place, dropped casually there by tired bearers. And on the tumbled blankets that lay in a disordered heap on its edge, Joanna sat almost all day with her stockingless feet upon one of the bed pillows that were somehow always kicking about the floor. She sat there, vaguely tormented at times by the thought of her absent husband, but most of the time thinking tearfully of nothing at all, looking with swimming eyes at her little son--at the big-headed, pasty-faced, and sickly Louis Willems--who rolled a glass inkstand, solid with <b>dried</b> <b>ink,</b> about the floor, and tottered after it with the portentous gravity of demeanour and absolute absorption by the business in hand that characterize the pursuits of early childhood. Through the half-open shutter a ray of sunlight, a ray merciless and crude, came into the room, beat in the early morning upon the safe in the far-off corner, then, travelling against the sun, cut at midday the big desk in two with its solid and clean-edged brilliance; with its hot brilliance in which a swarm of flies hovered in dancing flight over some dirty plate forgotten there amongst yellow papers for many a day. And towards the evening the cynical ray seemed to cling to the ragged petticoat, lingered on it with wicked enjoyment of that misery it had exposed all day; lingered on the corner of the dusty bookshelf, in a red glow intense and mocking, till it was suddenly snatched by the setting sun out of the way of the coming night. And the night entered the room. The night abrupt, impenetrable and all-filling with its flood of darkness; the night cool and merciful; the blind night that saw nothing, but could hear the fretful whimpering of the child, the creak of the bedstead, Joanna's deep sighs as she turned over, sleepless, in the confused conviction of her wickedness, thinking of that man masterful, fair-headed, and strong--a man hard perhaps, but her husband; her clever and handsome husband to whom she had acted so cruelly on the advice of bad people, if her own people; and of her poor, dear, deceived mother.|$|E

50|$|Paper has its {{own special}} {{problems}} with iron gall ink. The iron-tannic pigment does not make chemical bonds with the cellulose fibers. The ink sticks firmly to the paper, but largely by mechanical bonding; namely, the <b>dried</b> <b>ink</b> penetrates the spaces between the fibers and, after drying, becomes entangled in them.

50|$|The ink {{consumed}} in the cleaning process needs to be collected to prevent ink from leaking in the printer. The collection area is called the spittoon, and in Hewlett Packard printers this is an open plastic tray underneath the cleaning/wiping station. In Epson printers, there is typically a large absorption pad in a pan underneath the paper feed platen. For printers several years old, {{it is common for}} the <b>dried</b> <b>ink</b> in the spittoon to form a pile that can stack up and touch the printheads, jamming the printer. Some larger professional printers using solvent inks may employ a replaceable plastic receptacle to contain waste ink and solvent which must be emptied or replaced when full.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} wasted dye per page {{is also very}} high; most of the dye in the four panels may be wasted for a typical print. Once a panel has been used, even to just print a single dot, the {{remaining}} dye on that panel cannot be reused for another print without leaving a blank spot where the dye was used previously. Due to the single-roll design of most printers, four panels of colored dye must be used for every print, {{whether or not a}} panel is needed for the print. Printing in monochrome saves nothing, and the three unused color panels for that page cannot be recycled for a different single-color print. Inkjet printers can also suffer from 'dye wastage' as the ink cartridges are prone to drying up with low usage (without 'heavy use', the cartridge nozzles can become clogged with <b>dried</b> <b>ink).</b> Dye-sublimation media packs, (which contain both ribbon and paper), are rated for an exact number of prints which yields a fixed cost per print. This is in opposition to inkjet printers where inks are purchased by volume.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{determine}} the specific moisture content of several different papers that were exposed to four different relative humidity environments at approximately 30 degrees centigrade. This was done in order to see if the amount of water present in a sheet of paper affects the drying rate of <b>drying</b> oil <b>inks.</b> This in turn was done so that we would be able to determine if the rate at which this <b>ink</b> <b>dries</b> and its corresponding increase in viscosity affected the tack or 2 ̆ 2 stickiness 2 ̆ 2 which is vital to thermographic printing applications. The addition of moisture to paper as it is printed lithographically is known to retard the complete drying of <b>drying</b> oil <b>inks.</b> However, in this study, the concern was centered on the role of moisture hygroscopically trapped within the fibers of paper before it enters the lithographic press and its effect on the initial phases of <b>ink</b> <b>drying</b> where the applied ink film is at its tackiest. The relationship of the drying rate of <b>drying</b> oil <b>ink</b> to thermographic printing is rooted in the application of a finely ground plastic resin to a freshly printed ink film. Tack is usually an important consideration on the press due to the nature of the lithographic system and the principles of ink splitting and trapping. Here, however, the tack of the printed ink surface is of concern due to reception and required retention of plastic resin as is the procedure in thermographic printing. The goal of this endeavor was to more fully understand the influence paper moisture has on the tack of <b>drying</b> oil <b>ink</b> and to make conclusions on the conditions that prove to be preferable for maximum ink tack results...|$|R
50|$|A further {{increase}} in the number of notes per sheet was realized in 1952 after breakthrough developments in the production of non-offset inks. Beginning in 1943, the BEP experimented with new <b>inks</b> that <b>dried</b> faster, therefore obviating the need to place tissues between sheets to prevent ink from offsetting to other sheets. The faster <b>drying</b> <b>ink</b> also enabled printed sheets of backs to be kept damp until the faces were printed, thereby reducing distortion caused by wetting, drying, and re-wetting of the paper (sheets needed to be dampened before each printing).|$|R
