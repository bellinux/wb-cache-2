5|$|Bab Zuweila (or Zuwayla) is {{a medieval}} gate built in 1092. It {{is the last}} {{remaining}} southern gate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of Fatimid Cairo. The gate is today commonly called Bawabet El Metwalli.|$|E
5|$|Deeper (average: 3m) {{and much}} wider (av. 10m) {{perimeter}} ditches (fossae). These would have flat floors {{rather than the}} traditional V-shape. Such ditches would {{make it difficult to}} bring siege equipment (ladders, rams, and other engines) to the walls. It would also concentrate attackers in an enclosed area where they would be exposed to missile fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E

5|$|The lungs {{of birds}} contain {{millions}} of tiny parallel passages called parabronchi. Small sacs called atria radiate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> {{of the tiny}} passages; these, like the alveoli in other lungs, are the site of gas exchange by simple diffusion. The blood flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of gas exchange (see diagram on the right).|$|E
5|$|By 1911, {{the owner}} Major Richard Winstanley {{was unable to}} pay for the upkeep of the castle and, {{concerned}} about its deteriorating condition, proposed placing the property into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works. Following a survey by the architect Sir Frank Baines, which showed the ruins to need immediate repairs, the Commissioners took over the castle the following year. It was restored by Sir Charles Peers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments, between 1912 and 1913. He stripped away any remains of the farm, cleared the vegetation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and repaired the brickwork, re-cutting the moat and reconstructing a replica of the medieval bridge.|$|E

5|$|Different {{units of}} the {{regiment}} were stationed at other forts throughout the island {{under the command of}} William P. Burnham. Lieutenant Teófilo Marxuach, the officer of the day, was stationed at El Morro Castle at San Juan Bay on 21 March 1915. The Odenwald, built in 1903 (not {{to be confused with the}} German World War II war ship which carried the same name), was an armed German supply ship which tried to force its way out of the San Juan Bay and deliver supplies to the German submarines waiting in the Atlantic Ocean. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on the ship <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the fort. Sergeant Encarnación Correa then manned a machine gun and fired warning shots with little effect.|$|E
5|$|Elara's archers, {{shooting}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> inflicted heavy {{casualties on}} the attackers, while soldiers {{on top of}} the walls prevented any attempt to breach the wall by puring down molten metal on them. The elephant Kandula, attempting to break the southern gate, was injured in such an attack. After tending to his injuries and protecting him using thick animal hides, Dutthagamani encouraged Kandula and drove him against the wall. The wall was breached and Dutthagamani's army entered the city. The ten champions, unwilling to enter through an opening made by another, destroyed the wall themselves in different places and broke into the city. Led by them, Dutthagamani's army destroyed the defenders and took control of the fortress city of Vijithapura. The survivors retreated to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|IVThe {{painting}} was rehung {{as a result}} of the revival of Napoleon's reputation, and a fresh interest into his exploits. However, before this, in 1815, the year Napoleon was exiled, Napoleonic-themed art was proscribed for artists and painters, as he was not well liked because of events that had occurred in the few years immediately preceding 1815, and Napoleon's exile. It was only truly by the 1830s that artwork related to the emperor was being created once more. As such, after being removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the Louvre around 1815, David's version had been re-hung by the time Delaroche observed it.|$|E

The axis of the laser is offset <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> so that a pinpoint beam would be parallel to and offset <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and would not illuminate it; the fanned beam will intersect <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> creating an accurately horizontal (or vertical) illuminated line along it.|$|R

5|$|In her car, {{she packed}} clothing, toiletries, college textbooks, and birth-control pills. When her room was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings packed in boxes and the art removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> It's not clear whether Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night and Monday morning. On top of the boxes was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, the Texians watched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> as {{approximately}} 1,000 Mexicans {{marched into}} Béxar. The Mexican army celebrated loudly throughout the afternoon, both {{in honor of}} their reinforcements and at the news that troops under General José de Urrea had soundly defeated Texian Colonel Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27. Most of the Texians in the Alamo believed that Sesma had been leading the Mexican forces during the siege, and they mistakenly attributed the celebration {{to the arrival of}} Santa Anna. The reinforcements brought the number of Mexican soldiers in Béxar to almost 3,100.|$|E
5|$|Renovations {{included}} {{adding a}} new roof, creating a new entrance, adding an elevator, among other changes. Creating a new entrance involved removing hand quarried stone <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> to enlarge a window opening. The remodeling also brought the building up to modern seismic codes and {{to comply with the}} Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). City officials hoped to maintain the character of the original structure despite changes and upgrades. The total cost for renovations as of opening were $2.4 million, with the city paying for 60% of those costs. Some financing for the center came from selling bricks to the public that were then used on exterior spaces.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptian {{artillery}} {{failed to}} breach the walls, so Ibrahim decided to launch two ships with cannons {{and have them}} bombard the Maniot defences from the sea. He also combined this attack with infantry assaults, however these failed as the invaders were driven back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> eight times. The attacks lasted {{for a few more}} days before the Egyptians and Ottomans were forced to retreat when news arrived that Kolokotronis was approaching their rear with 2,000 men. The Maniots chased the Egyptians up to Kalamata before withdrawing. Ibrahim lost 2,500 men at Vergas and the Greek losses are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli {{captured}} Kars {{on behalf}} of the Georgian crown in 1206, but were repelled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of Akhlat in 1209. This brought the struggle for the Armenian lands to a stall, leaving the Lake Van region in a relatively secure possession of its new masters – the Ayyubids of Damascus. In 1209, the brothers Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli laid waste to Ardabil – according to the Georgian and Armenian annals – as a revenge for the local Muslim ruler's attack on Ani and his massacre of the city's Christian population. In a great final burst, the brothers led an army marshaled throughout Tamar's possessions and vassal territories in a march, through Nakhchivan and Julfa, to Marand, Tabriz, and Qazvin in northwest Iran, pillaging several settlements on their way.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders {{decided to}} attack Damascus from the west, where {{orchards}} would {{provide them with}} a constant food supply. They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July. The following day, the Muslims were prepared for the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. The defenders had sought help from Saif ad-Din Ghazi I of Mosul and Nur ad-Din of Aleppo, who personally led an attack on the crusader camp. The crusaders were pushed back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> into the orchards, where they were prone to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{describes}} the multidimensional behaviour of wall-bounded turbulence {{in the space}} of cross-scales (spanwise and wall-normal) and distances <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> This approach allows us to understand the cascade mechanisms by which scale-energy is transmitted scale-by-scale away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> through <b>the</b> overlap layer, and into the bulk flow. Two distinct cascades are identified involving the attached and detached scales of motion, respectively. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> near-wall region, scale-energy is transferred towards the bulk, flowing through the attached scales of motion, while among the detached scales it converges towards small scales, ascending again to the channel centre. It is then argued that the attached scales of wall-bounded turbulence are involved in a reverse cascade process that starts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and ends in the bulk flow. On the other hand, the detached scales belong to a direct forward cascade process towards dissipation. Hence, at a given distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>the</b> attached motion is fed by smaller attached scales located closer to <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> In turn this attached motion is responsible for creating the scale-energy that sustains larger attached scales farther <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and smaller detached scales that are responsible for connecting the scale-energy at large scales to the dissipation at small scales through a forward cascade. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

50|$|The wallflip is {{an easier}} and simple trick because it {{consists}} of only a three quarter rotation instead of a full rotation. The extra quarter is subtracted because <b>the</b> trick starts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vertical surface used. To perform this trick correctly one must push both away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and upwards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> <b>The</b> force pushing away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is so that the user does not {{come into contact with}} the surface during the trick, such as hitting their head on the surface while they are rotating. The upwards force gives the trick height and will also force rotation to ensure a proper landing.|$|R
5|$|The {{most notable}} {{feature of the}} chamber is the roof. The roof is {{supported}} by a structure of laminated oak beams joined with a total of 112 stainless steel connectors (each slightly different), which in turn are suspended on steel rods <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> The connecting nodes were fabricated by welders for Scotland's oil industry. Such a structure enables the debating chamber to span over 30metres (100ft) without any supporting columns. In entering the chamber, MSPs pass under a stone lintel—the Arniston Stone—that was once part of the pre-1707 Parliament building, Parliament House. The use of the Arniston Stone {{in the structure of the}} debating chamber symbolises the connection between the historical Parliament of Scotland and the present day Scottish Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} the first floor {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, the remains of which can be seen protruding <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> The front room on the first floor had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building. Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced law in New York before {{returning}} to Kentucky and being elected to the state legislature, where he gained {{a reputation as a}} consumer advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the state's classrooms {{in the wake of the}} U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state.|$|E
