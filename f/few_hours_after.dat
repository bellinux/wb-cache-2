5|$|A <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> the JTWC began issuing advisories, the {{depression}} made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines. The next day, after crossing into the South China Sea, {{the depression}} was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} and named Prapiroon. Several hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on the storm as it moved out of their area of responsibility. By the morning of August2, Prapiroon intensified into a typhoon and reached its peak intensity with winds of 120km/h (75mph 10-min). The typhoon maintained this intensity until shortly before landfall near Shangyang, China at 12:00UTC on August3, where it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Prapiroon quickly weakened and dissipated early on August5.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} the Gulf of California, an eye began to become apparent on visible satellite imagery, {{and it is}} estimated Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2. Continuing northward, it struck Topolobampo {{in the state of}} Sinaloa early on September 3 as a minimal hurricane. Isis weakened to a tropical storm a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> landfall, and subsequent to turning to the north-northwest the low-level circulation dissipated over Sierra Madre Occidental. The remnants entered southern Arizona on September 4 and tracked around an upper-level low.

Melvin was born in Halifax in 1941, joining the Metropolitan Police in 1960, then the Criminal Investigation Department. He studied at Bramshill Police College, served with the Flying Squad, and was known for having solved several notorious cases, including that of Kenneth Erskine, the Stockwell Strangler.

Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Chantal was one {{of three}} {{tropical}} cyclones to make landfall in Texas during the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. The third named storm and the first hurricane of the season, Chantal slowly developed on July 30 in the southern Gulf of Mexico from a tropical disturbance that was previously within Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) while near Trinidad and Tobago. While heading north-northwestward, the depression steadily intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal on the following day. Thereafter, Chantal quickly strengthen and became a hurricane on August1. After intensifying slightly further, Chantal made landfall near High Island, Texas later that day. The storm quickly weakened upon moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> landfall. Early on August2, Chantal weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over Oklahoma by August4.|$|E

The mission was successful despite the difficult and dangerous conditions that led Wilson to fly the aircraft at the low altitude of 150ft.

5|$|On September 2, a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> Henriette {{became a}} {{tropical}} storm, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for Baja California Peninsula from La Paz southward. Early {{the next day it}} was changed to a hurricane watch, and 18hours before Henriette made landfall the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Early on September 4, the hurricane warning was extended northward to 25°N. The threat of Hurricane Henriette prompted a Carnival Cruise Line ship to alter their route. Originally planned to tour Mexican ports, the captain turned the ship to tour the southern California coastline. Many upset passengers demanded refunds, to which the cruise line offered discounts for future cruises and a $40 credit card during their cruise.|$|E

This small force faced {{a large proportion of the}} British Channel Fleet, which was prepared for a second invasion attempt after Humbert's army had landed unopposed in August. As a result, Bompart's force was spotted just a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> he left Brest and he was then chased into the Atlantic Ocean by several British frigates which followed him for a week until he was able to lose them in heavy weather. This weather persisted throughout the campaign, causing significant damage to both sides in a series of storms.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Greg was {{the only}} eastern Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone in 1999 to make a direct landfall. Part of the annual hurricane season, Greg originated from a tropical wave that departed Africa in mid-August. The wave entered the eastern Pacific by September1, steadily organizing over subsequent days to become a tropical depression on September5. Amid a favorable environment, the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Greg a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> formation and further organized into a Category 1 hurricane on September6. Greg paralleled the southwestern coastline of Mexico, where it destroyed over 250 homes, cut-off roads, killed 10 people, and left at least 4,000 more injured. The storm weakened to tropical storm intensity as it moved ashore Baja California Sur, although rain was generally beneficial there. Succumbing to cooler waters and high wind shear, Greg ultimately dissipated over the Pacific on September9. Its remnants led to thunderstorms across northern California, with only minor impacts.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Linfa, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Chedeng, brought deadly {{flooding}} to areas of the Philippines and Japan in May and June2003. The fifth named storm within the northwestern Pacific that year, Linfa developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May25. The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> cyclogenesis. However, intensification leveled off as Linfa executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May27. Due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and decoupled before reforming in the Philippine Sea. Afterwards Linfa began reintensifying and reached its peak intensity on May29 with maximum sustained winds of 100km/h (65mph) and a barometric pressure of 980mbar (hPa; 28.94inHg). Following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May30; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan before dissipating in the Sea of Okhotsk on June4.|$|E
