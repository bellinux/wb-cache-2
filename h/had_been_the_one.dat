5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> on the spot.|$|E
5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her recall of {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E
5|$|Sastre's team <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> {{setting the}} pace in the peloton {{just before the}} climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan spun out and tumbled off the road into a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes and bruises, {{but he managed to}} continue and finish the stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed to be off the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E

5|$|The twelve-minute sketch {{was written}} by Michael O'Donoghue who {{wanted to create a}} scene that would {{showcase}} the acting talents of John Belushi. O'Donoghue <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who had initially persuaded producer Lorne Michaels to hire Belushi for the new Saturday Night Live program. O'Donoghue and Belushi recognized that the original Star Trek series itself was not a ratings success during its initial run, but had become much more successful during syndication. Belushi enjoyed the Star Trek series and wanted the part of Captain Kirk. He demonstrated his intense desire to get the role by trimming his sideburns to closely resemble Kirk's facial appearance in the original series. They worked together on the sketch for thirty-days and scheduled it for the final episode of the 1976 season of the show when it would be hosted by Elliott Gould.|$|E

The series premiered on October 10, 2007, and during this episode Donald Trump revealed that Katie Blair <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who had turned in Conner for {{alcohol and drug abuse}} because she felt that Conner was trying to steal Blair's boyfriend Josh.|$|E
25|$|By both {{temperament}} and connections, Adler <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who brought in new {{business to the}} partnership, and following the rupture Sullivan received few large commissions after the Carson Pirie Scott Department Store. He went into a twenty-year-long financial and emotional decline, beset by a shortage of commissions, chronic financial problems, and alcoholism. He obtained a few commissions for small-town Midwestern banks (see below), wrote books, and in 1922 appeared as a critic of Raymond Hood's winning entry for the Tribune Tower competition. He died in a Chicago hotel room on April 14, 1924. He left a wife, Mary Azona Hattabaugh, from whom he was separated. A modest headstone marks his final resting spot in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago's Uptown and Lake View neighborhood. Later, a monument was erected in Sullivan's honor, {{a few feet from}} his headstone.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} match, Cibernético, Billy el Malo, Charly Manson and Escoria of Los Bizarros faced La Parka, Dark Ozz and Drago of El Inframundo, who teamed with newly {{inducted}} Hall of Famer Octagón. At {{the end of}} the brawl, masked Los Bizarros member Taboo appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp holding La Parka's ten-year-old son, who revealed on the microphone that Taboo was his uncle and thus La Parka's brother, the luchador formerly known as Lasser Boy. Meanwhile, in the ring, Cibernético took advantage of the distraction, hit Parka with a Garra Cibernetica and pinned him for the win. After the match, Cibernético revealed that Taboo <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who had helped him invade Parka's home and provided him with the X-rays of his godson's broken leg back in January. Taboo ended the segment by declaring Los Bizarros his new family.|$|E

50|$|After Tincomarus, {{the emperor}} Augustus chose to {{recognize}} his brother, Eppillus, {{as the next}} client king. After ruling jointly with Tincomarus, he apparently became sole ruler c.7 AD, and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who drove out Tincomarus.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, {{an intense}} rivalry had {{developed}} between Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin, as while Li Jiancheng had some contributions toward Tang's reunification of China, Li Shimin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> defeating and capturing the major rivals Xue Rengao, Liu Wuzhou, Dou Jiande, and Wang Shichong, {{causing him to}} possess the greater reputation among the army. Li Yuanji, who was also often relied on by Emperor Gaozu as a general, supported Li Jiancheng in this rivalry, and often pushed Li Jiancheng toward a more hardline position against Li Shimin, wanting to be crown prince when Li Jiancheng would become emperor. Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji had better relations with Emperor Gaozu's favored young concubines than Li Shimin did (as their mother Duchess Dou had died before Tang's establishment), and those concubines helped rehabilitate Li Jiancheng's standing before Emperor Gaozu, causing him to no longer consider making Li Shimin crown prince instead, as he considered at one point.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} firmans of this nature, along with universally {{required}} bribes, {{was not unusual}} at this time: In 1801 for example, Edward Clarke and his assistant Cripps, obtained an authorisation from the governor of Athens {{for the removal of}} a statue of Demeter which was at Eleusis, with the intervention of Italian artist Giovanni Lusieri who was Lord Elgin's assistant at the time. Prior to Clarke, the statue had been discovered in 1676 by the traveller George Wheler and since then several ambassadors had submitted unsuccessful applications for its removal, but Clarke <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to remove the statue by force, after bribing the waiwode of Athens and obtaining a firman, despite the objections and a riot, of the local population who unofficially, and against the traditions of the iconoclastic Church, worshiped the statue as the uncanonised Saint Demetra (Greek: Αγία Δήμητρα). The people would adorn the statue with garlands, and believed that the goddess was able to bring fertility to their fields and that the removal of the statue would cause that benefit to disappear. Clarke also removed other marbles from Greece such as a statue of Pan, a figure of Eros, a comic mask, various reliefs and funerary stelæ, amongst others. Clarke donated these to the University of Cambridge and subsequently in 1803 the statue of Demeter was displayed at the library. The collection was later moved to the Fitzwilliam Museum where it formed one of the two main collections of the institution.|$|E
25|$|The game is {{presented}} {{against the background}} {{of the history of the}} One Ring. At the dawn of the Second Age, after the defeat of the Dark Lord, Morgoth, the elves of Eregion forged the nineteen Rings of Power to help themselves, the dwarves and men rule Middle-earth. However, the elves were unaware that Sauron, Morgoth's closest ally, had survived his master's defeat, and in the guise of Annatar <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who taught the Elven-smiths, led by Celebrimbor, how to forge the Rings, whilst, in secret, he forged his own One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, a Ring far more powerful than any of the others. However, in order for the One Ring to be powerful enough to control the other Rings, Sauron had to transfer most of his power into it. As soon as he put it on, the elves became aware of his ruse, removing and hiding their Three Rings, which Celebrimbor had forged without Sauron's aid. Sauron waged war on the elves, conquering much of Middle-earth and killing Celebrimbor. Thus began the Dark Years, when Sauron took possession of the remaining sixteen Rings, giving seven to the dwarves and nine to men in an effort to corrupt them. The dwarves proved relatively immune to the powers of the Rings, acquiring only a greed for gold, and becoming unconcerned with events in the wider world. Men proved less resilient, and the nine kings given the Rings become the nine Ring-wraiths, or Nazgûl, led by the Witch-king of Angmar.|$|E

According to Ellen Ryan, when confronted with this evidence, Green acknowledged having set the fire that destroyed her home, but denied any clear memory of the event. She continued to claim that Tim Farrar <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who poisoned his father. Green agreed to place an Alford plea of [...] "no contest".|$|E
500|$|The Kansans {{had no such}} {{artifacts}} to show. However, {{they argued}} that the Nebraska village postdated the Pike episode. The Kansas village, they stated, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> visited by Pike, and was occupied by the Pawnees until they were driven north by the Delawares in the early 1830s; the fleeing Pawnees had then established the village on the Republican, {{where they had been}} devastated by smallpox. In this account the epidemic, and not long habitation, explained the number of graves found by Hill; the medals had not been buried with their original owners, but had been treasured by the band for decades, until the time that the pestilence was blamed on [...] "evil gifts from the whites" [...] and they were cast away.|$|E

500|$|American singer-songwriter and parodist [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{had sought}} {{permission}} from Gaga to parody [...] "Born This Way", providing {{a brief description}} of the concept for his song. Her management responded that she must hear the song before providing approval. Yankovic obliged with the lyrics of [...] "Perform This Way", which was released on April 25, 2011, as the first single from his thirteenth studio album, Alpocalypse, on iTunes Store. After what Yankovic described as [...] "considerable expense" [...] in writing, recording, and mastering the song in the studio, he contacted Gaga's management again with a completed recording of the song. He was subsequently refused permission, without Gaga listening to the track and Yankovic getting the impression that the refusal came from the singer herself. Left with a completed song and abandoned plans for an outlandish music video to promote the song and album, Yankovic released it on YouTube. It was then that Gaga actually heard the song, and personally contacted Yankovic, giving him green light to include the song on Alpocalypse, telling him that her manager <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to refuse permission, which was done without her knowledge or input.|$|E
500|$|The top GC {{men in the}} peloton and the {{specialist}} climbers formed a chase group that overhauled Voigt in the final [...] The attacks of Colombian climber Mauricio Soler had been responsible for driving this group to catch {{the remnants of the}} breakaway, and he attacked again in the final , quickly getting a gap over the competition and appearing poised for the stage win. As Soler <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who caused the crash that kept Mark Cavendish from potentially defending the pink jersey the day before, his combativeness on this stage was described as his [...] "redemption". 2007 Giro d'Italia winner Danilo Di Luca timed his sprint to the line just right and overtook Soler for the victory. Sixteen riders finished with the same time as Di Luca, ten more were six seconds back, and a further 26 were inside a minute of his winning time. Thomas Lövkvist, who finished in the same group as Di Luca, took a narrow lead in the overall classification after the stage. However, Di Luca later tested positive for EPO and was stripped of his victory. The stage win was subsequently awarded to Stefano Garzelli, the runner-up.|$|E
500|$|Suspicious of the {{identity}} of the unknown woman based on the carpoolers' general description, Walter Jones called Sharon Kinne and asked if she had seen or spoken to his wife. Kinne allowed that she had, indeed, seen Patricia that day; she had met her to tell her about Walter's affair. According to Kinne, she last saw Patricia where she dropped her off near the Jones house, speaking to an unknown man in a green 1957 Ford. [...] Based on Kinne's admission over the phone, Walter Jones met with her late Friday evening and insisted she give him more details about where his wife was; he later admitted to {{going so far as to}} hold a key to her throat threateningly. Kinne's response was, after leaving Jones, to call John Boldizs and ask him to help her search for Patricia Jones. Shortly before midnight, and within hours of Kinne's conversation with Walter Jones, she and Boldizs had found the body of a woman in a secluded area approximately one mile outside of Independence. According to Boldizs, he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> to suggest searching the area in which they encountered the body; it was a spot to which they had often gone on dates before.|$|E
