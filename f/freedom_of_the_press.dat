The book starts by quoting the First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> Lewis traces {{the evolution of}} civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events.

5|$|The book starts by {{quoting the}} First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from {{creating}} legislation that limits free speech or <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> The author analyzes {{the impact of}} this clause and refers to the writer of the United States Constitution, James Madison, who believed that <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> would serve as a form of separation of powers to the government. Lewis writes that an expansive respect for freedom of speech informs the reader as to why citizens should object to governmental attempts to block the media from reporting about the causes of a controversial war. Lewis warns that, in a state in which controversial views are not allowed to be spoken, citizens and reporters merely serve as advocates for the state itself. He recounts key historic events in which fear led to overreaching acts by the government, particularly from the executive branch. The author gives background on the century-long process by which the U.S. judicial system began defending publishers and writers from attempts at suppression of speech by the government.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{official}} government statement that allowed for <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> {{this was the}} first trial of whether or not Dubček was serious about reforms. Goldstucker suffered no repercussions, and Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media, the government, and the citizens. It was under Goldstücker that the journal's name was changed to Literární listy, and on 29 February 1968, the Writers’ Union published the first copy of the censor-free Literární listy. By August 1968, Literární listy had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most published periodical in Europe.|$|E

Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished for a more mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.|$|E

5|$|<b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> is limited, with {{numerous}} restrictions on publishing rights and information dissemination.

In 2007, a government agency issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders, a move condemned by politicians from the opposition Democratic Action Party. Sabah, where all tabloids but one are independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia. Laws such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act have also been cited as curtailing freedom of expression.|$|E
5|$|However, {{right after}} Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became {{chairman}} of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers and thus editor-in-chief of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literární noviny, which under Novotny had been filled with party loyalists.
