5|$|The {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} extends the classical theory, which determined {{the interest rate}} solely by savings and investment, in that it adds bank credit. The total amount of credit available in an economy can exceed private savings because the bank system <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> create credit out of thin air. Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest {{but also by the}} creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.|$|E

Following this theme of expressivity, he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body, such as in intellectual operations and the products of one's cultural life.|$|E

If Brazil decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, the centrifuges at the Resende enrichment plant could be reconfigured to produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.

500|$|The {{decision}} also contradicted previous precedent as to {{the nature}} of evidence. John Baker notes that it violates strong rules which exclude the use of written evidence to interpret a document, unless the evidence was found in said document. Baker also argued that ministerial statements should not be used as evidence because they are irrelevant; [...] "no individual member of Parliament <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> state what that intention is or to speak for the silent majority. Parliament acts as a corporate body and the only expression of its common intention is the text to which the Queen and both Houses have given their unqualified assent. What passes in one House is not formally known to the other". An individual MP's statements, minister or not, may be based on a false understanding of the legal issues; MPs regularly vote for proposals having disagreed with the statements of the spokesman simply because they like the proposal itself.|$|E

500|$|Public policy {{determines the}} extent to which {{renewable}} energy (RE) is to be incorporated into a developed or developing country's generation mix. Energy sector regulators implement that policy—thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid. Energy regulators often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the financial feasibility of renewable energy projects. [...] Such functions include issuing licenses, setting performance standards, monitoring the performance of regulated firms, determining the price level and structure of tariffs, establishing uniform systems of accounts, arbitrating stakeholder disputes (like interconnection cost allocations), performing management audits, developing agency human resources (expertise), reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities, and coordinating decisions with other government agencies. [...] Thus, regulators make a wide range of decisions that affect the financial outcomes associated with RE investments. In addition, the sector regulator <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security. [...] The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost-containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies. [...] Since policies are not self-implementing, energy sector regulators become a key facilitator (or blocker) of renewable energy investments.|$|E

Some other trained peer support workers may also be law-enforcement personnel and firefighters as well as emergency medical responders.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{other species}} of the genus Portia, P. africana prefers to hunt web-based spiders, jumping spiders and other types in that order. When hunting web-based spiders, Portias use trial and error {{to find a way}} to mislead the prey until the Portia <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> bite the victim. While other Portias live and hunt as individuals, P. africana forms large populations both in savanna areas and in the dense [...] "cities" [...] which social jumping spiders build in {{vegetation}} near the shoreline of lakes. In the savanna, groups of P. africana, generally consisting of small juveniles, delay the prey until one juvenile bites the victim, and sometimes the juvenile shares the food with other. In vegetation near shorelines, P. africana hunts in the social jumping spiders' cities. There, two species of assassin bug prey on P. africana, and one also preys on the other.|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] the Midrash {{told that}} the people {{realized}} that they had spoken against Moses and prostrated themselves before him and beseeched him to pray to God on their behalf. The Midrash taught that then [...] immediately reports, “And Moses prayed,” to demonstrate the meekness of Moses, who {{did not hesitate to}} seek mercy for them, and also to show the power of repentance, for as soon as they said, “We have sinned,” Moses was immediately reconciled to them, for one who <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> forgive should not be cruel by refusing to forgive. In the same strain, [...] reports, “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed” (after Abimelech had wronged Abraham and asked for forgiveness). And similarly, [...] reports, “And the Lord changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends” (after they had slandered him). The Midrash taught that when one person wrongs another but then says, “I have sinned,” the victim is called a sinner if the victim does not forgive the offender. For in [...] Samuel told the Israelites, “As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you,” and Samuel told them this after they came and said, “We have sinned,” as [...] indicates when it reports that the people said, “Pray for your servants [...] [...] [...] for we have added to all our sins this evil.” ...|$|E
2500|$|By way of exception, {{alternative}} remedies to {{compensatory damages}} are available {{depending on the}} contract's nature. If damages would be an inadequate remedy, for instance, because the subject matter was a unique painting, {{or a piece of}} land, or was to deliver petrol during an oil crisis, a court may compel literal or specific performance of the contract's terms. It can also compel a defendant to refrain from actions that would continue a breach of contract. Injunctions are discretionary remedies, and so they are not awarded in cases where it might cause hardship, like compelling conveyance of property when it would mean an unexpectedly disabled inhabitant would lose her home. Additionally, the courts have, at least since the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, refused to grant specific performance of contracts involving personal services. This is part of a more general principle that two (potentially hostile) parties to litigation should not be made to work in a long term relationship. In Cooperative Insurance Ltd v Argyll Ltd although a shop broke its contract with a shopping centre to keep its business operating, and actual performance was important to keep flagship businesses and so attract more customers to the centre generally, specific performance was not granted because compelling a potentially loss making business to keep operating was draconian and probably not capable of being policed by the court. No award can be made which punishes, or makes an example of a defendant, even for a cynical and calculated breach of contract. However, in limited situations, a claimant may succeed in a claim for restitution of the contract breaker's gains, as is routinely available in cases involving trustees or other fiduciaries who profit from transactions where they have a conflict of interest. In the leading case, Attorney General v Blake a former secret service agent's profits from book sales, which recounted government information in breach of Blake's employment contract, were stripped. While Lord Nicholls stated, other than compensatory damages are not an adequate remedy, that [...] "no fixed rules can be prescribed" [...] and their Lordships were eager to not hamper the development of the law, the cases where such awards have been made in contract have all involved some quasi-proprietary element. In an earlier case, Wrotham Park Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd, Brightman J awarded a percentage of gains resulting from building a lot of homes in breach of a restrictive covenant, based on a sum that the parties would have been likely to contract for had they struck a bargain. More recently in Experience Hendrix LLC v PPX Enterprises Inc Mance LJ held that a percentage of profits made by PPX breaching the intellectual property rights on songs by Jimi Hendrix would have to be paid up. So if {{in the course of a}} contract one party <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of another's rights without their fully informed consent, a restitutionary remedy can be awarded.|$|E
