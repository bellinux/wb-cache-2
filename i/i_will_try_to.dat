25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” {{and he was}} right, {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks that when it got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” a little thing like that was some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only the board knows! <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> explain this difficult problem so that the board can {{get an idea of}} it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E

500|$|The message {{throughout}} the song, in which Martin sings, is words of encouragement: [...] "Lights will guide you home / And ignite your bones / And <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> fix you." [...] Michele Hatty of USA Weekend reported that Martin sings about recovering from grief in the song. Travis Gass of the Bangor Daily News wrote that Martin offers his sympathies for the downtrodden, with [...] "When you love someone {{but it goes}} to waste / Could it be worse?".|$|E

500|$|Themes of {{corruption}} and salvation are brought to the fore as Valérie and Crevel lie dying from the mysterious poison. When his daughter urges him {{to meet with a}} priest, Crevel angrily refuses, mocking the church and indicating that his social stature will be his salvation: [...] "la mort regarde à deux fois avant de frapper un maire de Paris!" [...] ("Death thinks twice of it before carrying off a Mayor of Paris.") Valérie, meanwhile, makes a deathbed conversion and urges Bette to abandon her quest for revenge. Ever the courtesan, Valérie describes her new Christianity in terms of seduction: [...] "je ne puis maintenant plaire qu'à Dieu! je vais tâcher de me réconcilier avec lui, ce sera ma dernière coquetterie!" [...] ("I can please no one now but God. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be reconciled to Him, and that will be my last flirtation...!") ...|$|E
500|$|The lead-up to Adore {{was marked}} by {{conflicting}} statements as to the album's sound—Corgan initially said the band was heading {{in the direction of}} the heavy-metal-guitar-and-electronic music-driven [...] "The End is the Beginning is the End" [...] in summer 1997. while the band's management reported the album would be all-acoustic. In early 1998, Corgan called the sound [...] "arcane night music", elaborating, [...] "The people that say it's acoustic will be wrong. The people that say it's electronic will be wrong. The people that say it's a Pumpkins record will be wrong. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make something that is indescribable". Further complicating the situation was the record label's initial insistence to use the Rick Rubin produced, upbeat, poppy song [...] "Let Me Give the World to You" [...] as the album's lead single, something Corgan strongly objected to, fearing it would give listeners the wrong first impression of the album. Corgan had to drop the song off the track list altogether to avoid using it as a single.|$|E

2500|$|The radical MP William Cobbett {{voted against}} the Act, asserting that the poor had an {{automatic}} right to relief and that the Act aimed to [...] "enrich the landowner" [...] {{at the expense of}} the poor. The 'Tory Radical' Richard Oastler personally lobbied Tory leaders (including the Duke of Wellington) to oppose the Act. [...] Oastler's objections were that the Act pursued aims dictated by political economy by un-Christian treatment of the poor (and particularly of the married poor: [...] "whom God hath joined together let no man part asunder"), and to ensure this was done with consistent heartlessness was setting up an unconstitutional body. [...] Oastler told the Duke [...] "if that Bill passes, the man who can produce the greatest confusion in the country will be the greatest patriot, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> be that man". [...] However the Duke was unconvinced; Tory landowners were as keen on reducing poor rates as were the Whigs, and the Bill received little opposition from either the House of Commons or the House of Lords before gaining Royal Assent. [...] John Fielden, an industrialist and owner of textile mills at Todmorden and MP for Oldham (where he had secured Cobbett's election) was like Cobbett a strong opponent of the New Poor Law, and after Cobbett's death was part of a small group of MPs who called for review of the working of the Act - Fielden further called for its repeal [...] -: all that was achieved was a Select Committee which took most of its evidence from the Poor Law Commission and other Poor Law functionaries and consequently found much to praise and little to blame.|$|E
