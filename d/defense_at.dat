5|$|TNA held {{a rematch}} between Angle and Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship on the April 24 episode of Impact!, which Joe won after {{interference}} from Scott Steiner. On the April 17 episode of Impact!, Steiner challenged Joe to a TNA World Heavyweight Championship <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> Sacrifice with his Feast or Fired TNA World Heavyweight Title shot.

5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Bryan {{defeated}} Triple H in {{the first}} match on the main show {{to qualify for the}} triple threat main event match, where he defeated Batista and defending champion Randy Orton to become the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion. The event was also notable for The Undertaker's 21–0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania coming to an end with a loss to Brock Lesnar. The WWE Divas Championship was the other title defended on the main show, its only <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> WrestleMania, while the WWE Tag Team Championship was defended on the pre-show.|$|E
5|$|Iberville had {{approached}} the Spanish in January 1702, {{before the war}} broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance warning of the expedition and organized a <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> {{the head of the}} Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force, with upwards of 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured.|$|E

5|$|On May 24, 1913, Frank {{was indicted}} {{on a charge}} of murder and the case opened at Fulton County Superior Court on July 28. The {{prosecution}} relied heavily on the testimony of Conley, who described himself as an accomplice to the murder, and who the <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> the trial argued was in fact the perpetrator of the murder. A guilty verdict was announced on August 25. Frank and his lawyers made a series of unsuccessful appeals; their final appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States failed in April 1915. Considering arguments from both sides as well as evidence not available at trial, Governor John M. Slaton commuted Frank's sentence from capital punishment to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|On the field, the Tech {{defense was}} captained by safety Justin Hamilton, who {{recorded}} 26tackles and threeinterceptions during the 2005season. On the defensive line, Tech's most significant defensive players were defensive ends Chris Ellis and Darryl Tapp. Tapp, an All-ACC selection, recorded 41tackles (including ninesacks), threeforced fumbles, and a blocked field goal. Ellis recorded defensive MVP honors for the Hokies' first-ranked <b>defense.</b> <b>At</b> linebacker, the Hokies started Vince Hall and Xavier Adibi.

5|$|One of {{the last}} skirmishes of the war took place on July 25. A Swabian army marched from the Hegau on Schaffhausen, but met with fierce <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> Thayngen. Although the small force of {{defenders}} was finally overcome, and the village was pillaged, the defenders inflicted heavy casualties and the attack was held up {{long enough for the}} Swiss to send troops from Schaffhausen to meet the Swabians in the field. Misunderstandings between the Swabian knights and their foot soldiers made the Swabians retreat, and nightfall then prevented a larger battle.|$|E
5|$|Stephen was crowned {{the first}} king of Hungary on either December 25, 1000, or January1, 1001. He {{consolidated}} his rule {{through a series}} of wars against semi-independent local rulers, including his maternal uncle, Gyula. He proved his kingdom's military strength when he repelled an invasion by Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1030. Marshlands, other natural obstacles, and barricades made of stone, earth or timber provided <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> the kingdom's borders. A wide zone known as gyepü was intentionally left uninhabited for defensive purposes along the frontiers. Most of the early medieval fortresses in Hungary were made of earth and timber.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Gettysburg was {{depicted}} in the 1993 film Gettysburg, based on Michael Shaara's 1974 novel The Killer Angels.

The first day focused on Buford's cavalry defense, the second day on Chamberlain's <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> Little Round Top, and the third day on Pickett's Charge.|$|E

5|$|After Floyd Mayweather, Jr. {{defeated}} Zab Judah on April 8, 2006, {{he rejected}} an $8million offer from promoter Bob Arum to fight Margarito on August 12, 2006, citing a hand injury {{as the reason}} {{he did not take}} the bout. On December 2, 2006, Margarito successfully defended the WBO welterweight title for the seventh time with a unanimous decision victory over Joshua Clottey. On July 14, 2007, Margarito fought Paul Williams in his eighth title <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> the Home Depot Center in Carson, California. With a victory, Margarito would set up himself up for a welterweight title unification match against Miguel Cotto in the autumn, but Margarito lost to Williams by unanimous decision. Four months later, Margarito knocked out Golden Johnson in the first round at Madison Square Garden in New York City. On April 12, 2008, Margarito had a rematch with Kermit Cintron, who held the IBF welterweight title. The match took place on the undercard of Cotto's fight with Alfonso Gomez and Margarito knocked out Cintron in the sixth round to win the title.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{received}} Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, which {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback. Because of the touchback, Alabama's first drive of the quarter started at its 20-yard line. The first play of that drive resulted in a five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech. Alexander then was tackled for a one-yard loss. On second down, Zow threw an incomplete pass, but on third down he completed a 34-yard throw to Alexander, who earned a first down at the Tech 42-yard line. On the first play in Alabama territory, Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty. Zow then threw two incomplete passes, and on third down he was sacked by the Tech <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> the Hokie 41-yard line. Because the Tide was trailing Tech by four scores, Alabama head coach Mike DuBose ordered his offense to try to convert the fourth down rather than punt. Zow's pass flew incomplete, and Alabama turned the ball over on downs.|$|E

5|$|Bogosian {{was born}} to Ike and Vicky Bogosian in Massena, New York, a town of 13,000 {{adjacent}} to the Saint Lawrence River. He is the first NHL player of Armenian descent; his great-grandfather, Stephen Bogosian, left Western Armenia in 1923 {{at the age of}} 16 {{as a result of the}} Armenian Genocide. At the age of 2½, Bogosian first began to skate. He joined the Massena Minor Hockey Association when he was 3, staying in the program until he was 14, when he left for Cushing Academy. Bogosian first began to play <b>defense</b> <b>at</b> the Squirt level (under-10); though he was smaller than most of his peers, he was a good skater. He alternated between forward and defense throughout minor hockey. When he began attending Cushing Academy he was a forward the first year, before he converted to a defender full-time. After leaving the school and moving to Canada with two years of high school to complete, Bogosian took courses on the internet.|$|E
