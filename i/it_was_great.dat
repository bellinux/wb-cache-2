5|$|The game's {{campaign}} received mixed impressions from reviewers. USgamer editor Jaz Rignall thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> {{for teaching}} {{the mechanics of}} the game and the progression of difficulty was reasonable. GameSpot reviewer Kallie Plagge thought the highest points of the campaign missions were the sequences that borrowed elements from the main Halo games. Brown stated that while the campaign was brief, he felt it had good pacing and there was a decent variety of objectives and scenarios. Stapleton agreed that the campaign missions offered enough variety to prevent them from becoming repetitive. However, overall he was unimpressed by the campaign missions, which he perceived as unambitious in their design. He was also surprised by the frequent bugs, which included crashing and mission events failing to trigger, that he experienced during his playthrough of the campaign on the Xbox One.|$|E
25|$|After {{six months}} {{residency}} at Pinocchios, Spry started booking The Flies into Sydney {{where they were}} arrested for vagrancy for having hair over their shoulders, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> publicity making all the papers. Back in Melbourne, Spry employed Carole West to organise a publicity shoot for TV and press to display his band having their long hair done at a women's hair salon in South Yarra. During the shoot, Burns sang with his guitar and was joined by apprentice hairdresser Lynne Randell – who was promptly signed by Spry and managed by West. In January 1965, they supported The Rolling Stones and Roy Orbison on their first Australian tour.|$|E
25|$|Shooting 'Put It in a Love Song' in Rio, in Brazil, {{was very}} incredible, I {{feel that the}} energy of the city matches {{the energy of the}} song. It's sensual, it's exciting, it's so rich with color. I loved it. The people came out so heavy and so hard. I think it was exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship. And {{to be able to have}} the chemistry we have and do it in a city that's so unique like that is unforgettable. The pictures speak a thousand words. So you saw the energy out there. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>great.</b>|$|E

The angle of polarization shows no variation with wavelength.|$|R

25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great</b> fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

500|$|Despite his mixed {{feelings}} on joining the club, Gunn's overall impression {{of his time}} in Edinburgh is upbeat: [...] "I only played 12 games for the Hibees but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great.</b> We beat Hearts in my only derby game 2–1 (John Robertson scored his 50th goal for Hearts in derbies but I told him it was worth nothing as we had won) and had a clean sheet at Celtic Park (stopping them from winning the SPL that day)."

[...] Hillhouse rated the main event eight out of ten and the overall event six out of ten. When the Canadian Online Explorer polled its readers on the event, 26% did not watch the event, 5% thought it was disappointing, 6% thought it was okay and 63% thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>great.</b>|$|E

[...] He described the scene in which he was strapped to an operating table with Mulder as [...] "totally uncomfortable". He joked that [...] "the only upside of that was that the author [...] was lying right beside me, feeling equally uncomfortable.
