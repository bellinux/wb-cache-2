The ride would have been located {{at the front of}} the park, with the ride's station situated where the Penguin Encounter exhibit exists and the main track extending out and over the car park. These plans were shelved. In December 2008, Sea World opened Jet Rescue, an Intamin <b>JetSki</b> Coaster.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Grylls led {{a team of}} four {{to climb}} {{one of the most}} remote unclimbed peaks in the world in Antarctica, to raise funds for children's charity Global Angels and promote the use of {{alternative}} energies. During this mission the team also aimed to explore the coast of Antarctica by inflatable boat and <b>jetski,</b> part powered by bioethanol, and then to travel across some of the vast ice desert by wind-powered kite-ski and electric powered paramotor. However, the expedition was cut short after Grylls suffered a broken shoulder while kite skiing across a stretch of ice. Travelling at speeds up to 50km/h (30mph), a ski caught on the ice, launching him in the air and breaking his shoulder when he came down. He had to be medically evacuated.|$|E

500|$|Becky Bain of Idolator {{praised the}} song, saying, [...] "Kelly totally rips it wide {{open on the}} chorus with her shrieking-but-not-shrill 'DAAAAY!' Once again, David Guetta + Kelly Rowland = musical gold. If we're lucky, this {{will also be a}} US single, but we know how {{infrequently}} mass American takes a liking to Europop tunes." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy agreed, saying that the song was [...] "nothing less than was expected." [...] He awarded the song four out of five stars, saying that the song could not top [...] "Commander" [...] but [...] "comes pretty close." [...] It [...] " [...] beats that bounce faster than a chesty lady on a high-powered <b>jetski.</b> It all makes for another infectious club-pop number on which Kel is refreshingly direct with her fella." [...] Not all reviews were positive. Rick Fullton of the Daily Record was much less impressed with the song, saying it could have [...] "been a session singer" [...] instead of the [...] "dance diva" [...] Rowland is intending on becoming. A reviewer from StarObserver praised the dance remix of the song. The review said, [...] "French DJ Antoine Clamaran has turned K Row’s mid-tempo jam into the perfect summer anthem – with killer beats, an uplifting chorus and suitably cheesy video (below)." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the game}} {{takes place in the}} Time-Twisting Machine, which allows the {{characters}} to travel to different periods in time. The levels that take place in the Middle Ages are populated by wizards, rams, knights and frogs that transform into princes upon being kissed. The prehistoric levels take place in a Jurassic swamp and feature a Tyrannosaurus hatchling that can be mounted and ridden, restless pterodactyls and a gigantic triceratops that pursues Crash throughout the level. The Arabian levels take place on the rooftops and are overrun with swordsmen, scorpions and genies who seek to stuff Crash into their lamps. The Egyptian levels are set during the heyday of the Great Pyramids and are populated by mummies, pyramid construction crews, scarabs and cobras; in addition to the various enemies, the tombs are also overrun with traps. The future levels take place in [...] "Neo York", a city under Cortex's rule that features laser cannons, robots, flying saucers, force fields and moving platforms. The [...] "Lost Highway" [...] levels, in which Crash pilots a motorcycle, take place in a 1950s America highway, where Crash must race against Cortex's hot rodders to win Crystals, avoiding construction barricades and cops along the way. The World War I levels take place in the skies of Europe and alternatively feature Crash and Coco as the player character. In these levels, Cortex's fleet of dirigibles must be shot down to obtain the Crystal. The Atlantis levels feature Crash in scuba gear who must find the Crystals in the Atlantean ruins, which are rife with sharks, depth charges and poisonous blowfish. Another water-themed group of levels take place during the Golden Age of Piracy and feature Coco as the player character, who must ride a <b>jetski</b> and gather the Crystals {{on the surface of the}} water, avoiding pirates and water mines as she does so. The Great Wall of China levels feature Coco as the player character and are played riding on the back of a tiger cub while avoiding doddery pan carriers and Chinese dragons.

2500|$|The 21st {{century has}} seen a new {{approach}} to jet packs where water is used as a high-density propulsion fluid. [...] This requires a very large mass of fluid that makes a self-contained jetpack infeasible. [...] Instead, this approach separates the engine, fuel and fluid supply from the pilot's flying apparatus, using a long flexible hose to feed the water to the jet nozzle pack attached to the pilot's body. [...] These inventions are known as [...] "hydro jet packs", and successful designs have used <b>jetski</b> technology as the powerplant operating in a body of water (an ocean, lake, or [...] pool) to provide the needed propulsion. Several hydro jet pack approaches have been successfully tested and put into production. Flow rate can be controlled by a throttle operator on the <b>jetski,</b> or by the pilot using a remote actuator.|$|E
2500|$|Jet Moto 2 retains all of {{the basic}} {{gameplay}} from its predecessor. [...] Players control hoverbikes which sit {{close to the ground}} and can be ridden over land and water. The courses in the game are designed {{to take advantage of this}} ability. Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and <b>JetSki,</b> similar to real-life sponsored racing. The riders received an overhaul, with only a total of ten selectable characters being available, and subsequently only ten racers on the track at any given time.|$|E
