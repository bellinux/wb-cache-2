5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore <b>how</b> <b>social</b> values affect science.|$|E
5|$|Sociobiology is {{the study}} of <b>how</b> <b>social</b> {{behaviour}} and organization have been influenced by evolution and other biological process. The field blends sociology with a number of other sciences, such as anthropology, biology, and zoology. Sociobiology has generated controversy within the sociological academy for allegedly giving too much attention to gene expression over socialization and environmental factors in general (see 'nature versus nurture'). Entomologist E. O. Wilson is credited as having originally developed and described Sociobiology. Besides Sociobiology the bio-communication theory investigates interactions between non-human organisms such as animal communication, plant communication, fungal communication and communication in micro-organisms on the basis of rule-governed sign-use. In this respect any coordination of behaviour between at least two organisms is sign-mediated that underlies combinatorial (syntactic), context-dependent (pragmatic) and content-relevant (semantic) rules.|$|E

25|$|Social {{systems have}} {{patterns}} of social relation that change over time; {{the changing nature}} of space and time determines the interaction of social relations and therefore structure. Hitherto, social structures or models were either taken to be beyond the realm of human control—the positivistic approach—or posit that action creates them—the interpretivist approach. The duality of structure emphasizes that they are different sides to the same central question of <b>how</b> <b>social</b> order is created.|$|E

Some studies assess emotional variations, especially in happiness versus alienation and anger, among individuals in different structural positions.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} an {{academic}} debate about <b>how</b> <b>social</b> media impacts the public sphere. The sociologists Brian Loader and Dan Mercea give an overview of this discussion: They argue that social media offers increasing opportunities for political communication and enable democratic capacities for political discussion within the virtual public sphere. The effect would be that citizens could challenge governments and corporations' political and economic power. Additionally, new forms of political participation and information sources for the users emerge with the Internet that can be used, for example, in online campaigns.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks into}} ways of {{supporting}} social Web services {{react to the}} behaviors that their peers expose at run time. Examples of behaviors include selfishness and unfairness. These reactions are associated with actions packaged into capabilities. A capability allows a social Web service to stop exchanging private details with a peer and/or to suspend collaborating with another peer, for example. The analysis of capability results into three types referred to as functional (what a social Web service does), non-functional (<b>how</b> a <b>social</b> Web service runs), and <b>social</b> (<b>how</b> a <b>social</b> Web service reacts to peers). To avoid cross-cutting concerns among these capabilities aspect-oriented programming is used for implementing a system. N/...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} lacks {{a discussion}} of the male presence in social work. Using the theoretical framework that gender role assumptions influence perceptions about occupations, this multiple case study explored <b>how</b> 12 male <b>social</b> workers perceived their occupational roles. The grand tour question was, 2 ̆ 2 <b>How</b> do male <b>social</b> workers describe their professional experiences? 2 ̆ 2 The sub-questions for the study were: (1) <b>How</b> do male <b>social</b> workers choose their careers? (2) <b>How</b> do male <b>social</b> workers describe their preservice preparation programs? (3) <b>How</b> do male <b>social</b> workers describe their job duties? (4) <b>How</b> do male <b>social</b> workers describe their supervisors and co-workers? (5) <b>How</b> do male <b>social</b> workers react to stereotypes about males in social work? ^ Data analysis of the interview transcripts resulted in six themes: (a) movement into and within the profession, (b) preservice training experiences, (c) job challenges, (d) perceived stigma, (e) male privilege, and (f) identified strengths. The themes were applied to Evans 2 ̆ 7 (2002) writings on negotiation and emotional work. The study problematized the assumption that males in female-identified professions universally reproduce power and privilege in their attempts to resolve gender role conflict. Male social workers negotiate their status as gender minority in ways that both sustain and challenge hegemonic masculinity. ^ Implications for both social work practice and academia were shared.

25|$|In 1970, Alvin Toffler in Future Shock {{described}} a trend towards accelerating rates of change. He illustrated <b>how</b> <b>social</b> and technical phenomena had shorter lifespans with each generation, and he questioned society's {{ability to cope}} with the resulting turmoil and accompanying anxiety. In past eras periods of change were always punctuated with times of stability. This allowed society to assimilate the change before the next change arrived. But these periods of stability had all but disappeared by the late 20th century. In 1980 in The Third Wave, Toffler characterized this shift to relentless change as the defining feature of the third phase of civilization (the first two phases being the agricultural and industrial waves).|$|E

25|$|Burgess was {{the first}} United States {{scientist}} to discover social spiders, which he described in Scientific American and other journals. Social spiders challenge theories of social biology because spiders are usually cannibalistic {{and would not be}} expected to form social groups. Burgess showed <b>how</b> <b>social</b> spiders modify their environment to be able to live together. For example, Mexican spiders called Mallos gregalis spin a web that amplifies the sounds of the flies that they eat and dampens the vibrations made by other spiders, allowing Mallos spiders to live in colonies containing hundreds of thousands of individuals. Another spider called Metepeira spinipes, spins two-part spider webs: individual orbs to catch prey, and vibration-damping tangled webs where spiders coexist peacefully. Burgess also described Oecobius civitas spiders who exchange individual webs with each other as part of a unique prober/retaliator social strategy (see evolutionary game theory).|$|E
25|$|Social norms {{can also}} be {{observed}} everywhere people interact, not only in physical spaces but in virtual communities on the Internet. Lawrence Lessig describes <b>how</b> <b>social</b> norms can regulate behavior in cyberspace: through an individual's perceptions from the (physical or virtual) surrounding community. For example, if a disabled person boards a crowded bus, everyone expects that some able-bodied person will volunteer their seat. The same social norm, although executed in a different environment, {{can also be}} applied to the Internet. If a user enters a discussion in a chat room and continues to use all capital letters or to make personal attacks ("flames") when addressing other users, the culprit may realize he or she has been blocked by other participants. As in real life, users learning to adapt to the social norms of cyberspace communities provide a public good—here, not suffering disruptive online behavior—for all the participants.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} {{mediation}} in Marxism is {{also referred to}} as the problem of determination, or namely <b>how</b> <b>social</b> actors navigate the social structures that bind them. For Marx, the primary form of mediation is labor, which forms a dialectical relationship between a worker’s body and nature. Labor thus mediates between humans and the natural world. Once labor becomes reified, or made into an abstraction that becomes a commodity, however, it becomes alienated from the worker who owns it and becomes exchangeable just like any other commodity. Once this occurs, capital becomes the mediating or determining factor, with the capitalist setting the wage rate or exchange-value of labor. The only thing the worker owns in this case, his or her labor power or ability to work, becomes the worker’s sole means of subsistence. The worker must get as much value from his or her labor as is possible on the open market in order to survive.|$|E
