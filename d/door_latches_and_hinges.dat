40|$|This report {{contains}} {{descriptions of}} the causes and consequences of the accidents involving cars in {{a representative sample of}} road traffic accidents to which an ambulance was called in metropolitan Adelaide. The characteristics of the drivers are reviewed in relation to the causation of these accidents and to accident prevention measures in general and the role of vehicle factors in accident and injury causation is discussed with emphasis on the Australian Design Rules for Motor Vehicle Safety. Two hundred and sixtytwo, or 86 per cent of the accidents in the survey involved one or more cars. Alcohol intoxication and inexperience in driving in traffic were the two characteristics of drivers that were most often obviously related to accident involvement. Vehicle defects played only a minor role. Seat belts were found to reduce the frequency and severity of injury; this was particularly so for the later inertia-reel belts which {{were also more likely to}} be worn. Seventy-nine per cent of drivers and 65 per cent of left front passengers wore a seat belt where one was available. <b>Door</b> <b>latches</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges,</b> seat anchorages, and the steering wheel and instrument panel were either deficient in the crash or otherwise were frequently found to be objects causing injury to the occupants of the car.

50|$|A doorjamb, {{door jamb}} (also {{sometimes}} doorpost) is the vertical {{portion of the}} door frame onto which a door is secured. The jamb bears {{the weight of the}} door through its <b>hinges,</b> <b>and</b> most types of <b>door</b> <b>latches</b> <b>and</b> deadbolts extend into a recess in the doorjamb when engaged, making the accuracy of the plumb (i.e. true vertical) and strength of the doorjambs vitally important to the overall operational durability and security of the door.|$|R
5000|$|The first Fizz Keeper-like {{device was}} {{patented}} in 1926 by G. Staunton. T.R. Robinson and M.B. Beyer patented the Fizz Keeper itself in 1988, without claiming in the patent that the device maintained a soft drink's [...] "fizz". [...] Several styles of device exist, from the plain piston pump to devices incorporating a bulb <b>and</b> a <b>latch</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinge</b> device to allow liquid {{to be poured}} out of a spout without removing the Fizz Keeper from the bottle.|$|R

50|$|The first lean-to {{addition}} was {{the first}} room restored during Isham's 1930's restoration. The entirely restored room presents an excellent picture of a 17th-century residential interior in Rhode Island. This room contains two of the original square-shaped, single casement, leaded glass windows. These windows were carefully restored and re-hung where originally located to provide {{some of the best}} evidence available of 17th-century windows. The room retains the huge fireplace surrounded by many of the original hand-planed, feather-edged, vertical pine boards, along with batten <b>doors</b> with wooden <b>latches</b> <b>and</b> strap <b>hinges.</b> The ceiling is exposed oak beam and both the floor and ceiling above are wideboard.|$|R
50|$|With {{only minor}} {{additions}} in 1999, the motorcycle remained unchanged {{until it was}} redesigned in 2002. Larger-capacity panniers (left capacity increased from 18 to 24 litres; right capacity increased from 16.7 to 19.5 litres) with more secure cover <b>latches</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> were fitted. The engine was overhauled with lighter pistons and other engine modifications to reduce vibration. A catalytic converter was fitted to ensure compliance with the stricter EU emissions laws. A combined braking system was fitted and the front brakes were upgraded to 3-piston calipers.|$|R
50|$|The entrances {{lead into}} a {{vestibule}} area spanning {{the width of}} the building. A staircase in the northeast corner leads to a balcony space overlooking the nave. The nave takes up most of the building, and is generally divided into three sections of box pews, separated by aisles leading from the vestibule to the pulpit area. The pews all appear to be original, retaining elements such as <b>doors,</b> <b>latches,</b> <b>and</b> even some painted finish. The pulpit area is a flat open space {{at the rear of the}} building, which appears to once have had a raised platform.|$|R

50|$|Initially the 5 Series {{received}} a three-star rating for adult occupants. However {{changes were made}} to the steering column, footrest, <b>door</b> trims, <b>door</b> <b>latch,</b> airbags <b>and</b> electronic software and the car was retested achieving its four-star rating. BMW claims the modifications improved the car's EuroNCAP score, not the vehicle's safety; consequently BMW chose not to recall the earlier-built cars.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an Actuation Control Unit (ACU) for mechatronic applications with embedded energy storage to face safety critical applications. The idea is ensuring full operation also {{in case of}} battery failure by using super capacitors as local energy tank. Thanks to boost converter circuitry the supercaps provide the required voltage and current levels for the required time to guarantee actuator operation until the system enters in a safe condition. The proposed compact realization has an energy capability up to 200 J covering the requirements of all the reported experimental applications (actuation of car <b>door's</b> <b>latch</b> <b>and</b> of a robotized gearbox in vehicles, actuation of a servomotor for prosthetic arm in biomedical robotic applications) although the circuit schematic is parametric and can be re-scaled for higher energy values...|$|R
50|$|The 1987 Cheltenham Gold Cup, run on 19 March was the 60th {{running of}} Britain's most prestigious steeplechase. Arthur Stephenson {{was not at}} Cheltenham, preferring to attend the meeting at Hexham, where he had seven runners, and The Thinker {{was taken to the}} course by Stephenson's nephew Peter Cheeseborough. The twelve runner field was headed by the 5/4 {{favourite}} Forgive 'n' Forget who had won the race in 1985, whilst the other runners included <b>Door</b> <b>Latch</b> <b>and</b> Bolands Cross (second and third behind Desert Orchid in the King George VI Chase, Wayward Lad, Charter Party, Combs Ditch, Earls Brig and West Tip. The Thinker, ridden by Ridley Lamb started at odds of 13/2 after considerable late support from gamblers who felt he would be well-suited by the testing conditions. An hour before the race, snow fell heavily on the course rendering the conditions virtually unraceable and the runners for the Gold Cup, having {{made their way to the}} start, were recalled to the paddock. After a delay of well over an hour, during which the snow began to melt, the runners were recalled to the start and the race began. Lamb settled The Thinker towards the rear of the field in the early stages as Cybrandian led the field on the first circuit. Charter Party fell at the fifth whilst Earls Brig was pulled up early on the second circuit and Bolands Cross fell at the fifteenth. Four fences from the finish, Cybrandian led from <b>Door</b> <b>Latch,</b> but The Thinker had made steady progress into third ahead of Forgive 'n' Forge, Wayward Lad an Combs Ditch. The Thinker moved into second but made a bad jumping error at the third last and turned into the straight in third place behind Cybrandian and Wayward Lad. The Thinker maintained his position over the last two fences before tracking to the right on the run-in and producing a strong late run to overtake Cybrandian in the last hundred yards and win by one and a half lengths. <b>Door</b> <b>Latch</b> <b>and</b> West Tip finished well to take third and fourth ahead of Wayward Lad.|$|R

60|$|Michael {{crossed the}} high {{threshold}} with the innocent intention of exploring no {{farther than the}} immediate vicinity. But scarcely was he through, when a heavier roll slammed the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>latched</b> it. <b>And</b> immediately Michael wanted to get back. Obedience was strong in him, for it was his heart's desire to serve his lord's will, and from the few days' confinement he sensed, or guessed, or divined, without thinking about it, that it was Steward's will for {{him to stay in}} the stateroom.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} that finite element analysis can be used in the design process for high performance fabric structures. These structures exhibit extreme geometric nonlinearity; specifically, the contact and interaction of fabric surfaces with the large deformation which necessarily results from membrane structures introduces great complexity to analyses of this type. All of these features are demonstrated here in the analysis of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Mars Pathfinder impact onto Mars. This lander system uses airbags to envelope the lander experiment package, protecting it with large deformation upon contact. Results from the analysis show the stress in the fabric airbags, forces in the internal tendon support system, forces in the <b>latches</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinges</b> which allow the lander to deploy after impact, and deceleration of the lander components. All of these results provide the JPL engineers with design guidance for the success of this novel lander system...|$|R
5000|$|The Plant Camp is {{significant}} for {{its potential to}} contain additional archaeological artefacts associated with the Burke and Wills expedition, particularly equipment associated with Wills' decision to [...] "plant" [...] or bury his astronomical equipment and Burke's order to leave behind everything except food and whatever they could carry on their backs. The Plant Camp has been identified through the presence of archaeological artefacts and two blazed trees situated along an unnamed ephemeral creek line on Durrie Station. Artefacts located to date include percussion caps, nipples, buckles, canvas/leather sewing kit needles, thrust block and duck bill leather sewing pliers {{a number of the}} brass fittings, including a clasp, escutcheon, <b>latch</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinge</b> all suggestive of a possible instrument case. These artefacts date to the same period (s-1860s) as the Burke and Wills expedition and are consistent with items listed in the detailed [...] "List of Stores III" [...] of goods officially supplied to the expedition.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious {{radiator}} grill and bumper bar changes, {{there were other}} less obvious changes that {{took place during the}} Midgets production run. The first cars assembled in 1967 were wired positive earth, had thinly cast engine blocks requiring nitrated crank shafts to provide extra rigidity. Later engines blocks were cast with thicker walls. Other changes were to negative earth wiring and alternator, chunckier boot lock handle, internal <b>door</b> <b>latch</b> handles, <b>and</b> quarter light window handles. Plastic window winder and internal door pull handles. Crossflow radiators running at higher pressures. The differential ratio was also changed to 3.9 some time during 1970.|$|R
