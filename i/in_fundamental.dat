The effect of ambiguity in information on stock returns is associated with market ambiguity; market ambiguity is negatively associated with abnormal returns for firms with moderate ambiguity <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals.</b> Investors <b>in</b> a small firm rely more on analyst recommendations...|$|R

5|$|In {{the opening}} {{lines of the}} poem Dryden {{describes}} King Cinyras just as Ovid did {{as a man who}} had been happier if he had not become a father. Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James who could have been counted as happier if he had not had his daughter, Mary, who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position. When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor. Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment, according to Lee. A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted. Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament, because it acted without constituted legal authority. Finally the daughter, Mary as Myrrha, is described as an impious outcast from civilization, whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted <b>in</b> <b>fundamental</b> social confusion. When Myrrha craves and achieves her father's (Cinyras') bed, Lee sees a parallel to Mary's ascending James' throne: both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers.|$|E

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of the Fama and French (1993) SMB and HML factors as risk factors {{is an open question}} that has carried a lot of controversy in the asset pricing literature and it is far from being solved. The aim {{of this study is to}} contribute to the understanding of this issue by analyzing a rational pricing explanation of this model in the Spanish Stock market. There is no empirical evidence around the relation between returns and <b>fundamentals</b> <b>in</b> this capital market, therefore it is necessary to study this relation in order to evaluate whether the use of this model is supported by a rational pricing explanation in non-US markets. Following the Fama and French (1995) approach we analyze whether there are size and book-to-market factors <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals</b> similar to those observed in returns and whether these factors <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals</b> drive stock returns. Our results show that there are factors <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals</b> similar to those observed in returns. Secondly, when Return on Capital is used as a proxy for <b>fundamentals,</b> factors <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals</b> drive factors <b>in</b> returns. Therefore, Return on Capital is a useful fundamental variable used by investors in the Spanish Stock Market. These results give support to the use of this model in the Spanish Capital Market.

40|$|Between 2000 and 2006 {{the murder}} rate in Newark doubled while the {{national}} rate remained essentially constant. Newark now has eight times as many murders per capita than {{the nation as a}} whole. Furthermore, the increase in murders came about through an increase in lethality: total gun discharges rose much more slowly than the likelihood of death per shooting. In order to explain these trends we develop a theoretical model of murder in which preemptive killing and weapon choice play a central role. Strategic complementarity amplifies changes <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals,</b> so areas with high murder rates (war zones) respond much more strongly to changes <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals</b> than those with low murder rates (peaceable kingdoms). In Newark, the changes <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals</b> that set off the spiral were a collapsing arrest rate (and probably a falling conviction rate), a reduction in prisoners, and a shrinking police force. ∗This work {{would not have been possible}} without the assistance of Director Garry McCarthy, Deputy Chief Gu...|$|R
40|$|The Japanese economy {{experienced}} {{a substantial increase}} and a subsequent crash in land and stock prices in the 1980 s and 90 s. I use a neoclassical growth model {{to determine how much}} of these asset price movements can be accounted for by the observed changes <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals</b> of the Japanese economy; in particular changes in productivity growth and government policy regarding land taxation. In the model, corporations issue land-collateralized debt to reduce their tax liabilities and the government follows a land-taxation policy that is countercyclical to land prices. These features substantially magnify the effect of small shocks by reducing the required return on land. With the model calibrated to Japanese data, I find that the observed changes <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals</b> cannot simultaneously account for the movements in asset prices and macroeconomic variables. In particular, with persistent changes <b>in</b> <b>fundamentals,</b> the observed asset prices can be justified, but at the cost of counter-predicting macroeconomic variables. ...|$|R
