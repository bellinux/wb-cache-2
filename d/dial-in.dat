2500|$|In 1984, Mark Peterson wrote The Realm of Angmar, {{beginning}} as a clone of Scepter of Goth. In 1994, Peterson rewrote The Realm of Angmar, adapting it to MS-DOS (the {{basis for}} many <b>dial-in</b> BBS systems), and renamed it Swords of Chaos. For {{a few years}} {{this was a very}} popular form of MUD, hosted on a number of BBS systems, until widespread Internet access eliminated most BBSes.|$|E
50|$|In principle, if both {{drivers have}} equal {{reaction}} times and their cars run exactly their posted <b>dial-ins,</b> both cars should cross {{the finish line}} at precisely the same time. In reality, this is an extremely rare occurrence. Measuring devices both at the start {{and at the end}} of the track post times down to 1/100000 of a second (0.00001s precision), which makes tied races almost impossible.|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} {{envisioned for}} ultra-high-speed networks require cryptographic transformations for data in transit. Security {{has often been}} an afterthought, and cryptographic support has generally not kept pace with performance increases in other network components. Two distinct experimental prototypes of high-speed DES boards were built to understand architectural issues in providing cryptographic support for the AURORA gigabit testbed. Combining cryptographic support with the host/network interface is indicated. 1. Introduction Network usage and capabilities are both increasing at terrific rates. The traffic load on the NSFnet backbones in the United States doubles every few months; {{much of this is}} due to the increased connectivity provided by interconnection with other networks, large numbers of personal workstations connected to LANs, and large numbers of computers connected via 9600 bit per second (bps) <b>dial-ins.</b> Much of this traffic is "traditional" Internet traffic, e. g., el [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Museums {{typically}} {{strive to}} support learning about topics that {{pertain to the}} collections. However, necessities in museum-exhibit design may work against this goal. Designing for experiences {{of just a few}} minutes keeps traffic moving through gallery spaces, but prevents the immersion that a productive learning experience demands. This paper describes a genre of computer environments that could address both the constraints of a museum visit and the sort of extended, highly personal experience that can support learning. The environments are called “microworlds, ” which can take the form of stand-alone &quot;construction kits &quot; for single users or teams of users, or located as pockets of activity within a larger, networked, multiuser environment. Supplemented by other exhibits and learning materials, microworlds can be installed in gallery kiosks to give visitors a taste of the subjects and modes of interaction they offer. The software could also be available for more in-depth use outside the museum, through museum store purchases or <b>dial-ins</b> to a server. The microworlds described here are for learning about an aspect of motion study, balance. The...|$|R
2500|$|BBS {{software}} {{was used to}} interact with human callers to the system. [...] BBS software would allow <b>dial-in</b> users to use the system's message bases and write mail to others, locally or on other BBSes. [...] Mail directed to other BBSes would later be routed and sent by the mailer, usually after the user had finished using the system. [...] Many BBSes also allowed users to exchange files, play games, and interact with other users {{in a variety of}} ways (i.e.: node to node chat).|$|E
50|$|A <b>dial-in</b> {{time is a}} {{term used}} in drag racing to claim how fast a racer's car is. <b>Dial-in</b> times {{function}} to determine which cars race against each other. If one car's <b>dial-in</b> time is significantly slower than another's, the slower car is given a handicap (which is done in E.T. bracket racing). The purpose of <b>dial-in</b> times {{is to make the}} race fair - so if a racer beats his or her <b>dial-in</b> time, he or she is automatically disqualified. <b>Dial-in</b> times can, however, be manipulated to be significantly slower than the car actually performs, in a technique called sandbagging.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 the Merit Board {{endorsed}} {{a plan to}} expand the MichNet shared <b>dial-in</b> service, leading to a rapid expansion of the Internet <b>dial-in</b> service {{over the next several}} years. In 1994 there were 38 shared <b>dial-in</b> sites. By 1996 there were 131 shared <b>dial-in</b> sites and more than 92% of Michigan residents could reach the Internet with a local phone call. And by the end of 2001 there were 10,733 MichNet shared <b>dial-in</b> lines in over 200 Michigan cities plus New York City, Washington, D.C., and Windsor, Ontario, Canada. As an outgrowth of this work, in 1997, Merit created the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Consortium.|$|E

50|$|Racer A has a {{car that}} {{consistently}} runs a quarter-mile drag race in 12 seconds. Racer A gives a <b>dial-in</b> time of 15 seconds, therefore claiming that the car is 3 seconds slower than it actually is. Racer A goes against Racer B in an E.T. bracket race. In bracket races, both racers are supposedly equal since both have similar times. However, Racer B has an accurate <b>dial-in</b> time of 15 seconds while Racer A has an inaccurate <b>dial-in</b> time that gives Racer A the advantage. During the race, Racer A gets a clear advantage off the starting line. But to not be disqualified by racing faster than the <b>dial-in</b> time, Racer A slows near the finish line to just barely beat Racer B.|$|E

If the racer sets his or her <b>dial-in</b> time too high at 14.32, there is a good chance the car will outperform that time and he or she will be disqualified.|$|E
