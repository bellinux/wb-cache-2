5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon HeartGold Version and SoulSilver Version are {{enhanced}} remakes of Pokémon Gold and Silver. The {{games are}} part of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games, and were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. First released in Japan on September 12, 2009, the games were later released to North America, Australia, and Europe during March 2010. Game director Shigeki Morimoto aimed to respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> new game to those that were introduced to the series in more recent years. Reception to the games was highly positive, the two being amongst the highest rated DS games of all time on Metacritic.

50|$|This urban flood {{was very}} unexpected. The weather {{forecast}} identified {{it as an}} Low-pressure area, but <b>it</b> <b>felts</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> storm was coming. There {{was a lack of}} adequate drainage canals and to many clogged drainage in the areas. After the incident, officials took action on cleaning the drains so that this won't happen again.|$|R

5000|$|The {{effects of}} the {{explosion}} were felt several miles away. Senator Troy Brown D-Napoleonville, who was at his home five miles from the plant when the blast occurred, said, [...] "For about a good two to three seconds, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> earthquake." [...] A shelter-in-place order was issued to residences and businesses within a two-mile (3.2 km) radius of the plant.|$|R
500|$|Joseph also {{performed}} with Sheena Easton {{for four years}} as her co-musical director and lead keyboardist. He went from Yanni to Easton and back to Yanni in a few years. [...] "It was a great transition from Yanni because it made me musically aware again", he said in reference to Easton's R style. [...] "I went back to where I started but <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> new invention." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} five live tracks {{appear on the}} album: [...] "Softer, Softest," [...] "He Hit Me (And <b>It</b> <b>Felt</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Kiss)" [...] (a cover of The Crystals), and [...] "Season of the Witch" [...] (a Donovan Leitch cover) all were {{recorded}} from Hole's performance on MTV Unplugged at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Valentine's Day 1995. [...] "Drown Soda" [...] and [...] "Asking for It", were recorded at London's Brixton Academy and the Reading Festival on May 4, 1995 and August 25, 1995, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Former Montreal Canadiens goaltender Ken Dryden {{described}} of Orr: [...] "When {{he began}} to move... the sensation was unique: All the Canadiens began backpedalling in a small panic, like beachgoers sighting a coming monster wave. He brought others with him; he wanted them involved. That's what made him so different: <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> five-player stampede moving toward you—and at his pace. He pushed his teammates, [...] you're playing with {{the best player in}} the league and he's giving you the puck and you just can't mess it up. You had to be better than you'd ever been." ...|$|E
5000|$|Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 (out of 5) {{and stated that}} [...] "In the spirit of Christmas, we'll forgive NCIS this one. It's not that [...] "Newborn King" [...] was a bad episode, but <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> entirely {{different}} show. The holiday theme was almost overblown at times, {{and there was a}} high level of (often predictable) cheesiness throughout, a far cry from some of the uber-serious, superbly well-written episodes this and every season." ...|$|R
6000|$|And the {{hyacinth}} purple, and white, and blue, [...] 25 Which flung {{from its}} bells a sweet peal anew Of music so delicate, soft, and intense, <b>It</b> was <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> odour within the sense; ...|$|R
60|$|Only for a moment, though; {{the next}} she had cowered, like some animal doubled up within itself. She peeped down the great rugged cliffs--the descent {{would be easy}} enough, as they were not precipitous, and the great {{boulders}} afforded plenty of foothold. Suddenly, as she gazed, she saw at some little distance on her left, and about midway down the cliffs, a rough wooden construction, through the wall of which a tiny red light glimmered <b>like</b> <b>a</b> beacon. Her very heart seemed to stand still, the eagerness of joy {{was so great that}} <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> awful pain.|$|R
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for [...] "Fight Club" [...] was a [...] "long-lost nugget" [...] that series creator Chris Carter had thought up a while back. He explained, [...] "I had this {{idea for a}} long time to do a story about mis-matched twins that had an almost nuclear reaction when they were around each other." [...] Carter began to write the episode at the same time as the pilot for the X-Files spin-off, The Lone Gunmen. Because of the [...] "insanity" [...] in juggling two scripts at once, many more [...] "crazy" [...] elements made it into [...] "Fight Club". When executive producer Frank Spotnitz first looked at the script, he noted that [...] " [...] had an odd tone. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wild show." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} was received {{with a positive}} response from critics. Jordan Zivitz of Montreal Gazette called the performance [...] "insanely theatrical, Broadway-worthy." [...] Melissa Maerz wrote for Entertainment Weekly that [...] "As visually spectacular as it was narratively [...] heavy-handed, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> callback to her last tour, 'MDNA', which featured a dark charade that found Madonna wielding a gun on stage. But when the song ended with video footage of the gladiators knocking over a saintly-looking Madonna statue, the tone changed. Madonna has built a career by playing with what we hold sacred, whether it's crucifixes or underground dance crazes. Now the only sacred thing she's tearing down is Madonna herself." [...] The performance of the song at the March 19-20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour.|$|E
500|$|... "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was {{the first}} {{full-length}} episode of the series to be produced in stop motion animation. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square. Walsh explained, [...] "They dug one of our shorts that we'd done a while back, which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted to have us apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ... We {{come from the same}} planet as far as our sense of humor and comic sensibilities are concerned. But we also {{wanted to make sure that}} <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> SpongeBob episode." ...|$|E

5000|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B+. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode an 8/10 [...] "Great" [...] rating, {{ultimately}} saying the episode [...] "had some great moments, but <b>it</b> ultimately <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> placeholder." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{feeling of}} {{uncertainty}} {{as to the}} best method of [...] "busting up" [...] induced him to clutch his hair with both hands, and snort. It must not be supposed that our hero gave way to such rebellious feelings with impunity. On the contrary, his conscience pricked him to such <b>an</b> extent that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> internal pin-cushion or hedgehog. While he was still holding fast to his locks in meditative uncertainty, three natives appeared {{at the entrance of}} his hut, and announced that they had been sent by Big Chief {{to take him to the}} royal hut by force, in case he should refuse to go peaceably.|$|R
500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be}} a big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E
500|$|Famitsu was {{generally}} positive about Mystery of the Emblem, citing both its overall {{quality and the}} improvements made to the gameplay and presentation of content from Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light. Mike Moehnke of RPGamer felt that the story was [...] "fine without being great", especially {{as it was a}} partial remake of the first game. While he enjoyed the gameplay, he noted that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> precursor to the more refined and expanded mechanics of later titles in the series, despite praising the dismounting mechanic. The graphics he found unimpressive for the platform, while he found the audio a mixed effect with a lack of tunes {{in the first half and}} more variety and strength for the second half. He finished that the game was worth seeking out for series and genre fans, but that the language barrier and advances of subsequent Fire Emblem titles made it less appealing.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{reviewed}} the episode for TrekNation, saying that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "real Star Trek episode" [...] but wasn't {{sure about the}} characterisation for T'Pol seen in [...] "Terra Prime". She {{would have preferred to}} see more of Mars, but was pleased with the glimpse of the Carl Sagan Memorial Station. She summed it up by saying that the two episodes were [...] "no means perfect episodes, but they're reaching very earnestly for what Star Trek was in the beginning". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] said that while there were plot holes in the story, and that elements were clumsy such as the showdown towards the end, the overall story was [...] "sound". He said that the episode was a [...] "much more satisfying as a send-off for the Enterprise crew" [...] than [...] "These Are the Voyages...". He gave [...] "Terra Prime" [...] a score of three out of four.|$|E
50|$|On April 11, 2014, Murray State coach Chris Hatcher {{announced}} that Maikhail Miller left {{the team for}} personal reasons. Miller later stated that he left because he wasn't into the game anymore and <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> job.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, {{owner and}} head chef Jean-Michel Hengge changed course in his {{restaurant}}. From {{a restaurant with}} kitchen staff, he {{turned it into a}} one-man show. Regaining the star in 2012 was a victory for Hengge. According to Hengge <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> getting <b>a</b> complete new Michelin star.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} written, directed, and {{executive}} produced by Dean DeBlois, the co-writer/co-director {{of the first}} film. Bonnie Arnold, the producer of the first film, also returned, while Chris Sanders, who co-directed and co-wrote the first film, acted only as an additional executive producer this time due to his involvement with The Croods. When offered the sequel, DeBlois accepted it on condition he can {{turn it into a}} trilogy. For the sequel, he intended to revisit the films of his youth, with The Empire Strikes Back and My Neighbor Totoro having the pivotal inspirations for the film. [...] "What I loved especially about Empire is that it expanded Star Wars in every direction: emotionally, its scope, characters, fun. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> embellishment and that's the goal." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Souders, Jonathan Kent's {{death had}} been {{requested}} by executive producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar at the [...] "beginning of the season", {{and that the}} idea was specifically planned to be featured in the show's 100th episode. Gough explained that the reason Jonathan Kent was chosen to die was because [...] "going into season five, {{this is the year}} the boy becomes the man, so at some point the mentor/father figure has to die, in order for Clark to ultimately step up and really embrace his destiny." [...] Schneider was happy with how the show wrote Jonathan Kent's death, arguing that his character exited the show [...] "like a hero". Furthermore, he drew comparisons to the death of John Wayne's character Wil Anderson in The Cowboys (1972), arguing that both were examples of [...] "empowering death." [...] Originally, a scene had been shot featuring Clark bringing his father's dead body to the Fortress of Solitude. However, the scene was ultimately cut because, according to Gough, [...] "It was something that sounded great on paper, but <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bit of a stutter step in the episode." [...] Gough later called the scene [...] "morbid".|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Old Age", whose organ intro was {{featured}} on the band's cover of [...] "Credit In The Straight World" [...] from Live Through This, was revealed to have originally written by Kurt Cobain; Love stated in a 1997 interview that [...] "Old Age" [...] was [...] "partly someone else's composition. It's something somebody {{had a little bit}} of and I said 'let me have the rest of it' and I wrote this thing in it and tried to make it goth. I found it, wrote it, and recorded it the same night." [...] It was later revealed that a version of the song was recorded by Nirvana during the Nevermind (1991) recording sessions, but Cobain threw the song out, later giving the melody to Love, who rearranged musical pieces and rewrote the lyrics. Two live cover versions were included on the album: [...] "Season of the Witch" [...] by Donovan, and [...] "He Hit Me (And <b>It</b> <b>Felt</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Kiss)", which was written by Carole King and recorded by The Crystals in the 1960s. Love referred to it as a [...] "feminist anthem" [...] after performing it during MTV Unplugged in 1995.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} for Deep Blue Sea {{began on}} August 3, 1998. Most {{of the film}} was shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic. Some of the sets were designed {{so that they could}} be submerged, while others were built on sound stages with fishtanks used as windows. At Fox Baja Studios, the cast worked with sharks that were either animatronic or computer generated. As the shark used in Jaws was 25 feet long, Harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet. Jackson recalled, [...] "When they first brought it into the lab we were all in awe of the size of this machine [...] It was a real monster. I would walk up to it slowly and touch it and they said <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> real shark. The gills moved and it had {{a mind of its own}} sometimes." [...] As an added homage to Jaws, the license plate pulled from the shark's teeth by Carter is the same plate found in the tiger shark carcass from Spielberg's film.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} eighteen, Du Plessis {{left her}} family in South Africa {{to come to the}} United States and {{eventually}} swim for the University of Hawaii: [...] ""I had been traveling for swimming since I was 13, so at first <b>it</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> really long road trip or camp".|$|R
5000|$|In {{the season}} 4 premiere, Howard {{developed}} a robotic arm for the International Space Station. Realizing how much <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> actual arm, {{he used the}} arm for masturbation, only to get the arm stuck on his penis. He called Leonard and Raj, but neither was willing to get too [...] "hands on" [...] and help free him from the arm's grip. He was afraid to use the computer controlling the arm as it thought it was holding a screwdriver and would start twisting if he un-paused the program. Eventually, Leonard and Raj took Howard to the hospital, where the attending nurse went against Howard's fears {{and turned off the}} computer, freeing Howard. The episode's tag scene implied that Howard tried to use the arm to pleasure himself again and ended up in the same predicament.|$|R
5000|$|Director Lee Yoon-ki {{had been}} in a bookstore in Korea, {{scanning}} the display of bestsellers, when a lonely little stack of the Japanese novella One Fine Day by Azuko Taira caught his eye, [...] "like one quiet, lonely person drawn to another." [...] He found the story different from the currently popular trendy Japanese fiction, [...] "There’s something old-fashioned about it, something very unique and intimate, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old, forgotten fable," [...] and thought he'd <b>like</b> to make <b>a</b> film that would touch people's hearts the way the book had touched his. The title was a problem, since many films had the same title. Lee thought of the term [...] "enemy" [...] because it can be used in Korean to refer to lovers, friends, even children. In adapting the story for the screen, Lee expanded on the novella, adding to the number of people the ex-lovers encounter, and changed some details (including the ending scene).|$|R
500|$|Several Scandinavian {{actors were}} cast in major roles, {{including}} Pihla Viitala, Peter Stormare (who Arterton said had actually inspired her to start acting), Bjørn Sundquist, and Ingrid Bolsø Berdal. In addition, actors from Germany and Poland (including Thomas Mann, Rainer Bock, and Joanna Kulig) {{and other parts}} of the world were also cast. Viitala, a self-described [...] "big fan" [...] of Renner, said she was nervous at first, but found him [...] "extremely" [...] easy to approach, made a good connection, and enjoyed working with him. Wirkola said Berdal was chosen for her [...] "piercing" [...] eyes, adding: [...] "There are a lot of Norwegians in the film. Minor parts, but I knew I could get great actors in small parts and Ingrid has a great physicality." [...] Stormare said he was only surprised at [...] "how smart Tom [...] is, and how broad this fantasy is and the span of his imagination," [...] his favourite aspect being how [...] "some of the witches are so sexy and cool." [...] He compared the film's production to being in Disneyland, saying <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream to him.|$|E
500|$|Phillips {{claimed the}} Dexter staff {{did not know}} how the finale would {{conclude}} until late in the season, but Phillips said Rita's death began to feel inevitable as the story evolved. [...] However, Julie Benz said she had been told John Lithgow knew about it {{from the beginning of the}} season. Phillips said the staff felt obligated to do more than simply kill the Trinity Killer in the final episode, especially because he felt the death of the third season antagonist (played by Jimmy Smits) was not handled [...] "as well as we could have". The writers discussed the idea of having Debra find out about Dexter's secret life, but it was decided they could not anticipate how drastically the series would be changed by that revelation. Benz heard rumors from David Zayas that her character would be killed in the episode, but she was not officially notified until late September, when the producers held a meeting with her the day before the season finale script was distributed to the cast. She said, [...] "It was a tough meeting. In a bizarre way, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> scene from Defending Your Life." [...] Benz was unhappy about the news but she handled it professionally. Benz described the death scene as [...] "very poetic".|$|E
500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] is a disco revival {{song with}} {{elements}} of gospel, pop and R styles. It lasts for a duration of four minutes and 46 seconds. Several critics highlighted the track as {{following in the}} recent disco revivalism footsteps of Daft Punk, Justin Timberlake and posthumous Michael Jackson material. The song begins with Carey singing about how {{she is in a}} dilemma {{as to whether or not}} she wishes to stay in a relationship with her lover, as he is no longer capable of romancing her. In response, Wale raps about how he is trying to woo her and is asking for a second chance. Carey then decides that it has been too long that Wale has not loved her for, and feels liberated for letting him go. Kenneth Partridge of Billboard likened the string arrangement to Chic's 1979 single [...] "Good Times". Pitchfork Media writer Jordan Sargent compared [...] "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] to Carey's previous singles [...] "Fantasy" [...] (1995) and [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] (1999), but noted that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "logical extension of post-Pharrell disco revivalism". Christina Lee for Idolator thought that the 70s disco feel embodied Daft Punk's 2013 single, [...] "Get Lucky".|$|E
5000|$|What I {{always like}} {{to do is look at}} where I am in my life at the moment. Here it was right after the babies and was when I was getting back to work and getting back to what I do again. <b>It</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> time of a lot of love and that seemed very romantic to me — I said it seems like love and glamour.|$|R

Speaking of her time presenting the programme, “Back then there were only four television channels and at our height we were getting seven million viewers. I just remember looking down the camera lens and thinking I’ve got this huge audience and I’m talking about <b>a</b> car. <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> such <b>a</b> waste.”.|$|R
