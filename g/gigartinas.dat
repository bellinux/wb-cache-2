The carrageenans proved to be potent inhibitors of herpes human virus type 1 (HHV- 1) and Poliovirus. The best results were obtained with carrageenans from <b>Gigartina</b> acicularis and Euchema denticulatum, which are more sulfated than those from Kappaphycus cottonii. The selective index values (CC 50 /ID 50) ranged from more than 22 to more than 545 for HHV- 1 and more than 6. 6 to more than 32 for Poliovirus. No citotoxic effects were observed.

Optical rotation and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) showed no evidence of conformational transitions on cooling and heating. Solutions of theta carrageenan at 2. 0 wt. % in water and in 0. 1 M KCl were Newtonian at 20 degrees C. and substantially less viscous than a 1. 0 wt. % solution of the lambda carrageenan precursor. Close Cox-Merz superposition was observed between steady-shear (rotational) viscosity (Wand complex dynamic viscosity (eta*) at equivalent values of shear rate ((gamma) over dot/s(- 1)) and frequency (omega/rad s(- 1)), and the variation of log G '' with log omega was linear, with a slope of 1. 0, strongly indicating a solution of disordered coils. The absence of double-helix formation, and associated gelation, is explained by sulfation at O(2) of 3 -linked residues. A previous report of gel formation by theta carrageenan is attributed {{to the presence of}} some gelling carrageenan in the lambda sample from which it was prepared. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Copyright © 1992, John Wiley and Sons. Algal zonation {{patterns}} were studied in two sites (Caloura, south coast and Ribeirinha, north coast) {{of the island}} of São Miguel, Azores. At each site two stations were studied and the transects revealed the occurrence of two distinct and well established algal zones. In the first zone, daily immersed and emersed by the tide, the algae were growing in a dense and, short tangle forming a mat, referred to as algal turf. In the second zone, which was wet most of the time, the algae were larger and frondose. A list of the species of benthic marine algae occurring on the algal turf of each station is given. Of the total of 47 species found, eight are new for the Azores and another 13 species recorded {{for the first time}} for São Miguel. <b>Gigartina</b> acicularis (Roth) Lamouroux and articulate coralline algae (Corallina oficinalis Linnaeus and Jania spp.) were the more common species. Seasonal variation of the algal turf was studied and related to mean monthly values of air and sea water temperatures, insolation and hours of light. The zonation patterns and composition of algal species were compared with those from other open rocky shores...|$|R
