50|$|Following {{permission}} from the Federal Government to issue a casino licence and despite strong opposition from Dr Hector Kinloch of the Residents Rally, Casinos Austria International was selected by the ACT Government as the preferred operator on 31 January 1992. A subsidiary company, Casino Canberra Limited was formed for this purpose. In <b>exchange</b> for the <b>licence,</b> Casinos Austria paid $19 million up front for lease {{of the land and}} an annual $500,000 licensing fee. A temporary casino began operation on 14 November 1992 at the National Convention Centre. The permanent casino opened on 29 July 1994. Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke and the ACT Chief Minister Rosemary Follett were among the guests at the large opening party hosted by Dr Leo Walner, then head of Casinos Austria. Bob Hawke was the winner of the golden roulette ball that was used for the first spin of the roulette wheel in the temporary casino.|$|R
40|$|According to the {{resource}} curse thesis (RCT) of the 1990 s, {{a strand of}} development discourse informed by neoliberal development economics, natural resource-rich developing countries are cursed by their natural resources abundance, particularly minerals and petroleum. Based on comparative statistics collected from the 1970 s to the 1990 s, {{the resource}} curse theorists claim that natural resources-rich developing countries have performed very poorly {{in terms of economic}} growth leading to industrialisation and improvement in social welfare compared to resource-poor developing countries at similar stage of development such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea. The resource curse theorists argue that, contrary to the assumptions of modernisation theory of the 1940 s and 1950 s that natural resources abundance would lead to rapid capital accumulation that would then lead to rapid industrialisation and usher in a stage of sustained economic growth, resource-rich developing countries have experienced regressive economic growth trends, systemic corruption, civil wars, political instability, and general decline in the standard of living and social wellbeing. The resource curse theorists thus assume that resource-poor developing countries prospered because they pursued 'free market' and export-oriented policies such as open trade while resources-rich developing countries sought 'autarkic' (heavily regulated) policies that led to their regression. Therefore, these theorists conclude that the solution to the resource curse is 'free market' policies epitomised by the Washington Consensus. This thesis critically examines the RCT from a political economy standpoint and establishes that the resource curse effects are the same outcome described by political economists in the 1950 s and 1960 s as the underdevelopment of development. The difference in the choice of words to describe the same effects stems from the ideological standpoint from which Third World poverty and underdevelopment is discussed. To the resource curse theorists viewing from the standpoint of neoliberalism, internal factors such as political corruption, rent seeking, lack of transparency and good governance cause the resource curse. To the political economists on the other hand, external factors such as the volatility of world commodity prices, capital flight, tax evasion, colonialism, imperialism, neocolonialism and globalisation cause underdevelopment. This thesis establishes that both external and internal factors contribute to the poverty and underdevelopment of Third World countries. One of the external factors is the legal regime imposed through colonialism. Colonial laws have effectively divested indigenous peoples of their ownership and property rights in natural resources, which the neo-colonial nation-states retained upon independence, which are then transferred to transnational corporations in <b>exchange</b> for <b>licence</b> fees and non-controlling equity. Local ruling elites and foreign capitalists share the resources wealth, leaving the majority impoverished and their countries underdeveloped. Chapters 10 and 11 examine Papua New Guinea's legal regime to demonstrate this point. The thesis concludes that the solution to the resource curse or underdevelopment is for natural resources-rich developing countries to reform their laws to allow majority ownership and control in their citizens and adopt policies that the now developed countries adopted and followed when they were at similar stage of development. These policies are the 'autarkic' policies rejected by the resource curse theorists but recommended by the political economists of the underdevelopment discourse. ...|$|R
40|$|MM Thesis 2014 ABSTRACT This {{research}} was conducted {{in a bid to}} understand the mining industry’s contribution to Local Economic Development (LED) through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the Northern Cape Province. The study was motivated by the apparent general criticism that is often levelled against the mining industry by various communities, labour organisations and political parties for not playing its part in terms of contributing to the socio-economic upliftment of the areas where these mining companies operate. This criticism exists despite these mining companies’ commitment to advance socio-economic transformation through Social and Labour Plans (SLP). In other words, South African mining policy dictates and compels the mining companies to show willingness as well as pledge their commitment to socio-economic transformation in areas where they intend to operate as a way of ensuring that mining activities in the country benefit the people who reside in these mining areas. This is a condition that government imposes on these companies in <b>exchange</b> for a <b>licence</b> to operate. If this is the case, then why is the mining industry, in general, accused of not playing its part in terms of contributing to socio-economic transformation in areas where there are mining operations? In order to understand this phenomenon, the research sought to understand the link between the mining companies’ CSR initiatives and the LED programmes and strategies of communities where these mining companies operate. Furthermore, in the quest to understand the relationship between CSR and LED, it was also vital to understand the relationship between key stakeholders such as government, community and mining companies in an effort to ascertain the level of partnerships in approaching LED. To this effect, CSR, LED and partnerships served as the key variables for analysis in the quest to understand the phenomenon, thereby achieving the objectives of this research. This research has revealed that there are key areas that constitute a challenge to LED. These are lack of a coordinated approach to LED, poor partnerships amongst stakeholders and weak monitoring and evaluation mechanisms from government. Although government has taken strides in formulating the policies to drive transformation in the mining industry, more still {{needs to be done to}} ensure that these policies result in the realisation of a desired state of evident socio-economically transformed mining towns. In order to deal with these challenges, the study proposes the need for a new approach to LED with specific reference to mining towns, the need for an improved and vigorous regulatory framework and the need for improved partnerships. The research presents these key factors as the possible solution to the challenges of Local Economic Development in mining towns in the Northern Cape Province...|$|R
