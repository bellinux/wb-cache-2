In this paper we use the same data but analyze the transverse momentum spectrum {{in the framework of}} the clustering of color sources. The charged particle pseudorapidities densities in the range 7. 0 ≤〈 dN_c/dη〉≤ 26. 0 are considered. Results are presented for both thermodynamic and transport properties. The initial temperature and energy density are obtained and compared with the Lattice Quantum Chromo Dynamics(LQCD) simulations. The energy density (ε/T^ 4) ∼ 11. 5 for 〈 dN_c/dη〉∼ 25. 0 is close to the value for 0 - 10 % central events in Au+Au collisions at √(s_NN) = 200 GeV. The shear viscosity to entropy density ratio(η/s) is ∼ 0. 2 at the transition temperature. The result for the trace anomaly Δ is in excellent agreement with LQCD simulations.

40|$|Elliptic flow in heavy-ion {{collisions}} is {{an important}} signature of a possible <b>de-confinement</b> transition from hadronic phase to partonic phase. In the present work, we use non-extensive statistics, which {{has been used for}} transverse momentum (p_ T) distribution in proton+proton (p+p) collisions, as the initial particle distribution function in Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). A Boltzmann-Gibbs Blast Wave (BGBW) function is taken as an equilibrium function to get the final distribution to describe the particle production in heavy-ion collisions. In this formalism, we try to estimate the elliptic flow in Pb+Pb collisions at √(s_ NN) = 2. 76 TeV at the LHC for different centralities. The elliptic flow (v_ 2) of identified particles seems to be described quite well in the available p_ T range. An approach, which combines the non-extensive nature of particle production in p+p collisions through an evolution in kinetic theory using BTE, with BGBW equilibrium distribution is successful in describing the spectra and elliptic flow in heavy-ion collisions.

The clustering of color sources provides a framework of the partonic interactions in the initial stage of the collisions. The onset of <b>de-confinement</b> transition is identified by the spanning percolation cluster in 2 D percolation. Various equilibrium thermodynamical properties in particular, initial energy density, entropy density, and trace anomaly are helpful to understand the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) {{phase transition}}. In this work, we have measured the initial energy density (ε_i), shear viscosity to entropy density ratio (η/s), trace anomaly (Δ), the squared speed of sound (C_s^ 2), entropy density, and bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio (ζ/s) using Color String Percolation Model (CSPM) and STAR data at RHIC energies from √(s_NN) = 7. 7 to 200 GeV.

40|$|This review gives {{a rather}} general {{discussion}} of high temperature superconductors {{as an example}} of a strongly correlated material. The argument is made that in view of the many examples of unconventional superconductors discovered in the past twenty years, we should no longer be surprised that superconductivity emerges as a highly competitive ground state in systems where Coulomb repulsion plays a dominant role. The physics of the cuprates is discussed, emphasizing the unusual pseudogap phase in the underdoped region. It is argued that the resonating valence bond (RVB) picture, as formulated using gauge theory with fermionic and bosonic matter fields, gives an adequate physical understanding, even though many details are beyond the powers of current calculational tools. The recent discovery of quantum oscillations in a high magnetic field is discussed in this context. Meanwhile, the problem of the quantum spin liquid (a spin system with antiferromagnetic coupling which refuses to order even at zero temperature) is a somewhat simpler version of the high T_c problem where significant progress has been made recently. It is understood that the existence of matter fields can lead to <b>de-confinement</b> of the U(1) gauge theory in 2 + 1 dimensions, and novel new particles (called fractionalized particles), such as fermionic spinons which carry spin 1 2 and no charge, and gapless gauge bosons can emerge to create a new critical state at low energies. We even have a couple of real materials where such a scenario may be realized experimentally. The article ends with answers to questions such as: what limits T_c if pairing is driven by an electronic energy scale? why is the high T_c problem hard? why is there no consensus? and why is the high T_c problem important?Comment: Submitted as "Key Issue" essay for Report of Progress in Physics; v 2 : References are added and typos correcte...|$|E
40|$|Semiconductor {{nanowires}} {{have attracted}} considerable attention as possible source for lasers and optical storage media. We report the fabrication and optical characterization of ZnO and CdS nanowires. The former {{are produced by}} electrochemical deposition of Zn inside nanoporous alumina films containing regimented arrays of 10 nm, 25 nm and 50 nm diameter pores, followed by room temperature chemical oxidization. Fluorescence spectroscopy shows different characteristics associated with different sample diameter. The 50 nm ZnO nanowires show an exciton recombination peak and an additional peak related to the deep trap levels. 25 nm ZnO nanowires show a only the exciton recombination peak, which is red shifted, possibly due to quantum confined Stark effect associated with built in charges in the alumina. This feature can be exploited to produce light emitting devices whose frequency can be modulated with an external electric field. Such devices could be novel ultra-violet frequency modulators for optical communication and solar blind materials. In addition, we have investigated fluorescence spectra of 10 -, 25 - and 50 -nm diameter CdS nanowires (relative dielectric constant = 5. 4) self assembled in a porous alumina matrix (relative dielectric constant = 8 - 10). The spectra reveal peaks associated with free electron-hole recombination. The 10 -nm wire spectra show an additional lower energy peak due to exciton recombination. In spite of dielectric <b>de-confinement</b> caused by the insulator having a higher dielectric constant than the semiconductor, the exciton binding energy increases almost 8 -fold from its bulk value in the 10 nm wires. This increase is most likely due to quantum confinement accruing {{from the fact that}} the exciton Bohr radius (~ 5 nm) is comparable to or larger than the wire radius, especially if side depletion is taken into account. Such an increase in the binding energy could be exploited to make efficient room temperature luminescent devices in the visible range...|$|E
40|$|Neutron {{scattering}} {{has been}} {{proved to be a}} powerful tool to study the dynamics of biological systems under various conditions. This thesis intends to utilize neutron scattering techniques, combining with MD simulations, to develop fundamental understanding of several biologically interesting systems. Our systems include a drug delivery system containing Nanodiamonds with nucleic acid (RNA), and two specific model proteins, β-Casein and Inorganic Pyrophosphatase (IPPase). RNA and nanodiamond (ND) both are suitable for drug-delivery applications in nano-biotechnology. The architecturally flexible RNA with catalytic functionality forms nanocomposites that can treat life-threatening diseases. The non-toxic ND has excellent mechanical and optical properties and functionalizable high surface area, and thus actively considered for biomedical applications. In this thesis, we utilized two tools, quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) and Molecular Dynamics Simulations to probe the effect of ND on RNA dynamics. Our work provides fundamental understanding of how hydrated RNA motions are affected in the RNA-ND nanocomposites. From the experimental and Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MD), we found that hydrated RNA motion is faster on ND surface than a freestanding one. MD Simulation results showed that the failure of Stokes Einstein relation results the presence of dynamic heterogeneities in the biomacromolecules. Radial pair distribution function from MD Simulation confirmed that the hydrophilic nature of ND attracts more water than RNA results the <b>de-confinement</b> of RNA on ND. Therefore, RNA exhibits faster motion in the presence of ND than freestanding RNA. In the second project, we studied the dynamics of a natively disordered protein β-Casein which lacks secondary structures. In this study, the temperature and hydration effects on the dynamics of β-Casein are explored by Quasielastic Neutron Scattering (QENS). We investigated the mean square displacement (MSD) of hydrated and dry β-Casein as a function of temperature, to study the effect of hydration on their flexibility. The Elastic Incoherent Structure Factor (EISF) in the energy domain reveals the fraction of hydrogen atoms participating in motion in a sphere of diffusion. In the time domain analysis, a logarithmic-like decay is observed in the range of picosecond to nanosecond (β-relaxation time) in the dynamics of hydrated β-Casein. Our temperature dependent QENS experiments provide evidence that lack of secondary structure in β-Casein results in higher flexibility in its dynamics and easier reversible thermal unfolding compared to other rigid biomolecules. Lastly, we studied the domain motion of IPPase protein by Neutron Spin Echo Spectroscopy (NSE). We found that decrease in diffusion coefficient belongs to domain motion of IPPase. Moreover, Rg is varied by temperature and concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis work is on {{studying}} the production of electrons from heavy flavor decays, i. e. non-photonic electrons, at both high pT and low pT in p+p collisions. The outcome of this work resolved the long standing discrepancy between STAR and PHENIX measurements and thus had a large impact in understanding the interactions between heavy quarks and the Quark Gluon Plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. ^ Nuclear and particle physics aims to understand nature {{in terms of the}} most fundamental ingredients and interactions. The most fundamental ingredients, so called elementary particles, include spin 1 / 2 fermions, which are the constituents of matter, and spin 1 gauge bosons, which are the force carriers. Except gravity, the other three most fundamental interactions can be well understood by quantum field theories. Quantum Chromo-dynamics (QCD), based on the SU (3) group, is the theory of the strong interactions of colored quarks and gluons. At high temperature or high energy density, the interaction between partons was expected to be significantly weakened enabling them to move around like a free gas and no longer confined inside the hadrons. This state of matter with de-confined partons is named as 2 ̆ 2 Quark Gluon Plasma 2 ̆ 2 (QGP) in analogy to the conventional plasma in atomic physics. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) was designed to collide all species of nucleus at high energy to produce QGP and study its property using a wide range of probes. Since it began operating in year 2000, RHIC has done systematic studies on a broad range of physics probes and discovered a new state of medium with unprecedented temperature and density. The properties of the new medium created at RHIC are more complicated than had been anticipated. It has very high density (5 GeV/fm 3) and very high temperature (150 - 180 MeV), which is well above the predicted QCD threshold for the occurrence of <b>de-confinement.</b> However, instead of behaving like a free gas, the observed large hadron elliptic flow suggests it is more like a 2 ̆ 2 perfect fluid 2 ̆ 2 with the ratio of viscosity to entropy close to the quantum limit. Clearly the goal of future RHIC physics programs should focus on the detailed studies of the hot and dense matter to clarify its properties. ^ Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are rare probes and have not been studied in detail at RHIC. They are produced early in the collisions and interact with the medium very differently from light quarks because of their large mass. Therefore studying heavy quark production would provide crucial opportunities to reveal new properties of the medium. Heavy flavor hadrons were thought to be less suppressed due to their heavy mass. However, it was found by both the PHENIX and STAR experiments in 2005 that the production rate of non-photonic electrons was as strongly suppressed as the light hadrons. This observation posed a serious challenge to our theoretical understanding heavy quark energy loss in QGP and triggered concerted efforts in the field to investigate novel energy loss mechanisms. Although the STAR and PHENIX measurements of the non-photonic electron nuclear modification factor were consistent, the measured production rate by STAR was, however, twice that measured by PHENIX in both proton-proton (p+p) and gold-gold (Au+Au) collisions. This discrepancy had essentially halted further progress in the understanding of heavy flavor energy loss in QGP. ^ This thesis presents analysis details in identifying and measuring non-photonic electrons with data recorded during the 2008 and 2009 p+p runs at = 200 GeV. This work leads to the resolution of the STAR and PHENIX discrepancy and thus had a large impact in understanding the heavy quark production in QGP. The STAR non-photonic electron invariant cross sections in p+p collisions can be described by the Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculation within its theoretical uncertainties. The measurement of the nuclear modification factor in Au+Au collisions shows a strong suppression in non-photonic electron production at high pT and challenge the understanding of heavy quark energy loss mechanism in the field. ...|$|E
