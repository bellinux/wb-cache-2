5|$|NSB {{operates}} a commuter rail service from Bergen with two hourly departures to Arna, plus fourteen daily departures to Voss, of which {{up to six}} continue to Myrdal. Rolling stock is the Class 69 multiple units. The first part to Arna represents {{an important part of}} the public transport in Bergen, since the rail direct line through the mountain Ulriken is considerably faster than <b>driving</b> <b>around.</b>|$|E
5|$|This contradicted Wright's earlier {{statement}} when stopped by {{police in the}} district {{in the early hours}} of the morning: he implied he was unaware he was in the red light district and was <b>driving</b> <b>around</b> because he could not sleep. Wright's rented flat was located in the red light area.|$|E
5|$|Much {{time was}} spent on getting guitars to sound as Simon preferred. A bit of {{experimentation}} among the additional session players occurred, from which Simon would edit himself, compiling them together or often deleting them altogether. Many songs were recorded with a hand-built cigar-box guitar, which Simon bought from Mississippi blues musician Super Chikan. Analogue effects were applied before recording digitally to keep mixes simple; this method also inspired Simon while arranging the songs. Smith would burn Simon a compact disc each evening of the dayâ€™s session, and he would return {{the next day with}} notes on the recordings. This resulted in mixes being created as the album developed, rather than {{at the end of the}} process. Simon and Ramone often listened to their recordings while <b>driving</b> <b>around,</b> noting what would need changes.|$|E

5|$|Although Smith {{maintained}} his innocence, detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran's death {{and those of}} the other two women. Witnesses had seen him leaving the Rainbow with both Corcoran and Hyde, and he was the last person to see them both alive. CCTV footage from around Birmingham showed his distinctive car visiting key locations linked to the investigation, and even captured Hyde getting out at one point to visit a chemist. Smith was seen buying petrol from a filling station and driving near the area where Hyde's body was later discovered. Corcoran was seen on camera struggling with Smith outside Monte Carlo's. CCTV footage showed him <b>driving</b> <b>around</b> Bromsgrove, a town close to Droitwich, after killing Corcoran, and later film showed him returning to Birmingham. At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him: a motorist who saw him buying petrol, and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance. Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight, although he had no visible signs of injury.|$|E
5|$|He {{returns to}} Gastown and learns Scrotus' {{location}} from Scab. Max and Chumbucket find Scrotus <b>driving</b> <b>around</b> the Purgatory Flatlands an area {{far away from}} the Great White and use the Magnum Opus to crash the Land Mover, which is pushed {{to the edge of a}} cliff. Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the Magnum Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and Magnum Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car at the start of the game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the chainsaw blade out of Scrotus' head and killing him. The game ends with Max entering the Interceptor and placing a picture of his family on the dashboard before he leaves for parts unknown.|$|E
