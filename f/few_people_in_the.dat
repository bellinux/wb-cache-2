Among the passengers were the Beatles, {{on their first}} trip to the United States as a band, with their entourage of photographers and journalists, and Phil Spector. When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed JohnF.KennedyAirport, they were greeted by a second large crowd, with Beatles fans again estimated to number four thousand, and journalists, two hundred. From having so many people packed in a little space, a <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crowd got injured. The airport had not previously experienced such a large crowd.|$|E

25|$|Tolstoy caused much {{controversy}} with his scathing remarks aimed at contemporary government officials (Alexander Timashev, Vladimir Butkov, Ivan Veillot) whom he – {{a supporter of}} the monarch – considered real enemies of the State.

Having witnessed the alleged rape-attempt through a window, Elly is one of the <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county who knows that Zendt is innocent. The pair head west, marrying along the way. Upon reaching Cairo, Illinois, the former Mennonite is forced to sell his prized draft horses. It is explained to him that they animals would never survive the trail across the Great Plains and that oxen are much better suited, despite being slower.|$|E

President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from The Matrix and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified {{to learn that the}} driver happens to be M. Night Shyamalan.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Ray Patterson is {{reinstated}} (to which he enters and exits to the Sanford and Son theme song) was {{a reference to}} a moment that occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx (who starred on Sanford and Son). During a show in Vegas, Redd Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song, only to find that there were very <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience. Foxx angrily stated that he refused to do a show with such a small audience and walked off the stage. The house orchestra, puzzled by Foxx's leaving, simply played him off with the Sanford and Son theme song again. The same incident was the basis for the joke in [...] "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons" [...] where Moe Szyslak walks onto the stage and, without breaking his stride, walks off.|$|E

500|$|Band {{originally}} planned {{to produce a}} sequel called Laserblast II, with production work to begin in August 1986 and a theatrical release expected to follow shortly thereafter. A tagline released for the film read, [...] "The ultimate alien weapon is back." [...] When plans for the sequel were announced, Atlanta-based film critic Scott Journal wrote, [...] "I {{am one of the}} <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world who saw the original and, believe me, it did not merit a followup." [...] However, Charles Band Productions fell into financial difficulties shortly after the production of Laserblast, and the project was eventually scrapped. However, the premise and elements of the abandoned sequel were later used in the 1988 Charles Band film, Deadly Weapon, which, like Laserblast, was about a bullied teenager who finds a powerful weapon and uses it to seek revenge against his enemies. Band continued to make films and eventually formed Empire Pictures.|$|E
500|$|The Foreigner song [...] "Hot Blooded" [...] plays over Apu's {{bachelor}} binge, and he dances in {{a manner}} similar to Riverdance. Additionally, an Indian version of The Carpenters' song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] is sung at the wedding; an Indian vocal group was hired to sing, while Alf Clausen wrote the instrumental part. The scene where Moe walks on and off the stage without breaking his stride was loosely based on a moment that occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx. During a show in Las Vegas, Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song, only to find that there were very <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience. Foxx reacted angrily refusing to do a show with such a small audience and walked off. The house orchestra, puzzled by Foxx's leave simply played him off with the Sanford and Son theme song again. This incident was also referenced in the later episode [...] "Trash of the Titans", when Ray Patterson is reinstated, although the reference is more similar to the real event then.|$|E
500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on {{was very important to}} us last season was, there were so <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the idea that people can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E

500|$|Upon {{its release}} in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2007, [...] "She's Madonna" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Nick Levine from Digital Spy awarded it {{three out of}} five stars, noting that the track {{was a kind of}} [...] "damage control" [...] for Williams' fallen public image following his rehabilitation. [...] "Who'd have guessed he'd sound so comfortable—his most convincing in years, actually—singing about one of the <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world who's more famous than him ?", Levine concluded. Alexis Petridis from The Guardian described the track as a [...] "brilliant, icy meditation on fame's corrupting power". NMEs Priya Elan listed [...] "She's Madonna" [...] as one of Williams' most [...] "bonkers song ever", along with three other songs from Rudebox: [...] "The 80's", [...] "The 90's" [...] and [...] "The Actor". Hubbard explained that the Pet Shop Boys brought an [...] "added spray of sheen to the glacially excellent" [...] song, and working with them brought some [...] "credibility" [...] to it. Julie Broadfoot from BBC Music described [...] "She's Madonna" [...] as a [...] "weird but fun tune". Lauren Murphy from Entertainment website noted that Pet Shop Boys' own musical influence was prevalent in the track, with its [...] "sparse, spacey glow and not least on synth-laden tongue-in-cheek homage" [...] of the song.|$|E

The last census conducted under French rule in 1803 [...] "estimated" [...] that the Arkansas Post District had a population of 600 with a militia of 150.|$|E

This would cause a lever with a counterweight to rise, pulling on the support beam under the gallows. When enough pressure was applied, the beam broke free, opening the trap and hanging the condemned man.|$|E
