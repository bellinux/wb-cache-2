50|$|One {{experimental}} railcar {{developed during}} the 1920s was the Leyland petrol railcar, designed in 1925 and built that year at NZR Hutt Workshops in Petone. The railcar was essentially a regular passenger carriage with a driving cab installed at one end; a Leyland petrol engine with an output of 60-75 kW was positioned in a <b>front</b> <b>housing</b> that extended some four metres {{in front of the}} cab. The wheel arrangement was 2-Bo, with the leading axle under the cab and the bogie located at the rear end. sixty-two passengers could be accommodated inside the 19-m-long railcar.|$|E
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of an investigation conducted to determine the nature and the extent of the reversal of flow, which occurs at the inlet of centrifugal compressors over a considerable portion of the operating range. Qualitative studies of this flow reversal were made by lampblack patterns taken on a mixed-flow-type impeller and by tuft studies made on a conventional centrifugal compressor. Quantitative studies were made on a compressor specially designed to enable survey of angularity of flow, static and total pressures, and temperatures to be taken very close to the impeller <b>front</b> <b>housing...</b>|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 58 - 59. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A study was performed to investigate the variation in the forces and moments acting on the front and back sides of a semi-open impeller. Three rotational speeds and five volumetric flow rates for each speed were identified as the operating conditions for the pump after generating performance curves. The pressure distribution inside the pump housing was measured through pressure taps drilled in the front and back housing. These pressure measurements were obtained for distinct geometric configurations comprising of varying positions of the impeller and the <b>front</b> <b>housing.</b> Pressure contour plots were generated for all the operating conditions and an asymmetric pressure distribution was observed in the pump housing. Higher pressures were witnessed near the volute tongue. Forces acting on the impeller were calculated by integrating the pressures acting on it as measured by the pressure taps. A net axial thrust on the impeller, trying to push it towards the suction side, was observed, which decreased in magnitude with increasing back clearance for a certain fixed value of the front clearance. Moments acting on the front and back sides of the impeller were noticed to approach smaller magnitudes for higher volumetric flow rates. A geometric configuration was identified for better overall performance of the pump...|$|E
