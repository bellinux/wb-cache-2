25|$|A month later, 25 October, at Stuttgart, Richard Strauss {{conducted}} the première of his Ariadne auf Naxos. The {{first and third}} performances were with the élite soloists Maria Jeritza, Margarethe Siems, Herman Jadlowker: the second was the Stuttgart team, Erb as Bacchus. In May 1913 at the Imperial performance at Wiesbaden he sang Hüon in Oberon. The Kaiser said to him, 'You must be a good Lohengrin. Tell Baron von Putlitz <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> him for having sent such a good performer of Huon.' Erb's farewell to Stuttgart after his six years there was as Lohengrin.|$|E

5000|$|Conversely, Gay Sr. {{said this}} about Marvin Jr., It was {{important}} that I have a male child. A namesake is what I wanted.

25|$|In Burundi and Rwanda, most, {{if not all}} {{surnames}} have God in it, {{for example}} Hakizimana (meaning God cures), Nshimirimana (<b>I</b> <b>thank</b> God) or Havyarimana/Habyarimana (God gives birth). But not all surnames end with the suffix -imana. Irakoze {{is one of these}} (technically meaning Thank God, though it is hard to translate it correctly in English or probably any other language). Surnames are often different among immediate family members, as parents frequently choose unique surnames for each child, and women keep their maiden names when married. Surnames are placed before given names and frequently written in capital letters, e.g. HAKIZIMANA Jacques.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>thank</b> you heartily for the pamphlet, {{and for the}} {{authorities}} you give me for the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since: I know not how long, they have been my creed: I believe, before even my happiness in your acquaintance and friendship, tho' they have certainly been strengthen'd and confirm'd by your conversation and instruction—in support of these principles I trust I shall ever act, and I shall continue to attempt their general propagation;—whether by the best means, is matter of speculation: but by the best, according to my judgement—nothing can make me a disciple of Paine or Priestley, nor any thing induce me to proclaim, that I am not so, but in the mode I myself think the best to resist their mischief—private conversation and private insinuation may best suit the extent of my abilities, the turn of my temper, {{and the nature of}} my character...|$|E
25|$|One of {{his drawing}} pupils was Margaret Lindsay, eldest {{daughter}} of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick and Amelia Murray (granddaughter to David Murray, 5th Viscount of Stormont and sister to the naval officer John Lindsay). He later eloped {{with her and}} on 1 March 1752 they married in the Canongate Kirk, Edinburgh; her father never forgave her for marrying an artist. Ramsay already had to maintain a daughter from his previous marriage and his two surviving sisters, but told Sir Alexander that he could provide Margaret with an annual income of £100. He said it would increase ‘as my affairs increase, and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> God, {{they are in a}} way of increasing’ and that his only motive for the marriage was ‘my love for your Daughter, who, I am sensible, is entitled to much more than ever I shall have to bestow upon her’. Three children survived from their long and happy marriage, Amelia (1755–1813), Charlotte (1758–1818?), and John (1768–1845).|$|E

25|$|The Gothic Temple {{designed}} by James Gibbs in 1741 and completed about 1748, {{this is the}} only building in the Gardens built from ironstone, all the others use a creamy-yellow limestone. The building is triangular in plan of two storeys with a pentagonal shaped tower at each corner, one of which rises two floors higher than the main building, while the other two towers have lanterns on their roofs. Above the door is a quote from Pierre Corneille's play Horace: Je rends grace aux Dieux de n'estre pas Roman (<b>I</b> <b>thank</b> the gods I am not a Roman). The interior includes a circular room of two storeys covered by a shallow dome that is painted to mimic mosaic work including shields representing the Heptarchy. Dedicated 'To the Liberty of our Ancestors'. To quote John Martin Robinson: 'to the Whigs, Saxon and Gothic were interchangeably associated with freedom and ancient English liberties: trial by jury (erroneously thought to have been founded by King Alfred at a moot on Salisbury Plain), Magna Carta, parliamentary representation, all the things which the Civil War and Glorious Revolution had protected from the wiles of Stuart would-be absolutism, and to the preservation of which Lord Cobham and his 'Patriots' were seriously devoted.' The Temple was used in the 1930s by the school as the Officer Training Corps armoury. It is now available as a holiday let through the Landmark Trust.|$|E
25|$|In 1662 Frankland {{retired to}} his {{patrimony}} at Rathmell, {{where he lived}} some years in privacy. His children were baptised (1664 and 1668) at the parish church. At this period he did not {{join the ranks of}} the ‘conventicle’ preachers. Efforts were being made by the nonconformists of the north to secure the educational advantages offered for a short time by the Durham College. William Pell, who had been a fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and a tutor at Durham, declined to start an academical institution, holding himself precluded by his graduation oath from resuming collegiate lectures outside the ancient universities. Application was then successfully made to Frankland, who was not hindered by the same scruple. Nonconformist tutors usually understood the oath as referring to prelections in order to a degree. Before opening his ‘academy’ Frankland was in London, where he felt ‘a violent impulse upon his mind to go to the king.’ By the help of ‘the old Earl of Manchester, lord chamberleyne’ (Edward Montagu), he gained an audience while Charles {{was on his way to}} the council. Frankland, in the divine name, enjoined Charles ‘to reform your life, your family, your kingdom, and the church,’ adding an impressive warning. ‘“I will,” saith the king, “do what I can.”’ After a few more words ‘the king hasted away, saying, “I thank you, sir,” and twice looking back before he went into the counsel-chamber, said, “I thank you, sir; <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> you”’.|$|E

Secondly, there was a vague {{something}} lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.|$|R

500|$|In a small essay, [...] "Shmendrick, My Mephistopheles", one of {{the last}} {{passages}} he wrote, Adler describes the last time he saw Shmendrick played, at a memorial for Goldfaden in 1912. Lamenting the choice of play for the memorial—"Goldfaden has written better things"—he nonetheless acknowledges, [...] "that same bitter Shmendrick was our livelihood... I gritted my teeth. I called on the ghosts of Aristophanes, of Shakespeare, of Lope de Vega. I wept and swallowed my own tears... And I cursed the fate that bound me to him... Yet even as I cursed and condemned, the tears rose. For my whole life, my whole past, was before me on that stage... Poor weak first step of our Yiddish theater... <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> you for the happiness you gave us... <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> you Shmendrick—my beloved—my own." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Schmirler {{worked as}} colour {{commentator}} for CBC during Canada's national junior curling championships. During her illness, Schmirler {{had been largely}} removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler {{held a press conference}} to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: [...] "There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place. And the last one was to actually be here today, and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> CBC, <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead." ...|$|E

500|$|Merson's {{introduction}} in the 74th minute was cheered by the Arsenal supporters, as was {{his every}} touch of the ball.

500|$|For Mercury's 65th {{birthday}} in 2011, Google dedicated their Google Doodle to him. It included an animation {{set to the}} Mercury penned song, [...] "Don't Stop Me Now".

500|$|.....I {{began to}} read and think and dissect the anatomy of the system in which workingmen, however organized, could be {{shattered}} and battered and splintered at a single stroke. The writings of Bellamy and Blatchford early appealed to me.

500|$|Zola {{himself was}} happy with his {{achievements}} to the Chelsea side, but when asked if his substitution was all projected, he denied it, stating: [...] "It wasn't planned. In the moment, I used my positive strength and I got a reward for the passion, the work not only I, but the masseur Mimmo Pezza did together in Rimini. The injury should take one month to heal, Mimmo Pezza helped me be fit in less than half that. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> this man for a beautiful moment which will be in my heart {{for as long as}} I can remember." [...] Their victory meant Aston Villa gained a place in the 1998–99 UEFA Cup.|$|E
500|$|The {{new version}} of the dance single with Inna's vocals was {{initially}} made available for consumption as credited to Bob Taylor and Anni (backwards to Inna), as the artists wanted to [...] "stay in the shade" [...] reportedly because [...] "the Romanian audience has some bias". Following a time of speculation and controversy, the performers of the recording were finally revealed, with Inna writing on her website; [...] "I consider that a good song can be promoted and listened to without knowing by whom it is composed or who interprets it. With the help of 'Déjà Vu', I have showed this thing and, look, again, you – the audience – had the biggest intake. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> you and don't forget that you are the only ones that can make a hit out of a song." ...|$|E
