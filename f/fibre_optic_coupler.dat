40|$|A new {{faint galaxy}} {{redshift}} survey has been constructed using the <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>coupler</b> at the Anglo-Australian Observatory. Intermediate dispersion spectra with resolution ~ 4 A have been gathered for over 200 field galaxies selected in apparent magnitude slices between 20. 0 1. 6, indicating {{a minimum of}} evolution of bright early type galaxies. The excess number count is clearly concentrated blueward of this, and consistent with the expectation of the burst model. Clustering on small scales, estimated via the 2 -point spatial correlation function agrees fairly well with local results, but evidence for a very large scale periodicity may be indicated by combining this survey {{with others in the}} direction of the Galactic poles...|$|E
40|$|A {{fibre optic}} sensor for methane gas using the "differential absorption" {{referencing}} technique {{has been designed}} and constructed. Infra red light in the 1. 66 pm spectral region is absorbed by methane {{and this is the}} operating principle of the sensor. The system employs a novel LED, manufactured by GEC Marconi Ltd., as an infra red light source. The LED couples more power into single mode fibre than any other device of its type which is commercially available. The light is transmitted to a gas cell via single mode fibres and a <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>coupler,</b> where some of it is absorbed according to the concentration of methane present. Two optical interference filters with transmissions at absorbing and non-absorbing spectral regions, respectively, are used in dual wavelength referencing mode to remove any interferences from non gas dependent parameters (e. g. dust in the cell). A calibration curve for the sensor is determined by plotting the values of the attenuated light signals against the corresponding concentrations of methane in the gas cell. A full characterisation of each component of the system was undertaken and the systems overall performance determined. The system has a limit of detection of 0. 077 % CH 4. This is a factor of 18 below the specification requirement for the project, which is 1. 25 % CH 4 in air (i. e. 25 % of the Lower Explosive Limit). The= system has a resolution of 0. 025 % CH 4 and shows both good repeatability and reproducibility. The main problem associated with the system is the critical temperature dependence of the optical interference filters, whose transmissions vary with temperature changes of 0. 1 °C and therefore affect the system stability...|$|E
40|$|In {{the modern}} era good {{communication}} systems are the need of the hour. This project includes the study of optical components and Radio over Fibre systems. Various Optical components are used in optical systems and those optical components have different characteristics. Various optical components have been studied in this project {{and in addition to}} that there is a study of components using S-matrix. The use of S-matrix in analyising the directional coupler. Optical networks can be analysed with the same methods as microwave networks in theory of microwave networks, components are generally represented by complex scattering parameters which form the S- matrix. we adopted this formalism to <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>coupler</b> used in optical network taking the polarization dependence into account. There is the study of Fabry- perot filter in which the study of free spectral range (FSR) and the Transfer function was determined through Matlab simulation. The results thus obtained are studied. For the future provisions of broadband, multimedia the radio over fibre systems are a good alternative. RoF systems are used basically because of their low loss and extremely wide bandwidth and robustness. Radio over fibre can use millimeter waves and serve as a high speed wireless local or personal area network. In this project various parts of the Radio over fibre systems are studied, The power spectrum measurements of a millimeter wave Radio over Fibre under different single mode fibre length is done with a Matlab simulation it is found that the fading occurs at some values of length of fibre in the power spectrum. In radio over fibre systems the two subcarrier modulations (SCMs) i. e., single sideband and tandem single sideband have been widely used both SSB and TSSB SCMs can be obtained by using optical mach Zehnder modulator. In this project we investigate the impact {{of the impact of the}} harmonic distortion and inter modulation distortion in RoF systems for one wavelength carrying two radio frequency signals with either SSB or TSSB SCM. It is found that non linear distortion can be reduced when the frequency difference 1 GHz. It was found that non linear distortion strongly depends on the modulation index. The source of these results was a mat lab simulation and calculations. For the different values of the signal frequencies the NSR was calculated. ...|$|E

In this paper, we present design details and performance {{of a number of}} <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>couplers</b> for use in irradiance measurement systems employing remote light sensors applicable for either spectrally resolved or broadband measurement. The angular and spectral characteristics of different coupler designs are characterised and compared with existing state-of-the-art commercial technology. The new coupler designs are fabricated from polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) rods and operate through forward scattering of incident sunlight on the front surfaces of the structure into an <b>optic</b> <b>fibre</b> located in a cavity {{to the rear of the}} structure. The PTFE couplers exhibit up to 4. 8 % variation in scattered transmission intensity between 425 nm and 700 nm and show minimal specular reflection, making the designs {{accurate and}} reliable over the visible region. Through careful geometric optimization near perfect cosine dependence on the angular response of the coupler can be achieved.

This is primarily due to post welding stresses in the <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> which develop during the cooling process. The mechanical stresses resulting in the post welded <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> are estimated using Finite Element Analysis and response surface methodology.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a new <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> sensor system for the optical detection of leakages in sewerage tunnels is reported. The system developed overcomes the disadvantages of the usually employed camera based inspection systems which are relatively complex and, in addition, require cleaning of the structures to be monitored beforehand. The sensor concept created combines a Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) -based humidity sensor and a swellable polymeric <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> sensor. Both sensors are located along the sewerage tunnel so that they can response immediately to any leakages that may occur. The swellable polymeric <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> sensor shows a response of 34. 2 dB in the presence of water, a performance which is superior to that seen form other swellable polymeric <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> sensors reported so far. Furthermore, the resistance of both sensors to highly alkaline environments (pH 13. 4), an important feature of such sensors was verified. Consequently, when compared to the use of conventional inspection techniques, the novel <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> sensor system provides a robust, relatively low-cost and continuous monitoring system well suited to use in sewerage tunnels...|$|R
