5|$|The {{impact of}} Copperhead is unclear. The visit was {{reported}} up the German chain of command, and some double agents later received {{requests for information}} about Montgomery's movements. There {{is no indication that}} Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this {{to the fact that the}} deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing that there would be no reason for a <b>flying</b> <b>visit</b> to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion.|$|E
25|$|On 20 April, Wellington {{arrived on}} a <b>flying</b> <b>visit</b> from the {{northern}} front. By this time, his opponent Masséna had abandoned his campaign in Portugal and retreated into Spain. Two days later, Wellington accompanied Major General Charles Alten's newly-arrived brigade of the King's German Legion on a reconnaissance of Badajoz. A skirmish with the aggressive garrison ensued in which the Germans lost 50 to 60 casualties. Before leaving on the 25th, Wellington issued a set of comprehensive instructions to Beresford. On {{the advice of his}} chief engineer, Colonel Richard Fletcher, Wellington ordered that the main attack be directed on the San Cristobal, Picurina, and Pardeleras forts.|$|E
25|$|The {{tourists}} flew to Sydney, where Mike Denness {{held a press}} conference, then flew on to Adelaide for net {{practice and}} their first matches. Here they also saw Dennis Lillee in his first match since his breakdown in 1973, taking 4/82 and 3/40 for Western Australia against South Australia. Frank Tyson noted that the tour was far more hectic than {{the old days when}} the team arrived by boat. Instead of having seven first class matches and a similar number of country matches before the First Test they now only had four first class matches, and few of the England players had time to accustom themselves to local conditions. Most of the party only had two games under their belt when they played Australia at the Gabba. Also the country games were no longer two-day occasions for relaxation, but were crammed into a 10-hour, one-day <b>flying</b> <b>visit,</b> which allowed little time to be feted by the locals or for the players to rest.|$|E

500|$|Later in September, Park {{performed}} {{for the first}} time in Australia, successfully holding concerts in Sydney and Melbourne. Park returned to Immortal Songs 2 for a [...] "King of Kings" [...] special in October, where he performed [...] "The Woman in Rain" [...] by Shin Jung-hyeon. In a <b>flying</b> <b>visit</b> to Los Angeles, Jay Park made a last-minute appearance in a YouTube sketch by David So, which parodies Wong Fu Productions' The Last.|$|E
500|$|By 8 April new bridges {{had been}} thrown across the Guadiana and the {{following}} day Beresford's army moved to Olivenza; they were now over the border and 24kilometres (15mi) south of Badajoz. While the British 4th Division tackled the small French garrison there, the main Allied army followed Latour-Maubourg south while sending covering forces to watch the Badajoz garrison from Valverde and Albuera. [...] Beresford coordinated his movements with {{the remnants of the}} Spanish Army of Extremadura (now under the command of General Castaños), adding 3,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry to his strength. [...] On 15 April, Olivenza fell to the 4th Division, which technically put Beresford in a position to commence the more important task of besieging Badajoz. [...] However, neither Beresford nor Wellington had provided a siege-train for the expedition, so one had to be improvised on the spot. [...] The solution adopted was to take sufficient artillery pieces of various qualities and vintages from the fortress of Elvas, but this expedient caused yet another delay in Allied progress. [...] Beresford took the opportunity presented by this delay to have his forces clear southern Extremadura of French forces and Latour-Maubourg was pushed back to Guadalcanal. [...] Beresford left his cavalry and a brigade under Lieutenant Colonel John Colborne, along with a detachment of Spanish horse, to watch Latour-Maubourg's movements and dissuade him from returning to Extremadura. [...] Wellington was so concerned by the lack of progress that he decided to pay a <b>flying</b> <b>visit</b> to the region. He and Beresford conducted a reconnaissance of Badajoz on 22 April {{and by the time he}} left for the north, he had prepared for Beresford a detailed set of memorandum concerning how he should conduct the impending siege and the rest of the campaign. [...] Beresford followed the instructions slowly but surely and finally began the Siege of Badajoz on 4 May.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1941, Mountbatten was {{appointed}} {{captain of the}} aircraft carrier [...] which lay in Norfolk, Virginia, for repairs following action at Malta in the Mediterranean in January. During this period of relative inactivity, he paid a <b>flying</b> <b>visit</b> to Pearl Harbor, {{three months before the}} Japanese attack on the US naval base there. Mountbatten, appalled at the base's lack of preparedness, drawing on Japan's history of launching wars with surprise attacks as well as the successful British surprise attack at the Battle of Taranto which had effectively knocked Italy's fleet out of the war, and the sheer effectiveness of aircraft against warships, accurately predicted that the US entry into the war would begin with a Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 November 1933, Balbo was {{appointed}} Governor-General of the Italian colony of Libya. Mussolini {{looked to the}} flamboyant Air Marshal to be the condottiero of Italian ambition and extend Italy's new horizons in Africa. [...] Balbo's task was to assert Italy's rights in the indeterminate zones leading to Lake Chad from Tummo {{in the west and}} from Kufra in the east towards the Sudan. Balbo had already made a <b>flying</b> <b>visit</b> to Tibesti. By securing the [...] "Tibesti-Borku strip" [...] and the [...] "Sarra Triangle", Italy would be in a good position to demand further territorial concessions in Africa from France and Britain. Mussolini even had his sights set on the former German colony of Kamerun. From 1922, the colony had become the League of Nations mandate territories of French Cameroun and British Cameroons. Mussolini pictured an Italian Cameroon and a territorial corridor connecting that territory to Libya. An Italian Cameroon would give Italy a port on the Atlantic Ocean, the mark of a world power. Ultimately, control of the Suez Canal and of Gibraltar would complete the picture.|$|E

60|$|In 1800, apparently, while Scott {{made only}} brief <b>flying</b> <b>visits</b> {{from the little}} inn of Clovenfords, on Tweed, to his sheriffdom, he found a coadjutor. Richard Heber, the wealthy and luxurious antiquary and collector, looked into Constable's first little {{bookselling}} shop, and saw a strange, poor young student prowling among the books. This was John Leyden, son of a shepherd in Roxburghshire, a lad living in extreme poverty.|$|R
40|$|The {{south-west}} of Tasmania {{has many}} attractions to the botanist, {{the principal of}} which are, firstly, that the district has not been examined botanically beyond a few <b>flying</b> <b>visits</b> to a few places; secondly, {{that there are many}} plants growing in this district that are seldom or never found elsewhere. It is only my intention to refer to plants of unusual interest, whether of distribution or other detail, and in doing so I shall deal with them in the order they occur in Bentham's Flora Australiensis...|$|R

25|$|In October 2013, Prime Minister John Key {{hinted that}} the {{election}} would take place before November. The setting of the election date became further influenced by Australia inviting New Zealand to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane on 15 and 16 November 2014, with {{the possibility that some}} leaders might make <b>flying</b> <b>visits</b> to New Zealand. Ideally, major diplomatic visits and engagements should be avoided during the election period, as they can distract politicians from campaigning and voters may see them as an attempt to influence the election result.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{are sure}} to be questioned, and can tell them the truth. Say that you acted by my orders, and {{had no idea of}} the reason for which I had hired the {{carriage}} and the extra horses; that you knew that I often made <b>flying</b> <b>visits</b> to the vineyards, and you thought I wanted to see some proprietor of Medoc, on business, and to return as quickly as possible; and were much surprised when you saw that madame went with me. Do not say anything about our picking up my friends on the road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'All right now. Don't be cross. If I didn't laugh I should cry. I'm {{so sorry}} if I have annoyed you.' He {{had gone back}} to his chair, so she paid him a <b>flying</b> <b>visit.</b> 'Satisfied?' ...|$|E

60|$|He had not {{begun by}} {{making love to}} her, or expressing admiration, or by doing or saying {{anything}} which could at all lead her to suspect his purpose, or put her on her guard. He had certainly been much more attentive to her, much more intimate with her, than he usually {{had been in his}} <b>flying</b> <b>visits</b> to Grey Abbey; but then he was now making his first appearance as a reformed rake; and besides, he was her first cousin, and she therefore felt no inclination to repel his advances.|$|R
60|$|I {{had never}} heard Mr. Fordyce preach before, as in his <b>flying</b> <b>visits</b> his ministrations were due at Hillside; and I {{certainly}} should have been struck with the force and beauty of his sermon if I had never known him before. It was curious that {{it was on the}} 49th Psalm, meant perhaps for the fashionable congregation, but remarkably chiming in with the feelings of us, who were conscious of an inheritance of evil from one who had 'done well unto himself;' though, no doubt, that was the last thing honest Parson Frank was thinking of.|$|R
60|$|As {{they rode}} {{down the main}} street they saw several mounted {{officers}} approaching, and at once recognized in the leader the commander-in-chief, who had just arrived from the front to pay one of his <b>flying</b> <b>visits,</b> to endeavor to allay the jealousies in the Portuguese Council, and to insist upon the food which the British Government was actually paying for, being supplied to the starving Portuguese soldiers. Drawing their horses aside, they saluted Lord Wellington as he rode past. He glanced at them keenly, as was his custom, and evidently recognized them as he returned the salute.|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ve got to go, too," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{with what he}} fondly {{imagined}} was a casual smile. [...] "Got to run up and see my boys and girls. Just a <b>flying</b> <b>visit</b> there and back. So we are going together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It depends," [...] was the reply. [...] "My {{intention}} {{was just to}} pay a <b>flying</b> <b>visit</b> to my honest old friend Burton here—best man in my squadron—but he is so hospitable, he’s been pressing me {{to stay for a}} few weeks." ...|$|E

6000|$|As to Christina Light's marriage, Madame Grandoni {{could make}} no {{definite}} statement. The young girl, of late, {{had made her}} several <b>flying</b> <b>visits,</b> in the intervals of the usual pre-matrimonial shopping and dress-fitting; she had spoken of the event with a toss of her head, as a matter which, with a wise old friend who viewed things in their essence, she need not pretend to treat as a solemnity. It was for Prince Casamassima to do that. [...] "It {{is what they call}} a marriage of reason," [...] she once said. [...] "That means, you know, a marriage of madness!" ...|$|R
50|$|Wildlife {{includes}} brushtailed possums, {{ducks and}} ducklings in spring, tawny frogmouths, kookaburras. Indian mynas and silver gulls are common.

60|$|Jorgenson, {{on taking}} up his dead command, {{had a house}} of thin boards built on the after deck for his own {{accommodation}} and that of Lingard during his <b>flying</b> <b>visits</b> to the Shore of Refuge. A narrow passage divided it in two and Lingard's side was furnished with a camp bedstead, a rough desk, and a rattan armchair. On one of his visits Lingard had brought with him a black seaman's chest and left it there. Apart from these objects and a small looking-glass worth about half a crown and nailed to the wall {{there was nothing else}} in there whatever. What was on Jorgenson's side of the deckhouse no one had seen, but from external evidence one could infer the existence of a set of razors.|$|R
