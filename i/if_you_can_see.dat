2500|$|The Exorcist {{was also}} {{at the center of}} {{controversy}} due to its alleged use of subliminal imagery introduced as special effects during the production of the film. Wilson Bryan Key wrote a whole chapter on the film in his book Media Sexploitation alleging repeated use of subliminal and semi-subliminal imagery and sound effects. Key observed the use of the Pazuzu face (in which Key mistakenly assumed it was Jason Miller made up in a death mask makeup, when it was actress Eileen Dietz) and claimed that the safety padding on the bedposts were shaped to cast phallic shadows on the wall and that a skull face is superimposed into one of Father Merrin's breath clouds. Key also wrote much about the sound design, identifying the use of pig squeals, for instance, and elaborating on his opinion of the subliminal intent of it all. A detailed article in the July/August 1991 issue of Video Watchdog examined the phenomenon, providing still frames identifying several uses of subliminal [...] "flashing" [...] throughout the film. [...] In an interview from the same issue, Friedkin explained, [...] "I saw subliminal cuts in a number of films before I ever put them in The Exorcist, and I thought it was a very effective storytelling device... The subliminal editing in The Exorcist was done for dramatic effect—to create, achieve, and sustain a kind of dreamlike state." [...] However, these quick, scary flashes have been labeled [...] " [...] truly subliminal" [...] and [...] "quasi-" [...] or [...] "semi-subliminal". In an interview in a 1999 book about the film, The Exorcist author Blatty addressed the controversy by explaining that, [...] "There are no subliminal images. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it, it's not subliminal." ...|$|E

"Leonard, Leonard," [...] cried Juanna in English, {{addressing}} him for {{the first}} time by his Christian name, as even then he noticed, but looking straight before her that none might guess to whom she spoke.

5000|$|In February 2017, posters {{appeared}} around Rome {{featuring a}} stern-looking Pope Francis, complaining about Francis's actions against conservative Catholics, and challenging {{his reputation for}} mercy. According to vaticanist Inés San Martín this is [...] "the first time in most Romans' memories that the city has seen posters in major public venues complaining about the policies of a given pope". [...] A week later, the Pope was targeted by a fake news hoax, which spoofed L'Osservatore Romano. In response, the Council of Cardinal Advisers appointed by the Pope voiced its [...] "full support" [...] to Francis. [...] In March 2017, when Cardinal Donald Wuerl {{was asked about the}} Pope's critics, he concluded: [...] "I think, there are just some people who can't bring themselves to move beyond where they are.

5000|$|In 2007 Bourne was {{contemplating a}} gay version of Romeo and Juliet. Despite {{the success of}} his Swan Lake, in which he altered the {{traditional}} story to be about a human male falling in love with a male swan, Bourne acknowledged the challenge of a gay Romeo and Juliet. [...] "It's more to do with dancing than with sexuality," [...] he said [...] "A male dancer, whether gay or straight, fits into a relationship with a female partner very happily. It's something you're taught, and it fits, it feels right, the lifting and all that stuff. Getting away from that, making a convincing love duet, a romantic, sexual duet, for two men that is comfortable to do and comfortable to watch-I don't know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> I've never <b>seen</b> it done." ...|$|R
500|$|Later, Chess {{arranged}} for Howlin' Wolf to record [...] "The Red Rooster" [...] {{and some other}} songs with Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts for the 1971 album The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions. [...] At {{the beginning of the}} recording, Howlin' Wolf can be heard attempting to explain the timing of the song, because as Wyman later explained, [...] "we were kind of playing it backwards". [...] Finally, Clapton (joined in by the others) encourages him to play it on guitar so [...] "I <b>can</b> follow <b>you</b> <b>if</b> I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> what you're doing". [...] Despite their efforts to get it right, according to Wyman, [...] "the Chess people ended up using the old 'backwards' take anyway".|$|R
