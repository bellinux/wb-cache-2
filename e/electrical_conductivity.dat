40|$|Abstract. The surface {{modification}} of carbon nanotubes（CNTs）has been recently observed {{to influence the}} distribution of CNTs in epoxy resin and the mechanical properties and <b>electrical</b> <b>conductivities</b> of these CNTs. Accordingly, the treatment of CNTs to with organic acids to oxidize them generates functional groups {{on the surface of}} CNTs.

The influence of adding various proportions of CNTs to the epoxy resin on the mechanical properties and <b>electrical</b> <b>conductivities</b> of the composites thus formed is investigated, and the strength of the material is tested at different temperatures.

The creep exhibits only two stages- primary creep and steady-state creep. The effects of creep stress, creep time, and humidity on the creep of composites that contain various proportion of CNTs were investigated at various temperatures. However, increasing the number of cycles in cyclic creep tests at room temperature resulted in a decrease in creep strain even at a high temperature of 55 ℃.
