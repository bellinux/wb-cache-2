The unit consisted of a cylinder of compressed air carried {{on the back of the}} diver, connected to a pressure regulator designed by Le Prieur adjusted manually by the diver, with two gauges, one for tank pressure and one for output (supply) pressure. Air was supplied continually to the mouthpiece and ejected through a short exhaust pipe <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> as in the Fernez design, however, the lack of a demand regulator and the consequent low endurance of the apparatus limited the practical use of LePrieur's device.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{locomotives}} were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> {{controlled by}} a weight suspended {{from the end of}} a lever, with the steam outlet being stopped by a cone-shaped valve. As there was nothing to prevent the weighted lever from bouncing when the locomotive ran over irregularities in the track, thus wasting steam, the weight was later replaced by a more stable spring-loaded column, often supplied by Salter, a well-known spring scale manufacturer. The danger of these devices was that the driving crew could be tempted to add weight to the arm to increase pressure. Most early boilers were fitted with a tamper-proof [...] "lockup" [...] direct-loaded ball valve protected by a cowl. In the late 1850s, John Ramsbottom introduced a safety valve that became popular in Britain during {{the latter part of the}} 19th century. Not only was this valve tamper-proof, but tampering by the driver could only have the effect of easing pressure. George Richardson's safety valve was an American invention introduced in 1875, and was designed to release the steam only at the moment when the pressure attained the maximum permitted. This type of valve is in almost universal use at present. Britain's Great Western Railway was a notable exception to this rule, retaining the direct-loaded type until the end of its separate existence, because it was considered that such a valve lost less pressure between opening and closing.|$|E
50|$|The modern bass {{trombone}} is {{the same}} length as a tenor trombone, but typically has two valves, one pitched in F and one in G. When combined, these valves put the instrument into D. Modern contrabass trombones are constructed in F and B. The F contrabass trombone is often <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> that puts it into D, and a valve that puts it into E, and when combined, these put the instrument into the key of B. The B contrabass is often <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> in F and has been fitted with both a valve in F and G, so that it matches its bass trombone counterpart, but is pitched an octave lower.|$|E
25|$|A {{second stage}} freeze {{is also likely}} to happen with the <b>valve</b> open, causing <b>a</b> free flow, which may {{precipitate}} a first stage freeze if not immediately stopped. If the flow through the frozen second stage can be stopped before the first stage freezes, the process can be halted. This may be possible if the second stage is <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> shutoff <b>valve,</b> but if this is done, the first stage must be <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> overpressure <b>valve,</b> as closing the supply to the second stage disables its secondary function as <b>an</b> overpressure <b>valve.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{one piece}} {{lubricator}} {{body is a}} gunmetal casting and incorporates the condensing chamber, the oil reservoir and the sight glasses. Passages within the body interconnect these areas. The body is <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steam <b>valve,</b> <b>a</b> water <b>valve,</b> <b>an</b> oil control <b>valve.</b> Sight glasses are fitted at the front & back of the body {{on each of the}} feeds, these feeds are <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> individual feed regulating valves for controlling the feed rate for each outlet. The oil control valve was used to either turn the supply off/on, or to shut off the supply to the cylinders and just supply the air compressor with oil whilst the locomotive is stationary on lubricators <b>with</b> <b>a</b> center feed. Each feed is also <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> drain <b>valve</b> for cleaning each sight glass. The body is also <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> oil chamber drain for draining the condensed water from the oil chamber.|$|R
50|$|A bellows or pair of bellows is {{a device}} {{constructed}} to furnish a strong blast of air. The simplest type {{consists of a}} flexible bag comprising a pair of rigid boards with handles joined by flexible leather sides enclosing an approximately airtight cavity which can be expanded and contracted by operating the handles, and <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> allowing air to fill the cavity when expanded, and with a tube through which the air is forced out in a stream when the cavity is compressed. It has many applications, in particular blowing on a fire to supply it with air.|$|E
50|$|The {{main parts}} of the {{flamethrower}} were two steel cylindrical tanks connected with each other, one for fuel (15 l capacity total, height 45 cm, diameter 16 cm) and a compressed air bottle (6 l, height 60 cm, diameter 12 cm). This tank assembly was fitted with straps to permit it to be carried on the operator's back. Fuel {{was a mixture of}} diesel fuel (75%) and gasoline (25%). There was a valve between the fuel and air tanks. A rubber fuel hose connected the assembly with a fuel gun, which was a pipe 114-cm long, <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> at the muzzle, operated with a handle.|$|E

50|$|The single-cylinder SP6 1338 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} engines Mamod have produced, and is <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> piston <b>valve</b> and fixed cylinder rather than an oscillating cylinder. It uses the same boiler/burner unit as the SP5 Mk2 1335 (optionally <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pressure gauge). The same engine block has been used on the larger mobile models. Originally introduced in 2006, production of this model is still ongoing.|$|R
50|$|A breaker is a {{powerful}} percussion hammer fitted to an excavator for demolishing concrete structures or rocks. It is powered by an auxiliary hydraulic system from the excavator, which is <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> foot-operated <b>valve</b> for this purpose. Additionally, demolition crews employ the hoe ram for jobs too large for jackhammering or areas where blasting is not possible due to safety or environmental issues.|$|R
5000|$|Le Prieur was {{impressed}} by the simplicity of the Fernez equipment and the freedom it allowed the diver, and he immediately conceived an idea to make it free of the tube to the surface pump by using Michelin cylinders as the air supply.

Air was supplied continually to the mouthpiece and ejected through a short exhaust pipe <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> as in the Fernez design. For the first time a man could breathe underwater with no connection to the surface at all - Le Prieur had invented the open circuit self-contained underwater breathing apparatus - scuba.|$|E

50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{is composed}} of a generator and a receptacle; the generator is a cylindrical lead boiler, covered with red copper and reinforced with pieces of forged iron. The capacity of this boiler is 6-7 liters. The generator is suspended between the two points of a cast iron base. The receptacle is formed from a vessel of lead contained in a cylinder of copper surrounded by rings of iron. The opening of the generator is sealed by a screw cap, pierced along its the cap's axis and <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve.</b> The receptacle likewise bears an opening on its upper edge; one inserts in this opening a copper tube which descends almost {{to the bottom of}} the receptacle and which is fitted on the outside with a valve. One establishes a connection between the receptacle and the generator by means of a copper tube. In order to produce carbonic acid, one introduces into the generator 1,800 grams of sodium bicarbonate, 4½ liters of water at about 35° 95°F, and a cylindrical copper cup containing 1 kilogram of concentrated sulfuric acid; one places it the copper cup along the axis of the generator, one closes it the generator and one rocks it around its axis the two points of support of the cast iron base, in a way that the acid flows and reacts with the bicarbonate; at the end of ten minutes one opens the valves in order to allow the carbonic acid to pass into the receptacle. The acid distills by virtue of the difference in temperature that exists between the two parts of the apparatus; one proceeds to a new preparation of carbonic acid that one allows to pass in the same way into the receptacle; by repeating procedure five or six times, one can accumulate up to 2 liters of liquid acid.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{carburetor}} on the Vespa Cosa came stock <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> electronic fuel <b>valve</b> {{and automatic}} choke. It {{also had a}} digital tachometer (similar to that on later versions of the Vespa T5).|$|R
2500|$|If a drysuit is worn, {{it must be}} {{equalised}} by {{inflation and}} deflation, much like a buoyancy compensator. Most dry suits are <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> auto-dump <b>valve,</b> which, if set correctly, and kept at {{the high point of}} the diver by good trim skills, will automatically release gas as it expands and retain a virtually constant volume during ascent. [...] During descent the dry suit must be inflated manually.|$|R
5000|$|Tauchpanzer III - Some {{tanks were}} {{converted}} to amphibious tanks for Operation Sea Lion. Unusually, {{they were designed to}} be able to stay underwater rather than to float. The idea was that they would be launched near to the invasion shore and then drive to dry land on the sea bottom. The tank was waterproofed, the exhaust was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> one-way <b>valve</b> and air intake was through a hose.|$|R
30|$|Three {{cylindrical}} reactors {{with a total}} {{volume of}} 60  L (height, 0.66  m; diameter, 0.34  m) were used in this experiment. The compost reactors were insulated with a cover of polyurethane foam of 2.54 -cm width. A vertical rotational axis with blades was used before obtaining the samples to ensure the whole mixing of the composting quantity. The reactors were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> for dropping the leachate.|$|E

This contains a pulse width modulator (10) which transmits commands to alternately open and close the valve with a predetermined frequency. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the apparatus. USE - Supplying gases to a vacuum coating apparatus. ADVANTAGE - Hysteresis and drift of flow sped with time are avoided...|$|E
40|$|Dissolved gas {{pressures}} were {{continuously monitored}} with gasometers, which {{were connected to}} a Commodore- 64 computer that recorded and displayed supersaturation levels on a monitor. A line printer provided a hard copy of the data. The system was protected from power outages by an emergency backup power supply. Power to commercially available pressure transducers was supplied from an external dual-voltage power supply. Calibration lines were fitted by a built-in linear regression calibration program. Each gasometer was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> system for purging moisture from the silastic tubing. The gasometer core was protected from moisture and abnormally low pressure readings were eliminated...|$|E
50|$|For the 1928 {{model year}} the {{manufacturer}} {{followed up with}} the “Sizaire Frères Six”, which was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> six-cylinder Sleeve <b>valve</b> engine of 2,910 cc, bought in from Willys-Overland of Ohio. Approximately 150 of these were constructed.|$|R
25|$|The C11 used <b>a</b> C10 motor <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{overhead}} <b>valve</b> cylinder head. The C11 {{frame was}} almost unchanged until 1951 when BSA added plunger rear suspension. Early gearboxes were weak and unreliable. The C11G was available <b>with</b> <b>a</b> three ratio gearbox and rigid frame or a four ratio gearbox and a plunger frame. Both models had better front brakes than earlier models. This model {{was a common}} commuter motorcycle, and many survive today.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the Falcon F2 loco&shy;motives {{differed}} from later models of its class by having a cab which {{was similar to the}} Beira Railway's earlier three 0-6-0 locomotives, with two rectangular louvred cab windows on each side. Its boiler dome was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Salter safety <b>valve.</b> The locomotive was delivered by Falcon in 1895 and was numbered BR4.|$|R
40|$|Invention {{of oxygen}} {{cylinder}} {{was one of}} the most important developments in the field of medical practice. Oxygen and other gases were compressed and stored at high pressure in seamless containers constructed from hand-forged steel in 1880. Materials technology has continued to evolve and now medical gas cylinders are generally made of steel alloys or aluminum. The filling pressure as well as capacity has increased considerably while at the same time the weight of cylinders has reduced. Today oxygen cylinder of equivalent size holds a third more oxygen but weighs about 20 kg less. The cylinders are of varying sizes and are color coded. They are tested at regular intervals by the manufacturer using hydraulic, impact, and tensile tests. The top end of the cylinder is <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>valve</b> with a variety of number and markings stamped on it. Common valve types include: Pin index valve, bull nose, hand wheel and integral valve. The type of valve varies with cylinder size. Small cylinders have a pin index valve while large have a bull nose type. Safety features in the cylinder are: Color coding, pin index, pressure relief device, Bodok seal, and label attached etc., Safety rules and guidelines must be followed during storage, installation and use of cylinders to ensure safety of patients, hospital personnel and the environment...|$|E
50|$|The steam {{cylinder}} {{was based}} on English construction principles and located inside under {{the level of the}} axles which meant it required an expensive and heavy cranked axle. The engine drove the second coupled axle. The steam engine was probably <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> simple Stephenson <b>valve</b> gear without <b>a</b> steam expansion stage, which would not have permitted any control of steam admission.|$|R
5000|$|The 80 was {{introduced}} in July 1948 as an entirely new body for the Sunbeam-Talbot Ten. As before sports saloon and drophead coupé bodies were offered. It was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> overhead <b>valve</b> revision of the Minx / Ten's 1,185 cc four cylinder engine developing [...] at 4800 rpm. The new cast-iron cylinder head with its overhead valves shared just its design with the 2 Litre 90, the cylinder blocks were not the same. From the Ten to the 80 the carburettor switched sides. Commentators noticed that between the speeds of 30 mph and 60 mph the much larger engined 90 consumed less fuel.|$|R
50|$|For {{his true}} Formula One debut at the 1967 German Grand Prix, Hahne drove a Formula Two Lola chassis <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2-litre 16 <b>valve</b> BMW engine, thus {{qualifying}} {{the drive for}} Formula One. The BMW factory were allowed to run this to give some national encouragement. He retired on lap 7 with suspension failure. The following year he finished 10th in the same car.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 ownerside of the {{peninsula}} went {{to the town of}} Andernach. In 2001 another borehole was drilled at a new location, further from the road, into the gas-permeable rock. Even when the first hole was driven, the geyser jetted back to a height of 40 metres. The well was then <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gate <b>valve</b> again. The Federation for the Environment and Conservation (BUND) presented a case to the Higher Administrative Court of Rhineland-Palatinate to prevent the further development of the geyser for tourism within the nature reserve.. In May 2005 the town of Andernach and the BUND settled outside of court to allow the geyser to be reactivated under certain conservation conditions and for tourism purposes.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{turbocharging}} {{is considered}} as a key technology for reducing CO 2 emissions in downsized automotive engines. However, more information is still required on compressor and turbine behaviour when working under unsteady flow conditions. The results of an extensive investigation into a small turbocharger turbine <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> waste-gate <b>valve</b> are presented in this paper. Measurements were developed at the University of Genoa test facility which allows investigations to be performed under both steady and unsteady flow conditions. Turbine unsteady performance was evaluated at different operating conditions, starting from the measurement of instantaneous parameters (inlet and outlet static pressure, mass flow rate and turbocharger rotational speed). This paper analyses the effect of flow unsteadiness on turbine performance at different pulse frequencies and waste-gate settings...|$|R
40|$|Skin lesions with {{peculiar}} bluish-green discolouration and wet, matted {{appearance of}} the fur, occurred sporadically in a small rabbitry. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the skin lesion. 3 cases of an unusual lesion, similar to that described by O'Donoghue & Whatley (1971), appeared in a small rabbitry of 20 does and 3 bucks of mixed breed and their offspring. The rabbits were caged in a 2 -tier suspended battery housed in a precast concrete building with concrete floors, and received commercial rabbit pellets (diet 934; Ambar Ltd, Shomoron, Israel). The drinking water {{was derived from the}} mains via a 10 liter tank <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> float-controlled <b>valve,</b> through 20 mm black polyethylene tubing supplying 2 drinking valves to each cage.

25|$|In another design, {{a rubber}} housing is <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{pressure}} relief <b>valve</b> that determines {{the speed of}} a vehicle. If the vehicle is traveling below the set speed, the valve opens allowing the bump to deflate as the vehicle drives over it, but it remains closed if the vehicle is traveling too fast. The valve can also be set to allow heavy vehicles, such as fire trucks, ambulances, and buses to cross at higher speeds.|$|R
5000|$|The 23/70 {{shared the}} same basic layout as the 17/50 but was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> straight-8 sleeve <b>valve</b> engine. The exact {{capacity}} of the engine is quoted by various sources as between 2760 and 3293 cc. The engine {{was said to be}} vulnerable if taken above 3400 rpm. The car could be distinguished from its smaller companion by a large [...] "8" [...] on the radiator grille. A free wheel mechanism was offered as an option.|$|R
5000|$|No. 2004 was <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{experimental}} butterfly <b>valve</b> blastpipe bypass, manually activated {{to prevent}} fire-lifting at high cutoffs. This was later replaced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plug <b>valve</b> and higher bypass pipe diameter, but both designs {{had problems with}} sticking due to carbonised deposits. No. 2005 lacked the Kylchap double chimney {{of the rest of}} the class, and No. 2006 had a different boiler design, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> longer combustion chamber, and firebox heating area and volume of 253 sq ft and [...] respectively <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Robinson superheater. The production series was completed in 1936.|$|R
50|$|The player inflates the bag {{using his}} mouth through <b>a</b> tube <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{non-return}} <b>valve.</b> Air is {{driven into the}} chanter (punteiro) with the left arm controlling the pressure inside the bag. The chanter has a double reed similar to a shawm or oboe, and <b>a</b> conical bore <b>with</b> seven finger-holes on the front. The bass drone (ronco or roncón) is situated on the player's left shoulder and is pitched two octaves below the key note of the chanter; it has a single reed. Some bagpipes have up to two more drones, including the ronquillo or ronquilla, which sticks out from the bag and plays an octave above the ronco, or the smaller chillón. These two extra drones are located next to the right arm of the player.|$|R
50|$|The breathing/buoyancy bag is <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{non-return}} release <b>valve</b> {{which allows}} air {{to escape from}} the bag as the user ascends towards the surface and the water pressure decreases. The wearer can close this valve on reaching the surface, the air in the breathing/buoyancy bag then serving as a life preserver. If the bag becomes deflated while the wearer is on the surface awaiting rescue, it can be refilled (for use as a lifejacket) by opening the non-return valve and blowing through the mouthpiece.|$|R
